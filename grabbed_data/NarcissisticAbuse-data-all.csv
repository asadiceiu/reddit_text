Everything I was in denial of was laid out in front of me. Messages from people warning me he was cheating, messages I sent pleading for an explanation, messages from the woman he was cheating on me with that were there purely to antagonize me. Pictures of my face bruised and bloody after he dragged me with his car. Pictures of my body riddled by anorexia. Messages of him threatening abandonment purely to trigger me. For a second I relived the pain but not from a victims stand point but from a warriors. I have been no contact for god maybe 2 months? 3 months? I used to tell myself every day away Im happier and healthier. This has come true. Im no longer infatuated with my nex, I no longer question why he did it. I do not blame myself. I do not sit and cry with my hand over my heart anymore. Memories of him have faded away &amp; I have dissociated my good memories with him and understand they are not a representation of him. I think I had to look at myself. Why did I allow someone to make me feel so unlovable and so unworthy? Who does that to someone they love? Why didnt I leave when I knew it was only getting worse? I still do not blame myself. I started to see the cycle of my childhood, the relationships I had with my family. I saw the patterns of these relationships in my romantic relationships. I studied and studied why people like us seek out narcissistic partners and what Ive learned is so much of this stems from childhood traumas. Therapy has helped but more of my healing was done by forgiving myself and truly loving myself. I now love my life, I feel like Im worthy of love and I will never allow someone to treat me like that again. I can see red flags and instead of ignoring them I run far away. I have a guy in my life that listens to me, cherishes me. He doesnt just tell me what I want to hear. We have difficult conversations, we express vulnerability and empathy. Im not rushing in to things with him and I love that. He doesnt love bomb me or shower me with attention. I just get to enjoy the pure genuine experience of getting to know each other. I let go of mutual friends with my Nex. I created a reality that I wanted without him in it. Im so hopeful of my future &amp; he no longer hurts me. The pain has ended. I have gained my strength back, I promise you will too. You will get your wings back."
1,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,About the 'good guy' i am dating... trust my gut feeling?,1,hrlk9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/hrlk9c/about_the_good_guy_i_am_dating_trust_my_gut/,2020-07-15 21:02:50,"Hello everyone. I am not being abused but looking for some advice. I have been dating this guy F for 6 months. I have experienced some flags and i am really wondering if this is me or him, and what i could do about this situation. I don't have anybody to talk about this so i am seeking for some advice. Two months ago i was diagnosed with cancer and now undergoing treatment. F promised to come over to cheer me up. When he arrived, he was stressed out and talking a lot about his own problems. This was not really what i needed. He failed to listen to me many times, and was distracted on his phone a lot. When i told him i found that annoying, he tried to justify his behavior. That night he tried to convince me to have sex without a condom. I told him i did not feel comfortable but he kept pushing and trying. At one point i told him to go off me and told him that this was really not cool. We talked and he told me that a month ago i put his dick in me without protection and he had to stop me. This is not true but i could see he truly believed himself so no point to argue. Somehow i was still super horny so eventually we had sex (with a condom) which felt physically good but now i feel awful and weak. Maybe i should not have done this. It feels like he was trying to take advantage of my vulnerability. I am not feeling very well through my cancer treatment and my self esteem is not very high at the moment. At first sight F seems like a genuine good guy who helps others a lot, and has his heart in the right place. I am just sensing something is off, and i start to doubt myself. The first flag was he love bomb. But it could be that he genuinly feels love pretty soon. Did he really just develop feelings for me quickly and does he really want to help others or is he just self absorbed.. or maybe a bit of both. I sense that he really believes he is the good, sweet and helpful guy that he wants to be, but he is mainly focused on what he wants. I also caught him lying about things. How others see him is VERY important to him. Now i am feeling insecure and angry. I want to tell him that his behavior is shitty and he did not help me at all. He will just talk his way around it like he always does. I deserve better than this but i want him to realize that. But he won't. He is too smart with his smooth talks and i am afraid that when i talk to him about my feelings that he will twist everything so that it seems that i am just insecure or distrusting or whatever. I just don't know what to do. I have to say that he really has been a great support for me otherwise. When i feel down he calls me and helps me to think more positively. I am really confused and it's standing in the way of me feeling comfortable. What should i do?"
2,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,To everyone who are stuck and heartbroken in or after the relationship,1,htj28t,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/htj28t/to_everyone_who_are_stuck_and_heartbroken_in_or/,2020-07-19 02:07:42,"Hey everyone. First I want to say a massive thank you to this community who has helped me so much throughout the last two years. Its been 4 months since I saw my ex the last time, life is moving on. I am moving on, before thinking I could never in a million years. I would like to share you my story, my experience, thoughts and advice before I leave this sub. When I met my ex, I had a very low self-esteem, I wasnt able to set boundaries. I didnt trust my intuition, and I truly didnt love myself. I grew up in emotionally abuse, and have had some physical/sexual abuse happened in my younger years. I had tried for a long time to get out of my everlasting depression, with meds, therapy, nothing was working. At the time I wasnt aware of ptsd, attachment patterns or anything. My ex, lets call him Jim, isnt diagnosed NPD, and he might not be NPD - but however showcased many signs of it which can be just as harmful to the receiving end, which is why I eventually became aware of narcissism and NPD, that also lead me to this sub. I sincerely hope he will get the help he needs to put these behaviors behind him, both for himself and whoever he will pick as his next partner. Regardless of what happened, I wish only healing and happiness for everyone. Im an emotional person, a very open person, a codependent person, an insecure person, also a very loving and empathic person. What I experienced with Jim was that I from the beginning, still learning about myself, wanted to be open about my good as bad traits. Very quickly a lot of these things, that I now know are great qualities, were looked down on. He saw me as hysterical, dramatic, needy, clingy, untrusting etc. What I also now know is that he had a very big problem with being in contact with his own emotions. He had grown up, not being allowed to be vulnerable and emotional, and this resentment for these traits were from the beginning projected onto me. These traits I have, which are of strength, he saw as weakness. So my first lesson I learned from it: Being vulnerable is one of the bravest things you can be in this world. I recommend checking out Brene Brown, both on Netflix, podcast and everywhere else as she talks about vulnerability and shame aswell as Justin Baldoni (especially for the men here) Important side-not: There is a big difference between being vulnerable, and having no boundaries. You cant be vulnerable without boundaries. None of the things that makes me a strong and good person was something he valued. Communication was extremely one-sided, and looking back, we never ever had a real honest conversation together, because he wasnt able to. This drained me, because I kept trying over and over again, to connect emotionally with this emotional unavailable person. It fucked me up real good, because I thought I was doing everything wrong. Why wasnt it working? Why were we not getting any closer? Why didnt he seem to get me? Am I a bad communicator? Am I not empathetic? Am I not trying hard enough? Second lesson: You can communicate all you want with someone, but if they dont understand you, it will be silent chaos. In the relationship there was a lot of lying, dishonesty, emotional distance and eventually gaslighting, stonewalling and manipulations going on. As an anxiously attached person, I acted out neurotic in so many scenarios, wanting him to come closer to me. Scenarios that have made me feel a great sense of shame and guilt. After the relationship you will look back and cringe, analyze and then you can begin to forgive yourself. I wasnt aware we were dancing the avoidant/anxious dance and how it was slowly destroying me. I came deep in my depression and became suicidal. The times he full on discarded me I was so fucking triggered from childhood trauma. I myself have a trauma response of wanting to run away, but I had never experienced a person who says they love you one second, go to acting like they never knew you the next. I brought up feelings from my father. Over time, every time we got back together, my boundaries were further down and my independence slowly disappeared. I thought Id die if he left me. My life couldnt possible go on. The only person who ever truly loved me, didnt want me - even more so acted like we never loved each other. I began to deeply hate myself. Third lesson: We pick partners that triggers unhealed traumas. We stay in relationships until we have learned our lesson. If we dont learn our lesson, we will stay or find a new partner who triggers the same things. So ask yourself about your triggers, where they come from. This is the wound that needs to heal before anything else. I was only able to leave in the end, because I had finally gotten aware of my own patterns and understood them. In the end I began to learn about healing the inner child (especially important for those of you who deal with childhood trauma) as well as getting to know my ego. Learning about my own ego, taught me about other peoples egos. We all have defenses. We all have our own narratives we tell ourselves about ourself or others. We all have different realities. We all have an inner critic, the voice who tells you, for example, that you are not good enough or that you dont deserve love that makes you feel good. Fourth lesson: Not all of your thoughts are true, are mind is an endless waterfall of different kind of thinking. You are not your thoughts, you are the one observing your thoughts. If any of you are on instagram I highly recommend to follow the.holistic.psychologist who talks about ego, inner child and trauma - she explains it a lot better than I ever could. As I have been through the five stages of grief. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and now finally arriving at acceptance - I can tell you there is life after love (Cher reference, sorry not sorry). These past 2,5 years would have been a complete waste of time and love, had I not learned anything from it. You are allowed to be heartbroken, angry, disappointed, whatever you are feeling, and you are allowed to feel it as long as you need. But for your own sake, nobody else, eventually you have to look at yourself, objectively. At first it will be scary and difficult, but as time goes by and you practice this, you will realize that you are only human. You make mistakes. You can forgive yourself. And when youre ready, you might even arrive at forgivenes for your ex. Forgiving them is not to say what they did is okay, but that they acted out of their traumas - and that it wasnt your fault. You will know that forgiving this person is, when you are ready, a blessing for you. I have grown so incredibly much by this experience, and it has lead me to be a person who can now set boundaries, I am a less toxic person myself, I love myself more. As that happens you begin to attract different kinds of people. In this period of my ex relationship, I eventually also had to face toxic friendships etc. Since then my friend group is growing stronger and healthier. Im dating a really sweet and vulnerable man. Neither of us is perfect (be both have adhd, so thats always a challenge) but we are having the talks, we are having the connection. There is respect and love. And I dont know if its the person I will spend the rest of my life with. We can never truly know this. But we can see everyone who crosses our path as a spirit guide, here to teach us something new. Some will pass on by, and some are meant to stay. As well in the friendships. This only was possible because of vulnerability and taking responsibility for my self and my own actions. Besides that, with this new found selflove, I care about creating a good life for myself, that is not bound only on romantic relationships. Im applying for university, in a field Im so excited about. Im still working my creative job, and choosing these jobs that makes me really happy. From all of this, I simply experienced that life goes on. For the first time in my life, I took a break to get to know myself again. To become my own friend. My own parent. My own child. The greatest love of my life. I havent figured everything out at all, everyday is a possibility to learn something new, and its hard work. Sometimes are harder than others. Its one day at the time. Sometimes its two steps forward, one step back, but do not lose hope from this. Know that is is life, we all go through it apart but together. Love can come, love can go. This is also life. But love will never hurt. Many other things will hurt you. Things that looks like love can hurt you. But love never will, so do not be scared to love again. Life will break your heart, but it will also surprise you with beauty and joy. It will be worth it. If you are in this sub, I promise you - you have a lesson or more to learn. When you are ready, this will happen. You will begin to heal, and slowly learn to love yourself and your place in this world, just the way you are. The last lesson I want to share: We allow people to treat us the way we treat ourselves. So treat yourself with kindness, patience and empathy. Talk to yourself lovingly, every day. Good luck everyone, I send you love, warmth and good energy. You can do this. Goodbye! &lt;3333"

I never opened up my vulnerability to anyone like I had you. I felt safe, at least for the first 2 years. I felt adored, cherished. You were my lover and my best friend. You were everything I ever wanted. I didnt realize you had constructed a fantasy that youd abandon me in. I knew it was coming. Your complete lack of regard for my desires to put distance between yourself and that coworker you professed your love for spoke volumes. You never planned for our future together, or even the times we saw each other. You couldnt be bothered to stash money aside. I was convenient for you. Until I saw through the cracks. Your presence in my life made me literally sick. I sensed a darkness in you and it ate at me like a cancer. How youd constantly pat yourself on the back for how much you valued honesty but didnt understand what a sin of omission was. Over time your words became repetitive and meaningless. Conversations never became more intimate. You couldnt seem to remember important things I had told you. It was like you never listened and only pretended to. You trapped me in your fantasy. So now Im driving around in Indiana somewhere in between a bed and breakfast on my way to a winery looking for you. Im in a convertible with the top down, speeding fast, but Im driving instead of you. Where did you go? Will I ever find you? Will I ever manage to break free of this fantasy of yours that you abandoned me inside? This fantasy has become hell, and I want out."
4,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,How did it take so long to notice all the red flags?,1,hz7kw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/hz7kw2/how_did_it_take_so_long_to_notice_all_the_red/,2020-07-28 13:55:47,"I (30 f) am ending things with a guy Ive been seeing for a month. Im coming to terms with the fact that my immediate reaction wasnt to RUN from the love bombing/rushing/too good to be true feeling. Im relieved that Im ending things now, but I feel like I let myself get carried away in the excitement of it and now Im in way over my head. Its really challenging me emotionally and mentally. Im so happy I found this sub! Despite having a huge list of red flags (I think I got to 90 items), Im still obsessing about the situation and part of me doesnt want to let go. The energy with him feels really special, like I feel alive. I know it feels compelling because a part of me recognizes it will become toxic. It already feels toxic and its only been a month! know I have trauma from previous bfs to work out still. Please remind me that all the attraction and big feels is just trauma bonding talking? To keep myself accountable/remind myself why Im ending it, Im sharing some of red flags from my list. Obvious red flags: 1. Love bombing like crazy (Im perfect/beautiful/etc., his life is great now because he met me) 2. Constant messaging 3. Bashing/mentioning his ex often 4. Rushed to define the relationship 5. Talked about meeting my parents (my last LTR didnt meet my parents for a year into us dating) 6. History of violence/fightsblames others or the situation but not himself (Why did he tell me about these incidents? To gauge my reaction and test what type of behavior I might tolerate?) 7. Casually talks about owning guns (combined with signs of abusive/controlling behavior, this is one of the scary deal breakers) 8. More than once, on social media his ex mentioned abuse and its definitely in reference their relationship (This is the big deal breaker. Even if she is as toxic as he says, the fact that she posted this indicates a really unhealthy relationship) 9. His friends sound like losers/womanizers, but somehow he isnt? 10. I feel swept along with everything and cant set/define boundaries because they have already been blown to smithereens Red flags that were harder to spot: 1. We have good chemistry and similar energy levels (reminds me of how I felt with my nex who totally blew my life up 8 years ago) 2. We talk for hours and it never gets boring (convo is almost too easy/familiar?) 3. I get lost looking in his eyes. No dead eyes, they are soft and warm 4. Describes himself as honest and shares unflattering stories about himself (I think hes faking vulnerability to get me to open up quickly?) 5. Very attentive/caring (which is great, but it feels vaguely controlling and inappropriate given how long weve known each other) 6. Hes already planning trips for us (awesome, but also too much too soon) 7. Somehow it feels like we fit together, despite actually being different people with radically different values and opinions 8. I get confused trying to figure out if hes just immature/love addict or if hes a mega narc who will destroy me down the line. (The fact that Im questioning this is reason enough to end things, right??) 9. He hinted at feeling like he was falling in love with me within the first week or so 10. Hes really into money (which is fine), but seems to fake agree with my anti-capitalism/socialist values (mirroring?)"
5,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Still not sure if he was a covert narc or not,1,hzpmde,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/hzpmde/still_not_sure_if_he_was_a_covert_narc_or_not/,2020-07-29 09:31:09,"Im trying to figure out if my ex is on the covert narc spectrum. He definitely has elements that make me believe he is but others that give me doubt. Here are the narc elements: - lack of empathy/showing of emotions - career/title oriented (hes a VP and asked for his title to be bumped up to this when he was hired) - big ass house, pool, hot tub - another house at a ski resort - got feedback by his previous boss he was unapproachable (he cried about this once in front of me) - difficulty building connections with people/introvert but very confident - tri-athlete who completed Ironman - superdad syndrome (single dad of 3) - had a giant canvas triptych made of a landscape picture he took while we were on vacation and gave it to me for my bday to hang on my wall - always acted cool and collected/rarely showed signs of vulnerability (it would happen only when he really was at the end of his rope and he would cry or admit hes overwhelmed/trying to please everyone) - never compromised in any of the arguments we had. The issues were solvable but he always said he understood how I felt but did what he had to do. That led him to break up with me. - jumped into another relationship just after our breakup, with someone he works with - he wanted me to be with him all the time and things were going mostly his way Things that dont fit into the narc scenario: - he never insulted or belittled me (I would never tolerate that) So I guess the question is, based on all this, could he be a narcissist even though he wasnt mean or insulting or belittling me?"
6,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"Expressing any emotion was taboo, and vulnerability was a sin.",5,gzavj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/gzavj3/expressing_any_emotion_was_taboo_and/,2020-06-09 09:23:41,"The most common examples I see are of overt narcissism, and covert narcissism can be hard to find examples for. The person I knew (online) would go out of his way to make sure you *never* heard anything *about* him. He needed to control his self image so much, he feared that any amount of information you knew would be used against him somehow. Any information he gave could have easily been manufactured, or they were cherry picked half-truths. He never shared any social media, and *refused* to give any identifying information that could pick him out from a crowd. It felt like a very covert way of manipulation. Only giving as much as he gave, he refused to remember someone's name, and didn't want to genuinely involve himself in someone's life (and didn't want others to involve themselves in *his* life.) He wouldn't *tell* you he didn't want to hear about your irl things, but made you feel foolish for sharing it by refusing to engage with those conversations. (Towards the end of our friendship, he would engage very minimally, but remained very factual.) On the other hand, was incredibly good at remembering things. Which made it all the more strange when he tried to play dumb, or made deflecting comments. He tried to make it seem like he stopped thinking about the people he talked to online as soon as he wasn't engaging with them, yet he seemed to make a point of bringing up small pieces of information of things that happened years ago, as if he remembered whole conversations. But he'd say he would need to be ""reminded"" to be considerate if he was doing something hurtful. A *lot* of circumstances surrounding him point to signs of narcissism, and he displayed a lot of ""my way or the highway,"" or ""nothing is ever his fault,"" types of mentalities. Everyone else needed to rise to his level (which he'd only express through context or ""*I* would never do that,"" types of comments) and he would become immensely cold if you tried bringing up the most minuscule thing to resolve or talk about. Past exes would show intense qualities of covert narcissism -- even ongoing relationships, *or* they knew him when he was much younger, and either moved on, or they felt that it was too painful to let go of the memories they made together, so they remain in contact with him. (There was no one he *remained* in contact with, that I met, that was still his friend because they saw him as a positive person to be around.) He put a lot of effort into isolating certain friend groups from each other, and it was immensely taboo if you were to ever know or meet someone from his ""real"" life, or if they were valuable sources of supply. When I look at lists that describe qualities of manipulators, he scores high or checks off at least half of the list. In ""30 red flags of manipulative people"" the score was 20 out 30. But every time people start using examples, he stops fitting the bill. He was more of a charming vampire that would suck you dry, and never need to lift a finger. There were never explosions of anger, no phrases of degradation, but an elaborate illusion he crafted, making sure *he* was never the one framed for degrading comments or poor behavior. He never talked about his other friends, experiences, and allegedly never saved anything people sent him as a gift. Expressing any emotion was taboo, and vulnerability was a sin. (If it swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.) There were no self-aggrandizing comments about how great he was, and would try to paint himself as too humble for anything above average. He would even congratulate you on your successes and achievements, but remained distant and uninterested. I felt guilty for ""over sharing"" anything that was substantial because I felt like I was telling him more than he wanted to hear. If it was about my life, I needed to keep it to myself. If I felt a certain type of way that was anything less than positive, I needed to keep it to myself. Very rarely, it seemed that he would drop hints that he knew exactly what he was doing. He would pass them off as jokes, or play aloof when a comment or a link was ill timed. *You* were suppose to make the connection, because he couldn't be caught saying it outright. He relied *very* heavily on the image of a perfect gentleman, but be totally absent as a person and a friend. Sometimes it still feels hard to believe he was a narcissist, covert or at all, despite knowing any of this."

8,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Extensive story about ex's disorder,1,hco1sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/hco1sl/extensive_story_about_exs_disorder/,2020-06-21 01:24:11,"Hi, First I will say, sorry for writing a ""novel"", but I need to get it out of my system. This is my last avenue where I will share the story, and its probably the right place, because I never got any feedback concerning NPD elsewhere. I never got any input in regards to my suspicions that she was NPD or other Cluster B disorder such as Histrionic. So this part was mostly ignored, which means the position where I'm coming from (trauma bond) was not understood. Its always the usual ""why do you care about such relationship/her then"", ""just move on"", etc. Yeah, I moved on, I'm past the final discard, and its done, but there's an aftermath. I've been to a therapist and even she went against any possibility that I've been dealing with narcissistic ex, but since it was my first therapist ever, and selection was random, could be I just didn't find the one that is adequate. It eats up my energy and its difficult for me to go over the story every time (since I'm not copy-pasting), but lets do it one more time in hope that it will be worth it, as this community is focused on particular topic. She's 22 now, I am 30. We've been dating for 9 months, definitely not long but its odd how effect is no less than if it were longer. It starts right from the day we met, I mean, if I could describe the experience of ever falling for someone on first sight that would be it - however there's one caveat, it was more of a fascination, aura of mystery in tandem with strange feeling of unnatural familiarity, something resonating with me. I will never forget the way she glanced that night, it was kind of predatory. Well, I need to add that her behaviour was strange, in such a way that its obvious to anyone, my friends actually thought she was just stoned that night, some would think she's just ""crazy"", or mentally challenged. I don't know if this is a trait in any type of narcissism but this is an important detail when describing her. Maybe histrionic symptom? But while I considered it to be an act at first stages of knowing her (for example speaking too quietly so no one can hear what she's saying, laughing in self amusement, laughing often for no reason, creating strange narratives), gradually it became clear to me that her intelligence, and awareness of what she's doing are not in question, its just I could never pinpoint to exact reason why there's something off about her. Next morning we woke up to each other's embrace (other than sleeping together on a couch, nothing more happened yet), and from there we planned out next date. \-it was contrary to my first impressions, she was quick to form a sexual relationship and even present herself as someone who had lots of ""history"". There was something off about this too, she avoided intimacy, never wanted to kiss, no oral on either side, no foreplay, she just preferred a robotic act, and even though we formed ""committed relationship"" which will come at the end of this post, this never changed. This has been difficult for me at times because its not really attractive, and it felt one-sided. Outside of that, we would spend lots of time together, in a way that time would actually stop existing for me, it was like a dream. I also immediately told her that I'm in a 6 year relationship but this one was falling apart and it was just a matter of time for official breakup. She was completely phlegmatic about it, but this detail will be important for later. She had this push-pull tactic, that whatever was lacking (like in example above), she did offer a certain kind of affection for me to hold on to, but always kept me on the edge. Even literally - cuddle for a moment, then suddenly she'd go: ""don't touch me"". To me, this only got addictive. I don't know if this is actual **love bombing**, but she was always around, either texting very frequently, initiating to meet often(mostly according to her convenience - ""where are you?"", its 5am and I'm out in another city, no problem - ""come pick me up?""), and because I was quite isolated at the time, this is how she got into my life and my head completely. \-very early on, she opened up about being on suspended sentence (1 year), her ex being a junkie who's in prison, this probably has something to do with drugs (she was obsessed with weed specifically). She was going to a therapist, and I'm not sure whats the reason again, but she was on AD for a while, and I can tell you she didn't suffer from depression (ask me more if you want). Also at home she was forced to take sleeping pills. \-later I found out she seems to rotate guys, by getting a glance on her messages, like when one pops up. I'd say this with certainty by the way it looked. I didn't think much of it at the time because she never expressed the desire to be committed, even though she technically invested her free time to the point that it had to become a topic sooner or later.The catch is, **discards** were present from beginning to the end. It was the pattern of 2-3 weeks of being in contact/seeing each other, then 1/2/3 weeks of disappearing act usually initiated when something didn't go her way, or I said or brought up something. She would **hoover** back every time like nothing happened. It's almost as if I got used to it and started playing along. Couple times when I had enough of it, as soon as I was on my way out completely, and moved on, she could sense it and somehow sneaked in again. Eventually I was giving her hints that I'd like to be committed, which also eliminated possibility that she wants it too but maybe thinks I don't want anything serious. \-fast forward, bumpy road, but we became committed. Things didn't change though, the pattern of discards stayed exactly the same. She'd always find a reason, every 2-3 weeks, to go NC acting offended by something I supposedly did wrong. I had some bad events at first, like ex stalking me, so I thought maybe she rightfully doesn't want to deal with the drama, but I figured I always rationalised her ""retreats"", that I must be in the wrong. Also being closer then ever - at this last stage, I could observe some things daily. She had this moments of what looked like random anger for no reason, stone cold expressions. This is hard to explain, but it's the eyes of someone who, for a brief moment, sees you as an object of hate.Besides this being random, like a mask slipping off, one intense moment that I can recall is when I tried to set a boundary, as she started making a habit of being disrespectful to me multiple times already. There is no negotiation with her, at all. If she senses that you are going to respond to something where she played with you on purpose, then she sets an overwhelming tone of hostility, or just cuts you off. The way she transformed this time, into an ice cold demon and said to me: ""be careful what you are going to say next, because i know what it is as i can telepathically hear you"".... I'm sure this is something one doesn't experience often in regular human interactions. I mean there are certain manipulative behaviours that a regular 22 year old simply isn't capable of. And I'm talking, constant. What was a real sense of twin flame BS at first, was actually **mirroring.** One of the things she said in beginning was ""are you me?"" and that we are both strange but in a same way. Which created two illusions, firstly manufactured soulmates, and second one which still puzzles me, i still can't explain it - couple times it was like she could read my mind. Picked like a frequency on a radio in passing... Certain things I confided to only one person, from only one possible login point where she had no access.. And she REPEATED the key words for that specific context out of nowhere with a smirk on her face. She loved to exploit my weaknesses and insecurities that she was subtly scanning for. \-she was never able to discuss anything seriously, like there's no depth to any emotion and hence normal relationship with her is impossible, its a language she just doesn't understand. She was functioning as a self-amused individual who never showed any real vulnerability, emotion, or empathy, it all felt 100% staged. Sharing the same space with her for couple days was draining, to a vampiric degree, co-habitation with her would be impossible. Highs and lows were driving this relationship. \-**devalue** tactic was always present, but it went from very subtle, ie. always pointing out how other people are this or that(specifically good looking) - implying that i'm not - or mentioning details from her past on purpose which I asked her not to, all to direct insults later on, that were coming out of nowhere, often with a smirk on her face, that she would never repeat. Causing me to doubt if I misheard something because it was unbelievable. She also called me fake on occasions, and I don't know where this was coming from.The final devalue-discard: she wasn't satisfied with sex that night, so straight up told me that I'm not useful for anything, and that I will be remembered by ""bad performance"". Left earlier next day without speaking, only to contact me later like nothing happened. This time she wanted me to know she's randomly in another city and if I'm not coming at her whim, she's going to stay overnight by herself. I ghost and block her. 2 weeks pass by, I crave for a ""drug"" and make a mistake by unblocking her, thinking that it can't get worse... She asks for a small favor, and I do it. Then makes it clear that this is only ""friendly"" communication and we're broken up because ""I cheated on her with my ex"" (she always resorted to this during discards but this isn't true in itself because as I said, she knew i was ending a relationship BEFORE two of us got exclusive). I'm tired of BS, straight up tell its because she's a liar and NPD. At this point she exploits one of my past insecurities when I slipped and made it known how I don't negatively view myself looks wise, and proceeds to tell me that another reason is because I am ugly. Made sure to ""elaborate"" that its ""only in her opinion"". Now, you can ask me anything if you feel there's gaps because, of course, I can only give my version of the story. But I guess, on one hand I'd like it to be NPD, because its a coping mechanism in a way, to know that you wouldn't expect this level of toxicity from ""normal"" person. On another, I don't have any other explanation and most things are matching once you get into research. I actually stumbled upon NPD info by just looking for similarities, and then it started to make more sense. It also explains ""trauma bond"" experience, but usually people could just say: ""you had a crush on someone who wasn't really serious, who is inexperienced in relationships, still young and just comes out as dickhead, all other coincidences are random, and your mind is connecting the dots blowing everything out of proportion"". However, I can't deny what my mind tells me, that someone intruded my mind by very skilful tactics (regardless if they are conscious or unconscious/effortless), only to plant landmines. That it was seductively malicious. There's literally no place in my close environment where we haven't been to. So she poisoned the air around me, I have to gradually get rid of that, but some things will never go away. The mental trace is dualistic, because my mind still holds to this idea that she was someone special, someone I had to be with, and despite knowing it was an illusion, that I mean't nothing to her, a part of me is convinced there was a connection. Like I've been walking through a garden of Eden, then night fell, and snakes came out. It all feels like a dream. Turned into a nightmare. Thanks for reading."
9,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,My story. Doubting myself. Doubting if he even is what I think.,3,hf5an8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/hf5an8/my_story_doubting_myself_doubting_if_he_even_is/,2020-06-25 03:30:33,"Just feeling kind of weird today and wanting to tell my story. I don't expect anyone to read it, because it's going to be long. But me writing out my feelings is therapeutic. So here it goes. Met suspected narc when I started a new job halfway across the country from where I grew up. I moved happy and optimistic, though nervous since I didn't really know anyone. A couple weeks into my job I noticed this one guy staring at me whenever I would walk through the room. I thought it was a bit odd, but didn't think too much of it. One day I was training in the same area as him and he came up and made a conversational comment and that was it. A few weeks later, he somehow found me on instagram, added me, and DM'ed me. From that day forward, he messaged me every day. Trying to get to know me, complimenting me, showing me what he had in common, and showing off. I remember commenting to a friend how weird it was, especially since he was 13 years my senior. But slowly, I got sucked in. I was in a new place and enjoyed the attention and having someone to talk to (pathetic, I know). I always had this ""off"" feeling about him, but couldn't put my finger on it. When he asked me to dinner the first time, I remember being iffy about it, and purposely wearing a sweatshirt and leggings to try to convey that it wasn't a ""date date."" After that first meeting, I remember thinking in my car how I didn't think I'd do that again. All he did was talk about himself. But as I drove home, I convinced myself that maybe it was just nerves. So next time he asked me to go out, I agreed, but funny enough, the day we were supposed to go I had a really bad day and cancelled. I think I also just didn't feel like I truly wanted to go. I remember him being disappointed, and then pushing and pushing me to meet him at a restaurant anyway, and I did because I felt bad. I felt uncomfortable around him and wasn't sure why--was it because he was kind of awkward, because he talked loudly, because I didn't actually really know anything about him due to the superficial nature of our conversations? After those first few meetings came the constant sexual talk. Questions that were strange and made me uncomfortable. Every conversation seemed to turn sexual. But, I was ok with it. He was a guy who was giving me attention, making me feel wanted, and seemed on top of his shit and was prospectively making plans and showing his interest. He kept pushing to come bring me food or come over and hang out, and one day I gave in. I remember that we tried to have sex, but he couldn't keep it up. Again, I attributed it too nerves. He said it was better on his home playing field. Slowly, he stopped planning things. Seeing me was brought up a day or two in advance, or I had to start bringing up plans. I remember purposely holding off on mentioning anything just to see if he would initiate. Communication started to die down--I would hear from him later and later. I remember getting a drastic hair cut and color only a few months into our relationship because I felt like I was losing his interest but again, couldn't really put my finger on it. I began noticing him following new women on social media, and saw him on multiple occasions flirting with a coworker (who is also my age). When I asked him about it, he said that she was ""just super friendly"" and that I shouldn't worry because he wasn't ""her type."" Still, when we were together I saw him messaging and texting her. He would always tell me that she was ""great help"" at work and speak her praises. I figured I was being too jealous or in my head, so I tried to brush it aside. Communication continued to die, but when I would bring it up he would claim everything was fine. I remember one conversation where I brought up how I needed more consideration of my time, and how lack of plans in advance was frustrating. He told me that it was ""difficult to change"" and that I should express myself because ""men can't read women's minds."" He never changed or made an effort to. Each time I brought it, or anything else serious up, he would make a joke of it, change the topic, or discount my feelings altogether. I started feeling more and more desperate to get that attention and desire from the beginning back as it became clear I wasn't a priority anymore. I would bring him groceries, and he would tell me that he was grateful, but I had gotten something that he didn't like or there was another version he liked better. Thank you's became more and more sparse. Compliments became nonexistent. Then, one day I showed up to an event he was participating in. I had been several times before and knew the schedule. He didn't explicitly mention he was participating that day, but it was on my way home so I stopped by for a bit. As I was watching, another woman walked in. Shortly thereafter, he walked out, claiming injury and rushed out of the doors, and this woman just blindly followed him out. He came back in to talk to me, and I left. When I asked him later what went on, he said he had hurt himself. That the other woman was just an old friend, and then later said she was an old family friend...that I would like her if I got to know her. I had a strong gut feeling something was off here. From then on I became paranoid. I knew something was going on. I didn't know if it was with this woman or someone else, but something was wrong. I broke down one day, and brought up the lack of plans and lack of communication again. Instead of having a conversation, he shut down. Saying he was too independent for me and that I found something new wrong with him every week even though he was ""just being himself."" He ended it. We didn't talk for a couple weeks, but he stared at me at work, and kept me on social media. One day I had lunch with a male friend, he saw, and later that day deleted his whole social media account. I gave in and reached out, he promptly responded and began initiating conversation again. It felt great. A month later we went out again for the first time. But, as I'm sure you guessed it, the momentum quickly died down. The old patterns of not making plans and intermittent conversation resurfaced. He wasn't texting the coworker anymore, so at least there was that. However, I still felt ""off,"" I was constantly nervous, tired, and stressed. I always felt on edge and like the littlest thing I said or did could be the end. I knew not to express myself anymore. I remember one day bringing cupcakes to work and telling a coworker that I had brought them. Suspected narc got mad at me that I didn't tell him first and didn't talk to me that evening. When I apologized and said I had messed up he said ""yeah, you really did."" It seemed so disproportionate. Only a few months later, I went to drop something off at his house. But when I drove up, the woman who was at the aforementioned event, had her car in the driveway. I didn't go up to the door. When I texted him about it, he claimed that he was helping her with her phone. I was able to look her up on social media, and while I couldn't see many details, I could see that she had been in a relationship since 2005. That stuck in my brain. So, a few weeks later when a similar thing happened, he claimed he was helping her with lawn equipment. I blew up at him, and he shamed me for making him feel bad for always wanting to help his friends. I ended up apologizing and begged for him to stay with me. Queue him only talking to me once a week, seeing me infrequently, and no more physical contact for months. Then, he mentions going on his annual summer trip. He hadn't mentioned it the whole year we were together, but supposedly he had had it planned since before we even met. He told me he didn't know anyone where he was going and enforced he was going alone. Well, my gut was screaming that that wasn't true. So I did some digging. I found that the same woman had accompanied him by looking at her reviews on a travel site calling narc her boyfriend. Come to find out she had been accompanying him on summer trips for YEARS. When I confronted him, he first said that she had only been on the trip part of the time...that she just happened to be in the same area for work training. When I told him that the reviews extended for the whole trip, he claimed he hadn't lied to me before and that she was there ""as part"" of the trip, not ""for part"" of the trip. I thought I was going crazy. He said that he and this woman had been together for a long time over 5 years ago and that she must have misunderstood their relationship and he'd have to be more clear with her. That he had learned in his next relationship he would have to be ""upfront"" about all his exes he has as friends (yeah right, he can't have a deep or meaningful conversation, I don't ever see this happening). I remember talking to him on the phone and him telling me that I was controlling, that he tried to work out every possible way of being with me, but it always resulted in him having to give up all his female friends (I had never attempted to control this or said anything about it before). That if I kept pushing him he would never talk to me again. He ended by recounting all of the names and scenarios of all his recent exes he is friends with in an attempt to ""be transparent."" A couple days later I reached out to apologize for being so unkind, he responded that he should have been more honest with me, and should have been more clear with this other woman. This confused me, since it seemed genuine, and that was unusual. A few days later, I was blocked from everything. We didn't talk for a month. I messaged him and he didn't respond until a month later. He started messaging me every day again. We started hanging out. The same patterns repeated. He's been ogling new women at work (both 16 years younger than him). Over time it has been revealed that he has also consistently been having breakfast with his ex every other weekend throughout our entire relationship. She calls him often as well. We went on a trip I wanted to go on last weekend, he ended up changing every detail of what we did, leaving me so disappointed. It's exhausting. I have a solid plan to leave next week, but I can't believe I let myself get to this point. I can see and feel how unhealthy it is, but I can't get myself to leave. I still can't seem to convince myself that he is 100% a narc (mainly because of those moments where he seems human again: admitting he should have been more honest, asking my opinion on things sometimes, etc.) despite: &amp;#x200B; * The constant attention at the beginning. I was awesome, I could do no wrong. I was worth making plans with, complimenting, talking to. This died off once he saw he ""had"" me. * Being one of the most selfish/self-centered people I have interacted with. Everything is on his terms and has to be his choice, or else he might begrudgingly agree, but will make it clear that he isn't happy * Having few friends. 2 of his friends are ""exes"" and 1 is a man who he didn't talk to after having an argument for over a year, and constantly disses. None of these friendships have extended beyond 6 years. * Being cagey/secretive. There are no deep discussions, no openness. Work, family, friends, relationships are all separate entities * Everyone at work doesn't really care for him. He thinks he's great and always boasts about the great work he is doing. Yet, when there was a leadership opportunity, they approached everyone but him. I have heard him say more people dislike him than like him, and have heard tons of people call him an ""asshole"" or complain about him. He also puts down everyone at work except for the few women who give him attention. * He doesn't care for anyone in his family except for his dad. He has said he hates his brother and his brother's wife. A lot of it sounds like envy--they have a house, kids, are married, have been successful--all things he lacks. * He can't communicate. All conversations about feelings or trying to solve problems are halted, joked about, etc. I've learned not to express myself or my feelings. Problems will never be solved or genuinely talked about. * Conversations predominantly revolve around him. He half-listens until something he's interested in is mentioned. Conversation gets brought back to himself. He boasts about his accomplishments. * The littlest perceived ""slights"" piss him off and will mean that he will shut down and not talk for awhile. He can't take criticism and acts like a child. * He lies. I've caught him in many, and he has openly admitted he lies. He once said he lies all day at work. It's funny because he once told me he was ""very loyal and highly agreeable."" He has since proven that both of those things are highly inaccurate. * Nothing is his fault. It's my fault, or someone else's fault. There's a reason why he isn't responsible. One day he trashed his brother on the phone to his dad, not knowing his dad had him on speaker phone and was driving with his brother. He blames his dad for this. * Gaslighting--telling me he was going on his trip alone, then that he was with someone ""part"" of the trip, then saying he told me she was there ""as a part"" of the trip. This is only one example. * Pretending he is amazing, but deep down disliking himself. And also, putting me down through subtle insults. Once he made a ""joke"" about how I should give him a friend's number. When I called him on it, he said it was a joke, and it didn't matter, because he wouldn't be good enough for my friend anyway. * Lack of empathy. At the beginning when I would have a bad day, he would at least pretend to care and would stick up for me. Now if I bring up things, he doesn't seem to really be listening or care. He might offer a halfhearted ""Sorry to hear that,"" but that's about it. * Projection and DARVO. Lack of responsibility. When I called him on cheating, I was ""controlling"" and ""crazy."" He brought up a guy in my life to try and turn it around on me. I better chill or he'd never talk to me again. * Need for attention. He pretty much only has women on his social media. He will attempt to talk to anyone that will answer him. The people he's with aren't good enough, he always needs more. He's always in search of that thing that is ""bigger and better."" * Needs things to be perfect. Everything in his home has to be in its place. His car has to be spotless. * He has to be in control of everything. He doesn't like people staying at his home because he feels ""out of control."" He has to control plans. If someone else suggests something and he agrees, he will change the plans last minute to make sure he is in control. * Lack of intimacy. Can slap my butt, but won't hold my hand or kiss me just to kiss me. Kissing just leads to sex, even then, it's minimal. Won't share a bed. * Anxious and constantly negative. Everything is always negative, no matter what. * Inability to be vulnerable. He can only express that he is ""upset."" I don't think I've ever heard him discuss any other emotion. NO deep discussions that require connection and/or vulnerability. The list goes on. But instead of focusing on these things, I think of the very beginning, or the time he told me he could of been more honest--indicating self-reflection, or those little moments where he wasn't as selfish, or asked me how I was after I asked him for once. Is he even a narcissist? How can I get myself to embrace all these negative things and see it for what it is?"

I feel completely and utterly invisible in his eyes. He tells me he loves me and cares about me but whenever I try to express my emotional needs or tell him that something he is doing/has done in the past is hurtful to me, he doesnt try to resolve things with me and just accuses me of blaming and criticizing him constantly. Last night we had a big fight and I told him he is a narcissist and it is hurting our entire relationship. Very blatantly told him I think he has a mental illness. And he just responded by saying that I am also mentally ill because I externalize blame. He interprets EVERYTHING I say as blaming him for all our relationship issues. Sometimes I am blaming him, I admit. But Ive only resorted to all this unhealthy criticism after months of trying to understand why he was treating me so horribly when all I ever did wrong was fall in love with a narcissist. Im so confused. I know that the stress and the trauma has led me to say some pretty unsavory things to him but hes telling me I have a mental illness and I need to stop stifling him and stop trying so hard. All Ive ever wanted from the beginning was to see some genuine vulnerability in him and to form an emotional connection. I dont know where I went wrong. I dont know if Im really as bad as he says I am or if he is really as bad as I think he is. I dont know whats going on, my mental headspace is confused, everything seems to be so impossibly tangled up inside my mind. I feel like no matter what I do there is no right decision and no way forward that does not lead to more suffering. I kind of have a grasp of what is going on. I met this broken person and I had good intentions from the very beginning, but he is so protective of his ego that he couldnt accept the love I tried to give him and did things that hurt me very deeply as a result. And I was left confused about what was going on and why that happened to me but for some reason I kept trying to find a way through to him and over time my inability to do so evolved into me lashing out and desperately trying to get him to see what he has done wrong. Maybe Im turning into a toxic person myself. I dont know. It feels like I am both trying to be my most authentic self but losing sight of who I am at the same time. My mental state is constantly filled with paradoxes and conflicting emotions and cognitive dissonance. He told me he would try harder for me but I dont know how to continue when everything is so jumbled. This was messy and a bit of a rant but I just had to get it off my chest..."

He says other things other times, like ""I care about you"" and calling me ""my love"". But never ""I love you"". I've often wondered if my appeal to him was my vulnerability, the fact that he can get away with abusing me and that my disability and lack of family means I can't get away.

You cant breathe, youre screaming but arent heard. Then a little while later they grab your head and pull you back up. The fresh air feels incredible, the sun warms what was once cold, and you finally feel like youre breathing. Then again, just like last time, they push you back down. Its not just drowning, its questioning your sense of self. Its seeing them as the victim and questioning reality itself. Theyll twist feelings around while weaponizing vulnerability. You are suddenly the sharpest pain, a heartless monster. They leave once you have been reduced to your lowest form. They come back as they feel you getting stronger. You will remember who you are faster than the first time. Today I realized that I dont have to be drowning. I hope you feel this too. It is possible, and you are worth so much more than their abuse."

There was no love bombing stage it just progressed normally, I often felt a weird lack of empathy from him for me and for other people, hes very logical and doesnt express feelings very much. There was also a deep lack of vulnerability from him, I felt like I was giving and giving and being so vulnerable and putting my all into this and getting nothing back. This led to a bunch of arguments constantly around the 1.5 year mark- I would feel like everything was wrong and that he never took responsibility for his actions or owned up to things or changed the things he said he would. He also constantly put me down but in a joking way- I didnt think it was funny and I told him to please stop as it makes me feel bad and he would stop for a couple days and start again. He also put my friends down a lot (admittedly some of them did have issues) and he talked about how everyone just sucks so much. I would say maybe we should break up when fights got really bad but then change my mind as soon as I said it because Id be convinced that hes amazing and I could never find someone like him around the 2 year mark he broke up with me and told me that I had just done a lot of damage to the relationship (from all the fights &amp; the maybe we should break ups) and hurt him too much and he just couldnt get past that. That absolutely broke me- I was so sad that I hurt someone who I thought was literally the best person in the world, I begged him to give us another chance but he wouldnt. Ok. So I thought its time to work on myself so that I never hurt someone I love again. But I also went through so much trauma and grief because I genuinely believed that I had just lost the most perfect person on earth and I even cut myself (this is not typical for me) a lot of times because I felt like I deserved it for hurting someone like him. I oscillated between just accepting it and working on myself and desperately googling how to get back together and praying for it. I did a month of no contact and then reached out to him to apologize properly. After a long talk he told me he still loved me and I said I do too but we need time to work on ourselves before we can get back together. I asked him to respect my boundaries and not contact me but he just kept reaching out because he couldnt stop thinking about me. I was charmed cuz hes never been this loving to me before &amp; I thought maybe he changed. We started talking again and eventually dating. And that charm didnt last long at all, the moment things became consistent again and it was clear that I wasnt leaving he stopped doing it. Its been a year since we got back together now and Im just so confused. I feel like he doesnt take responsibility for anything he does thats bad but is the first to step up when its for a good thing. He seriously lacks empathy and the ability to discern what the other person needs at the moment. Idek what to think? I think he might be a narcissist but I dont think he does any of this stuff on purpose, I think hes genuinely unaware. Ive actually never met anyone with so little self awareness. The only other explanation would be some form of Aspergers or something that makes people unable to empathize and connect with others &amp; be vulnerable or self aware. That might also explain the never taking responsibility for actions part. I have no idea, Im hoping that since people in this sub have experience with actual narcissists they might be able to point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance for your help."
14,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Was I a victim of narcissistic abuse?,1,gioaeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/gioaeu/was_i_a_victim_of_narcissistic_abuse/,2020-05-13 10:39:49,"How to recover from being manipulated, lied to, betrayed, and hurt by someone who promised me everything? tl;dr: I met this guy on tinder back in August and I clicked with him instantaneously. We talked everyday for hours on FaceTime and through text and I started developing strong feelings for him. This was the first person I fell for and thought fell for me too. One day after about a month of talking he randomly and coldly ended it saying that he wasnt interested anymore because of the distance (were 50 km apart) and because he doesnt have his own place and there was nowhere for us to have sex privately according to him. I wanted to lose my virginity to him because I felt such a strong emotional connection to him. But he chose to walk away. I was absolutely devastated it took me months to recover emotionally and stop waking up with the pain of him being gone. Six months later I see that hes liked me on tinder. He said he was really sorry for last time and he has his own place and we should go out officially now. He tells me that hes willing to drive four hours and pick me up and take me back home just so we can be together. He tells me Im a keeper and different from all the other girls in his past (and there were so many hes had 10 exes and slept with 20 women). Before he would just compliment my looks but this time he told me how emotionally invested he was in me. After the initial bliss of reconnecting we started having some problems, he refused to add me on social media, he refused to get an std test (although he didnt refuse this the first time we talked, we just never got around to having sex) because he wanted raw sex and he got really angry with me over this and insisted he didnt have anything or any symptoms. We started drifting apart and hadnt talked for weeks and one day I messaged a girl he was mutuals with on Instagram hoping to find information on him through other girls hes talked to. She told him and he got really mad he said I was psychotic and he doesnt care anymore. He told me hes with someone else (probably lying to hurt me on purpose and to get me to forget about the promises just like how he he lied last time to get me off the phone and because I saw him on tinder). I felt really empty, shocked, and numb unlike last time where I was just sad because this time we both believed it could last. It hurts so much to remember all the promises he made and never kept. Looking back, I was really manipulated, there were a lot of red flags which I couldnt see because I was blinded by my affection for him. We never even met in person. After knowing each other for so long. How do I deal with the what ifs? I wrote him a letter for closure and I dont know if I should send it. How do I recover from all the pain? Betrayed after giving my ex a second chance and lost on how to find closure and move on I (20F) took my ex (23M) back and reconnecting with him was so exhilarating, he told me how sorry he was about last time and how he regretted it (we only lasted a month the first time). Note: Im sorry if this is long but the story is messy and at the very least an interesting read so thank you to anyone who gets through the whole thing. We met on tinder and had instantaneous chemistry, we got along great (one of the main reasons he came back to me along with him being very fond of my appearance according to him). He was the one who initiated everything, he asked me out and only four days into knowing me he told me the more I talk to you the better I feel. I developed feelings for him and thought he did too by how much he talked to me and was attracted. He even deleted tinder a week into knowing me. The first time we FaceTimed it felt so natural, there was no awkwardness, and our personalities just clicked and we were both attracted too. Ive never had sex before but this was the first guy I wanted it with (even though we never got around to that). He ended it coldly out of the blue one day telling me that I lived too far away (were 50 km apart) and that he didnt feel the same way, he was just being friendly, he didnt reciprocate, he didnt want to date me, I was too clingy and annoying, he didnt have his own place, and that he just wasnt interested in me anymore. Worst part is that he did it through text but I begged him to call me and he relented, but he told me that after that I want to move on. The phone call lasted an hour where I cried and he yelled and told me that we wouldnt work. After the phone call I texted him a selfie of me flipping him off and he asked me if I changed my mind again would you give up now? And I said omg youre seriously doing this again? He said I am attracted to you and I said I dont want a relationship right now. I told him he hurt me and that I wasnt his bitch. He told me that when he was ready we could meet but hed only do it when he says and on his own conditions. However, at that moment we agreed to give each other space and I guess I wanted to cling onto the tiny bit of hope that he would stay. We didnt talk for a few days aside from sending each other songs. Ultimately, he told me that he made up his mind and that he wasnt interested and that he didnt want to meet anymore. I just couldnt bring myself to say goodbye so I asked him if things changed in the future would he want to meet me. He said he would for sure. I told him thats why its better to leave things open ended. He agreed. The last thing I said to him was okay well text me some other time. And the last thing he said was okay. He never did (well not that I expected). After this text conversation I screamed as loud as I could and cried my heart out. It felt like my heart was cut in two, it was the first time I experienced a break up and he was the first guy I fell for. It was very painful for me and I cried for months on end. I felt like there was an empty hole where my heart was supposed to be and I was just terrified that it was possible for me to love someone this much. I dont know why I feel this way about him but I cant seem to shake the feeling that hes my soulmate despite the negatives on the virtue of the way he makes me feel alone. I tried to move on and I think I got there halfway, I accepted that the distance was something I couldnt control and that he wouldnt come back. The most painful part of my breakup with him was not even the fact it ended but never being able to see how it would turn out. I was deeply hurt by all the what ifs and how we couldve been great together but circumstances fit in the way. 6 months later I download tinder again and 20 minutes into using the app, I see that hes swiped right on me. I felt completely shocked, my heart literally skipped a beat and I cried myself to sleep that night. I left it for a few days not wanting to swipe left or right, but 4 days in I realize that its his birthday today. I swiped right on midnight and messaged him saying I remembered his birthday. The next morning I wake up and see, it is and thank you for remembering. We should go out officially now. I have my own place as of next week. Im very sorry about last time, I realized I kind of fucked up, youre a keeper and Im glad I found you again. Im really sorry I didnt take you for granted. I really want to be with you. He asked me if I wanted to take a shot and be together. I told him ugh you know I cant say no to you. I just couldnt believe that the guy I never thought would come back, came back. And so strongly and intensely too (he was flirty with me before but in a relaxed and reserved way). He finally showed me a side of him that was emotional and vulnerable. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to build something real. The honeymoon phase eventually started to ebb away but he still seemed into it. I made him promise me he wouldnt change his mind because I didnt wanna relive the past and he swore he wouldnt and would do whatever he could to make it work. We never got into arguments the first time but there were a few problems starting to emerge. I got upset with him when he refused to add me on Facebook because according to him I was too nosy and I would ask him too many questions about his past and things he wanted to forget. I was hurt by him not wanting me there and I suspected he had something to hide. He repeatedly denied having something to hide and he said it was because I was too nosy. We argued about this back and forth but he still refused (even though he told me he wanted to make up for last time by giving me whatever my heart desires). This act didnt sit well with me and it started to create resentment for him in me (a feeling I didnt even know was possible to have with someone Ive loved this much and have wanted to badly). Another thing I have to mention about him is that hes had 10 exes (longest one being for a year), slept with 20 girls, and hes only 24. A part of me felt really flattered that he would choose me above all the others (he told me that I was special and he cared about me a lot because I cared about him unlike the other ones) but the other part of me saw this as being a red flag. I dont know if its unfair or not because he was young and not all the relationships were serious but it made me wonder what the issues were on his end. Another thing that became a huge problem was his refusal to get tested. He told me from the very start that he prefers unprotected sex because of the intimacy and pleasure. I got on the pill for him. One day we started off as any other day (happily and lovingly), I told him that I dreamt of us the night before and we were just so happy in it. He said that was so sweet of me and that he couldnt wait to see me. He then had to go back to work and I went to go do my own thing. I stumbled across an article on sociopaths in relationships (I was irked by the timing and felt off about things especially with the social media stuff) and it discussed all their habits such as love-bombing, subsequent emotional withdrawal, and instability. I started to wonder if it was all a lie and if I was manipulated this whole time. I became kinda afraid of him and a little worried for myself. I started to secretly resent him (I never thought this possible but Im proud of myself for achieving such a feeling towards him if that makes sense) but I didnt wanna break it off because Ive made good memories with him and am still emotionally attached (which was why I took him back). A couple of hours after the dream conversation and reading the article, I decided to test him (we were planning on meeting two days from that point and had been taking for three weeks), I told him that I missed a pill. He immediately texted back saying I needed to set an alarm. I then told him I fell asleep before taking it. I then proceeded to tell him that I wanted him to get tested or we could have condom sex the first time. He said he would rather wait a month because raw sex was important and it wouldnt be the same otherwise. I was worried about his refusal to get tested and he got really mad at me for missing the pill and for interfering with our plans so soon before meeting. I told him that it wasnt safe right now and my dad was sick (this was in mid-March while quarantine started). He said he understood and wed make it work and wed find another time to see each other. I asked him when he would get tested and he got really annoyed saying that he was really upset with me cancelling on him and how this stupid shut was keeping us apart (if you want to be with me then just see me and go with the flow). I told him that I was willing to wait and that he didnt want to get tested while coronavirus was a thing and risk getting infected (I can see his side of this so I dont know if its a red flag or not). He was anyway very adamant about not having any stds and he told me had no symptoms and hadnt had sex in a year. I just let it go in the moment but this along with the Facebook thing resurfaced in a few more arguments. One night after another argument he said that he had to be honest and said that I dong know if were a good match lol because we fight and argue a lot. I said yeah we do and then he said all i want is for me to see you and you forget the testing and Facebook and all the other bullshit. I told him we could see each other he said to leave it at that then. I was starting to have doubts but I couldnt bring myself to end it (I have a habit of clinging onto good memories) but he showed me a side of him that I didnt know about. I could surmise he was selfish because the way he walked out on me the first time was very cold due to the way he did it. Im glad he came back because I finally got to confront him about it. He told me that he said all those things to get me off the phone because I was very attached and he had to let go at the time because he couldnt see a way to make it work without having his own place. It was nonetheless a very selfish thing to do, it negatively impacted my mental health and I constantly thought about how confusing it all was and became obsessed with the situation. One day (I guess I just finally had a breaking point because of thinking about all the old and new emotional baggage) and I texted him saying that his refusal to get tested was a serious problem for me and that if he didnt want to get tested he could go find someone else who would have raw sex with him no questions asked because it wouldnt be me. He texts back two hours later saying alright thats what Ill do then. Take care. Immediately after he responded waves of regret began to wash over me and I told him I changed my mind and I didnt want him to leave and I really wanted to see him in person and not repeat last time. He agreed and said that as long as you dont bring up the Facebook or testing again. I wasnt happy about this but resigned because I didnt want him to leave. The next day he texts me making small talk (our usual) Im still very resentful of what went down the night before but didnt want to bring up the testing or Facebook for fear of pushing him away again so I involuntarily unleashed my frustration and anger towards him in other ways. We started off talking about shows and our day but we eventually started to veer off topic to language and politics. He gets really mad at me for calling him sexist and objectifying me. He then very rashly says I will block your number. I dont think we should be together anymore. We never have good conversations. I told him that I was shocked he would say this as weve had great times too. He told me that from now on we shouldnt text as he gets very bad vibes from texting. I told him I wanted us to go back to normal. He said that everything can only be in person or FaceTiming. Our conversations become less and less frequent and he refuses to FaceTime as he keeps telling me that hes busy and too tired all the time all of a sudden. Naturally I become suspicious and find out that hes rejoined tinder from one of my friends. He stops initiating any texts with me and I became really sad. I decided not to confront him through text about it because it would be better to do it in person. One day I just couldnt take his silence and asked him whats wrong, he said nothings wrong and he just needed space right now. I try to resolve our issues with him but he tells me he doesnt want to talk. So I just leave it and become more resentful for being lied to. One day after like two weeks of not talking I ask him if he wants to FaceTime tomorrow afternoon he says, okay I will try, I promise. I text him the next day at the time we agreed to talk and he texts back hours later saying sorry I took a nap lol. I send him paragraph after paragraph on how hes hurting me with his neglect and that we can fix things as long as he puts in the effort. He doesnt respond and two hours later he texts me a paragraph saying that this wouldnt work anymore, he doesnt think were a good fit, hes just not feeling it anymore, and how hes kinda been talking to someone else lately too and he doesnt want to lie to me. He also says the reasons it didnt work the first time (with the distance) are coming back to him now. This is what angered me he promised me that if I took him back we wouldnt go through that again. But I wasnt gonna let him off the hook that easy this time, not after all his grandiose promises. I beg him to reconsider and to see me in person before writing it off. He reluctantly agrees but still doesnt initiate conversation anymore. I just gave him space after that outburst for a few weeks until a few days ago where I texted him calmly about our problems. He responds saying that his only problem is that I sometimes overwhelm him with messages and often asking the same questions. I ask him to promise me to try and meet in person before my birthday in four weeks. He says hell try but it could be difficult with the quarantine. I ask him about the other girls and he says hed rather communicate these things in person and not through text. Im honestly not even jealous or mad about this, only sad. I used to feel so jealous of the thought of all the girls who were with him or will be with him but now I dont. I guess this means something as Im not resentful in that respect, but I dont understand why I feel jealous. Is it not even because Im moving on but Ive been conditioned by him to be used to bad treatment? One day I messaged a girl he was mutuals with on social media asking her if she could show me his following list and send me screenshots because I was hoping to find answers through other girls he may have talked to as he never gave me any. I wanted to know if he talked to them the same way he talked to me. The girl told him about what I did and he got very angry, he told me that he doesnt care anymore, wants nothing to do with me, that it was very creepy and intrusive and that hes done. He said coming back was a mistake and that he wishes the best for me and hes sorry if he hurt me in the process. He said that hes with someone else now and has been seeing them for a few weeks (I dont think this is true not because I dont want to believe it but because I saw him on tinder the same night this happened, I have a strong feeling he said this so I would let go like how he told me he wasnt interested in me anymore last time). But either way all that matters is he doesnt want me anymore. He said hes pissed at me and this is the last straw. He said Im annoying as shit, creepy, super clingy and we need to move on. He blocked me. Did I mess up by contacting her? What wouldve happened if I hadnt and we met in person? Im regretting what I did because now I have to live with what ifs. However, I do know he treated me unkindly and I let him for those few moments of temporary happiness. I know deep down we have too much bad blood to have a future together now. Hes so unstable. He broke his promises. He told me I was special and different from all the others in the past. He showed me a lot of sincerity and vulnerability when he came back and I believed him. Its hard to move on when this is the first person I had feelings for and he treated me like this. What do I do with the memories? The good ones and the bad. At this point I dont know which is more painful. Im grateful that I never lost my virginity to this guy and never got into a real relationship with him because if he walked out on me after that I dont know how I wouldve dealt with it. I wrote him a letter for closure, is it wise to send it? At the same time I want to to help me move on and at the same time I dont because I dont want to close this door forever. I dont want to be with him, he doesnt want me but I also dont want to not be with him and I keep wishing that we met in another life, another time, another place, where we could be happy. Im worried Ill never be truly loved and that Ill never truly love again. I really did love him selflessly and unconditionally. But he didnt. I knew I cared more than he did but still I kept on letting him in because I hoped he would properly fall in love with me too. What hurts is how he told me how happy he was to find me again, how it was destiny, how he was hoping that we were meant to be together, he was so crazy about me in the beginning and yet he still had no problem hurting me. I dont understand how people change their minds, how their feelings change so quickly. I wish I could move on as easily as he could. But I know Ill have to. I just dont know how or when. Will someone like him ever truly love anyone? I wonder if hes ever experienced proper heartbreak before,the kind where you feel as if your heart has been ripped from your chest and miss them beyond belief. Thats how I felt the first time he left. The second time, I had my doubts too, about his character, about his past, the fact he had so many exes, and how disrespectful he was to me before. I tried my best to look past it because I didnt want to leave someone I loved so much and felt so connected to. Im worried hell always be a part of me, that Ill always look for his shadows in other guys. He said he was committed and because we had a few fights about him not adding me and getting tested, he started believing we were incompatible. Looking back, he didnt care about a special bond or connection, he just wanted someone who would be agreeable and fulfil all his demands. These connections are disposable to him. Its just hard to accept that this time its finally over. Or it may not be because of his track record. Why are some guys are like this? Does he have mental health issues? I always suspected it. Or is he just too broken to love? Or is he not capable of it in the first place? Do people like him even feel guilty about it? Do you think hell feel regret for losing someone who truly loved him? He did last time. What will happen in his future relationships? Is a guy like this ever capable of lifelong love? How do I move on? The first time he left all I did was cry for weeks reminiscing about the good times, the sweet things he said, the connection we had. This time I feel numb and in shock. I cant think properly. I feel like a part of my brain is in shock. I dont know what to do and I worry about him being my only soulmate because Ive never felt this way before and worry I wont again for anyone. Ive tried dating other perfectly acceptable nice, funny, attractive (better than him on paper) guys but no one compared to the connection I had with him. Do I just have Stockholm syndrome? Am I just a love-bombed woman? I dont think he was lying to me about his feelings, I think it was real in the moment but I slowly pushed him away because of my emotional baggage (which he caused anyway). But the fact that he was able to throw away something meaningful over such little things just shows that it never meant much to him. How do I reconcile what my brain understands and what my heart feels? How do I get over this? Being betrayed so deeply? Having promises that he was here to stay, that he just wants to love me and make me happy, that hes committed completely broken? How will I deal with the trust issues that come from this? Is it really true that people always remember their first love, even if it was toxic and ended badly? Will I truly move on? Should I send him the letter for closure? Or is there some way I can find it on my own? How will I know when I have moved on?"

We talked everyday for hours on FaceTime and through text and I started developing strong feelings for him. This was the first person I fell for and thought fell for me too. One day after about a month of talking he randomly and coldly ended it saying that he wasnt interested anymore because of the distance (were 50 km apart) and because he doesnt have his own place and there was nowhere for us to have sex privately according to him. I wanted to lose my virginity to him because I felt such a strong emotional connection to him. But he chose to walk away. I was absolutely devastated it took me months to recover emotionally and stop waking up with the pain of him being gone. Six months later I see that hes liked me on tinder. He said he was really sorry for last time and he has his own place and we should go out officially now. He tells me that hes willing to drive four hours and pick me up and take me back home just so we can be together. He tells me Im a keeper and different from all the other girls in his past (and there were so many hes had 10 exes and slept with 20 women). Before he would just compliment my looks but this time he told me how emotionally invested he was in me. After the initial bliss of reconnecting we started having some problems, he refused to add me on social media, he refused to get an std test (although he didnt refuse this the first time we talked, we just never got around to having sex) because he wanted raw sex and he got really angry with me over this and insisted he didnt have anything or any symptoms. We started drifting apart and hadnt talked for weeks and one day I messaged a girl he was mutuals with on Instagram hoping to find information on him through other girls hes talked to.

He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to build something real. I asked him where was this side of you before then? He said, good question, Im not sure. He was very intense (a change from his relaxed, chill attitude from last time), he talked about us being meant to be together, how beautiful our future children would be, moving in. He constantly flattered me and always praised my appearance and told me that I was special and different from the other girls in his past, because I cared about him unlike the other ones. He was also very sexual and he would always discuss his sexual desires and get me to send nudes so he could masturbate. I dont know why he wanted them because he watches porn daily (particularly milfs which doesnt match my body type). I welcomed this because he made me feel desirable and helped him carry out his fantasies. He texted me all the time and we had such an amazing connection. The honeymoon phase eventually started to ebb away but he still seemed into it. I made him promise me he wouldnt change his mind because I didnt wanna relive the past and he swore he wouldnt and would do whatever he could to make it work. We never got into arguments the first time but there were a few problems starting to emerge. I got upset with him when he refused to add me on Facebook because according to him I was too nosy and I would ask him too many questions about his past and things he wanted to forget.

I was starting to have doubts but I couldnt bring myself to end it (I have a habit of clinging onto good memories) but he showed me a side of him that I didnt know about. I could surmise he was selfish because the way he walked out on me the first time was very cold due to the way he did it. Im glad he came back because I finally got to confront him about it. He told me that he said all those things to get me off the phone because I was very attached and he had to let go at the time because he couldnt see a way to make it work without having his own place. It was nonetheless a very selfish thing to do, it negatively impacted my mental health and I constantly thought about how confusing it all was and became obsessed with the situation. One day (I guess I just finally had a breaking point because of thinking about all the old and new emotional baggage) and I texted him saying that his refusal to get tested was a serious problem for me and that if he didnt want to get tested he could go find someone else who would have raw sex with him no questions asked because it wouldnt be me. He texts back two hours later saying alright thats what Ill do then. Take care. Immediately after he responded waves of regret began to wash over me and I told him I changed my mind and I didnt want him to leave and I really wanted to see him in person and not repeat last time. He agreed and said that as long as you dont bring up the Facebook or testing again. I wasnt happy about this but resigned because I didnt want him to leave. The next day he texts me making small talk (our usual) Im still very resentful of what went down the night before but didnt want to bring up the testing or Facebook for fear of pushing him away again so I involuntarily unleashed my frustration and anger towards him in other ways. We started off talking about shows and our day but we eventually started to veer off topic to language and politics. He gets really mad at me for calling him sexist and objectifying me. He then very rashly says I will block your number. I dont think we should be together anymore. We never have good conversations. I told him that I was shocked he would say this as weve had great times too. He told me that from now on we shouldnt text as he gets very bad vibes from texting. I told him I wanted us to go back to normal. He said that everything can only be in person or FaceTiming. Our conversations become less and less frequent and he refuses to FaceTime as he keeps telling me that hes busy and too tired all the time all of a sudden. Naturally I become suspicious and find out that hes rejoined tinder from one of my friends. He stops initiating any texts with me and I became really sad. I decided not to confront him through text about it because it would be better to do it in person. One day I just couldnt take his silence and asked him whats wrong, he said nothings wrong and he just needed space right now. I try to resolve our issues with him but he tells me he doesnt want to talk. So I just leave it and become more resentful for being lied to. One day after like two weeks of not talking I ask him if he wants to FaceTime tomorrow afternoon he says, okay I will try, I promise. I text him the next day at the time we agreed to talk and he texts back hours later saying sorry I took a nap lol. I send him paragraph after paragraph on how hes hurting me with his neglect and that we can fix things as long as he puts in the effort. He doesnt respond and two hours later he texts me a paragraph saying that this wouldnt work anymore, he doesnt think were a good fit, hes just not feeling it anymore, and how hes kinda been talking to someone else lately too and he doesnt want to lie to me. He also says the reasons it didnt work the first time (with the distance) are coming back to him now. This is what angered me he promised me that if I took him back we wouldnt go through that again. But I wasnt gonna let him off the hook that easy this time, not after all his grandiose promises. I beg him to reconsider and to see me in person before writing it off. He reluctantly agrees but still doesnt initiate conversation anymore. I just gave him space after that outburst for a few weeks until a few days ago where I texted him calmly about our problems. He responds saying that his only problem is that I sometimes overwhelm him with messages and often asking the same questions. I ask him to promise me to try and meet in person before my birthday in four weeks. He says hell try but it could be difficult with the quarantine. I ask him about the other girls and he says hed rather communicate these things in person and not through text. Im honestly not even jealous or mad about this, only sad. I used to feel so jealous of the thought of all the girls who were with him or will be with him but now I dont. I guess this means something as Im not resentful in that respect, but I dont understand why I feel jealous. Is it not even because Im moving on but Ive been conditioned by him to be used to bad treatment? One day I messaged a girl he was mutuals with on social media asking her if she could show me his following list and send me screenshots because I was hoping to find answers through other girls he may have talked to as he never gave me any. I wanted to know if he talked to them the same way he talked to me. The girl told him about what I did and he got very angry, he told me that he doesnt care anymore, wants nothing to do with me, that it was very creepy and intrusive and that hes done. He said coming back was a mistake and that he wishes the best for me and hes sorry if he hurt me in the process. He said that hes with someone else now and has been seeing them for a few weeks (I dont think this is true not because I dont want to believe it but because I saw him on tinder the same night this happened, I have a strong feeling he said this so I would let go like how he told me he wasnt interested in me anymore last time). But either way all that matters is he doesnt want me anymore. He said hes pissed at me and this is the last straw. He said Im annoying as shit, creepy, super clingy and we need to move on. He blocked me. Did I mess up by contacting her? What wouldve happened if I hadnt and we met in person? Im regretting what I did because now I have to live with what ifs. However, I do know he treated me unkindly and I let him for those few moments of temporary happiness. I know deep down we have too much bad blood to have a future together now. Hes so unstable. He broke his promises. He told me I was special and different from all the others in the past. He showed me a lot of sincerity and vulnerability when he came back and I believed him. Its hard to move on when this is the first person I had feelings for and he treated me like this. What do I do with the memories? The good ones and the bad. At this point I dont know which is more painful. Im grateful that I never lost my virginity to this guy and never got into a real relationship with him because if he walked out on me after that I dont know how I wouldve dealt with it. I wrote him a letter for closure, is it wise to send it? At the same time I want to to help me move on and at the same time I dont because I dont want to close this door forever. I dont want to be with him, he doesnt want me but I also dont want to not be with him and I keep wishing that we met in another life, another time, another place, where we could be happy. Im worried Ill never be truly loved and that Ill never truly love again. I really did love him selflessly and unconditionally. But he didnt. I knew I cared more than he did but still I kept on letting him in because I hoped he would properly fall in love with me too. What hurts is how he told me how happy he was to find me again, how it was destiny, how he was hoping that we were meant to be together, he was so crazy about me in the beginning and yet he still had no problem hurting me. I dont understand how people change their minds, how their feelings change so quickly. I wish I could move on as easily as he could. But I know Ill have to. I just dont know how or when. Will someone like him ever truly love anyone? I wonder if hes ever experienced proper heartbreak before,the kind where you feel as if your heart has been ripped from your chest and miss them beyond belief. Thats how I felt the first time he left. The second time, I had my doubts too, about his character, about his past, the fact he had so many exes, and how disrespectful he was to me before. I tried my best to look past it because I didnt want to leave someone I loved so much and felt so connected to. Im worried hell always be a part of me, that Ill always look for his shadows in other guys. He said he was committed and because we had a few fights about him not adding me and getting tested, he started believing we were incompatible. Looking back, he didnt care about a special bond or connection, he just wanted someone who would be agreeable and fulfil all his demands. These connections are disposable to him. Its just hard to accept that this time its finally over. Or it may not be because of his track record. Why are some guys are like this? Does he have mental health issues? I always suspected it. Or is he just too broken to love? Or is he not capable of it in the first place? Do people like him even feel guilty about it? Do you think hell feel regret for losing someone who truly loved him? He did last time. What will happen in his future relationships? Is a guy like this ever capable of lifelong love? How do I move on? The first time he left all I did was cry for weeks reminiscing about the good times, the sweet things he said, the connection we had. This time I feel numb and in shock. I cant think properly. I feel like a part of my brain is in shock. I dont know what to do and I worry about him being my only soulmate because Ive never felt this way before and worry I wont again for anyone. Ive tried dating other perfectly acceptable nice, funny, attractive (better than him on paper) guys but no one compared to the connection I had with him. Do I just have Stockholm syndrome? Am I just a love-bombed woman? I dont think he was lying to me about his feelings, I think it was real in the moment but I slowly pushed him away because of my emotional baggage (which he caused anyway). But the fact that he was able to throw away something meaningful over such little things just shows that it never meant much to him. How do I reconcile what my brain understands and what my heart feels? How do I get over this? Being betrayed so deeply? Having promises that he was here to stay, that he just wants to love me and make me happy, that hes committed completely broken? How will I deal with the trust issues that come from this? Is it really true that people always remember their first love, even if it was toxic and ended badly? Will I truly move on? Should I send him the letter for closure? Or is there some way I can find it on my own? How will I know when I have moved on?"

I thought about it a lot and Ive come to the conclusion that Im doing a lot of the same stuff my mother did to me unconsciously. I realized that I did it to my closest friends in the past, as well. I care a lot about my friends and their well-being and I think Im pretty good at giving advice and support when it doesnt directly involve my emotions, but when it comes to intense emotional vulnerability that involves my feelings, I did a lot of the same things my mother did to me without even realizing it. I dont get why this is and I dont know how I didnt even realize it. I feel dumb for not considering it a possibility until now. I feel so awful. I thought I was immune to becoming my nmom because of how much I hate her and what shes done. I know it probably sounds nuts that I didnt see that this was going on and I cant believe it either. I wish I caught it before I hurt people I cared about. If anyone has any advice, how do I break the pattern? How did you break it if youve experienced this? How do I stop unconsciously doing the same fucked up shit that my nmom did to me? I dont want to hurt anyone. I just want to be healthy and I want my relationships to be healthy and I want to be able to be emotionally supportive without being reactive, even when Im feeling shitty or vulnerable. Any advice would be great, thanks"

Thats the hardest part to deal with. Knowing he is highly manipulative and manipulating everyone, but not being able to do anything about it. Hes pretty smart and knows exactly what to say to lure someone in, telling lies and faking vulnerability. I have gone NC for 5 months now and fully, not even breaking it to look at his social media of lies. But I am not at my full strength yet after the abuse, and the abuse has made me believe Im not so smart. While I do not have to directly address him at work, Im worried he might address me directly to provoke me since hes hoovered recently through a friend. I ignored it. I blocked him on all grounds so that was his only way in. I need all tips possible on how to feel strong and confident while dealing with the narc no matter real life provocation or manipulation. Especially dealing with an intelligent narc who will try to manipulate people behind the scenes and provoke/humiliate me. How can I prepare for this? I am meditating now to have better control of my mind. Im in the stage where I recognise this person is complete trash and I dont want anything to do with them even in my head. I cant quit my job, so I can only be better. He has zero empathy and IMO has no limit as long as he wont be caught. I want to lead my life as though he was never there and be the strong girl I was before. All advice welcome."

We talked everyday for hours on FaceTime and through text and I started developing strong feelings for him. This was the first person I fell for and thought fell for me too. One day after about a month of talking he randomly and coldly ended it saying that he wasnt interested anymore because of the distance (were 50 km apart) and because he doesnt have his own place and there was nowhere for us to have sex privately according to him. I wanted to lose my virginity to him because I felt such a strong emotional connection to him. But he chose to walk away. I was absolutely devastated it took me months to recover emotionally and stop waking up with the pain of him being gone. Six months later I see that hes liked me on tinder. He said he was really sorry for last time and he has his own place and we should go out officially now. He tells me that hes willing to drive four hours and pick me up and take me back home just so we can be together. He tells me Im a keeper and different from all the other girls in his past (and there were so many hes had 10 exes and slept with 20 women). Before he would just compliment my looks but this time he told me how emotionally invested he was in me. After the initial bliss of reconnecting we started having some problems, he refused to add me on social media, he refused to get an std test (although he didnt refuse this the first time we talked, we just never got around to having sex) because he wanted raw sex and he got really angry with me over this and insisted he didnt have anything or any symptoms. We started drifting apart and hadnt talked for weeks and one day I messaged a girl he was mutuals with on Instagram hoping to find information on him through other girls hes talked to. She told him and he got really mad he said I was psychotic and he doesnt care anymore. He told me hes with someone else (probably lying to hurt me on purpose and to get me to forget about the promises just like how he he lied last time to get me off the phone and because I saw him on tinder). I found out he was lying about already having anew gf as I saw he made a new account on bumble two weeks after our breakup. Did he do this to hurt me on purpose after I angered him or did he do this to get me to leave him alone and move on easier like he did last time with saying he wasnt interested in me anymore (he later claimed he only did this to get me off the phone and wanted to be with me then but couldnt see a way it would work at the time). I felt really empty, shocked, and numb unlike last time where I was just sad because this time we both believed it could last. It hurts so much to remember all the promises he made and never kept. Looking back, I was really manipulated, there were a lot of red flags which I couldnt see because I was blinded by my affection for him. We never even met in person. After knowing each other for so long. How do I deal with the what ifs? I wrote him a letter for closure and I dont know if I should send it. How do I recover from all the pain? Betrayed after giving my ex a second chance and lost on how to find closure and move on I (20F) took my ex (23M) back and reconnecting with him was so exhilarating, he told me how sorry he was about last time and how he regretted it (we only lasted a month the first time). Note: Im sorry if this is long but the story is messy and at the very least an interesting read so thank you to anyone who gets through the whole thing. We met on tinder and had instantaneous chemistry, we got along great (one of the main reasons he came back to me along with him being very fond of my appearance according to him). He was the one who initiated everything, he asked me out and only four days into knowing me he told me the more I talk to you the better I feel. I developed feelings for him and thought he did too by how much he talked to me and was attracted. He even deleted tinder a week into knowing me. The first time we FaceTimed it felt so natural, there was no awkwardness, and our personalities just clicked and we were both attracted too. Ive never had sex before but this was the first guy I wanted it with (even though we never got around to that). He ended it coldly out of the blue one day telling me that I lived too far away (were 50 km apart) and that he didnt feel the same way, he was just being friendly, he didnt reciprocate, he didnt want to date me, I was too clingy and annoying, he didnt have his own place, and that he just wasnt interested in me anymore. Worst part is that he did it through text but I begged him to call me and he relented, but he told me that after that I want to move on. The phone call lasted an hour where I cried and he yelled and told me that we wouldnt work. After the phone call I texted him a selfie of me flipping him off and he asked me if I changed my mind again would you give up now? And I said omg youre seriously doing this again? He said I am attracted to you and I said I dont want a relationship right now. I told him he hurt me and that I wasnt his bitch. He told me that when he was ready we could meet but hed only do it when he says and on his own conditions. However, at that moment we agreed to give each other space and I guess I wanted to cling onto the tiny bit of hope that he would stay. We didnt talk for a few days aside from sending each other songs. Ultimately, he told me that he made up his mind and that he wasnt interested and that he didnt want to meet anymore. I just couldnt bring myself to say goodbye so I asked him if things changed in the future would he want to meet me. He said he would for sure. I told him thats why its better to leave things open ended. He agreed. The last thing I said to him was okay well text me some other time. And the last thing he said was okay. He never did (well not that I expected). After this text conversation I screamed as loud as I could and cried my heart out. It felt like my heart was cut in two, it was the first time I experienced a break up and he was the first guy I fell for. It was very painful for me and I cried for months on end. I felt like there was an empty hole where my heart was supposed to be and I was just terrified that it was possible for me to love someone this much. I dont know why I feel this way about him but I cant seem to shake the feeling that hes my soulmate despite the negatives on the virtue of the way he makes me feel alone. I tried to move on and I think I got there halfway, I accepted that the distance was something I couldnt control and that he wouldnt come back. The most painful part of my breakup with him was not even the fact it ended but never being able to see how it would turn out. I was deeply hurt by all the what ifs and how we couldve been great together but circumstances fit in the way. 6 months later I download tinder again and 20 minutes into using the app, I see that hes swiped right on me. I felt completely shocked, my heart literally skipped a beat and I cried myself to sleep that night. I left it for a few days not wanting to swipe left or right, but 4 days in I realize that its his birthday today. I swiped right on midnight and messaged him saying I remembered his birthday. The next morning I wake up and see, it is and thank you for remembering. We should go out officially now. I have my own place as of next week. Im very sorry about last time, I realized I kind of fucked up, youre a keeper and Im glad I found you again. Im really sorry I didnt take you for granted. I really want to be with you. He asked me if I wanted to take a shot and be together. I told him ugh you know I cant say no to you. I just couldnt believe that the guy I never thought would come back, came back. And so strongly and intensely too (he was flirty with me before but in a relaxed and reserved way). He finally showed me a side of him that was emotional and vulnerable. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to build something real. I asked him where was this side of you before then? He said, good question, Im not sure. He was very intense (a change from his relaxed, chill attitude from last time), he talked about us being meant to be together, how beautiful our future children would be, moving in. He constantly flattered me and always praised my appearance and told me that I was special and different from the other girls in his past, because I cared about him unlike the other ones. He was also very sexual and he would always discuss his sexual desires and get me to send nudes so he could masturbate. He did however say that hes just speaking his mind and that I dont have to do anything. He did ask me if I consented. I dont know why he wanted them because he watches porn daily (particularly milfs which doesnt match my body type). I welcomed this because he made me feel desirable and helped him carry out his fantasies. He texted me all the time and we had such an amazing connection. He even said that he was willing to drive four hours to pick me up and drop me off to his own place (which he never wanted to do before). The honeymoon phase eventually started to ebb away but he still seemed into it. I made him promise me he wouldnt change his mind because I didnt wanna relive the past and he swore he wouldnt and would do whatever he could to make it work. We never got into arguments the first time but there were a few problems starting to emerge. I got upset with him when he refused to add me on Facebook because according to him I was too nosy and I would ask him too many questions about his past and things he wanted to forget. I was hurt by him not wanting me there and I suspected he had something to hide. He repeatedly denied having something to hide and he said it was because I was too nosy. We argued about this back and forth but he still refused (even though he told me he wanted to make up for last time by giving me whatever my heart desires). This act didnt sit well with me and it started to create resentment for him in me (a feeling I didnt even know was possible to have with someone Ive loved this much and have wanted to badly). Another thing I have to mention about him is that hes had 10 exes (longest one being for a year), slept with 20 girls, and hes only 24. A part of me felt really flattered that he would choose me above all the others (he told me that I was special and he cared about me a lot because I cared about him unlike the other ones) but the other part of me saw this as being a red flag. I dont know if its unfair or not because he was young and not all the relationships were serious but it made me wonder what the issues were on his end. Another thing that became a huge problem was his refusal to get tested. He told me from the very start that he prefers unprotected sex because of the intimacy and pleasure. I got on the pill for him. One day we started off as any other day (happily and lovingly), I told him that I dreamt of us the night before and we were just so happy in it. He said that was so sweet of me and that he couldnt wait to see me. He then had to go back to work and I went to go do my own thing. I stumbled across an article on sociopaths in relationships (I was irked by the timing and felt off about things especially with the social media stuff) and it discussed all their habits such as love-bombing, subsequent emotional withdrawal, and instability. I started to wonder if it was all a lie and if I was manipulated this whole time. I became kinda afraid of him and a little worried for myself. I started to secretly resent him (I never thought this possible but Im proud of myself for achieving such a feeling towards him if that makes sense) but I didnt wanna break it off because Ive made good memories with him and am still emotionally attached (which was why I took him back). A couple of hours after the dream conversation and reading the article, I decided to test him (we were planning on meeting two days from that point and had been taking for three weeks), I told him that I missed a pill. He immediately texted back saying I needed to set an alarm. I then told him I fell asleep before taking it. I asked him, are you seriously blaming me for that? He said, yeah I am. I wanted to see you but you changed your mind and didnt take the pill like you were supposed to. I then proceeded to tell him that I wanted him to get tested or we could have condom sex the first time. He said he would rather wait a month because raw sex was important and it wouldnt be the same otherwise. I was worried about his refusal to get tested and he got really mad at me for missing the pill and for interfering with our plans so soon before meeting. He told me, Jesus Christ Im mad. I wanted to see you but now Im getting frustrated with you. I was supposed to see you this week, just fucking do it and stop worrying about stupid shit! This stupid shit is keeping us apart. Fucking stupid. Thats why I get annoyed. If you told me this was a concern earlier I would be more understanding. I told him I was caught up in the excitement of reconnecting after so long and wasnt thinking of practical matters. He said, you dont trust me? I have no diseases or anything, youre not going to get pregnant, just trust me here please. I said it was risky to have raw sex right now but we could still meet if he wanted to. He said okay lets meet then. To be fair, he never said we had to have penetrative sex the first time meeting, I was the one who kept that up because I wanted to lose my virginity and I wanted to show him I cared by letting him get something out of driving so much. He then cut the conversation abruptly and told me that he wasnt going to get tested during coronavirus and risk getting sick. Although, he repeatedly asked me when i was going to figure out the birth control and get on the pill. I was really upset by how I did something for him and he wouldnt for me. I asked him if he still cared and he said, Id care more if you just trusted me and met like how we were originally supposed to. I told him that it wasnt safe right now and my dad was sick (this was in mid-March while quarantine started). He said he understood and wed make it work and wed find another time to see each other. I asked him when he would get tested and he got really annoyed saying that he was really upset with me cancelling on him and how this stupid shut was keeping us apart (if you want to be with me then just see me and go with the flow). I told him that I was willing to wait and that he didnt want to get tested while coronavirus was a thing and risk getting infected (I can see his side of this so I dont know if its a red flag or not). He was anyway very adamant about not having any stds and he told me had no symptoms and hadnt had sex in a year. I just let it go in the moment but this along with the Facebook thing resurfaced in a few more arguments. One night after another argument he said that he had to be honest and said that I dong know if were a good match lol because we fight and argue a lot. I said yeah we do and then he said all i want is for me to see you and you forget the testing and Facebook and all the other bullshit. I told him we could see each other he said to leave it at that then. I was starting to have doubts but I couldnt bring myself to end it (I have a habit of clinging onto good memories) but he showed me a side of him that I didnt know about. I could surmise he was selfish because the way he walked out on me the first time was very cold due to the way he did it. Im glad he came back because I finally got to confront him about it. He told me that he said all those things to get me off the phone because I was very attached and he had to let go at the time because he couldnt see a way to make it work without having his own place. It was nonetheless a very selfish thing to do, it negatively impacted my mental health and I constantly thought about how confusing it all was and became obsessed with the situation. Some background knowledge on my ex: he comes from a middle-class white background and grew up in a stable family environment. His parents were married until his mothers death and I am fairly certain he has a good relationship with his family, however he did say insulting things about his sister in law, how shes annoying, how he would never want a woman who acts like her, and very selfish. I dont know what this woman is like so I cant say if its valid or not. I also must mention that he only likes women of colour (brown and Asian girls not black women). He always praised my facial features like full lips, brown eyes, and light brown skin tone. I asked him why and he said its probably because of interracial porn or that he doesnt like women who look like his blonde blue eyed mom. He has a university degree and a stable job and now his own place. Ive talked to a few people who knew him as friends and they all said he was quiet and a friendly guy. However, he was always very bold and talkative with me in our FaceTime conversations. Ive asked him more than once if he is bipolar and he has always denied this. He always got really upset whenever I brought up what happened last summer and he said that we cant talk about it constantly or else he cant do this. He also said that he cant give me an answer I want anyway because he cant remember what happened, yet he remembers random details like how I like wearing jeans?! Hes also slept with 20 women and has had ten ex-girlfriends, mostly having unprotected sex and he does not get tested after every new partner. He hates using condoms because he says that he doesnt enjoy sex with them and they break on him because he can last up to an hour. He is intelligent, eloquent, well-spoken and has studied criminology in university and hopes to become a police officer. He should probably be familiar with personality disorders then. Do people like this know they have a problem? Another random thing is he told me how a video game storyline (red dead redemption 2) made him cry and think about life afterwards. Its just so strange to me picturing this man cry, so I guess he isnt afraid of feeling his emotions. Another thing that doesnt sit well with me at all but I could be overanalyzing, I did some research and I found his mothers obituary she passed away on March 22nd, on March 27th he uploads a selfie (in which he is wearing a tux so Im assuming is for the funeral) smiling with the caption rip momma. I thought this was a really strange thing to do, if this happened to me I would certainly never post a picture of just myself . He also used this picture as a profile picture for many years and on his tinder and bumble profiles. Why would he do this? One day (I guess I just finally had a breaking point because of thinking about all the old and new emotional baggage) and I texted him saying that his refusal to get tested was a serious problem for me and that if he didnt want to get tested he could go find someone else who would have raw sex with him no questions asked because it wouldnt be me. He texts back two hours later saying alright thats what Ill do then. Take care. Immediately after he responded waves of regret began to wash over me and I told him I changed my mind and I didnt want him to leave and I really wanted to see him in person and not repeat last time. He agreed and said that as long as you dont bring up the Facebook or testing again. I wasnt happy about this but resigned because I didnt want him to leave. The next day he texts me making small talk (our usual) Im still very resentful of what went down the night before but didnt want to bring up the testing or Facebook for fear of pushing him away again so I involuntarily unleashed my frustration and anger towards him in other ways. We started off talking about shows and our day but we eventually started to veer off topic to language and politics. He gets really mad at me for calling him sexist and objectifying me. He then very rashly says I will block your number. I dont think we should be together anymore. We never have good conversations. I told him that I was shocked he would say this as weve had great times too. He told me that from now on we shouldnt text as he gets very bad vibes from texting. I told him I wanted us to go back to normal. He said that everything can only be in person or FaceTiming. Our conversations become less and less frequent and he refuses to FaceTime as he keeps telling me that hes busy and too tired all the time all of a sudden. Naturally I become suspicious and find out that hes rejoined tinder from one of my friends. He stops initiating any texts with me and I became really sad. I decided not to confront him through text about it because it would be better to do it in person. One day I just couldnt take his silence and asked him whats wrong, he said nothings wrong and he just needed space right now. I try to resolve our issues with him but he tells me he doesnt want to talk. So I just leave it and become more resentful for being lied to. One day after like two weeks of not talking I ask him if he wants to FaceTime tomorrow afternoon he says, okay I will try, I promise. I text him the next day at the time we agreed to talk and he texts back hours later saying sorry I took a nap lol. I send him paragraph after paragraph on how hes hurting me with his neglect and that we can fix things as long as he puts in the effort. He doesnt respond and two hours later he texts me a paragraph saying that this wouldnt work anymore, he doesnt think were a good fit, hes just not feeling it anymore, and how hes kinda been talking to someone else lately too and he doesnt want to lie to me. He also says the reasons it didnt work the first time (with the distance) are coming back to him now. This is what angered me he promised me that if I took him back we wouldnt go through that again. But I wasnt gonna let him off the hook that easy this time, not after all his grandiose promises. I beg him to reconsider and to see me in person before writing it off. He reluctantly agrees but still doesnt initiate conversation anymore. I just gave him space after that outburst for a few weeks until a few days ago where I texted him calmly about our problems. He responds saying that his only problem is that I sometimes overwhelm him with messages and often asking the same questions. I ask him to promise me to try and meet in person before my birthday in four weeks. He says hell try but it could be difficult with the quarantine. I ask him about the other girls and he says hed rather communicate these things in person and not through text. Im honestly not even jealous or mad about this, only sad. I used to feel so jealous of the thought of all the girls who were with him or will be with him but now I dont. I guess this means something as Im not resentful in that respect, but I dont understand why I feel jealous. Is it not even because Im moving on but Ive been conditioned by him to be used to bad treatment? One day I messaged a girl he was mutuals with on social media asking her if she could show me his following list and send me screenshots because I was hoping to find answers through other girls he may have talked to as he never gave me any. I wanted to know if he talked to them the same way he talked to me. The girl told him about what I did and he got very angry, he told me that he doesnt care anymore, wants nothing to do with me, that it was very creepy and intrusive and that hes done. He said coming back was a mistake and that he wishes the best for me and hes sorry if he hurt me in the process. He said that hes with someone else now and has been seeing them for a few weeks (I dont think this is true not because I dont want to believe it but because I saw him on tinder the same night this happened, I have a strong feeling he said this so I would let go like how he told me he wasnt interested in me anymore last time). But either way all that matters is he doesnt want me anymore. He said hes pissed at me and this is the last straw. He said Im annoying as shit, creepy, super clingy and we need to move on. He blocked me. Did I mess up by contacting her? What wouldve happened if I hadnt and we met in person? Im regretting what I did because now I have to live with what ifs. However, I do know he treated me unkindly and I let him for those few moments of temporary happiness. I know deep down we have too much bad blood to have a future together now. Hes so unstable. He broke his promises. He told me I was special and different from all the others in the past. He showed me a lot of sincerity and vulnerability when he came back and I believed him. Its hard to move on when this is the first person I had feelings for and he treated me like this. What do I do with the memories? The good ones and the bad. At this point I dont know which is more painful. Im grateful that I never lost my virginity to this guy and never got into a real relationship with him because if he walked out on me after that I dont know how I wouldve dealt with it. I wrote him a letter for closure, is it wise to send it? At the same time I want to to help me move on and at the same time I dont because I dont want to close this door forever. I dont want to be with him, he doesnt want me but I also dont want to not be with him and I keep wishing that we met in another life, another time, another place, where we could be happy. Im worried Ill never be truly loved and that Ill never truly love again. I really did love him selflessly and unconditionally. But he didnt. I knew I cared more than he did but still I kept on letting him in because I hoped he would properly fall in love with me too. What hurts is how he told me how happy he was to find me again, how it was destiny, how he was hoping that we were meant to be together, he was so crazy about me in the beginning and yet he still had no problem hurting me. I dont understand how people change their minds, how their feelings change so quickly. I wish I could move on as easily as he could. But I know Ill have to. I just dont know how or when. Will someone like him ever truly love anyone? I wonder if hes ever experienced proper heartbreak before,the kind where you feel as if your heart has been ripped from your chest and miss them beyond belief. Thats how I felt the first time he left. The second time, I had my doubts too, about his character, about his past, the fact he had so many exes, and how disrespectful he was to me before. I tried my best to look past it because I didnt want to leave someone I loved so much and felt so connected to. Im worried hell always be a part of me, that Ill always look for his shadows in other guys. He said he was committed and because we had a few fights about him not adding me and getting tested, he started believing we were incompatible. Looking back, he didnt care about a special bond or connection, he just wanted someone who would be agreeable and fulfil all his demands. These connections are disposable to him. Its just hard to accept that this time its finally over. Or it may not be because of his track record. Why are some guys are like this? Does he have mental health issues? I always suspected it. Or is he just too broken to love? Or is he not capable of it in the first place? Do people like him even feel guilty about it? Do you think hell feel regret for losing someone who truly loved him? He did last time. What will happen in his future relationships? Is a guy like this ever capable of lifelong love? How do I move on? The first time he left all I did was cry for weeks reminiscing about the good times, the sweet things he said, the connection we had. This time I feel numb and in shock. I cant think properly. I feel like a part of my brain is in shock. I dont know what to do and I worry about him being my only soulmate because Ive never felt this way before and worry I wont again for anyone. Ive tried dating other perfectly acceptable nice, funny, attractive (better than him on paper) guys but no one compared to the connection I had with him. Do I just have Stockholm syndrome? Am I just a love-bombed woman? I dont think he was lying to me about his feelings, I think it was real in the moment but I slowly pushed him away because of my emotional baggage (which he caused anyway). But the fact that he was able to throw away something meaningful over such little things just shows that it never meant much to him. How do I reconcile what my brain understands and what my heart feels? How do I get over this? Being betrayed so deeply? Having promises that he was here to stay, that he just wants to love me and make me happy, that hes committed completely broken? How will I deal with the trust issues that come from this? Is it really true that people always remember their first love, even if it was toxic and ended badly? Will I truly move on? Should I send him the letter for closure? Or is there some way I can find it on my own? How will I know when I have moved on?"

I have encountered 2 people like this, at least. It feels like emotional manipulation. These people tend to think they are right and feel angry at you until you be vulnerable with them. As someone who values vulnerability, not every person has earned your trust. It feels SO wrong to me that in order to be on your good side I must divulge a part of me that I dont trust you with, also because it is forced, its not actual vulnerability it is me trying to appease you. It feels like being emotionally beaten into submission. These people have also been in roles of authority. It makes them incredibly unapproachable which undermines their ability to do their job. Can I get input from anyone who has experienced these kinds of people?"

Ive the way she smiles, Ive seen the happiness in her eyes, I know the way she used to hold me, I heard the love and passion in her voice. I think she had BPD with narcissism. She wore a narcissistic mask to protect herself from being emotionally hurt due to her childhood trauma. I know that doesnt excuse the way she treated me, Im not saying it does. But it DOES mean that her rare moments of vulnerability were real and when we connected deeply and intimately, it was real. Which means...I still love her and empathize with her. I cant make her into a villain, I just cant. I dont think shes a bad person. This is preventing me from moving on."
22,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Subtle traits that give away a narcissist,1,g474s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/g474s5/subtle_traits_that_give_away_a_narcissist/,2020-04-19 22:48:38,"In my 29 years, I've been through the emotional turmoil that is dating a narcissist three times. The last one had me absolutely blind-sided and so I wanted to share some things I picked up from this experience so to hopefully help everyone else who uses this sub. Firstly - if you've just got out of a relationship: **do not start dating again until you know in your heart you are ready.** This is exactly how I got caught up with my ex and if I had my time again, I wouldn't have been so quick to jump back on the dating apps. I have now decided to dedicate my time and energy to myself and I will be taking a long break from dating. I am going to break this down into different aspects so to properly communicate the red flags I've noticed and to make it (hopefully) more digestible. INTUITION - never ignore this. As normal, healthy people, we like to give others the benefit of the doubt and as anyone who has been in a narcissistic relationship knows, abusers never paint themselves in a negative light at the beginning. This person might shower you with lovely dinners, presents and words of validation/adoration. You have to see past this and not be swept up in it. A narcissist will use these gestures down the line to tell you that they \*are\* very appreciative of you and attempt to use them as proof when you try to address things in your relationship that you don't like. It's smoke and mirrors - don't look there, **look over here!** If you feel like someone isn't telling you everything, is hiding something or you just get a general sense of ""douchiness"" - trust that feeling. ANIMALS AND PETS - as an empathetic person, it's probably a good sign to you that the person you are dating likes animals. They probably even have a pet of their own. It's not true in the case of narcissists that how they treat animals is indicative of how they treat humans. Pets are subservient to them. They pose no threat to their ego. What is a red flag is when the person in question sees no issue in their pet attacking other people. Two narcissists I have dated have shown little remorse at their pets' hostility towards other people. Additionally, if you have a pet and the person you are dating makes you feel as if they like your pet more than they like you, then they probably do and it's a sign that something is off in your relationship. MONEY - my most recent ex made comments on how affordable things were, for example, ""this restaurant is so good, and it's \*so cheap\*"". Narcissists are ultimately cheap people and if they are wining and dining you, expect only to order entrees, go out on nights where there are discounted menus and watch as they don't bother to ask if you've had enough to eat. They are likely courting you because it's perceived to be the ""done thing"" and not because they have any interest in getting to know you or treating you. YOUR SPACE - take note of how someone treats your living space. They should leave things as they find them and make an effort to help clean up. Additionally, if you are purchasing new things, they should show a vested interest in what you are buying - particularly if they are spending a lot of time at your place. My most recent ex tried to talk me into buying incredibly cheap furniture that he wouldn't have bought for himself and that would have broken after the first few uses. \*How they treat your living space is an exact reflection of how they feel about you.\* RELATIONSHIP WITH SERVICE STAFF - they will likely yell at telecom phone operators, their rental managers or anyone else they deem is below them, inconvenient to them or simply because they think that they can get away with it. There will always be a justification for it. Most people get frustrated a their telecom company and rental agent from time to time, but most people will at least start out polite and certainly don't sit there arguing with that person even after the point is made. A narcissist will tell you about this and rationalise it. Yelling at wait staff is a sign, but not for an introverted narcissist. They don't want other people to watch them and to cause a scene which will paint them in a bad light. RELATIONSHIP WITH FRIENDS - this will be incredibly unbalanced. You will know when it's off. Likely, they are bound to their close friends for an ego boost and will therefore rely too heavily on them while also talking badly about them to you. Their friends are also likely narcissistic and will try and make your narcissist feel guilty for dating you by stonewalling him or her once you've both committed to the relationship, or attempting to use triangulation to break you up. This can be as subtle as small, disparaging or dismissive remarks. RELATIONSHIP WITH FAMILY - look out particularly for how they speak about their mother. Narcissists will both hate and love their mother and you will never be entirely sure which it is. They will likely be unempathetic to other family members. My ex made a point of telling me he called out his sister for her bad relationships. There was no empathy for her, rather, she was to blame entirely because she chose to be in those relationships. EXES - they will either tell you that their exes were all crazy or they will omit information/avoid the conversation. If you notice the latter, pay very close attention to what they \*are\* telling you. There may be an air of dismissal about their previous relationships and a lack of accountability. COLLEAGUES - they will smear other colleagues, particularly those they deem beneath them. The firm assistant may have to service all nine lawyers and the firm partners, but the narcissist will always find a way to describe her as inept, without any regard for her workload. USE YOUR EMPATHY/SENSITIVITY AS A FILTER - about a month into my last relationship, I told my now nex that I was feeling nervous about our budding relationship. He responded ""that's a good thing"". No. It's not. If someone responds to small emotional cues that you are feeling uneasy as if it is a good thing or they dismiss it entirely, run. Use small displays of vulnerability as a shit-test. &amp;#x200B; I ultimately broke up with my ex after he refused to re-open a conversation with me about how his friends had reacted to us ""becoming official"". It wasn't his friends comments that bothered me, but rather how he refused to speak to me about it. He even said ""I'm not being dismissive, we have already spoken about this"". It was a very small thing and looking back, the only red flag I'd noticed until that point. When we finally spoke to discuss it - he laughed at me and told me ""there's nothing to save"". He confirmed all of my suspicions in that small sentence. Later on, he tried to flip the narrative to make it seem as if he instigated the break-up and that is was my actions that caused it."

This cant be normal!!! Just need to vent I (F36) feel like there little to no hope my husband (M39) to have a happy, heck civil or decent marriage (together for 7yrs, married 2yrs)Thoughts and/or advice We started seeing a marriage counselor, only had one session so far, and this week we will be having our own individual sessionsbut I after tonight I feel its almost rather pointless and wastes of time and money to continue therapy. Despite such reservations were still going to do itat least for this week. So if you review some of my other post youll see that things have not been super greatsince we had our twins. I know that the first year after baby, esp post multiples, is savage on a marriagebut 8 months on Im starting to believe that he just really is like this and boys have nothing to do with itSo starting this the latest incident this evening Luckily, during plague 2020 Im lucky enough to still have job that grants me a lot of flexibility (TY JESUS!!!). Unfortunately, he is not so lucky. So I asked to me to please watch the boys so I concentrate to get a few things done for workand this turned into a thing. He told me that I was being confrontational and making crazy accusations. Like bc I asked him to go sit with the boys I was saying he has not been spending time with them all, even after I told him that was mot my intentionbut it just seems like every time I speak to him he tells me Im being confrontational, creating a scene, etcmind a majority of our fights begin with me asking him to please just be in the same room the boys. RESENTMENT: I honestly think that due to his ego he holds so much resentment and hatred towards me for my profession. Hell constantly comment on what he perceives as my lack of work ethicAgain luckily my job grants a lot freedom in regards so just because he doesnt see me working at 3am or 4am after I put the boys down which means Ill sleep in that day he assume that I do nothing...its just offensive &amp; insulting especially since Ive put in a over a decade of work in my industry and been with the same company for the better part 10 yearswhile he has found it impossible to keep a job longer than 13 months at most since weve been together. I think a lot of it stems from him coming from a rather well-to-do family which afforded him opportunities that a less privileged person would not have squandered. And then he see me someone who did their fair share of partying in her younger dates (he says he always been straight-laced), was technically ward of state (but raised by grandparents), first one in my family to graduate high school, first to graduate college, and first one to not have to do menial labor to make a livingand he just cant reconcile how I coming from such a humble means can be more stable and successful than hecoming from such a good stock always finds himself such dire straits having to rely on the generosity of his parents. Maybe Im just being paranoid, idk. GASLIGHTING: He also tells his parents Im crazy/bi-polar. So previously I open up to that I was dealing with PPA (which I soon found out he told his parentssee prior posts for more info). So I decided to nip that in the bud and speak to his parents as address how the things they done/said affected me and even tho I doubt there was any malicious intent behind their actions I found it necessary to address my concerns and my PPA so they would be conscious of our future interactionsa conversation that I had to have ALONE (DH made himself not available)but now its come to my attention (via 1st therapy session) that he is using this as catalyst to portray me as crazy/bi-polar to his family. Which makes feel so betrayed to have your vulnerability weaponized is just horrible. DEAD BEDROOM: Hes just not that into me at allwe havent been intimate since the beginning of January and that seemed liked a chore for him. Its to the point where I feel like he got his kids so now theres no reason for him to have to sex with me. I know it sounds out there but a part me thinks that he got married and had kids to appease his parentsand now the boys are here Ive served my purpose for him and his family. DISRESPECT: He is always disrespecting my motherhood. If the house isnt spotless it because I want my children living in squalor. If I have to go to Target or the Grocery store it means Im running the streets because I want to get away from kidsI buy ANYTHING its Im wasting money that I should be giving himIf Im up all night with the boys and need a nap its all I do ALL DAY is sleep. If I ask him to just be in the same room with the boys beyond feedings and diaper changesits I dont want to take care of my children (mind you its usually when I need to get work stuff done). He obv knows that I suffered a miscarriage before the boys were conceived and if I ask him to watch them so I can do something he say something like IDK was had kids if you dont want to take care of themI think bc of the miscarriage that really stings. THREATS: He is always threathening me that he will leave me an make sure a never see the boys again. I just dont think he loves anymoreif he ever did at all. Ill admitted in the thick of PPA I was horrible, but after all Ive been thru with him stuck out I thought that would of afforded me some type of grace after being hospital bedrest, traumatic birth, nicu stays, &amp; all the other mind-fuckery that comes with being a FTM. But it appears I was horribly mistaken. If you made this far THANK YOUI just really needed to ventI mean I love him and I want our family to stay together but as each day passes so does my hope usGN"

In its clinical form, narcissism is a [personality disorder](URL According to the fifth edition of *The Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5), in order for an unusual [personality](URL to be regarded as disordered in the clinical sense, it must give rise to a pattern of thought and behavior that is so problematic that the afflicted person is unable to function in society. For example, they may be unable to follow rules or hold a job. In common parlance, narcissism doesnt refer to the clinical disorder. Rather, it depicts a troublesome personality that causes other people great distress yet doesnt significantly compromise the afflicted person's ability to function. Narcissism, in this ""subclinical"" sense, can be thought of as a personality disturbance (or distortion) as opposed to a *disorder*, that is, narcissism, in its subclinical manifestation, is a psychological condition that falls short of meeting the diagnostic criteria for the corresponding clinical personality disorder but which nonetheless can create havoc in interpersonal relationships. The narcissist's typical style of interaction tends to cause great distress to family members and friends and sometimes even strangers. But the narcissist is very often in denial about (or perhaps blissfully ignorant of) the suffering she causes others and the very fact that her personality is warped. One reason for this blindspot is that the narcissist's pattern of thought and behavior, which can elicit great distress and emotional hurt in others, doesn't seem to cause the narcissist any discomfort, not anything she can access or cognitively process anyway. Another reason behind the narcissist's typical lack of self-insight turns on the fact that the condition can emerge in two different forms: [grandiose and vulnerable narcissism](URL Grandiose narcissism is characterized by [extraversion](URL low [neuroticism](URL and overt expressions of feelings of superiority and entitlement, whereas vulnerable narcissism is marked by introspective self-absorbedness, high neuroticism, and alternating feelings of excessive pride and deep [shame](URL Source: Berit Brogaard, used with permission Grandiose narcissism is one of the traits in the dark triad of personality, the other two being [psychopathy](URL and [Machiavellianism](URL Vulnerable narcissism has found its way into a different (but related) triad of personality, the so-called vulnerable dark triad, which is the constellation of the three vulnerable dark personalities: vulnerable narcissism, secondary psychopathy, and [borderline personality](URL Vulnerable narcissism is far more subtle and harder to pin down than its grandiose counterpart. Yet it may be [the most common](URL of the two subtypes in younger generations (Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen alpha). Although vulnerable narcissism is hard to spot, due to its subtle and somewhat unfamiliar manifestation, it nonetheless is associated with its own [highly distinctive patterns of thought and behavior](URL Here are 6 of its most common characteristics. If most of them ring true with you, then you may have vulnerable [narcissistic](URL tendencies. **1. You have an introverted personality** If you are a vulnerable narcissist, you are just as convinced that you are above most others as your grandiose counterpart, but you have a much more introverted personality. According to the [Big Five](URL of personality, [introverts](URL tend to come across as unapproachable, unfriendly or cold, negative, unassertive, and as having a need for alone time. If you are a vulnerable narcissist, then you are far more likely to sit in the corner at the office party than being surrounded by people eager to hear your anecdotes. Indeed, you may be the exception to the proverb that no (wo)man is an island. **2. You have a neurotic personality** If you are a vulnerable narcissist, you are likely to be high in neuroticismanother dimension of personality on the Big Five model. Neuroticism is characterized by the following six facets: anxiousness/[panic](URL depressiveness, hostility, self-consciousness, immoderation, and vulnerability. If you are both high in neuroticism and self-centered, you are likely to worry a great deal about your perceived status: your youthful look, your [career](URL prospects, your savings, your relationship status, or anything else you take to matter to your perceived superior status. **3. We won't say it out loud, but (psst!) you thrive on** [**attention**](URL **and accolade.** You want to amount to something in the eyes of the world. You are therefore in constant search of ""natural"" opportunities for self-promotion. You are particularly eager to take on tasks that are bound to be noticed by others yet you do what you can to avoid agreeing to do things that tend to go unnoticed. If your completion of the attention-worthy task doesn't give you the accolade you were looking for, you will then go to great length to hint at (in roundabout ways) how hard you have been working or how much you have achieved, yet look unfazed and maybe even surprised when your colleagues finally acknowledge your ""hard work"" or ""significant achievements."" **4. You are prone to feelings of shame.** Your [self-image](URL is split into a positive self-image that is characterized by excessive pride and a negative self-image that is ridden with shame. This split makes you hypersensitive even to gentle feedback and constructive criticism. When receiving only positive feedback, you are able to keep the negative shame-filled self-image hidden from your own conscious mind. But when you perceive someone's feedback on your work as a criticism of you, your negative self-image pushes the image of pride off the stage, and this triggers intense feelings of self-disgust and self-blame, and inevitable shame. **5. You blame others for your mistakes** You rarely accept responsibility for your actions, because when things go wrong you tend to feel that it isn't your fault. Rather, other people or circumstances are to blame for your mishaps. If you break a promise to a friend, it's because your boss is too demanding of your time. If you consistently fail to show up on time for work, it's because your roommate takes over your joint bathroom for at least three hours and fifteen minutes each morning. On the rare occasion where you do accept blame for breaking promises or for being tardy at work, it's because you feel cornered. But your acceptance of blame in this scenario is completely void of any heart-felt [guilt](URL regret, or remorse. **6. You take but rarely give** You are always looking to receive more than you give. You may make more money than all of your family-members combined, yet crash on your kid sister's futon or live off of your grandparent's savings. You don't typically bother with the company of other people but on those rare occasions where you join your coworkers for a drink Friday after work, you don't ever really feel that it's your turn to buy a round, not even after your having happily accepted and gulped down three or four specialty cocktails, all paid for by your coworkerseven the intern and the receptionist chipped in. If against all odds, you do decide to reciprocate, it's probably because you think that doing so could benefit you in the long run."

I held on to the trauma bond, believing this was my twin flame the push and pull of our love was a challenge we had to overcome. It's been three months I've on and off practiced no contact. I wanted closure, we all deserve closure. But none of us will get it if we are dealing with a true narcissist. So he's messaged me here and there telling me he feels terrible for what he did. Telling me he could've done 100 things better, tells me he's terrified of attachment, the whole 9 yards to make me feel like he was actually holding himself accountable. I've been asking for us to talk in person for months and he never tells me know he leaves the door open and gives me the silent treatment so I really have to suffer in agony. So here's the part where you learn from my mistake. I showed up to his apartment, his friend let me in the house and we had an amazing conversation I was sitting there waiting for him to come home. This might make me look crazy but he told me we were gonna talk today but ignored me all day long, he lives very close too so it's not out of my way. Well he showed up with the girl he cheated on me with, the girl he swore he had nothing to do with. That stung but hey I kind of expected it. Well here it goes he denied ever talking to me he pushed me out of his house, he yelled at me told me I was crazy. Denied ever telling me he was going to talk to me. Denied it all made me look so mentally insane in front of his friends dragged me out of the house told me he did talk to me. He literally said stop thinking so highly of yourself you aren't shit. This might not happen to you, but this is a lesson on closure. You'll never get it from a narcissist. Let them go. Fuck them. Heal your own heart cause they have no remorse in their body for the pain and agony they cause you."
27,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"How narcissists work, by u/nakosmog",1,gbk7il,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/gbk7il/how_narcissists_work_by_unakosmog/,2020-05-02 01:29:08,"*This is simply a reformatted essay from u/nakosmog... I hope it helps. This is a good read, in my opinion!* ... # Two types of narcissists - The narcissist that everyone knows is the classic one, the one easy to spot because he is extrovert, he is a centralist, he loves to be at the centre of the scene, he needs constant admiration and wants to be adored, so he is a blatant theatrical artist, he wants to assert himself at all costs, and this is called narcissist overt. - In addition to the narcissist overt there is another kind of narcissist, called covert, who is more introverted, so he acts silently in the shadows and therefore is difficult to spot and is a person who apparently seems normal and quite charming, he can be funny, usually he is a well-behaved person, even affectionate, but he hides a dark side, he hides an intimidating and unbearable aspect: the so-called cold side. # Covert Usually this narcissist covert is a bit of a snob, he gives himself airs, he poses, he gives himself importance. You know those people who have inherited a lot of money but act as if they have earned it and deserved it? Well, it's a bit like that and woe betide him to point it out, those who don't recognize his status are immediately rejected and suffer the treatment of silence. In general all narcissists believe they are special, they feel unique, so covert narcissists don't really seek admiration in a striking way but they demand it in a veiled way and if they don't get it they become aggressive by adopting a rather passive way, for example sulking. The covert narcissist expects others to satisfy his desires, not only that, but he exploits others to get what he wants, only that he appears calm and therefore most people do not suspect that they will be mistreated in the end. Another characteristic of the covert narcissist is that he poses as a victim. While the overt narcissist has a high self-esteem, the covert narcissist, feeling like a victim, constantly rumbles and shows a low self-esteem that needs a grandiose self to be compensated, that is, a form of idealization of oneself, so it happens that all the devaluing emotions are projected outside, therefore on others. Well, therefore, while the extrovert narcissist, that is the overt one, is an exhibitionist, the covert narcissist is a shy one, we said that he is introverted and one who is exposed to feelings of humiliation of rejection, the covert is very afraid of rejection. In reality, both narcissists, both the overt and the covert narcissists, show problems related to the sphere of self-esteem, but the overt faces it believing to be superior and thinking that everything is due to him, while the covert is ashamed of his ambitions and avoids social relationships for fear of being rejected. # Overt narcissist So the narcissist overt shows a rather confident behavior and has also reduced levels of anxiety in social relationships, then also a contemptuous and superior attitude, is obsessed with success, pretends to dominate others and has no empathy, his are superficial and dry social relationships. The narcissist covert instead is rather frightened and anxious, his feelings of grandeur are present but are disguised by shyness, so he appears rather modest, to the point of looking depressed. # Overts are grandiose and arrogant, while coverts are insecure and shy. Where the narcissist overt has thoughts of superiority and control over others, the narcissist covert manifests emotions such as shame, anger, and is plagued by thoughts of failure, but often behind the mask of the refined intellectual or non-conformist artist, or even the good guy with noble principles, hides a personality that establishes relationships marked by exploitation. Coverts tend to be idealists and seem apparently disinterested in success, but in reality they cultivate secret fantasies of glory and fame. From the very first encounters with the narcissistic covert typically creates an atmosphere of emotional closeness of life, because the covert opens up to the other, but at the same time presents itself as an unfortunate and suffering person with a troubled life and past. # The covert is a victim The covert is described as a person traumatized by the memory of a relationship that ended badly with a partner because of whom, years later, he is unable to engage in a new relationship, this is a classic covert, which will be described as a romantic, sensitive, even too good person, who has had the misfortune to run into terrible companions. Victimism is the dominant note in these stories and the failure of the relationship is always attributed to the ex, who is described as unstable and crazy. Here again we can see how narcissistic grandiosity is masked by a resigned and vulnerable facade, and it happens that many people become soft when a man or woman on a first date talks about their difficult life, or talks about grief. But, it is never a good sign when grief is shown so soon, people who have terrible stories behind them usually need time to open up, because they are ashamed, but covert narcissists are keen to present themselves as very suffering people, identifying with their sad story which becomes a business card to show to others. The covert feels like a victim and is convinced that everything is more difficult for him, while the others are lucky and happy, so he thinks he is entitled to a favorable treatment, and here it happens that if the partner has the nature of a red cross nurse, will be flattered by these confidences and will think that the covert can change. # resistance to changing behavior This is a mistake, because in reality the narcissist, with his behavior is like saying ""I'm like this, if you're with me you have to understand it and accept it without pretending to change me"". # Lack of empathy Among other things, the narcissist covert presents himself as a sensitive person and is capable, especially at the beginning, of a series of niceties, of attention that give the impression of a deep interest towards the partner, but in fact the covert is incapable of empathy and focused on his needs, so he makes the partner feel guilty. Typically it happens that the covert, in front of the partner's requests, puts up a wall saying ""with all the problems I have in this period I can't be bothered, my life is already a nightmare and if you start giving me more problems, I'll leave you"". At this point it happens that she or he mortifies themselves thinking they're too demanding and let it go, so even if he doesn't answer the messages ""maybe he's busy"", if he cancels appointments at the last minute ""maybe next time"" and so on. # Unbalanced relationships Many people end up accepting a relationship that is unbalanced, a relationship with a man or a woman who always asks a lot but for very little, on the other hand it is also true that the covert tends to choose companions whose devotion is taken for granted. The covert is one who tends to take more than give, in fact the partner complains about his avarice, which also reflects a greed of feelings, as well as a real avarice, and it can also happen that the covert lends some money that then punctually does not return and even gets kept by the partner. # Fear if vulnerability Another characteristic of the covert is that it is not very interested in sex, it has one characteristic: the absence of desire. Many coverts don't seem to be interested in sex, they give themselves to their partner as if they were doing them a favor, saying things like ""always think about those things"" and so on. This is because they are not in touch with their drive, because they live as dangerous the loss of control that there is in the sexual act, which involves a surrender to the other, but for them letting go of intimacy means on an unconscious level to be at the mercy of the power of their woman or man and this is the reason why many narcissists prefer a solitary sexuality. # Devaluation of others Therefore, the devaluation of the partner is always present, especially when the narcissist feels too dependent, needy and the devaluation therefore represents an attempt to re-establish power in the couple, the best clue that one is experiencing a relationship with a person who has such characteristics is to feel vampired, i.e. sad, in a bad mood, in checkmate, and so without realizing it, people involved in a relationship with a man or woman with this character structure end up dying out, or they get fat, neglect their well-being and stop making personal plans to take care of themselves. #Emptiness Despite this, the narcissist covert lives a constant sense of emptiness, alternating with brief moments of fullness, the emptiness he feels comes from the incessant concern for his status, he worries about the power he would like to acquire and worries about how to maintain it, but feels a sense of emptiness, and then constantly seeks the approval of others, but suffers from the criticism he receives, which he does not accept because of his great sensitivity. # In essence he lives constantly seeking the approval of others because he would like to be recognized as a special being. For the covert narcissist, criticism is worse than poison, even if on the outside he appears as a fascinating, brilliant, affectionate, determined person, and it is precisely this passion for beauty or luxury that often leads him to be a bit snobbish. To be snobbish for him is to flaunt refinement, criticizing, however, those who do not think like him, this is a real defense that serves to keep away from too deep relationships, as they would not have the right safety distance, and the covert does not want the emotional involvement because it would destabilize him, but at the same time without the others inside him there is only emptiness, an emptiness that fills with these problematic relationships. Typically when coverts are rejected or treated with indifference they assume passive-aggressive behaviors, their tolerance decays, plummets and first they become melancholic and then they become inflexible, they become intransigent and then they become unbearable, so they end up taking revenge, this is one of their most successful tactics. # Thoughts?"

And I want to know why. It's not that I'm ignorant or don't see the signs. My heart is drawn to certain types... and then each time I watch my heart die... Is it something about their puppy dog eyes, and false vulnerability that makes us feel drawn to them? Is it something about their domineering style that makes us want to lay with them? I could go years being single in between each one, but... I always end up with another one... The last one matched me with is vulnerable story of abuse. He claimed he was controlled, manipulated, and lied to... I was as well, with my last narcissist... and so I related to him on this. I didn't realize he was PROJECTING himself. I ignored red flags that were right in front of my eyes... because I hadn't felt love in such a long time.. But now I wonder what this addiction is... I don't want to fall for another one of them. This last one.. he was subtle. Covert. And after having a child with him... I walked away from the relationship. He's more hateful and ignorant than any of the others I dated before.... Why? I just want peace. I want happiness and love for me and my son.. and this man is hellbent on destroying this for us... because he's ""the victim"".. He's always been ""the victim of women trying to keep his children from him""... While I dated him, he had visitation with his two daughters, three weekends a month. But that wasn't enough. He had to have full custody. He said she was crazy. He said she was abusive. He said I had to help him save them from her. But I WOKE UP... after becoming a mother myself. He was hardly a parent to them... Just the weekend fun dad with no rules.... no boundaries... no limits... They ruled the house and I couldn't imagine living with it, giving up my son for good to let his oldest (13yrF) play mommy because that was her favorite game, while she walked around topless, and at night would ask her daddy if she had a sexy ass, and then he ACCUSED ME of saying he wanted to have sex with her when I told him that at her age certain things were inappropriate. I got out... but.. now he's trying to take my son from me. The 2nd narcissist I dated tried so hard to get me pregnant, but this one.. he said "" I regret it"" in the hospital the day he was born... Because I was upset that he didn't want to sign the birth certificate, as he was afraid the hospital would foot him with the bill. The subtle one was far worse.. then the overt... That's all I want to say. Even the asshole who beat the shit out of me still wished me well,... but this last one.. the subtle one.. he told me I deserved to end up with a drug addict who would treat me like dogshit. How many of you out there have a SERIES of these kinds of relationships? Do we just label every asshole in this category? Is it all about learning from our pasts, and repeating history in a sense.. until we finally understand?"
29,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,One way to look at it,1,ffh09b,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/ffh09b/one_way_to_look_at_it/,2020-03-09 05:50:56,"I've been talking with my brother, who is a licensed psychiatrist, about my Nex a lot ever since shit hit the fan back in December. Yesterday he offered me a new perspective on those with NPD: ""You have to stop looking at him as someone who had a real romantic interest in you that went south. He's mentally incapable of feeling that way about someone. Instead, treat him like a thief. His intentions were bad from the start, and seeing your emotions and vulnerability from the beginning was like a thief discovering your hidden wealth. Unfortunately it did nothing but paint you and your ""cash safe"" as a good target. It will not be any different for the next person he's with, because he's not out there trying to find a ""better partner"" who he connects better with. A stack of $100 bills in one safe is exactly the same as the stack in the next. Doesn't matter who's safe it is, as long as he has the combination. He emptied yours, and you finally came home and discovered the mess. And since a skilled thief knows they shouldn't rob the same house twice, he bolted out the backdoor and is now sneaking into the next one down the street."" And even though this was technically stuff I already knew, I think the visual will help me remind myself going forward that it had nothing to do with me personally, and no matter what we think, we can't change them. No matter how happy they may seem in their new lives, they are repeating the cycle behind the scenes. I hope this helps others heal."

It was the final piece I needed to walk away, and I was overjoyed. Now all of my things are there, and the divorce conversation has been had. We're done. At first, I thought I would feel relief, but I feel into a deep, profound sadness and guilt. I thought he would rage at me, or blame all of it on me, or just acknowledge my little speech with a curt *okay, see ya.* He didn't do any of that. He was shocked and pained. In the moment I said ""divorce,"" I watched realizationrealization of every mistake he had made, every way he made me feel less-thanflood into his face. I can't forget that expression. I can't forget his tears; or the full, detailed, and accurate blame he laid on himself; or his pleading; or how he *finally* saw me in that moment. I can't shake the look he had. That he responded in such a vulnerable, human way made me second-guess myself. I felt like maybe I have just been so delicate and sensitive that the things that hurt me would never have even registered for someone more resilient and forgiving. Maybe all of the usual, normal, to-be-expected offenses between two people grew to ridiculous proportions for me. Maybe his grief and vulnerability proved he was not the narc I thought he was. I felt weak and guilty and sad. But now, with a few days' distance, I'm starting to feel hopeful. I've been unable to avoid him, but despite his pleading, I've been able to stay firm. It's almost like an out-of-body experience to watch myself have the strength to say, ""I know this is difficult, but I won't be changing my mind. No, I won't go to counseling. No, I won't try to talk this out."" My therapist is helping me realize I need to be wary of his pleading and vulnerability. Because that, too, could be a manipulation. Even if this is sincere, I was treated too badly for too long. Three different therapists have told me that I was in a DV relationship with a narcissist. I have the information I needed to make the decision I did. I'll admit that it felt good to get what I didn't dare hope fora full, sincere apology taking accountability for every way he had ever belittled, criticized, exploited, and diminished me; somebody I once loved fighting for me. But none of that feels as good as saving myself."
31,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,They want you to be nothing but a pawn in their game,1,ftq9tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/ftq9tp/they_want_you_to_be_nothing_but_a_pawn_in_their/,2020-04-03 04:15:43,"Narcissists don't care about you, and the good qualities and abilities that you have are only a source of envy for them. So, their whole modus operandi is to whittle you down until you no longer exist for yourself and you only exist for them, or only exist insofar as they *allow* you to exist. They accomplish this by pretending to be interested in you. They might flatter you, lovebomb you, or generally make you feel like you're someone special in their eyes. While they do recognize your good qualities and abilities, they will never be content with allowing you to have those things and to continue on in life as the person that you are. Instead, they want to get close to you so that they can either steal these things from you, or destroy you so that you don't have these things or can't be these things anymore. They view you with malice, with burning hatred, because how dare you attempt to be greater than them? How dare you think that you actually matter? In this way, they feel justified in destroying you. You being you is a direct affront to their ego and they do not feel any remorse in taking you down. They are looking for any vulnerability within you that they can capitalize on. Anything where they can say, ""See? You're not as great as you think you are."" They work very, very hard to ""prove"" this to you, it's like a victory to them. And, if they can't find any vulnerabilities, they will *create* vulnerabilities within you by orchestrating a situation to where you're backed into a corner. One of their favorite ways to achieve this is by treating you like you're weak just because you have feelings and a conscience. You have gone into the interaction with the narcissist completely unaware that they are competing with you in this way, so you don't think to keep your guard up. At the end of the day, narcissists really do think that they're the kings and queens of the world. And they desperately want and need you to be nothing but a pawn in their game. So, you always have to remember that, no matter what they say or do, this is really what they're after. Whatever they can do to get you to be in your ""rightful place"", beneath their feet."

Because I have flexibility with my job, I have been doing all the travelling back and forth, but it's been taking a toll on me. I feel like I have done a lot for my boyfriend and this relationship. His effort however... Is lacking. Yet he is needy. When it comes to sex, it's literally all he wants, multiple times a day, and it's never rly enough. I've had a few breaking points where I would tell him pressuring me into it is not okay, I only need to say no once. And yet I'm left feeling like I'm not doing enough, even if we fuck everyday. He stonewalls when I talk to him in person (about any issue), but he will fully act like I did not just have a serious conversation and act all affectionate without resolving things. Now that we are apart for a few days, I brought this up again over text (he was pressuring me for sex the other night) so he has time to write a response. But now, he is fully ignoring me. I asked him why he continues to pressure me even when I've repeatedly told him not to, I even told him how him pressuring me doesn't make me horny at all, and that I think he just wants me for sex. Right now I'm at the point where Im not even upset he's ignoring me because I don't feel he is going to apologize or even acknowledge this. I can't say if he is a full blown narcissist but a lot of symptoms are present (boundary issues, only thinks of his needs, doesn't trust anyone, doesn't have friends, paranoid, avoids vulnerability, love bombing, charming in the beginning) I acknowledge that I have codependency issues and that's why I've stuck around this long. But now I can accept that this won't work out and I need to end it soon. I just don't know how since he is ignoring me and has the spare keys to my place. I won't be back until a few days later. I don't want to escalate this situation since I want my keys back..."

CW: domestic violence, abuse, violence, sexual assault, racism, substance abuse, mental illness, suicide attempt mention (the gang's all here) I am 19F, living at home with NDad &amp; codependent mother. Background: both of my parents are alcoholics. They drink beer daily; I've been catching them drinking liquor at work, they also drink and drive; lots of open container evidence. I have no idea how they're not dead yet, and this has been going on as long as I can remember. They are both going down fast. NDad got a DUI recently. I have witnessed domestic violence between my parents as well as my NDad attacking me on multiple occasions, as well as 2/3 of my siblings. I have witnessed my dad knocking out my mother as young as 6 years old. This has happened a handful of times, but not recently. My father is very controlling towards my mother. If she wanted to leave, she couldn't. She is dependent on him financially, she does not have separate money. Everything is in his name: cars, the house. One occasion she threatened to leave, and from my bedroom window I saw my dad mess around in the hood of her car, either fucking with spark plugs or disconnecting the battery. They also feed each other's alcoholism. My dad has done countless violent things to me and my siblings. He has hit me and my siblings, attacked us to the ground, dragged us down stairs, provoked us to fight each other, threatened to beat our asses, and once broke my brother's collarbone by pushing him over a baby gate. He will actually scream over the smallest things that upset him. I have been called every name in the book: bitch, whore, the c-word, slut, idiot, arrogant, freeloader, ignorant, worthless, untalented. I have a 9 year old sister as well, who he has called the c-word(?!) and hit belts against furniture to manipulate her into fear. He is racist and sexist. When I lost my virginity years ago, I told my mother and was shamed about it; she told my father, he did not speak to me or look me in the eye for over a month.(a couple Fourth of July's ago, my uncle, NDads brother, smacked and groped my ass. I told my mom, and she said ""Oh, he didn't mean it like that.) My femininity was stripped from me as a child, and my dad tried to raise me as a boy basically, shaming me on my vulnerability and girliness. He doesn't do shit around the house because it's women's work. My boyfriend is a Latino from South America, and last Thanksgiving he made racially charged remarks towards him. He will frequently spit racist slurs; once heard him say whites are superior. He is also extremely territorial. If anyone comes into the kitchen while he's there alone, you get an angry sigh, or an ""oh my fucking god."" Walking on fucking eggshells. I have anxiety just being in his presence, and I completely dissociate. I basically stay in my room all day. I can only be out comfortably when I'm home alone. He also threatened to kill himself in front of me once, and after conflicts, I am so scared to go down in the basement and find him hanging or something. Not only is my dad a piece of shit, I am sure he is a narcissist. My sister (18, moved out about a year ago and is doing wonderfully) and I have been pitted against each other multiple times. Outside of the house, he is a completely different person. On the outside, we are a perfect family, his children are diligent and talented. He will twist arguments back on me, calling me names. Actually, I can't even get a word in edgewise. The conversation is about him, and anything I contribute is quickly dismissed with a ""mm, okay."" Or I am blatantly interrupted. I am always doing something wrong, or am I crazy. Even me telling him that I love him before, he dismisses it and doesn't say it back. He tries to take away my power in the smallest ways. For example, apparently it's bogus for me to shower everyday, even though it's sanitary and is a key factor in improving my headspace (I've voiced this multiple times). He throws a goddamn fit when I turn the water on. When I try to voice my concerns and confront his behavior, he mocks me for "" 'speaking my truth' like a millennial."" Lmfao. He does not listen. He is always correct. My dad also mocked me, because I had a panic attack and my friend dropped me off at the ER recently. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder/Generalized Anxiety at 14 and the past 6 months have been very hard for me mentally. I'm on medication but I was also on the depo shot which completely wreaked havoc on my mental health. It's very hard to live here. The house is always disgusting. My parents smoke cigarettes in the house. My mother is also depressed and unmotivated, getting drunk nightly, staying in her room, feigning happiness, sometimes taking 3 naps a day. I know that she feels ugly, unwanted, and worthless. It's very hard to heal in such an unsupportive and unhealthy environment. My parents say I can always come back. That they will always be there for me. But they kicked me out with nowhere to go the other night for smoking pot for my anxiety. I called him out on their hypocritical behavior, and told them that I was trying to help myself, but I get the ""my house, my rules."" I'm not even allowed to have a lock on my door, so people bust in when they please. A lot of my childhood was spent in isolation. After the recession, my dad lost his job and we were right above the poverty line, we lived in the middle of nowhere and I was homeschooled. My parents were drinking themselves to sleep every night, fighting and getting violent. I believe a lot of my mental illness stems from that. Recently, there's been a scandal. My dad was emotionally cheating on my mom with some random bitch on the internet that he's never met. Going through his phone, I saw him talking to someone about struggling to choose a stranger over his wife of 20 years &amp; 4 kids. Wanting to just pack up and leave for Florida. Apparently they were going to spend a weekend together, and he told my mom he was going to some game. That ended up not happening because this woman ""did not want to put the 9 year old in the middle of it."" I took pictures and showed my mom. That did nothing but cause a huge fight. ""He chose to stay."" And I genuinely hate him for that. If he even thought of leaving, he should've left. Also, my little sis had a school talent show the other day. Boyfriend &amp; I went. When she got upstage to sing, she forgot the words from stage fright and closed the curtain on her. I've never felt that kind of pain for someone before and it genuinely made me cry. While waiting for her second chance (she killed it the second time!) we all went to the side of the stage to comfort her and build her up. My dad had to walk away to LAUGH about her stagefright, trying to change the subject to him and his prior stage experiences. I told him to stop, and it wasn't about him. He got angry. Boyfriend said he wanted to wipe that stupid smirk of NDad's face with his fist. I confided in my aunt who lives states away, and she told me that my dad is a sick individual and she wishes my mom should have left him years ago. I'm extremely worried about my mom. I have a very good feeling that they will both be dead within 10 years, and I am going to have to raise my little sister. Boyfriend, other sister, and I have already started to hash out plans. I am just at a complete loss of what to do or how to deal. It's 5:30 in the morning and I can't sleep because it's completely racking my brain. I don't believe that I love my dad anymore. I do have plans to cut him out of my life. I don't have plans to invite him to my wedding. I don't even think I could trust my future babies at my house, where my parents drink and smoke cigarettes inside. It's so hard. I've realized that I have a lot of parental wounds, and I am actually jealous of the relationship my boyfriend has with his parents. I know that I need to run far, far away from my dad. I am terrified for my sister, but I can't pour from an empty cup.

I realized that other people (non narc) don't react to me like my narcs did and becouse I had such a long relationship with my narcs (mom + ex best friend) i thought it was normal to be treated the way i was treated and to have my vaulrnabilities used against me if i showed any ""weakness"" But to my surprise,other people did not do that to me. I slowly realized that relationships doesn't have to be that complicated. I don't need to walk on eggshells I don't need to over explain myself I don't need to put their feelings before mine to the point where i lose track of my emotional self and operate as their armor against life's cruelty since they are always the victim. To be loved,reapected,understood,heared I don't have to try so hard to make it work. To create scenarios and to make excuses for their actions without them saying a word to explain themselves. To allow myself to be confused by their manipulation and then question my own sanity and if i missed something. What's yours?"
35,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Does my bad self esteem reach narcissistic levels here?,1,f57pb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/f57pb4/does_my_bad_self_esteem_reach_narcissistic_levels/,2020-02-17 22:54:33,"Some self doubt going on here, reflected on some bad relationships from the past, one longer one and some more short-time meetings with bad commentary. I know already my self esteem is a problem but I've been trying to be honest about it towards others instead of denying it - kinda courage in vulnerability, although I fear it would be abused by more manipulative and selfish people as well. Mostly I desire equal relationships, casual and deeper with others. However due to my past, always sort of having to be meek and ""fit in"" or someone will start bullying me, I kind of started feeling imprisoned into passive/submissive role in interpersonal relationships. I tried my best to maintain some friendships I wanted to remain as mutually good and loyal, but my friends changed, eventually discarded me for ""better friends"" they had grown closer to. I had hard time accepting it after investing a lot time and energy in the friendships.. and even tried to correct my behavior into whatever they desired because they often just discarded me when I started being a ""whole person"" or showed any of my flaws or personal wishes. Then came the phase of me being bullied by someone whom I suspect being a narcissist, some power struggles between us in private and all that typical stuff. After I cut off the narc and everyone who could act as a man in middle in their attempts to hoover, my resentment for all past things surfaced in more uncontrollable way. I have been aware of this before but controlled it better, sort of ""use this energy constructively""/""trust you'll have your moments too"" mindset... and this is where the casual commentary comes in. I started to wish I could experience the roles different way, for the sake of knowing how it feels, but refrain from acting on it because I know it's ""evil behavior"", so to speak.. socially not acceptable and would hurt people. I wished, and said it to out loud to few half strangers (who had better social success and more long term friendships regardless of their flaws) that I wish I could even once or twice have people submit to my will and stay with me like dogs in the leash. Others (mostly narcs and charming people) are allowed to have those kinds of experiences and they aren't punished for it (although they may be scolded and threatened) so why not I? I can't really fake good self esteem for long, even if it passed, I lose interest in faking it and the whole show, before I even get to experience how it feels. Guess what I also wish is the ability to control others to be more predictable and reliable. I'm sick of wasting social energy and time on people who won't return it in long term, although it's not always easy to discern who will ""give something in return"". And I'm tired of all useless unconditionality in all interaction, ""or else you're a narcissist"". Sometimes I want others would just pick me to be their best friend or just have a social circle that for once danced around me and put me on pedestial in more long term. I want to know how it feels, for real.. without the gloom and doom it's just some social love bombing to lure me into some narcissistic relationship where I'd have to submit to their will again. These half strangers did scold me for getting angry like that. Obviously I was frustrated and my demonstration of it, was (mostly) uncalled for. What triggered it was the fact that they had social success while I didn't, and these same people had showed some behavior (week ago from this) that they wanted to boost their success at my expense. Draw attention on them when it was my turn to get some, in a social situation, while they could've had every opportunity to get that attention on them (from other people and myself) in 10 or 20 minutes or so. Anyway, is this still normal behavior for a person with bad self esteem and capacity of both good and bad, but still not on narcissistic levels, or should I be worried I'm unawarely a narc?"

We've kept it mostly cordial, with the occasional temper tantrum that I just ignored until he went away for a while. You can check my post history if you're interested, but you know how it goes. I have a hard time cutting people out. Yes, even this guy who put me through literal hell, but I'm working on that. I've started to date again and I think he's finally doing the same. (He's an outlier with that one- lots of emotional cheating/flirting, zero follow through because he's ""picky"" and finds every woman he meets ""not like her profile."") I feel like it's time to block him and go NC entirely because: 1.) I want to post freely about my life (something I couldn't do with him without being mocked or yelled at because OF COURSE it had to secretly be about him) and I don't need him fucking blowing up at me. Last summer, I posted a silly picture of me, quoting a joke my friend made about making it a Tinder profile pic, which I did not have. The next day, he was coldly demanding money I owed him (that he previously refused to let me pay back) and sent me a tirade of insults for a week, followed by two weeks of silence and a week of apologizing and wanting to get back together. I don't need a repeat of this. 2.) Frankly, I don't want to see that shit on his end either. I don't want him back, but it's still a healing process. Now that I suspect he's dating again, I've been checking his social like a mofo and it's setting me back. I don't want to experience anything other than indifference to him. Any experiences/advice you guy can share with how they reacted to blocking? Do I tell him I'm doing it and why? Normally I wouldn't, but the one time I did it last summer during a ""discard"" when we weren't even together, he was very crafty at getting around it (flying monkeys, ""deactivated"" accounts he used to check on me, texting me from his work phone, *posting on my company's social media*), and that's when the grey-rocking started. I can't be private because I'm a performer so I need social media to promote myself. I know they're in their own reality so it's hard to say what to expect, but I'd like to be as prepared as possible. I've made a ton of progress and I don't want my head getting twisted up like a pretzel. I DON'T WANT A PRETZEL IN MY HEAD. Thanks for all your continued honestly, vulnerability and openness.

Really get to know the person you're dating. Don't get into a relationship in a month or two. If you're getting to know someone, male or female, try to be friends first before starting a long-term relationship, or thinking about moving in together. Get to know their reputation, their past, pay attention how they speak about previous partners and why their relationships ended, try to geth both sides of the story, their negative qualities, their environment; everything. Most importantly, trust - please - trust your gut: if something feels or looks iffy, _trust that impression._ Don't make significant compromises in a short time span: don't move in together, be exclusive, get in a relationship, or get married, compromise, have a child, unprotected sex, or get a pet, (or whatever significant potentially life-changing circumstance) before truly _getting to know them and feel sure_. Most people - in general - will rarely show you their bad side in the first months, or without living with them. Abusers don't abuse you straight away. Abusers aren't mean straight away. A person who love-bombs you and puts you on a pedestal doesn't see you as who you really are, and they _will eventually end up pushing you from that high place_. Love grows over time: with shared experiences, vulnerability involved, seeing them realistically; after seeing the person how it is and accepting them as who they are. Nobody can sincerely love you in a month or two. It takes TIME. Don't accept or give in to any pressure to push things further than what you'd want fast. You can be infatuated or elated over a budding relationship - yes - but it takes way more than this to say you love a person. Learn self-control, _and even if every fiber of your being wants to be with this person in a committed relationship, be wise: if this person is the right one for you, male or female, they will wait._ Take care."

And that bothers me. That I let myself be taken advantage of in this terrible way by her, even without any love bombing. I understand those who stay because they hold on to the initial feelings of feeling loved, but for me there wasn't even that. So I wonder why I stayed and what the fact that I stayed so long, says about me. I guess as a lonely, nerdy, gay, butch woman, finding someone who was somewhat interested in me itself was a big deal. But to be honest, I actually saw through her rants and arrogance and anger was in fact this deep seated vulnerability. And I wanted to help her with that. I thought that by loving her, showing her unconditional love I could help her. She took each of my insecurities -- about my body, about my lack of experience with sex, about my nerdiness, and threw it back at me. She took the things that I confided in her -- about my struggles with anxiety, and attacked me with it. I was ""too anxious"" for getting worried about her health, I was always ""too this"" or ""not enough that"". It's been a long road to recovery for me. And I still feel a lot of shame about being hurt this way by her, without receiving anything positive during the whole year I was with her. Ugghh it feels so shitty."

Literally, when someone mistreats me I feel *more* beholden to them, like it's my responsibility to help them learn how *not* to be that way. I suppose it's compassion that hooks me. A sense of, look at this person, they're suffering. They're not doing what they should be doing. I need to help them. I need to show them a different way. But why do I take that upon myself? When someone mistreats me, I need to draw boundaries, not obliterate my boundaries and jump in to save that person. I firmly believe that this has caused me to get hurt and taken advantage of countless times, because I approach these people instead of getting away from them. It's almost like...no matter how awful a person is, I can't stand to watch someone fall flat on their face. I want to help. I want to ""teach"".

40,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Narcissist Friend?,1,f9okkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/f9okkv/narcissist_friend/,2020-02-26 16:45:20,"Friends are narcissists too. Right? No one talks about abuse from friends! Is this narcissism??! I dont see many posts on here about abuse from friendships, which is why I question my situation frequently- its so frustrating. I am 23F in college- We had been best friends since high school. I transferred to a new university that she was going to and we decided to live together. I feel like that was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. We lived together for 2 years. I cut contact with her last summer after almost a year of misery- it got so bad that I had to get on medication and my parents made me see a therapist- I had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, even though I had never ever had any issues with mood swings before in my life, nor do I have any family members with the same diagnosis. All of that misery and mood swings came to a halt once I cut contact and moved out. She is extremely charming, smart, funny, and gorgeous. The attention she got was unlike anything Id see before. When we moved in together everything was great. We did everything together. Quickly we became the two best friends that was never seen without each other- her influence made me feel really special. Especially when shed compliment me! I quickly changed- she always looked like a Barbie doll, so I put a lot of extra effort into how I looked to keep up. She was always cheating on her boyfriend at the time, and started sleeping with her professor. And then she started sleeping with one of our good friends- I liked all of them but I lied to them so much for her, which made me feel so shitty. I would say her abuse was her simply not giving a shit. She was so calculated that some of the things she did was seemingly so trivial. For example, she got upset at me for wearing the same style of eyelash as she did, so I stopped and found my own style (sounds so shallow, right?). Then SHE started wearing my style, and when I called her out on it, shed make fun of me. It was always stupid stupid stupid shit like this, which was so convenient for her- because anytime Id react, shed always respond with how trivial it was, OR shed say something so humorously distracting that I just blew it off. Around 6-8 months of living together I was starting to experience some depression. She could see that I was having mood swings- one night I was in her room and she said something that was passive and teasing which instantly changed my mood. She saw and said aww are you gonna go slit your wrist? WTF. And you know whats crazy? Even though I remember her saying it, I question if she even did say it at all, because its so horrible- but yet she was so charming and funny and I wanted nothing more than her friendship and validation- how could she say something so crazy? She apologized after I left the room and cried. We were fine after that. But still to this day I wonder if I dreamt that up even though I have the memory. You know? Thats weirdest part of it all. I question my memory. Simply being around her too long was taking a toll on me. Her world was filled with glamour, laughter, deceit, and greed. She was too smart to do anything super direct to me. It was all very weird and passive. One night I was in her room, we were taking about what kind of gay man wed be if we were born men (so dumb). She said shed be a drag queen, I said I would too. Then she said no you wouldnt be. Youd be a sad little boy because of your anxiety WTF? So weird. I left crying- at that point I was so sensitive to EVERYTHING. That day her and the professor boyfriend said I needed to get on meds. Also, the professor boyfriend owns a lot of property on the side- he makes a lot of money. She saw that and ran with it- he paid her half of the rent, along with utilities, furniture, and WiFi. She had him wrapped around her finger. So much that he got her a boob job, trip to Jamaica, lip injections, clothes galore, a DOG, you name it. Hed call me all the time to vent (he was super submissive). I lied to him a lot for her. It made me feel so guilty that I couldnt sleep at night. Everything was always about her. Then I got a boyfriend. He really helped me in my worst moments. My parents starting asking me if she had anything to do with my mood swings and depression. Every time Theyd ask I would get so angry and defend her every time. It was always how dare you even suggest that, shes my best friend. Looking back, I swear I was conditioned to react this way to people when theyd challenge me about her. She was so hypercritical of everything, always made weird comments that left me confused and upset- like digs at some of the things that I like, or my personality traits. Anytime shed come home Id feel a lot of dread. But at the same time, she was so charming and funny that it made everything confusing. I loved and hated her company. Anytime Id confront her about hurting my feelings, shed laugh at me. When I asked why she was laughing her bullshit excuse was I laugh when Im uncomfortable, Im sorry. I stopped confronting her after multiple tries. She HATED my boyfriend. She told me after meeting him that her mom said Itd be a real shame if they were to marry and shed always make these weird ominous comments I worry that youll get pregnant or I feel like your chances of getting pregnant is greater than mine because Ive been on birth control longer WTF?!!!? My paranoia from fear of pregnancy kinda ruined my sex life at one point. Anytime when I would talk happily about him, shed make these faces and comments like she felt embarrassed for me for ever liking someone so pitiful. That made me feel awful- and I questioned my relationship with my boyfriend from all of that bullshit I was buying into. Then my boyfriend finally said, your friend is a piece of shit, and shes the reason why youre so miserable and it took me a while to see it, but he was right. I stopped talking about my boyfriend to her. She noticed immediately. She said why dont you ever talk about your boyfriend anymore? And I said because you dont like him and she said I dont NOT like him and then I said you told me that your mother said itd be a shame if I were to marry him and she responded with my mom never said that. Thats when I decided that it wasnt going to work. She flat out lied. A couple days later she found out I didnt tell her about me meeting my boyfriends parents. She stopped talking to me for about a month, and then asked to talk so she could get some things off my chest. I said no, Im good. And the next day, all of the furniture in the living room was gone, her boyfriend took away the WiFi, and I was dumped with the utility bill. She stayed at her boyfriends house during most of this. I asked to meet up to work things out- at that point I was like fuck it! Lets make up so I can squeeze as much money as I can out of her for the utility bill. We made up and then her professor boyfriend chewed me out for ever treating her that way. He even said Im not quick to forgive. I can get real nasty. Before that he said I know you havent been going to your classes (I hadnt been, I would lay in bed all day and sleep. I was very depressed) which led him to say so why are you lying about that, and why are you lying about your relationship with your boyfriend? They both acted like ME not telling them about visiting his family over the holiday breaks was almost unforgivable. Isnt that insane? Then he questioned me intensely about my meds and asked if they were working. and then told me I should watch Brenee Browns Vulnerability special on Netflix and gave me a hug. He went from really angry to really sweet and nurturing. KEEP IN MIND, HE IS A PROFESSOR AT MY UNIVERSITY, AND HE DEFENDED HER AFTER ALL THE TIMES HE CONFIDED IN ME ABOUT SUSPECTING HER SLEEPING WITH ANOTHER GUY (which happened!) After I got as much utility money as I could from her before the lease ended, I blocked both of their numbers. I havent seen or spoken to them since. I feel like I have to defend some of this because I know it sounds stupid and trivial. But Im still dealing with this pain almost a year later. I know a lot of these things sound small an trivial, but day after day of it I became so, so, so miserable from it. I was intimidated and scared to speak up. She is a charming, hilarious, best friend bully. I always felt really embarrassed and ashamed of who I was and how I looked when I was around her. Sometimes I find myself so angry that I start to spiral when I see a photo of her. I also find myself denying things that I truly enjoy or I find myself wanting to change myself in certain ways in fear of criticism because of her. Still. Im still dealing with the lasting effects of all of this. Idk if this is narcissism. Shes totally a horrible person. I hope anyone whos gone through a terrible friendship is feeling better! Im about to start weening off of my meds. Since Ive moved out, I havent really needed them anymore. Even though the pain is still there, Im so so so so so happy again. Im my old self and it feels so good and freeing."

He called me stupid, retard, idiot, and a psycho. He physically blocked the doorway and would let me leave the room because he wanted to talk. He ripped the blankets off of me and threw them on the floor when I was laying down because he wanted me to look at him. It was horrible. I ended up sobbing and apologized for whatever it was he wanted me to apologize for just to get him to leave me alone. He eventually apologized as well and it went something like Im sorry that I reacted to you not wanting to talk to me. Im sorry that I let you get to me. Basically blame shifting and bringing everything all back to me. I was still heart broken and angry, but I moved on because I was done going back and forth with him and feeling like a prisoner in my own home. After a few hours had passed, he came home and was a completely different person. He said he was sorry he was such an asshole, Im such a better wife than he is a husband, he doesnt deserve me, I have a kind heart, he projects his insecurities on me and its not fair, hes the one with issues, blah blah blah. It seemed genuine and it felt good to hear it but Im very confused. When I think about our fights and the way he treats me, I know I dont want to be with him. I know I deserve something different, and I know this is not a healthy relationship. But when he has apologies like that and has these moments of vulnerability I feel bad for even thinking about leaving. I see the person I love and I want to help him. We usually end up really good for a few days, maybe even weeks after those kind of apologies, and then all of a sudden we will have a few days from hell, where we argue horribly, Its a cycle. I feel so lost and confused and I dont know what to do. I love him so much when we are good and I hate him so much when we are not good. I feel crazy and sad. Thank you to anyone who read this."

We had fun at places like that. We were looking at some of the decor and stumbled upon some cool stuff, and saw this wedding set up/collection. We both enjoy putting events together and decor and things of that nature. We were giving our opinions about it, and I said I definitely looked forward to planning my own wedding and not needing a planner is fine really because Ill enjoy all those facets unless I got a little stressed and needed a hand  and he said yeah Id really enjoy planning my own wedding too. I immediately realized first in that moment that if him and I tried to plan a wedding together Id have almost no say and realized how over bearing he is and selfish in planning and decision making. But I let it slide and then he said (in a jokey light hearted sort of manner but also serious) I have this feeling that the day of my wedding Im going to be like micro managing every detail, and have to take a moment and say to myself 9 this is your day ****, relax let other people do things and focus on yourself and enjoy your day He didnt say enjoy your fianc and family and friends of ok this is both of your guys day  he let it slip that hed be both controlling and micro managing of every aspect which I already concluded in my head before this day and moment and then right after that let it slip that his future bride wont be the biggest thing on his mind  the details of the event and himself as usual would be the biggest thing hes focusing on. I asked him do you think youll cry when your bride walks down the aisle? (I know that isnt gonna be everyone and it doesnt mean anything bad if the guy doesnt cry but I do have a tiny hope my future husband will at least tear up a little!! Cause Im gonna be bawling lol) He said no why would I cry? Why would anyone cry? Its a happy day not a sad thing or an emotional thing I thought he really never shows vulnerability or understands it does he? Its fine if he doesnt cry but to not get why some guys or people do? Anyway, just a thought that came to mind recently. Its interesting what pops up and it always more reasons we just never would have worked and how he showed signs of narcissism so early on even in small ways like this."
43,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Am I the Narcissist or the Victim? (Part 3),1,el0kka,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/el0kka/am_i_the_narcissist_or_the_victim_part_3/,2020-01-07 08:23:17,"I listened to a YouTube video last week that was enlightening and validating to my own experiences. I typed it up, and Im sharing the transcription in case it helps others. This is the third and last post - I broke them into parts because it was a lot of text. Ways 1-4 of 5 are in other posts. (Note - it sounds like this particular person helps other identify narcissistic behaviors with audio examples that people send her - she refers to this a lot in this part.) Keep on healing yall.  Am I the Narcissist or the Victim - 5 Ways to Determine by Michele Lee Neives Coaching 5.) Probably the communication skill that really gives the narcissist away is the lack of empathy. For example, if two people are in a heated dispute and their emotions are all over the place, and one person starts to get emotional and feel pain (maybe cry, or just express their personal pain - not attacking, just expressing how much it's affecting them and hurting them) - a healthy individual will react to that show of vulnerability. If they care about this person, they are going to change in some slight way no matter how mad they are. They are going to say something that shows that they see that person's pain. They may be angry in the moment, but they see the pain. Its not their intention to cause that pain, but they are wanting this issue resolved and that's something that they need to work through. They show a desire to acknowledge the person's pain, and want to reach a conclusion, and want to reach some sort of resolution. A narcissist, when they see a person's pain, have zero empathy. This is the biggest giveaway in a conversation. I've had several conversations sent in where the person ends up crying - it's sad sometimes when I read comments where somebody is criticizing them saying, ""oh you're recording, and yet you're crying. That's just you trying to make yourself look like the victim. But its not so much the crying that makes them look like the victim, but how the other person responds to the crying. For example, the narcissist might completely ignore the person. If they don't ignore it, they will make fun of you for feeling sad. They will make fun of you for crying. They will mock your pain. And then they will ignore it as if it's so insignificant, it's not even worth their attention. In one audio, I remember one of the guys being recorded began reading the mail as his partner cried. First, he made fun of her, and then he read the mail. And when you're listening to it from the outside, you can see a complete lack of empathy. And again, it's all about control. The narcissist is wanting that person to act in a way that is beneficial for them. So that lack of empathy, I would say, is probably the biggest indicator of who the narcissist is. Or I should say, who's displaying narcissistic tendencies in that conversation, or who's displaying unhealthy communication behaviors. So for those who sent in emails asking, ""So am I the narcissist? ...Because there have been times that I've been the one yelling, I've been out of control, and I've been the one that just sounds awful. I've lost it. I've been pushed more than I can take. Am I the narcissist?"" Going over these 5 points - there's many others, but just for the sake of this video, going over those 5 points really help you see that just because a person loses it or gets overemotional, or reacts to abuse, or somebody else provoking them doesn't make them a narcissist. Its important to realize this too, because not ever narcissist is the one is the one that's yelling and screaming. The most dangerous narcissist, I would say, is the covert narcissist, because they are the hidden narcissist. It's the sheep in wolves clothing narcissist. They don't always lose their cool, so you really have to look for those really subtle forms of abuse in order to realize what's going on. In fact, it's the covert narcissist that often confuses their victims into thinking or convincing the victim that the whole problem is them because of the way they're reaacting. What the victims dont realize is that they're undergoing a daily dose of subtle forms of abuse to the point that they can't take it anymore. They are reacting to that, and the narcissist is trying to use that reaction as proof that THEY are the problem. So it's really important to understand how they communicate and how to identify them in conversations so that you don't get confused with being the narcissist yourself, because sometimes you ~don't~ handle everything calm, cool, and collected. Knowing these subtle forms of abuse will help you open your eyes to why conversations with narcissists seem to spin in circles and seem to repeat over and over without ever reaching any sort of resolution. Once you can spot what they do, you can start to learn healthy behaviors so that you don't get sucked into those constant drama battles that leave you feeling drained and emotionally stomped on.  Personal notes: Seriously, interacting with someone youre close to *doesnt* have to be like this. Its is an absolutely night and day difference to be in a relationship with someone who exhibits healthy patterns of relating and communicating, and high emotional intelligence. Im sure many of yall have had this frustrating experience of just wanting normal conversations with your loved ones where you problem solve together and are both kind, loving, communicative and compassionate. And its possible, just not with the narcissist."

However, she has a habit of making moments of vulnerability revolve around her, and it's extremely emotionally taxing. I deal with a lot of issues related to mental health, but I'm not a big fan of opening up about them, as I feel as though it's a hassle and a burden on others, especially if they're struggling as well. My friend tries very hard to make our conversations regarding mental health non judgemental, but every time I try to open up and tell her about the things I deal with, she ends up making it revolve around her a lot by victimizing herself and making it seem like I'm worsening her mental health for venting to her despite her being the one who asked. She'll tell me I triggered her anxiety and type (maybe deliberately? not sure, it seems very forced though) semi-incoherently as though she's crying as we text, and I understand that it can be hard to talk about certain topics when you're going through similar things, but surely she wouldn't ask about specific things if she knew she wouldn't be able to handle talking about them? All in all, nearly every opportunity I get to open up to her ends up with me having to console her rather than the other way around, and it has made me very nervous about opening up to my friends about things I'm going through. If you read this entire post, thank you."

Conversation, for him, is about finding any and all ways that he can be right and superior to the other person. Thats it. Thats his only goal. He is especially adept at poking holes in every single thing about other people. Their personalities, their lives, their opinions - anything is fair game to be picked apart and criticized by him. Its like an obsession. He HAS to feel that hes better, that hes smarter, that hes more practical and clever than other people. Of course, the actual relationship, the bond with another person is of zero importance to him. Because, bonding with someone requires honesty and vulnerability in order to meet them halfway. He refuses to do this, because how can he be superior if he accepts that hes human just like everyone else? No. He MUST be better. He MUST win. Very sad."

They dont think there is anything wrong with the way they treat you or talk to you. If they have proven to you that time and time again that they cant respect you, LEAVE! Do not waste any more of your time crying over them. Put yourself first! Recognise the red flags and really ask yourself, is this the fulfilment I want from this person in a relationship?

47,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"I found this chilling piece online. Written by HG Tudor. Simply called ""THE STARE""",1,enjnkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/enjnkz/i_found_this_chilling_piece_online_written_by_hg/,2020-01-12 16:45:05,"""The eyes feature prominently in an engagement with another person. You look into someones eyes to read them, to allow them to read you, you look away from someone in order to convey certain emotions, you fail to meet somebodys gaze to convey others. I have written about the eyes of our kind previously but let us turn to a specific element of the use of eyes in the narcissistic dynamic and that is the stare. Ordinarily, staring at another person is considered to be rude and ill-mannered, although it may denote fascination and even infatuation, but even that stare from a besotted admirer can be regarded as rude, never mind the unending gaze of a passer-by who cannot believe what he or she is witnessing. The stare when deployed by our kind takes on a different application altogether and it manifests at different times during your engagement with us. The Stare in Seduction It is not used by all of our kind, but if you have been subjected to it, you will know it and you will remember it well. It was the time when those brilliant blue eyes locked with your own eyes and stared deep inside of you. Those flashing emerald eyes appeared transfixed as they stared at you. The rich brown eyes which seemed to melt as they gazed at you wavering. Whatever colour our eyes are, when you first received that seductive stare, the colour seemed to become brighter, the light shone in them and the intensity of our gaze was immense. It was not so much as being looked at, but rather an event in itself. Our steady stare was unusual as you probably had not experienced it from anyone else previously. You wanted to look away, torn between a sense of discomfort but the mesmerising quality of our eyes kept you looking back into them. At that moment, our relentless gaze told you that you and only you mattered. There was nothing else of consequence in the universe. The background drained away, the surrounding sounds became muted and all distractions were removed. We wanted to show you that our devotion to you was beyond anything else. Only by allowing us to stare at you for such a long time were we able to convey the depths of our love, the vastness of our desire for you, the sheer scale of our need to be with you. Time slowed and then stood still, your skin tingled from the experience of this tantalising stare. Your breath caught in your lungs, your face seemed to flush and the wave of addiction washed across you, sending a shiver up and down your spine, around your neck and twisting your stomach. In that instant we became your universe as we showed you the world in our eyes. Yet, what you really looked on as those two eyes continued to bore deep into you, was yourself. We commenced this engagement by knowing that to stare at you for an unconventional length of time would make you feel both uncomfortable and captivated so that you would then show us what was in your eyes. You would reveal to us your desire, your love, your hopes, your wants and your dedication. All we did was mirror back at you what you showed to us, amplified through the auspices of the mimicry for which we have become known. In that moment as we held your gaze from across the table, or after that kiss, or as we lay on top of you, we showed you yourself and thus sowed the seeds that caused you to fall in love with us, but really it was with yourself. That is why your love became something beyond anything that you had ever experienced before. That is why it was deep, powerful and absolute, because your subconscious saw what it wanted to see and this fired-up powerful and immense responses in you. The world whirled in our eyes, your world. We offered limitless possibilities through the promise we mirrored back at you and by keeping you in this gaze we told you that we wanted you above anything and everything else. We wanted you. We wanted you. We wanted YOU. The Stare in Devaluation: Neutrality In Why Does He Seem Like A Different Person, I explained about the stranger setting where the person who once lit up your life, becomes like a stranger, almost robotic. This is a change which occurs as the devaluation begins. It is not always present as some of our kind move straight into the dark abuses of the devaluation from the off, but there is a precursor to this when the person who once walked in with a cheery smile and a kiss, just enters and sits down, devoid of any prevailing emotion. If you experience this, then you may also experience the stare at this juncture. This will be a hollow gaze which is accentuated by the blank expression that accompanies it. It is not a look of confusion or misapprehension; it is not a look of dimwittedness but is instead the empty stare of an empty person. You are looking at the void that exists within all of our kind. This represents the crossroads. The seductive stare glowed, fizzed and shone with the fabricated positive emotions which would cause you to respond with positive fuel. That has gone. The darkness of the devaluation has not yet commenced and its drawing of the negative fuel. Instead, you are looking at the in-between. The eyes which are devoid of warmth or hatred, empty of passion or malice, just a blank stare which conveys the void within. This will cause you to become confused. It will have you ask whether everything is alright and have you wondering what has happened. You will be mystified as to where those mesmeric and scintillating gazes have gone. Why are you no longer looked at with that piercing and uplifting look? Where have we gone? If we had a soul, it is as if it has been sucked from within us, leaving only this husk behind. You cannot complain that you are being badly treated, since no abuses have yet been deployed against you. This empty and robotic stare is a warning of what is to come and should you see it in those you engage with, heed it and make good your departure because it is signaling to you that a far worse stare awaits you. The Stare in Devaluation: Malice This, perhaps, is the stare that most associate with our kind. When you are subjected to our malicious stare, our eyes darken, emphasised by the contortion of our features which makes us appear like something else. The glowing greens, brilliant blues and blissful browns have vanished. The glinting grey eyes are no more, the halcyon hazel has been banished and instead a dark and glowering black has taken their place. This gaze will cause you to shrink back under its impact. The hatred that is embodied in the ink darkness will turn you cold, send ice through your heart and is enough to even cause you to burst into tears. Terror will grip you because when this stare is deployed against you, you are seeing the evil in our core. The pure, unadulterated hatred which we have for you. It is seething, dense and vicious. It bears down on you, reminding you of your weaknesses and vulnerabilities, a blackened glare which keeps on driving at you, pressing down on you, forcing you to feel small and wretched. You may have caught the occasional malicious glance from us, just a flash of hatred, but that is something else. Those glimpses were warnings which could only be used for an instant to avoid detection by third parties and the fracturing of the faade. This is a stare. Sometimes it may be accompanied by hissed words of threat and insult. Sometimes it is cloaked in silence, the balefulness a clear warning that a period of silence will now be visiting you. The person that you thought we were will be utterly absent. Your world has been annihilated in an instant and replaced by two orbs of glinting black, which tell you that you are hated. Totally hated and that much worse will be visited on you in conjunction with this stare of concentrated evil. The Stare in the Discard This is perhaps witnessed if you are actually told of your discard. More often, it appears post discard when you try to see us, to plead with us for answers, to beg us to take you back and so forth. This stare is one of pure contempt. Disdain and distaste for you. How on earth did we come to couple with one so weak, so pathetic and so disgusting as you. You make us shudder to think that we once even looked at you with favour, love and longing. The shame we feel at choosing someone like you is thrust to one side to be overridden by a contemptuous stare, that is designed to weaken you in your tracks and tell you that in no uncertain terms we want nothing to do with you. We have someone far better. This stare is to urge you to keep away and to forbid you from reminding us that we once promised you the world. We do not want to remember such matters. Somebody else receives those promises now. You are an unfortunate reminder of a part of us which we prefer to keep locked away and this stare conveys this through contempt and loathing. The Stare in the Hoover The Malign Follow-Up Hoover as you would expect applies the same approach as the malicious stare detailed above. Should we make contact with you for the purposes of trying to convince you to return to us, whether it is post-discard or post-escape, we will look to hold your gaze once again. This time those eyes of ours will shine again but with hope, longing and contrition. Vulnerability, sorrow and remorse may appear to loom large in the rounded and pleading gaze which we now hold you in. Once more this is pure artifice. All we are doing is mirroring what you show to us. The hope that we might have seen the error of our ways. The longing for us to come to the realisation that we have done wrong. The sorrow for a person who must behave in this manner. The remorse that you engaged with someone so vile. The longing that you have for the golden period to shine once again. It is all manufactured as we mirror back to you what we see but for the purposes of hoodwinking you once again and with mealy-mouthed assurances and never to be delivered promises, we hook you back into our grasp. The stare is a prominent weapon when we engage with you. It is a device that fabricates those emotions we do not possess and allows you to see the reality of who you have entangled with when you look up on the emptiness and shrink from the malice."""

We had one conversation where there seemed to be a tiny bit of personal responsibility so I went against better judgment and called her back one more time for an evening chat. I don't know if she's a narc, but when I talk to her I feel like I'm talking to a different species in an eerie way. Arrogant, cocky, rapid talking, very emotionally immature. Constantly in a sadist position and firing off questions at me (not talking with me). Last night was the first time my body just went numb as it all ran through me. My heart is broken for what I thought was there. For knowing someone like this exists and thrives and works almost well in their world. I know this was a trauma bond after the death of my mother. I also have a brain injury that causes impulsivity and a lot of emotional and physical vulnerability. I was always pushing back against this behavior. I was never passive about it which made me feel almost abusive. Like I was trying to rewire this monster. (Feel free to look at past posts. I'm still trying to make sense of who the f I'm dealing with here)"

The last 6 months of my life have been some of the hardest of my life. Just a little over 4 years ago I met you at work, a woman who I thought was one of the most wonderful people Id ever encountered. Charming, funny, smart, a brilliant conversationalist, just the right amount of modest, silly and weird. And this endearing sense of innocence or vulnerability, Im not sure which one, maybe both. I loved your sense of style, I wont deny you caught my eye well before I worked up the courage to talk to you. You were different to most for all the right reasons; and eventually we hit it off thanks to a mutual friend. We hung out together at the work Christmas party for the first time, and a few weeks later she you were at my place for a house party for that same friend. Somewhere between those events and Christmas we went and got a coffee after you finished work, and I was amazed you seemed to dig all the music I was into on the car ride there and back - we sat out the front of your parents talking and listening for what felt like hours. It wasnt long before we started seeing each other - Christmas Day in fact was the first night we spent together, after finishing up our respective family engagements. There was this pesky ex boyfriend hanging around we just couldnt seem to get rid of, and all my protective instincts kicked in as I tried to help remove him from your life. It wasnt easy, but eventually he disappeared. I couldnt understand why you didnt just block him, especially since you had told me how abusive and controlling he was, and I resolved to never be like that. I was sad to hear he took your cat too, what a shitshow it seemed like, I couldnt believe someone could act like that towards someone as kind and sweet as you. You told me about the way he abused you, and I do still believe you. I know hes a different type of crazy, and I dont doubt he put you through hell. And I wont victim blame you, because nobody deserves it. It was a whirlwind romance for me, it moved quickly but you felt like the mystical the one, and we spent many a late night swapping stories, secrets, fears, fantasys. We talked about it all. You opened up to me about your anxiety, and while I was definitely ill prepared to understand or help you with it at first, I resolved to try. Did you lovebomb me? Or did I lovebomb you? Maybe both, maybe neither. Maybe it really was just a whirlwind romance after all. We ended up together for almost 3.5 years. We signed a contract to buy a house after 8 months, got that house after another year and a bit, and lived in it together with our dog for another 18 months or so. Ill start with my fuck ups, and acknowledge my own narcissistic traits or behaviours. On two seperate occasions I was messaging pretty flirty with girls from work on Snapchat. Never nudes or actually making plans anything like that, but pretty suggestive nonetheless. Talking the talk, but never walking the walk. The first time was early on, around the time we signed the contract for the house. You caught me, and we almost ended there. Somehow I managed to convince you to stay and work through it with me. Except I suppose we didnt really talk about it much after a week or two. I dont really fully understand why I did it back then, my best guess when I try and take my mind back there is a combination of things. I think I was a little panicked or overwhelmed by how quickly things had been moving - dont get me wrong I was super excited, but I did have my reservations. And I dunno, Id sorta cut back on some of the things I used to enjoy doing, and stopped hanging with certain friends as much because either you werent up for it, or those people made you uncomfortable. Maybe I was rebelling a little? One of those friends I cut a lot of contact with, was one of my exes (lets call her S). S and I had a long history, having known each other since we were kids, dated for years before breaking up, and becoming good friends again a year or so later. Thats a lot of history - I know that, Im not stupid. And I acknowledge how daunting that can be to a new comer to any social circle, let alone as my partner. Fuck I went out of my way to try and introduce you two in the best ways possible, S was a big part of my life and her and her family were still important people to me. But that night went to shit, due to a simple misunderstanding that spiralled quickly, and even though that misunderstanding had nothing to do with S it myself, there was no coming back from that - you made it quite clear in fact. S and I stayed in contact for a little while longer, she was actually really helpful to me trying to understand anxiety more, and how I could help, but eventually the hiding of conversations and all that got too much for me, and we decided it best to discontinue. The first friend I gave up. I know I shouldnt of been hiding those chats, but I know I shouldnt felt like I had to either. I dont blame you for it entirely either, it rests on both of us there. I dont doubt me hiding the fact I was talking to her hurt you, especially after you found out. Some will say I wanted to have my cake and eat it too, or are of the opinion that exs should stay firmly in the past. I think it depends on the ex, but I digress. Nonetheless, that was my second fuckup, innocently intentioned enough as it may of been. The third major fuckup was about a year after we moved into our house. Again, a girl from work, again snapchat. I knew this girl was trouble the day I met her, but nonetheless I found myself talking to her. The conversation was mostly work, but definitely with flirty undertones, and some straight up flirting of course. Blah blah blah talking the talk walking the walk. She was definitely an attention seeker thats for sure, and I should of steered well clear. Life was super stressful, you felt distant to me and instead of reaching out to you I took the easy path to get my ego stroked. A culmination of shitty events and decisions no doubt. Im not sure, all the same it sounds like excuses to me, that Im probably making to make myself feel okay with being a daft idiot. I know in day to day life I often had little in the way of energy left, that you did a lot more than me around the house. That I could be arrogant and selfish sometimes, indecisive and moody others. I know that my bottling up of negative emotions, hiding my stress and overall low mood wasnt any good for either of us. No doubt it didnt help the distance between us. And I know that my apologies didnt always seem sincere, but I promise you they were. Perhaps I didnt always listen as well as I should, or should of been better able to pick up on your signals. I know I can be inattentive, impulsive and talk over the top of people. You told me I was too focussed on improving and setting up our new house when you wanted to travel. I know I shouldnt of taken it so personally when you wouldnt open up to me about your anxieties, I just wanted to help and I sometimes felt powerless to do so. I think ultimately I ended up being quite codependent in some way. I know I betrayed your trust, and attempted to justify it or downplay it - to both you and me. And Im sure theres more to list Then theres the way I spun the fuck out of control when you left me. I know I gaslighted you, tried to manipulate you, had some massive emotional outbursts. I tried everything no doubt to convince you to stay, most ironic considering it no doubt served to push you further away. All of a sudden - I was that crazy ex from your past, spinning wildly out of control. Ranging between begging you to come and see me, to spitting venom when I spoke. I stalked you when I knew you were lying to me the first time, and had a hard time breaking out of that habit. It almost became a compulsion. I even messaged your new supply a couple of times to try and get him to back off. I was extremely difficult no doubt. When things between you and I ended, everything I had been bottling up over the last year just came flooding out, and I couldnt control it. Youll never know how many nights I spent on the couch in what was once our home, curled up into a ball crying, struggling to breath. I was almost catatonic, the only time I felt anything it was either anger, despair or overwhelming sadness. I should of got out of that house ASAP, being surrounded by the memory of what was was eating at my soul. But I thought if I stayed while you did you for a bit, you would come back. Even after I did move out, I was constantly rereading our messages, looking for clues or hints, anything to help me understand. I pushed, provoked and antagonised you. I held onto the hurt because you were no longer here and it was the only way for me to hold onto you. But then theres you. Lets start with overlapping relationships. Your ex before me, I know you justify sleeping with me that first night as being okay because you two were on a break - at least thats what you had told him. - in the 24-36 hours before. You told me you were single, and had been for a little while - just having difficulty untangling your lives. Or that when we went and had coffee, you told him it was to straighten me out and get me off your case? Sure didnt seem that way sitting out the front of your parents. Or how almost 18 months into our relationship YOU added him back on Facebook, and I looked the fool when I saw it on my newsfeed and went off on him, thinking he had added you. Never mind the fact that I overlooked you accepting it. It ended up being him that removed you from fb this time round, Ive seen the proof. I know now that you initiated that. At the time I just thought you were being nice accepting his friend request, maybe a chance to forgive and forget or something. Now, well I cant think of a good reason to add someone one social media that abused you the way you said. Apparently you were going to give the cat up too, but thats hearsay and I cant substantiate that. And you left me the same way you left him too. Except this time it was a little more complicated than that, because we had a house together. You waited until you had new supply lined up, road tested him and made sure he was in, then found your reason, then went through my phone and found that flirting from 4 months earlier. And look, Im not saying thats not good enough reason in its own right. But the timing of everything, and the method. That was cold, and you played me like a fiddle. You used what I had told you all those years ago in confidence to burn me to the ground. You knew I had always been interested in experimenting with a third person in the bedroom, but had had a really bad experience in the past. So you broke all the rules we had for that repeatedly and with enthusiasm. One month after meeting this third party you went through my phone. Decided to stay in the house for two weeks with me, telling me that we should just try and do the things that always made you happy like ikea trips, taking the dog out, and (surprise) more threesomes. Then you went to stay with your folks for a few weeks, to help you clear your head. It was barely a few days before you were lying to me about seeing him - I knew the moment you started acting out of character. And even when I caught you in that first big lie, you denied it and denied it even as I gave you chance after to chance to fess up, until I actually called you on it. 8 months later and youve never been happier or luckier, or so you tell the world anyway. You always considered yourself a little unlucky, but you finally got lucky that first night at the casino when you met him - the last place youd usually find unlucky old you. You took my deepest desires, as well as fears and past experiences and used them against me. Then when I tried to talk about it, you threw it back on me. Told me it was because you felt like you werent good enough anymore. Even through you knew my motives were about as far from that as possible. Then when I tried to explain myself again, you tried to shut me down telling me if it was a woman not a man I wouldnt care. Funny, one of my friends told me during all this that you always seemed pretty cold and calculating - I vehemently disagreed at the time but now... Im not so sure. Or what about the night your friend came to stay with us? The one who understood your anxiety better than I did, who you had been secretive about talking to? That when I walked in the door, the whole mood felt off - like I wasnt welcome in my own home. Your behaviour totally different to normal, like I wasnt welcome in my own home. Maybe I read too much into it, but when we ended up arguing about it you managed to put it back on me. See you had this beautiful way of making me back down every time - you would cry or go into hysterics. Of course, how could I keep going when it got like that? Id have to back down because I hated seeing you cry, that protective instinct would override any of me thoughts or emotions most of the time and invariably I would end up comforting you. I remember, one night when you had been caught messaging your new man, you actually said to me why are you attacking me like this. Stopped me dead. No wonder I had started to bottle things up, and walk on eggshells. Shit like sorry I guess Im just a shitty person, or sorry I suck, thats so manipulative. You are always the victim too, ever noticed that? First it was your ex. Then my best mates gf, then the transfer to a new team at work. Then we had problems with the bank. Then it would be work again, or your new boss. Then your dad when he came to visit, or one of your friends wasnt treating you right or not talking to you. Or my brother. Then it was me. During the whole process of separation, you were just nice enough to me to get me to comply with whatever needed doing, and picked your battles well. On one hand, I can see the rational, obviously keeping me on side was beneficial to making sure things went smoothly. On the other hand, I realise just how much extra work I put into preparing our house for sale. You barely lifted a finger other than to arrange a cleaner and a repairman. And when the cleaner fucked up guess who was there scrubbing tiles before the first open house by themselves? Me, while you lead me to believe you would help, you were off with your new supply. Even now Im still waiting on you 4 months later to sort the property and assets out - not for lack of trying on my behalf. But your free legal representation from a family friend, well you know I cant match that. So you continue to drag this process out, one that if we were acting like adults could be resolved in hours. Theres so many more little things I could say about us, as individuals and a couple. But you know what, whats the point? Ive been over and over everything time and time again in my head. At first I thought I was entirely to blame, and I was miserable. Then a friend told me to look up covert narcissism, and I was like hallelujah! A label! I can handle this, it gives me something to be angry about, something to resent, and thats easy. But these last few weeks Ive been writing it all down, the story of us. And I realised you know what, despite it all, it wasnt all bad. You opened my eyes to many new things, many new ways of thinking. You taught me a lot about love and life, and honestly did help me to become a better, more tolerant man in many ways. You do have some beautiful, incredible traits, features whatever you want to call them. That good in you is incredible. And Im going to find where that is in me again. Just writing this out has been cathartic, and this last few weeks have been some of the most peaceful in a long time. And the conclusion Ive come to? I think we both certainly share some narcissistic traits, wether they define you Ive yet to determine, but I wont let mine define me. Its a sliding scale after all. My friends and family have spent a long time helping me pick up the pieces of all this, and Ive spent many a sleepless night trying to figure it all out. Ive sought professional help as well, at first just to help drag me out of the hole I was in. Found out I have ADHD, so thats been an experience- but understanding whats going on in my head has been helpful. And Im going to keep focussing on me for awhile, until one day this is all just a distant memory. I dont think I would change it much if I could. Maybe a few things here or there, but ultimately Im going to be stronger for the experience, and I thank you for all the good times, the wonderful memories, as well as the lessons learnt. I do hope one day you find peace with the things that plague you, and that youve learnt from this too. Dont go repeating the same mistakes, same patterns we have both made. For your sake, and everyone elses. I still think you are a beautiful person with so much to offer the world. Ill try to do the same."

No, what finally did me in was realizing how friggen boring this guy was. One of the things on my mind this week was how tedious text conversations with my nex friend would be. Our chatlogs so lacked substance and overall passion that I sometimes had to will myself into continuing a conversation. I didn't even like talking to the guy half the time! Wtf was I so hooked on his nonsense about? Like, we would semi-frequently dabble into some light-hearted nsfw roleplaying together, and I'd always end up ghosting the conversation before we could ever finish a scene. He completely sucked out my creativity. He had no passion toward any of the stuff I wanted to explore, and brought nothing of his own for us to work with. I'd write these walls of steamy text that included character building and dialogue so that our sessions would be fun. He would just parrot back a two sentence sentiment I'd already brought to the table without expanding upon it. His character had the emotional vulnerability of a wetnap. Even worse was his character's dialogue felt wooden. ""Yes, I enjoy this. Ha ha. Do you like this as well? Ooh..."" It's kind of catty, I know, but in hindsight that thought got under my skin more than any of the other admittedly awful shit he did over the years. He had a handsome enough face, sure, but god! At what cost? I'd have run better lines with a sockpuppet. He claimed to love roleplaying. We even ran in similar online groups so we had quite a few risque overlaps, which should have been exciting! Safety in friendship mixed with excitement in fantasy should have been the ultimate conversation jackpot. It was honestly like trying to have a heart-to-heart with an echo. I cried over ""yes, baby...."" ?? I spent sleepless nights making myself sick about ""I do enjoy a bit of that haha......[one hour later].....sorry. you still up?"" At least I finally met my standards."

Also - did anyone else's try to get you to reveal bad experiences? Mine often wanted me to talk to him about school (he guessed correctly I was bullied and kept trying to get me to open up). I didn't understand why he was interested as it was 15 years ago, and even by my last year of school I felt like I'd well and truly moved on.

Do I somehow alert or let his wife know? He slept with me unprotected for the entirety of her pregnancy, and would still be doing so now, several months after the birth, had I not ended things.** **Would you want to know or not? If you think she should be told or alerted more discretely somehow, how? Or do I just run and never look back?** Because it's a fairly complex moral question I'm including the fairly lengthy backstory so its obvious that this is not a simple revenge story. **I met him in November 2016**. He was charming and had this odd vulnerability and a way of looking right into my soul. I was smitten. We met up a few times before he told me he was married. The usual story  unhappily married, she was ungrateful, unloving, no sex, they were separating etc. They had been married only two years, together for closer to eight. We saw each other for a few months, a few hours at a time, mostly dinners, movies and sex. It was incredibly passionate, but I came to my senses and ended things. We only spoke a few times in the two years after. **This past January 2019**, I reached back out to him. I was vulnerable: in treatment for newly diagnosed bipolar 2. We started seeing each other again, every week or two. We texted constantly. He was still married but again, they were separating. They had tried therapy but no luck. He said he had moved out and was living at his parents. This continued all summer. There were quite a few red flags, but I was completely love-bombed and swept away. **Mid July,** I found his wifes public Instagram profile. I opened it up and there was a photo of her  seven months pregnant. Im not even going to try to describe how that moment felt. I think part of the trauma of it had me in denial for the past few months. I had a meltdown and blew up at him, telling him he didnt deserve any of the people in his life that he claimed to love. Conveniently, the day after, his father had a heart attack. I was filled with pity and guilt. I ended up apologizing to HIM for MY behaviour. I cut him out and started dating other people. But I missed him horribly and the love-bombing pulled me back in hard. In **August** he told me he loved me. That he wished hed met me first, that if he didnt have kids (they have another from one of her prior relationships) he would have left to be with me. I thought we were head over heels in love but that our timing was just off. Morally it sounds awful, but I couldn't rationalise that he could do what he was doing unless he truly was unhappy and planning to leave. He always dangled the possibility of a future, playing me off against her in a way that kept me behaving well in order not to lose him. **September.** As the due date got closer, I started pulling away. The more I disengaged the more the love-bombing ramped up. But I think the stress of having to maintain two masks plus look after a newborn was getting to him. Cracks started to show. I started asking more questions and not accepting vague roundabout answers. I kept bumping into more lies. The love-bombing strategy changed once I attempted no contact. Lets be friends forever. I dont think youre handling this well, lets keep it friendly, Ill still play with you though if you think you can handle it. That strategy didnt work so the devaluation began. I love my wife and Im trying to fix everything in my life, the baby changed everything, I love you both. **October.** I felt like I was going crazy, but in actuality, I was just starting to wake up to reality. So many red flags, so much manipulation. I lie to get what I want, I only ever tried to be the type of person I thought youd like, ""honestly after the way you behaved I don't think there ever could be a future now"" etc. Once you get a little time away and can step back and take a breathe, you suddenly start putting all the pieces together. Its a hard reality to face; realising the person you fell for doesnt exist. Suddenly the world you thought you knew is actually much darker than you thought. It's shaken my worldview, destroyed my self-esteem and fucked up my ability to trust anyone. I'm dealing with some pretty complex CPTSD. **Now Im left with one really conflicting, complex question  do I tell his wife?** I have struggled with this for months. I wanted to be sure I wasnt just being paranoid or vindictive. It will never be something I do rashly. I am fully aware of my responsibility in this mess. I made immoral, stupid choices. I do not want to destroy a happy, healthy family. Nor do I want to put her in a dangerous situation. She has a three-month old newborn. But can it ever be a secure, happy and healthy family if she doesn't know the truth? **Do I tell her? Would you want to know? Is it better to just step back and hope she figures this out soon enough that it doesnt destroy her or her children too much? If you think I should let her know somehow, how should I do that?** If anyone has more questions or anything else they'd rather say privately - feel free to DM me."

I often wonder if this applies to my own situation. On the other hand, perhaps he is not gay but just enjoys in some sick and perverted way, seeing how much lack of intimacy hurts me. The lack of intimacy that I am speaking of is very basic, including hugging and kissing...touching...sex. The ways that make me feel close to him have been taken away completely. It started just after marriage, so I know it wasn't me. I have not changed. I am just, if not more, fit. What's going on? I found some erectile dysfunction medication in his bathroom, and I can't help but wonder now...if he needed it to be temporarily attracted to me to get me hooked. I wonder if his primary interest is men. I have tried to initiate sex, but he tells me, ""that's a man's job""...if I try to touch him in bed in the morning, I am pushed away - literally. The times I have asked him to help pleasure me, he has told me it's too much work, his hand gets tired, excuses, excuses, etc. If I pleasure myself next to him, he never even bothers to help or look at me...nothing. Just stares straight up at the ceiling. When I have asked him to watch porn with me, he giggles like a little kid...and he noticed the man first, commenting on his physique. The other day I asked him if he dislikes kissing me. He said he didn't want to mess my make up up...I just looked away trying not to cry...he said, ""you look so sad right now""....I just got up and walked away. I didn't want to share any more vulnerability with him. Is he taking pleasure in this?? I guess in the end, the reason doesn't matter...but it hurts me so badly. Have any of you experienced this, and if so, what did you find out?"

I am curious about your experiences in this regard. The lack of intimacy that I am speaking of is very basic, including hugging and kissing...touching...sex. It started just after marriage. I have not changed. I am reasonably attractive. What's going on here? I have tried to initiate sex, but he tells me, ""that's my job""...if I try to touch him in bed in the morning, I am pushed away - literally. The times I have asked him to help pleasure me, he has told me it's too much work, his hand gets tired, a woman's anatomy is not attractive, etc. Before we got married, we attended a marriage workshop. One of the questions pertained to expectations surrounding sex. I explained that it was an important part of a loving relationship, so he knows this already. This doesn't seem like typical behavior toward your spouse...and why the change after marriage? In public, he is very affectionate, holding my hand...gazing into my eyes as I talk...others probably cannot imagine how he is at home. The other day I asked him if he disliked kissing me. He said he didn't want to mess my make up up...I just looked away trying not to cry...he said, ""you look so sad right now""....I just got up and walked away. I didn't want to share any more vulnerability with him. He followed up with the comment, ""I only don't want to kiss you when I am mad at you or when you have hurt me"". I silently thought to myself, ""isn't that most of the time?"" Is he taking pleasure in my pain? I have tried talking to him about the importance of affection many times, with no avail. After we got back together earlier this year, he was himself again for a period of time, but now we are back to nothing. When I ask him why he failed to initiate sex after promising to be intimate earlier in the day (since I have been told that I cannot initiate), he flips it around and says, ""you fell asleep""....or, ""you didn't feel well""...or some other excuse that indicates it's my fault. Have any of you experienced this, and did you feel it was intentional?"

I found the Mayo Clinic's definition and, point-by-point, have answered with my husband's level of meeting each criteria. I have no hope of ever getting him diagnosed or treated, because he's too scared and/or arrogant and/or immature to do that, but I'd be interested in feedback as to whether this is NPD or just being an a\*\*hole: &gt;Signs and symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and the severity of symptoms vary. People with the disorder can: &gt; &gt;\- Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance &gt; &gt; \- yes &gt; &gt;\- Have a sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admiration &gt; &gt; \- doesn't seem to care about admiration at all, but definitely entitlement issues &gt; &gt;\- Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it &gt; &gt; \- not so much superior, but RIGHT, despite evidence to the contrary and a complete lack of qualifications on any topic &gt; &gt;\- Exaggerate achievements and talents &gt; &gt; \- not really &gt; &gt;\- Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate &gt; &gt; \- NO &gt; &gt;\- Believe they are superior and can only associate with equally special people &gt; &gt; \- superiority yes, not the association part &gt; &gt;\- Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior &gt; &gt; \- not the conversation part, but the belttle and looking down on people -- IN THEIR ABSENCE &gt; &gt;\- Expect special favors and unquestioning compliance with their expectations &gt; &gt; \- only from me, it seems &gt; &gt;\- Take advantage of others to get what they want &gt; &gt; \- would not hesitate. I've been able to instill tiny bits of conscience in him, but not much &gt; &gt;\- Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others &gt; &gt; \- totally &gt; &gt;\- Be envious of others and believe others envy them &gt; &gt; \- envy, yes (not extreme) - doesn't believe anyone envies him, though &gt; &gt;\- Behave in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious &gt; &gt; \- yes &gt; &gt;\- Insist on having the best of everything  for instance, the best car or office &gt; &gt; \- no. He has learned frugality from me and is pretty good at it - most of the time &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they perceive as criticism, and they can: &gt; &gt;\- Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special treatment &gt; &gt; \- he becomes impatient or angry at LOTS of things, not particularly at not receiving special treatment &gt; &gt;\- Have significant interpersonal problems and easily feel slighted &gt; &gt; \- don't know about feeling slighted, but has significant interpersonal problems with people who matter (family) and customers (but not with strangers - he's charming to strangers) &gt; &gt;\- React with rage or contempt and try to belittle the other person to make themselves appear superior &gt; &gt; \- with me, yes &gt; &gt;\- Have difficulty regulating emotions and behavior &gt; &gt; \- TOTALLY &gt; &gt;\- Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change &gt; &gt; \- stress yes, change ... I've worked hard to bring stability and avoid change, so I'm not sure &gt; &gt;\- Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection &gt; &gt; \- depressed and moody for no apparent reason, not because of ""falling short"" &gt; &gt;\- Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, vulnerability and humiliation &gt; &gt; \- no idea, because I get no honest insights into what he's really feeling I've been with him since 1985, but today made me want to chuck it all in and leave. I have grown increasingly LESS tolerant of his behaviors, over time, while unfortunately developing unhealthy and unproductive reactions to them. Are there actual ""support groups"" for people who live with people with NPD? What about a\*\*hole-anon, for family members of a\*\*holes?"

Long story short, it was a friend of mine who is married and we'd gotten close. She and I would flirt all the time and she made it clear that all she was looking for was friendship and that she married and monogamous. But we discussed things I wouldn't with my usual friends. Was very vulnerable and honest and it was nice to have a close, female friend who understood. Yes, she and her husband were having issues. Yes, I figured I was filling an emotional void. I was trying to keep myself aware of everything, but I must have failed at some point because I developed feelings? Anyway. Once a mutual friend had pointed something out along the lines of emotional cheating, that's when she decided she needed to do the right thing and make her marriage work. And I felt immediately like I was being discarded. I talked to her yesterday and it was such a bizarre conversation. One where she would oft remind me how she was honest at the beginning. How she flirts with everyone. How she tells all of her friends that she loves them. How she's trying to be a good person. How checking on me meant that she still cared, despite the fact that I felt heartbroken, but I guess that's my fault for developing feelings \[/sarcasm\]. The whole time, it felt like she was saying she wasn't trying to minimize my feelings, but pointing things out in the opposite direction. Also pointing out how uncomfortable I got when she tried to remind me of her intentions and being married. I had isolated very severely because for me, it felt like a break-up, but I guess it shouldn't have, since she was ""honest from the very beginning."" During our conversation, something felt off, that I couldn't place. I couldn't necessarily argue with some of what she pointed out, because she was right. However, it did seem like she wasn't taking accountability on her end; but hey. She was being honest, right? I know she's toxic for me. She kept saying she wasn't my enemy. I don't hate her. I wasn't trying to paint her as a villain. I know what I ""have"" to do. I've had to put up with enough narcissists and toxic people. I know. I think that what gets me, though, is that I put so much into this friendship and there was so much trust and vulnerability and we talked all day every damn day. And maybe I misread some of the situation and ran. And felt like I was discarded. She said that that's not what she was trying to do, that she was honest and clear with her intentions from day one, but I don't feel like that excuses some of her behavior? I don't know. Her actions and her words always seemed to be different. But maybe it's just me. And the best part? How she kept telling me how I need to be nice to myself. ... Yeah, I know. No kidding."

It was nice to sit with someone and have a real conversation. I felt listened to. I would talk and she would listen with a warm smile on her face. She was quietly confident, kind, and warm. She was not boastful and full of herself. She wasn't fake or distant. Just a healthy amount of vulnerability. Even when I said, ""Wow I'm talking your ear off!"" She said she was interested in what I had to say. It was so nice to share and be met with a real smile. I don't know if my ex ever once smiled at me when I shared myself. The woman I met last night didn't have any condescending or judgmental remarks, she didn't compare herself to me or anyone, she was just herself. She didn't bad mouth anyone or have anything rude or nasty to say. When I summarized what she said, she felt understood and didn't say, ""No! You're wrong!"" She wasn't playing any games with me at all. She wasn't ashamed about being human, and didn't feel the need to hide herself or act a certain way. We held hands for a while and just sat close and there was ZERO pressure. I didn't even realize how much pressure I always felt sitting with my ex, pressure to give, give, give. Pressure to pay attention to her even though everything she said was either recycled, superficial, a huge exaggeration, an outright lie, or the same story she had already told me 25 times. I couldn't stand it. It was so frustrating just being at dinner with her. She couldn't be real for even one second. I just wanted her to be real with me. I always felt so much pressure, so invisible, pressure to give this empty person everything I had and it was never enough. In contrast, my date last night was just a nice mutual feeling, a no pressure zone. Two people giving. I felt so calm and welcome. I have another date tonight with a new person. I am being highly selective and I will NOT settle. It's ok to date around and have fun. It's ok to have sex, it's not a contract. It's ok to not have sex too. We are kind loving humans and it's ok to connect and take our time! I feel so free and so happy to be me."

He asked me if Id be loyal to him and if he was my bf. I said yes. We had a disagreement on morals on the first night. He thought we should just be friends due to that. So after the first night he text me this: Him: I hope you find your happiness. Had fun tho. Me: I hope you find happiness too. I like you but if this is good bye I don't blame you. Him: I dont blame you either. I like you too but I guess we have a different values at this time. Hope you the best :) ***So not gonna lie my stupid ass could have easily cut this off here... but for some reason I couldnt just leave it at that... I like you but... I like him a lot too, Ill admit that, this is why Im having such a hard time walking away.*** Me after stressing out all morning: Wait so like you don't like me cause of what I said last night? Just be blunt honest please. I know its wrong of me to expect you to give me anything like a car. That was way out of line I shouldn't have said that. And we vibe though this sucks. Again if you totally want to cut this I understand it hurts but I like you and I think we vibe. Anyway just be blunt honest if you don't wanna continue because I do. Him: We can still friends if you want I thought I did have same page as you. I dont know how you start and keep the relationship but I'm pretty conservative when it comes with the money. I get it you dont have enough and struggling but as you said last night if you are looking for a sugar daddy then I'm not that person that you are looking for. I'm not blaming you trying to judge anything I'm just telling you the truth that I'm not that guy and I never date in that way. But I am telling you I really had a good time and good vibes with you. If you want we can be friends :) Me: Thank you for your honesty I wish you the best. Him: No thank you. Call me when you wanna have some beer Me: I didn't mean that I was drunk and I'm sorry I said that. I know I sounded like a complete idiot last night and now. I start a relationship the way it should start and I like you and I think we vibe. I'm not looking for a sugar daddy I just want someone I vibe with and a real relationship I shouldn't have said what I said last night. I was probably just trying to push you away because I was scared. Its rare to find someone I like and I like you. Him: You know I like you too. You must be really tired. Me: I was kinda tired this morning but I got some energy. Wbu? If you like me and I like you why are you saying you just wanna be friends? Like I don't want some friends with benefits I want something real. I told you I'm sorry. Just be straight up with me because I really like you and I don't wanna be led on and I said sorry and Idk what to do or say. I shouldn't have said the money thing, thats not how I am. Him: You know I didnt mean friends for benefits. I just wanted to know and feel you more that's it. Let's meet again whenever we have time then. :) ~ So from this forward we are flirting and still in this relationship, with all the I miss yous and the sex and yeh. As the texts reflect, I said I didnt mean what I said I was drunk about and I think we vibe and should be more than friends. We continue to see each other. About a week later I asked him if he was still on the dating app. He made a joke about me saying now he cannot have female friends. Thats not what I was intending to say and I clarified for him that I dont think people should need to find friends on a dating app if they are with someone else. Hes still active on the app. I dont want to be so insecure about this but if he is still talking to other people, I am a monogamous, honest person and I want my partner to be the same. I dont think thats too much to ask. Im looking for the right person, not the wrong one. I think I may have to break this off, I dont want to, I really like this guy, but I cannot do the dishonesty and lies. For context He is 35M I am 22F. I met him on November 18th.,Hes very materialistic, puts a lot into his appearance/clothes, its like he is trying to look younger. In fact I even notice on his dating profile his age says 31, but in his bio hes like Im 35 cannot erase.. On the bright side he is really smart and he seems to vibe with my personality well... that could also be the social chameleon in both of us though idk. I also notice he gets very energetic and raises his voice when he is trying to prove a point like he doesnt need to talk that loud I can hear him just fine. Its not even if we are arguing in a bad way we could just be having a healthy debate with different views or I could be on the same side as him and still throw him counter claims saying well what about this, but he like has to be right... and his claims are normally logical but sometimes he dont wanna hear counterclaims, I find that weak. I have tried to break it off after I picked up on a few signs. I just want this to be over with but my ego always has me coming back to prove myself. He has this addictive personality that makes me wanna go back. I like pleasing him and making him happy, I will say I kinda feel like Im walking on egg shells. If I say one wrong thing or set a boundary, he like doesnt wanna talk to me anymore. I told him not to text me too early in the morning when he said good morning because it wakes me up, not because I dont wanna hear from him, I just dont wanna be woken up prematurely. This resulted in oh sorry and he just didnt text me the rest of the day which is out of the ordinary for him and I finally just texted him. He also doesnt really plan with me, he like expects me to drop my shit and have him come over. I have a very busy schedule and so does he, 12-10 hour days are not uncommon. He forgot about our first date, and I ended up conforting him about it. Like we set a day and he didnt text me until like five PM that day and I had to get up super early the next day so I found that disrespectful and didnt reply until the next day. He didnt apologize or anything he just set another date, I noticed this but I just brushed it off. So after a while of noticing these signs and I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that we should just break it off after all this; ~ Me: Hey I don't think we should talk anymore. I'm not your girlfriend and I'm not loyal to you anymore. Him: Any reason? Me: I dont think youre honest with me. And I thought about it for a while and if your still looking for friends on the CMB app, thats just not something Im okay with if you want my loyalty. I feel like what be have lacks boundaries and thats not the type of relationship Im looking for. Him: Ok. I'm sorry if you felt that way. I was going to erase the CMB anyway I just used some last beans that I have left in there. I do have same reasons because as I told you trust cant be made but should be build. If you think you cant do this then I guess this is it. Me: Thats a lame excuse to continue finding other people and having a few back ups in case it doesnt work out. I personally believe in taking a risk with someone. I want to find something real. Ill admit I only deactivated my account and stop talking to every match. I blew off a few dates too. I took that risk in hopes that I would have found the same honesty and integrity I have expressed from you as well. Again, I cannot do the dishonesty. Him: I understand. I'm sorry again if you felt that way. But I hope you understand also that we need some time to build up this. Remember when the first time you said you were looking for sugar daddy, I told you I am not that person and you said you were just drunk and I told you the next time when we met we will need time to build our trust to each other. Trust builds up inside not made by.. ****OKAY FOR CONTEXT I ASKED HIM IF HED LIKE BUY ME A CAR WHEN I WAS SHIT FACE DRUNK... (Im a poor college student) I SHOULDNT HAVE BUT I DID IT AND I APOLOGIZED FOR IT PROFUSELY AFTER I DID THIS. *** Me: I believe trust needs time too but I cannot do the lies from the start. If you're gonna lie from the beginning and stay on the app talking to other women after you ask for my loyalty in return how can you expect to to trust you in from the start? When you ask for my loyalty I meant that. But dont abuse it, dont dishonor it. And with the sugar daddy thing again I was drunk. I'm not gonna lie and say I'm not struggling. I tried and you were not okay with being that way. That was okay with me, I compromised, because I really liked who you were. I thought you were honest. But apparently you could not take that risk. If your not gonna be honest and continue to be lurking Im not gonna be intimate and fuck. I dont want an open relationship I dont want to wait and see. If its not right for you be honest with me, dont lead me on. I can be vulnerable, I have emotions and feelings. But I don't want to be intimate with someone I'm not serious about. Anyways I dont know why I like you so much but I do. I dont really like the concept of modern dating and having to weed through all the hypocrites. You ask for honesty in your profile, you say your honest yourself and your not. Him: I totally understand and I apologize if I hurt your feelings. But I want you to know I really like you and I didnt lie anything about it to you. Me: If you really liked me as much as you claim you wouldnt be leading me on continuing to talk to other people. If you really liked me you wouldnt ask for my loyalty and then not give me that in return as well. If your really liked me you could take that risk. And you saying 'I'm sorry you feel that way' is not an acknowledgement that you did anything to impact me, just that I feel bad. Him: I apologize for that and if you can't take it. I wont blame. And if you cant believe that I like you, I dont know how I can make you believe with it. Me: Its not your responsibility to apologize for what I choose not to deal with. You dont apologize for your action, you apologize to put the blame on me and my feelings like its my fault you cannot commit after you want my loyalty. Youre not actually sorry. You cannot make me believe or respect what you do not even mean yourself. Him: I think you totally misunderstand. This is the thing. I apologize for what made you feel bad when i didnt erase my CMB. That's it. And technically I didnt even talk with anyone in there after. I am not blaming you for anything so I dont know what you are talking about. All I said was it takes time for us to build but I am telling you again if you cant trust me anymore then I was telling that I can't help it. Me: You didn't talk to anyone after but you didn't assure me of that instead you try to 'joke' about it and say how you cannot have any female friends thats not the case. A dating app is not where I'd meet guy friends or where I'd expect someone I want to be with to meet girl friends. So how am I supposed to know you where not talking to anybody. You didn't assure me of this and you were not willing to take that risk. I asked because I care and I like you. You say you care but your so eggar to end this more than I am in every least sentence of your messages. And yes you put the blame on me by saying 'I'm sorry you feel that way.' Again, 'I'm sorry you feel that way' is not an acknowledgement that you did anything to impact me, just that I feel bad. Him: I dont really get it. I said I'm sorry that I didn't erase the app and if was talking to someone and dating with other people, the moment you said to you dont wanna meet me I probably gonna say ok. But I am trying to understand what is goin on and figuring this matter. And like I said if you cant trust me I really dont know what I can do.. Me: No you dont get it. And every last sentence you leave in your messages you leave the ball in my court like its all my fault for calling you on your bs. I like you this is what sucks, this is why its so difficult and you know that I like you too. Although Im not going to put up with someone that just owns their dishonesty and disloyalty like its not a big deal. If you where talking to other people dont ask for my loyalty I dropped people. I made an effort. Idk what to say. Im trying to tell you what is going on. You were dishonest and asked for my loyalty and didnt give me that back. Im not going to be in a open relationship. You say your sorry after I call you out on it now but not before you defended your right to be there to meet female friends. I dont care that you didnt meet anyone, why your still on there thats shady as fuck and the fact you defended it. If you cared you wouldnt do that and would be able to understand that and I dont think you get that. And I cared enough to call you out on it. I cared enough to take a risk and be honest with you from the start. I compromised, was vulnerable and apologized and took back what I said when I was drunk. If course I wish I had that, but I was willing to make that compromise with you because I saw something with you but maybe I was wrong. Him: I dont know what to say. I already said I'm sorry about the app. I completely understand what you feel about and I'm telling you I will erase it. But what i am concern about is i dont know how i can explain more to make you believe that i really like you and i have not talk to anyone else after. And I dont blame you for anything this is on me. So I dont want you to misunderstand. I really miss you while I'm writing this txt but if this is the end I understand. Me: First you tried to justify you being on the app looking for 'friends' then you said Im sorry you feel that way and tried to justify being there because you had beans and say you didnt talk to anybody now your sorry.... I like you and I miss you too. But to continue this am asking for straight up loyalty and honesty. I feel like this started pretty quickly and we didnt really talk about what we expected and wanted out of a relationship. Communication is a big deal to me. If this is not what you are looking for, if you are not ready for this type of thing and want to find other people by all means. Do so. Please just be honest with me and dont lead me on if I am not someone you want in the long run though. I have feelings and emotions and I can be logical about the situation but I also cannot deny my feelings or deny that I care. What Im saying is please think about this. I like you. But if you dont like me that much or are not honest and blunt as myself dont lead me on, please end it. I don't want to deal with someone who is dishonest. Tell me like it is. Tell me what you expect and please don't play this game. I want to be honest with you. I'm very blunt and I need blunt honesty in return. Don't try make up excuses for bs. If you wanna be on the app and continue looking for 'friends'. Say it, and I'm done. Honest is fucking huge to me. Him: I was always honest with you. So if you wanna continue this relationship I would like to.. Me: Ill continue under the condition that you are honest and loyal as well. If Im in a relationship where I am intimate with someone Im not with other people. If you are not on the same page say so now. So if your using more beans tbh your indenting to make other matches after you ask for my loyalty... thats not okay... and if you did that behind my back if out telling me... what would you do if we continue this... thats dishonest af. You say trust is not made but built.... but if you start out asking for my loyalty but doing this behind my back, how can I trust you? And trust is made over time... but if you crush if from the start you cannot built it... Like did you expect me to be loyal to you but it was okay for you to have a few back ups in case it didnt work out? And if I never found out who cares right? Just dont say things you dont mean I am a very literal person. Your actions speak louder than words. If you say you want loyalty why are you still spending beans in others? You say you wanna continue this and I dont wanna commit to you if your not ready. Him: (my name) I already apologize for that. I dont know why are you keep telling that thing. If you cant take it, told you I understand. Seems like you can't give any trust to me I dont blame you. Me: I don't blame me either. Like I have beans to spend and dates to go on too but I cut that shit off and was honest and loyal with you when you said that. But all you have to say is I don't blame you if you wanna end it like you don't give a fuck. You won't say it you won't give me the truth. Like at this point would you be cool if I continue to see you and call you my bf or whatever that fuck this is and still go on CMB and talk to guy and set up dates? Because I sure as hell wouldn't call my self loyal to anyone or anybodies gf if I was still talking to other people. Or excuse me, attempting to talk to other people because you claim you talk to no one else. Even the attempt is a stab in the back though and I don't think you get that. Him: This is the thing I've been keep saying about. If you cant get over with it I really dont know what to say.. Im also not a person to open easily and yes maybe I was having second thoughts and I told you already I'm sorry that I didn't had same way as you decide to and I wanna try this time since I feel how you think about it. If this is keep coming to bother you I really don't know how I can make you understand.. Really miss you.. I want to keep this relationship if you feel like you can't trust me anymore I understand. Let me know... Me: If your having second thoughts I would rather you have told me upfront and been honest with me not lead me on. It just comes to show you have not respect for me. If Im having second thoughts about someone, I dont ask them to be loyal and then not be myself. Thats not fair at all. The boundaries in this relationship are not clear at all and thats not okay with me. Im not a person that is comfortable being vulnerable and opening up either. No one really is but in order to have a relationship with someone Im not afraid to be honest with someone about who I am. It takes effort over time but Ive gotten there and Im still working on it to this day. Thats not going to stop me from having a relationship and connection with other people especially with a bf in this regard. Im not looking for half assed bs. If you have your having second thoughts say so be blunt about it, Im not some back burner bitch. I dont do half ass shit like this. I dont wanna date multiple people. I wanna be happy with the right person and if you feel like thats not me, do each of us a favor and walk away. Its not a relationship in general that bothers me. Its the way the relationship between you and I has started out with dishonesty is what Im not okay with. You broke my trust. And I notice you dodging my questions like all my questions Im bringing up are not valid points/questions. If you wanna try and diminish this issue instead of sincerely owning up it I dont blame me for walking away one one bit. I dont think just getting over it is what Im going to do. I feel like your not even sorry either your more like defending your dishonesty by saying I was having second thoughts and still had beans to spend like that justifies your actions. It doesn't. I dont just forgive and forget. I can forgive but I dont forget. My trust is built and so far youve broken it. My trust began with you at a neutral level and you have not built it up but torn it down within a very small time frame. Statistically odds are you'll do it again. If you really liked be you wouldnt treat me this way. I really miss and like you too but maybe you need to think about if your having second thoughts about me or not. And if you don't respect who I am wanna treat me this way and be dishonest, this will never work Him: I dont know what to say. I never defend my actions. Tbh i didnt do anything in CMB but didnt wanted to explain and try to look I'm making excuses. I admit it that I didnt erase it and the very first date that you told me about made some hesitation to trust you however I dont blame you for that it just that's me. I dont know how many times I have to say I'm sorry for that and yet you if you are keep telling that i am not sorry, well i guess this wont work. I tried really to make you understand, dont even think that you are the only one who is broken. My heart too is. So if you wanna keep blaming about this not trying to fix or not telling me what to do. I dont know what else I could say. Just tell me if you cant trust me anymore and can't give a chance then I guess I have to blame myself for it. So let me know. Me: Okay let me rephrase for lack of a better term; you attempted to rationalize and justify your actions. You said oh I had beans, oh I was having second thoughts, oh but you said the sugar daddy thing in an attempt to bring up my past actions and put the focus less on you and your dishonesty and disloyalty. I call you out on staying on CMB after you ask for my loyalty and I assume I am in the beginnings of a relationship and am going to try and take a risk. Love doesn't come without pain. And thats not to say love is pain but vulnerability is a sense. You cannot really feel true love and happiness unless you open yourself up to an extent. Remember when I said my respect is earned not granted? Same goes for trust, I want to love, respect and trust you but you have to earn that, I cannot just give it to you, you speak this through your actions. Of course do this with the right people dont just trust anybody. If I'm not the right person for you to open up to then by all means move on. I don't feel like I broke your heart. And yes I've been hurt in the past by many. And I can feel you have been hurt. Although I try my best not allow the hurt and pain from my past to influence my actions and hurt other people nor would I expect you to. Im telling you what to do; Take some time and think about whether you wanna do this. If you are having second thoughts. Leave. If you wanna be an honest respectable man by all means do so. I can tell you right now though, I will not put up with lying, not even white lies. In all honesty, I dont even blame myself for asking you if youd help me financially. I was honest with you and I attempted, you were not okay with this and I compromised. Its not a requirement from me for you to be that way because in the end Im looking for a relationship. I value honesty the most though. You can either appreciate my blunt honesty or not. Im not gonna play games. Again take some time and think about what you wanna do. Because saying Im sorry you feel that way like you were at the beginning of this is not an acknowledgement that you did anything to impact me or is a real apology, you just acknowledging that I just that I feel bad. So when you say this in the bringing and then finally cave and say Im sorry, I have doubts to if I can trust you word or not Him: I already gave you the answer. You are just not accepting. See this thing, keep repeating what I did even tho I said I'm sorry if dont get it I can't help it. I told you I'm sorry that I didnt had same way as you.(tbh I wasnt even sure what you were thinking coz we just started our journey) But now I clearly know that is why i was trying to step forward for myself too and you still think that i dont admit it and trying to make excuse? Well if you keep thinking that way I dont know what you want. Me: I just told you what to do dont say I did not, as I quote; Im telling you what to do; Take some time and think about whether you wanna do this. If you are having second thoughts. Leave. If you wanna be an honest respectable man by all means do so. I can tell you right now though, I will not put up with lying, not even white lies. You can help it. I told you what you did and instead you attempted to justify and rationalize your actions at the beginning. Now you say Im sorry idk what to do. Own up to it at the beginning next time or better yet but honest and dont expect my loyalty if you are not loyal. Keep yourself in check and have integrity. If someone asks for my loyalty and ask me if their my bf and I say yes and agree, I assume its a relationship. If thats not the case, Do not say those words. Do not lead me on and say things you dont mean. If you dont want me that way it as a gf, do not lead me to believe that is the case. If I havent made myself crystal clear already; Take some time and think about whether you wanna do this. If you are having second thoughts. Leave. I told you what I want. I want an honest loyal man I can have respect for. That also means having the integrity to do the right thing even when no one is there to keep you in check except yourself. That means being able to be honest with me even when its tough. That means being able to to walk away and have the human decency not to lead on another human being and waste one anothers time if that isnt you; Walk away. Him: I told you. I gave you my answer. Me: Take a while to think about that like I told you. Take some time to reevaluate if you are in fact what I'm looking for, an honest man with integrity. If you are having second thoughts, maybe I'm not the person for you. Him: Oh my.. (my name) how many times do I have to explain it. I am not having any second thoughts try to look for some other girls. I wasnt even thinking about the app but my action of the consequences that showed I will take it as my responsibility and i admit it and I apologize for it and wanted to step forward to you. If you are just trying to make an excuse to refuse me dont need to. I get it now. I getting tired of this. I made my choice and if you still cant trust, then I think you already made your choice. Me: As I quote from what you had said; this morning; yes maybe I was having second thoughts... So yes, you are having second thoughts, you said it this morning and now your denying it. And if you are by all means don't waste your time! I can tell you right now if I am on a dating app Im lurking and looking for other people. So no, I dont know thats not what your doing on the app and thats shady as fuck if you wanna call this a relationship or call my your gf or have me be loyal to you. Im not trying to make an excuse to refuse you I wish it wasnt this way, but I just dont wanna be lied to and I wont be afraid to call out bs when I see it. I can't trust, you earn that. I hope you can understand that. Him: You cant really get over for it even tho I try to explain. Then i guess I cant really do anything. I told you i made my choice and told you I do like to go forward. But you still keep repeating that what you said, now you deny, then you said.. You know what I didnt deny anything didnt wanted to look like making an excuse or anything and you only think as what you want to believe I guess. My words are worthless for now I dont blame you I guess you cant just get over with it. Then it not me needs to think. Maybe you should ask yourself if you can or not. I am telling you. I made my choice. Me: You say you wanna go forward but you don't want to admit you're denying things and then you say 'well idk what to do, you won't get over it, sorry you feel that way.' I don't just think what I believe Im thinking what I am seeing. I'm even giving you evidence. You don't blame me why? Because I called your ass out and your denying it and trying to tell me to just get over it. I don't blame me either. I've already thought. I know what I'm not going to put up with. And if you are not on the same page with my simple expectations then leave. Its really inconsiderate and unempathetic of you to tell me to just get over it. Trust takes time like you said and you broke it. I can forgive but I do not forget. You earn my trust it doesn't just come back over night. There was no communication on what this really was and tbh it happened really fast. I don't really even know what to call it because I thought it was a relationship for obvious reasons and apparently I was mistaken. Him: Hailey. I dont know why this is keep repeating txt back and forth. I already gave you my answer. If you dont want me say no. If you still wanna try out just say yes. I understand what you worried about ""relationship"" and I am on same page as you. So tell me what if you wanna continue with me or not. **the next 12 hours I dont reply *** Him: (my name)... Are you still thinking? Me: What do you mean you dont know why? Im proving a point and call you out on bs and youre dodging my points by saying idk what to say stop repeating yourself, I appolagize if you cant take it. Thats not a straight apology. Thats a slap in the face, a backhanded apology. Its not sincere. I dont think you see this or maybe you know you do it. You just dont care enough to admit it. Stop playing mind games and own up to your bs. When you start out with an insincere apology as soon as I call you out your mistake it makes me lose trust in your ability to even sincerely own up to your mistakes. You seem to have a difficult time doing that, which as to do with you having a difficult time opening up as you previously mentioned and being vulnerable. This doesnt just make you immature emotionally it also makes you not ready for a successful relationship. In all honesty youre an interesting case, not in a good way. You wont have a successful relationship if you cannot be vulnerable with anyone. It will fall apart. You need to increase your emotional strength. You will either be hurt in the end, or you will end up hurting someone else, which you dont seem to care about based on your actions and half hearted apologies. Even at the end of your messages you wanna jump straight to saying if you think you cannot do this then I guess thats it. Or it seems like you cannot give me any trust, I dont blame you. Like its my fault I cannot trust you.... your deflecting the blame.... and you want me to drop it. If your doing these things this early on, Im willing to bet youll do it again. And saying I wont blame you is just like saying I dont blame you for walking away its not like I wont do it again if you do give me another chance again, I dont blame you, Im a broken man anyways. Idk who hurt you or why you cannot just be honest with me but its not my fault. Im not going to be in some relationship with blurred lines and have someone call me their gf when thats not this case. I really like you, youre smart, youre funny, we vibe but I dont want to continue if you cannot be honest and have integrity or even give my a straight sincere answer that you will do so. If you cannot give me that or even say you will. If your too broken to be vulnerable in a relationship them dont waste my time. Youve got some work to do Him: ??? I think you completely misunderstand. I mean I am stepping forward and want to build that relationship as what you believe what I use to believe. Honest and sincere to each other and try our best to keep it. I dont know where you misunderstand I am really feeling like you just dont wanna continue this and trying to make more reasons not to continue.. If that is what you think then I guess this is it. I do like you. I'm sure you know that. Im not playing games. I never play games when it comes to relationship and yes maybe I fucked it up wasnt thinking that deeply enough hurt you. I've been keep admitting everything and yet you are telling I deny it so looks like you just dont wanna listen to my voice anymore.. Me: What you used to believe? So you no longer believe in that anymore. Youre so vague. You want me to ask so I guess I will, what its it you no longer believe that I supposably do? Please elaborate. No (his name), I did not misunderstand and I called you on your bs and you cant admit it. You wanna forget about it, ignore it, deflect the blame, make it my problem, instead of taking responsibility for your own actions, giving a sincere apology for the both of us and connecting with me. And to try our best to keep it? How about we dont make excuses for ourselves to start off and actual make sure we do it right to eliminate the error of this being a train wreck in the first place. Because thats just going to be a head ache of both of us. Especially me. Maybe you should take a closer look at that I wrote you and think about it. Thank me later when you figure yourself out. You were not thinking hard enough to deeply hurt me. But enough for you to not hurt yourself or feel any shame which hurts me in the process, but you dont seem to see this. Im not making reasons not to continue because I dont want a relationship with you. If I didnt care about being successful with you, I wouldnt point any of this out. Id simply walk away, I wouldnt care. However, I care enough to not walk into a train wreak with you and if thats what the facts are showing me, Im not going to do it. If I wasn't listening to your voice I wouldn't be continuing to call you out on your illogical 'points.' We wouldnt have this issue if it was my fault, I can move and admit my mistakes. And if you think this is all my fault, which its not, then I guess thats it. ~ So he finally calls me I answer and we talk it out and I just say okay fine because he want to continue and so do I. I also told him if he is having second thought say so now dont lead me on, he said he wants to keep going. So after all this bs and arguing for two days we stay together. I get a little distant. We finally meet up two days later and when he comes over and is at my door with a rose for me and some wine I like. So its like love bombing all over again, huge red flag. Then when he drops me off at my house after coming back from his house he mentions how far it is to drive over and idk how much longer I can do this... Its like a 40 minute drive to my place. Ive dated guys that live further like three hours away and we saw each other less but still made it work. On the same day he also meantions how the culture gap between us might be too big. Like Ive dated guys with different cultural backgrounds before just fine, so when he says this I just say okay well if it too much for you break it off and hes like nah thats not what I meant.... its cancer.. So Im struggling because Im falling in love and it doesnt feel good. I just want outta this. TLDR; Met this guy on a dating app. We vibe we slept together on the first date. He asked me if Id be loyal to him and if he was my bf. I said yes. We had a disagreement on morals on the first night. He thought we should just be friends due to that. I have picked up on signs he is a narcissist, not respecting boundaries, silent treatment, crazy making conversations putting the blame on me being overly materialistic."

Do these messages/treatment seem familiar to you?,1,e4jlob,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/e4jlob/how_do_i_make_a_clean_break_from_this_narcissist/,2019-12-02 03:31:55,"TLDR AT END; Met this guy on a dating app. We vibe we slept together on the first date. He asked me if Id be loyal to him and if he was my bf. I said yes. We had a disagreement on morals on the first night. He thought we should just be friends due to that. So after the first night he text me this: Him: I hope you find your happiness. Had fun tho. Me: I hope you find happiness too. I like you but if this is good bye I don't blame you. Him: I dont blame you either. I like you too but I guess we have a different values at this time. Hope you the best :) ***So not gonna lie my stupid ass could have easily cut this off here... but for some reason I couldnt just leave it at that... I like you but... I like him a lot too, Ill admit that, this is why Im having such a hard time walking away.*** Me after stressing out all morning: Wait so like you don't like me cause of what I said last night? Just be blunt honest please. I know its wrong of me to expect you to give me anything like a car. That was way out of line I shouldn't have said that. And we vibe though this sucks. Again if you totally want to cut this I understand it hurts but I like you and I think we vibe. Anyway just be blunt honest if you don't wanna continue because I do. Him: We can still friends if you want I thought I did have same page as you. I dont know how you start and keep the relationship but I'm pretty conservative when it comes with the money. I get it you dont have enough and struggling but as you said last night if you are looking for a sugar daddy then I'm not that person that you are looking for. I'm not blaming you trying to judge anything I'm just telling you the truth that I'm not that guy and I never date in that way. But I am telling you I really had a good time and good vibes with you. If you want we can be friends :) Me: Thank you for your honesty I wish you the best. Him: No thank you. Call me when you wanna have some beer Me: I didn't mean that I was drunk and I'm sorry I said that. I know I sounded like a complete idiot last night and now. I start a relationship the way it should start and I like you and I think we vibe. I'm not looking for a sugar daddy I just want someone I vibe with and a real relationship I shouldn't have said what I said last night. I was probably just trying to push you away because I was scared. Its rare to find someone I like and I like you. Him: You know I like you too. You must be really tired. Me: I was kinda tired this morning but I got some energy. Wbu? If you like me and I like you why are you saying you just wanna be friends? Like I don't want some friends with benefits I want something real. I told you I'm sorry. Just be straight up with me because I really like you and I don't wanna be led on and I said sorry and Idk what to do or say. I shouldn't have said the money thing, thats not how I am. Him: You know I didnt mean friends for benefits. I just wanted to know and feel you more that's it. Let's meet again whenever we have time then. :) ~ So from this forward we are flirting and still in this relationship, with all the I miss yous and the sex and yeh. As the texts reflect, I said I didnt mean what I said I was drunk about and I think we vibe and should be more than friends. We continue to see each other. About a week later I asked him if he was still on the dating app. He made a joke about me saying now he cannot have female friends. Thats not what I was intending to say and I clarified for him that I dont think people should need to find friends on a dating app if they are with someone else. Hes still active on the app. I dont want to be so insecure about this but if he is still talking to other people, I am a monogamous, honest person and I want my partner to be the same. I dont think thats too much to ask. Im looking for the right person, not the wrong one. I think I may have to break this off, I dont want to, I really like this guy, but I cannot do the dishonesty and lies. For context He is 35M I am 22F. I met him on November 18th.,Hes very materialistic, puts a lot into his appearance/clothes, its like he is trying to look younger. In fact I even notice on his dating profile his age says 31, but in his bio hes like Im 35 cannot erase.. On the bright side he is really smart and he seems to vibe with my personality well... that could also be the social chameleon in both of us though idk. I also notice he gets very energetic and raises his voice when he is trying to prove a point like he doesnt need to talk that loud I can hear him just fine. Its not even if we are arguing in a bad way we could just be having a healthy debate with different views or I could be on the same side as him and still throw him counter claims saying well what about this, but he like has to be right... and his claims are normally logical but sometimes he dont wanna hear counterclaims, I find that weak. I have tried to break it off after I picked up on a few signs. I just want this to be over with but my ego always has me coming back to prove myself. He has this addictive personality that makes me wanna go back. I like pleasing him and making him happy, I will say I kinda feel like Im walking on egg shells. If I say one wrong thing or set a boundary, he like doesnt wanna talk to me anymore. I told him not to text me too early in the morning when he said good morning because it wakes me up, not because I dont wanna hear from him, I just dont wanna be woken up prematurely. This resulted in oh sorry and he just didnt text me the rest of the day which is out of the ordinary for him and I finally just texted him. He also doesnt really plan with me, he like expects me to drop my shit and have him come over. I have a very busy schedule and so does he, 12-10 hour days are not uncommon. He forgot about our first date, and I ended up conforting him about it. Like we set a day and he didnt text me until like five PM that day and I had to get up super early the next day so I found that disrespectful and didnt reply until the next day. He didnt apologize or anything he just set another date, I noticed this but I just brushed it off. So after a while of noticing these signs and I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that we should just break it off after all this; ~ Me: Hey I don't think we should talk anymore. I'm not your girlfriend and I'm not loyal to you anymore. Him: Any reason? Me: I dont think youre honest with me. And I thought about it for a while and if your still looking for friends on the CMB app, thats just not something Im okay with if you want my loyalty. I feel like what be have lacks boundaries and thats not the type of relationship Im looking for. Him: Ok. I'm sorry if you felt that way. I was going to erase the CMB anyway I just used some last beans that I have left in there. I do have same reasons because as I told you trust cant be made but should be build. If you think you cant do this then I guess this is it. Me: Thats a lame excuse to continue finding other people and having a few back ups in case it doesnt work out. I personally believe in taking a risk with someone. I want to find something real. Ill admit I only deactivated my account and stop talking to every match. I blew off a few dates too. I took that risk in hopes that I would have found the same honesty and integrity I have expressed from you as well. Again, I cannot do the dishonesty. Him: I understand. I'm sorry again if you felt that way. But I hope you understand also that we need some time to build up this. Remember when the first time you said you were looking for sugar daddy, I told you I am not that person and you said you were just drunk and I told you the next time when we met we will need time to build our trust to each other. Trust builds up inside not made by.. **OKAY FOR CONTEXT I ASKED HIM IF HED LIKE BUY ME A CAR WHEN I WAS SHIT FACE DRUNK... (Im a poor college student) I SHOULDNT HAVE BUT I DID IT AND I APOLOGIZED FOR IT PROFUSELY AFTER I DID THIS.** Me: I believe trust needs time too but I cannot do the lies from the start. If you're gonna lie from the beginning and stay on the app talking to other women after you ask for my loyalty in return how can you expect to to trust you in from the start? When you ask for my loyalty I meant that. But dont abuse it, dont dishonor it. And with the sugar daddy thing again I was drunk. I'm not gonna lie and say I'm not struggling. I tried and you were not okay with being that way. That was okay with me, I compromised, because I really liked who you were. I thought you were honest. But apparently you could not take that risk. If your not gonna be honest and continue to be lurking Im not gonna be intimate and fuck. I dont want an open relationship I dont want to wait and see. If its not right for you be honest with me, dont lead me on. I can be vulnerable, I have emotions and feelings. But I don't want to be intimate with someone I'm not serious about. Anyways I dont know why I like you so much but I do. I dont really like the concept of modern dating and having to weed through all the hypocrites. You ask for honesty in your profile, you say your honest yourself and your not. Him: I totally understand and I apologize if I hurt your feelings. But I want you to know I really like you and I didnt lie anything about it to you. Me: If you really liked me as much as you claim you wouldnt be leading me on continuing to talk to other people. If you really liked me you wouldnt ask for my loyalty and then not give me that in return as well. If your really liked me you could take that risk. And you saying 'I'm sorry you feel that way' is not an acknowledgement that you did anything to impact me, just that I feel bad. Him: I apologize for that and if you can't take it. I wont blame. And if you cant believe that I like you, I dont know how I can make you believe with it. Me: Its not your responsibility to apologize for what I choose not to deal with. You dont apologize for your action, you apologize to put the blame on me and my feelings like its my fault you cannot commit after you want my loyalty. Youre not actually sorry. You cannot make me believe or respect what you do not even mean yourself. Him: I think you totally misunderstand. This is the thing. I apologize for what made you feel bad when i didnt erase my CMB. That's it. And technically I didnt even talk with anyone in there after. I am not blaming you for anything so I dont know what you are talking about. All I said was it takes time for us to build but I am telling you again if you cant trust me anymore then I was telling that I can't help it. Me: You didn't talk to anyone after but you didn't assure me of that instead you try to 'joke' about it and say how you cannot have any female friends thats not the case. A dating app is not where I'd meet guy friends or where I'd expect someone I want to be with to meet girl friends. So how am I supposed to know you where not talking to anybody. You didn't assure me of this and you were not willing to take that risk. I asked because I care and I like you. You say you care but your so eggar to end this more than I am in every least sentence of your messages. And yes you put the blame on me by saying 'I'm sorry you feel that way.' Again, 'I'm sorry you feel that way' is not an acknowledgement that you did anything to impact me, just that I feel bad. Him: I dont really get it. I said I'm sorry that I didn't erase the app and if was talking to someone and dating with other people, the moment you said to you dont wanna meet me I probably gonna say ok. But I am trying to understand what is goin on and figuring this matter. And like I said if you cant trust me I really dont know what I can do.. Me: No you dont get it. And every last sentence you leave in your messages you leave the ball in my court like its all my fault for calling you on your bs. I like you this is what sucks, this is why its so difficult and you know that I like you too. Although Im not going to put up with someone that just owns their dishonesty and disloyalty like its not a big deal. If you where talking to other people dont ask for my loyalty I dropped people. I made an effort. Idk what to say. Im trying to tell you what is going on. You were dishonest and asked for my loyalty and didnt give me that back. Im not going to be in a open relationship. You say your sorry after I call you out on it now but not before you defended your right to be there to meet female friends. I dont care that you didnt meet anyone, why your still on there thats shady as fuck and the fact you defended it. If you cared you wouldnt do that and would be able to understand that and I dont think you get that. And I cared enough to call you out on it. I cared enough to take a risk and be honest with you from the start. I compromised, was vulnerable and apologized and took back what I said when I was drunk. If course I wish I had that, but I was willing to make that compromise with you because I saw something with you but maybe I was wrong. Him: I dont know what to say. I already said I'm sorry about the app. I completely understand what you feel about and I'm telling you I will erase it. But what i am concern about is i dont know how i can explain more to make you believe that i really like you and i have not talk to anyone else after. And I dont blame you for anything this is on me. So I dont want you to misunderstand. I really miss you while I'm writing this txt but if this is the end I understand. Me: First you tried to justify you being on the app looking for 'friends' then you said Im sorry you feel that way and tried to justify being there because you had beans and say you didnt talk to anybody now your sorry.... I like you and I miss you too. But to continue this am asking for straight up loyalty and honesty. I feel like this started pretty quickly and we didnt really talk about what we expected and wanted out of a relationship. Communication is a big deal to me. If this is not what you are looking for, if you are not ready for this type of thing and want to find other people by all means. Do so. Please just be honest with me and dont lead me on if I am not someone you want in the long run though. I have feelings and emotions and I can be logical about the situation but I also cannot deny my feelings or deny that I care. What Im saying is please think about this. I like you. But if you dont like me that much or are not honest and blunt as myself dont lead me on, please end it. I don't want to deal with someone who is dishonest. Tell me like it is. Tell me what you expect and please don't play this game. I want to be honest with you. I'm very blunt and I need blunt honesty in return. Don't try make up excuses for bs. If you wanna be on the app and continue looking for 'friends'. Say it, and I'm done. Honest is fucking huge to me. Him: I was always honest with you. So if you wanna continue this relationship I would like to.. Me: Ill continue under the condition that you are honest and loyal as well. If Im in a relationship where I am intimate with someone Im not with other people. If you are not on the same page say so now. So if your using more beans tbh your indenting to make other matches after you ask for my loyalty... thats not okay... and if you did that behind my back if out telling me... what would you do if we continue this... thats dishonest af. You say trust is not made but built.... but if you start out asking for my loyalty but doing this behind my back, how can I trust you? And trust is made over time... but if you crush if from the start you cannot built it... Like did you expect me to be loyal to you but it was okay for you to have a few back ups in case it didnt work out? And if I never found out who cares right? Just dont say things you dont mean I am a very literal person. Your actions speak louder than words. If you say you want loyalty why are you still spending beans in others? You say you wanna continue this and I dont wanna commit to you if your not ready. Him: (my name) I already apologize for that. I dont know why are you keep telling that thing. If you cant take it, told you I understand. Seems like you can't give any trust to me I dont blame you. Me: I don't blame me either. Like I have beans to spend and dates to go on too but I cut that shit off and was honest and loyal with you when you said that. But all you have to say is I don't blame you if you wanna end it like you don't give a fuck. You won't say it you won't give me the truth. Like at this point would you be cool if I continue to see you and call you my bf or whatever that fuck this is and still go on CMB and talk to guy and set up dates? Because I sure as hell wouldn't call my self loyal to anyone or anybodies gf if I was still talking to other people. Or excuse me, attempting to talk to other people because you claim you talk to no one else. Even the attempt is a stab in the back though and I don't think you get that. Him: This is the thing I've been keep saying about. If you cant get over with it I really dont know what to say.. Im also not a person to open easily and yes maybe I was having second thoughts and I told you already I'm sorry that I didn't had same way as you decide to and I wanna try this time since I feel how you think about it. If this is keep coming to bother you I really don't know how I can make you understand.. Really miss you.. I want to keep this relationship if you feel like you can't trust me anymore I understand. Let me know... Me: If your having second thoughts I would rather you have told me upfront and been honest with me not lead me on. It just comes to show you have not respect for me. If Im having second thoughts about someone, I dont ask them to be loyal and then not be myself. Thats not fair at all. The boundaries in this relationship are not clear at all and thats not okay with me. Im not a person that is comfortable being vulnerable and opening up either. No one really is but in order to have a relationship with someone Im not afraid to be honest with someone about who I am. It takes effort over time but Ive gotten there and Im still working on it to this day. Thats not going to stop me from having a relationship and connection with other people especially with a bf in this regard. Im not looking for half assed bs. If you have your having second thoughts say so be blunt about it, Im not some back burner bitch. I dont do half ass shit like this. I dont wanna date multiple people. I wanna be happy with the right person and if you feel like thats not me, do each of us a favor and walk away. Its not a relationship in general that bothers me. Its the way the relationship between you and I has started out with dishonesty is what Im not okay with. You broke my trust. And I notice you dodging my questions like all my questions Im bringing up are not valid points/questions. If you wanna try and diminish this issue instead of sincerely owning up it I dont blame me for walking away one one bit. I dont think just getting over it is what Im going to do. I feel like your not even sorry either your more like defending your dishonesty by saying I was having second thoughts and still had beans to spend like that justifies your actions. It doesn't. I dont just forgive and forget. I can forgive but I dont forget. My trust is built and so far youve broken it. My trust began with you at a neutral level and you have not built it up but torn it down within a very small time frame. Statistically odds are you'll do it again. If you really liked be you wouldnt treat me this way. I really miss and like you too but maybe you need to think about if your having second thoughts about me or not. And if you don't respect who I am wanna treat me this way and be dishonest, this will never work Him: I dont know what to say. I never defend my actions. Tbh i didnt do anything in CMB but didnt wanted to explain and try to look I'm making excuses. I admit it that I didnt erase it and the very first date that you told me about made some hesitation to trust you however I dont blame you for that it just that's me. I dont know how many times I have to say I'm sorry for that and yet you if you are keep telling that i am not sorry, well i guess this wont work. I tried really to make you understand, dont even think that you are the only one who is broken. My heart too is. So if you wanna keep blaming about this not trying to fix or not telling me what to do. I dont know what else I could say. Just tell me if you cant trust me anymore and can't give a chance then I guess I have to blame myself for it. So let me know. Me: Okay let me rephrase for lack of a better term; you attempted to rationalize and justify your actions. You said oh I had beans, oh I was having second thoughts, oh but you said the sugar daddy thing in an attempt to bring up my past actions and put the focus less on you and your dishonesty and disloyalty. I call you out on staying on CMB after you ask for my loyalty and I assume I am in the beginnings of a relationship and am going to try and take a risk. Love doesn't come without pain. And thats not to say love is pain but vulnerability is a sense. You cannot really feel true love and happiness unless you open yourself up to an extent. Remember when I said my respect is earned not granted? Same goes for trust, I want to love, respect and trust you but you have to earn that, I cannot just give it to you, you speak this through your actions. Of course do this with the right people dont just trust anybody. If I'm not the right person for you to open up to then by all means move on. I don't feel like I broke your heart. And yes I've been hurt in the past by many. And I can feel you have been hurt. Although I try my best not allow the hurt and pain from my past to influence my actions and hurt other people nor would I expect you to. Im telling you what to do; Take some time and think about whether you wanna do this. If you are having second thoughts. Leave. If you wanna be an honest respectable man by all means do so. I can tell you right now though, I will not put up with lying, not even white lies. In all honesty, I dont even blame myself for asking you if youd help me financially. I was honest with you and I attempted, you were not okay with this and I compromised. Its not a requirement from me for you to be that way because in the end Im looking for a relationship. I value honesty the most though. You can either appreciate my blunt honesty or not. Im not gonna play games. Again take some time and think about what you wanna do. Because saying Im sorry you feel that way like you were at the beginning of this is not an acknowledgement that you did anything to impact me or is a real apology, you just acknowledging that I just that I feel bad. So when you say this in the bringing and then finally cave and say Im sorry, I have doubts to if I can trust you word or not Him: I already gave you the answer. You are just not accepting. See this thing, keep repeating what I did even tho I said I'm sorry if dont get it I can't help it. I told you I'm sorry that I didnt had same way as you.(tbh I wasnt even sure what you were thinking coz we just started our journey) But now I clearly know that is why i was trying to step forward for myself too and you still think that i dont admit it and trying to make excuse? Well if you keep thinking that way I dont know what you want. Me: I just told you what to do dont say I did not, as I quote; Im telling you what to do; Take some time and think about whether you wanna do this. If you are having second thoughts. Leave. If you wanna be an honest respectable man by all means do so. I can tell you right now though, I will not put up with lying, not even white lies. You can help it. I told you what you did and instead you attempted to justify and rationalize your actions at the beginning. Now you say Im sorry idk what to do. Own up to it at the beginning next time or better yet but honest and dont expect my loyalty if you are not loyal. Keep yourself in check and have integrity. If someone asks for my loyalty and ask me if their my bf and I say yes and agree, I assume its a relationship. If thats not the case, Do not say those words. Do not lead me on and say things you dont mean. If you dont want me that way it as a gf, do not lead me to believe that is the case. If I havent made myself crystal clear already; Take some time and think about whether you wanna do this. If you are having second thoughts. Leave. I told you what I want. I want an honest loyal man I can have respect for. That also means having the integrity to do the right thing even when no one is there to keep you in check except yourself. That means being able to be honest with me even when its tough. That means being able to to walk away and have the human decency not to lead on another human being and waste one anothers time if that isnt you; Walk away. Him: I told you. I gave you my answer. Me: Take a while to think about that like I told you. Take some time to reevaluate if you are in fact what I'm looking for, an honest man with integrity. If you are having second thoughts, maybe I'm not the person for you. Him: Oh my.. (my name) how many times do I have to explain it. I am not having any second thoughts try to look for some other girls. I wasnt even thinking about the app but my action of the consequences that showed I will take it as my responsibility and i admit it and I apologize for it and wanted to step forward to you. If you are just trying to make an excuse to refuse me dont need to. I get it now. I getting tired of this. I made my choice and if you still cant trust, then I think you already made your choice. Me: As I quote from what you had said; this morning; yes maybe I was having second thoughts... So yes, you are having second thoughts, you said it this morning and now your denying it. And if you are by all means don't waste your time! I can tell you right now if I am on a dating app Im lurking and looking for other people. So no, I dont know thats not what your doing on the app and thats shady as fuck if you wanna call this a relationship or call my your gf or have me be loyal to you. Im not trying to make an excuse to refuse you I wish it wasnt this way, but I just dont wanna be lied to and I wont be afraid to call out bs when I see it. I can't trust, you earn that. I hope you can understand that. Him: You cant really get over for it even tho I try to explain. Then i guess I cant really do anything. I told you i made my choice and told you I do like to go forward. But you still keep repeating that what you said, now you deny, then you said.. You know what I didnt deny anything didnt wanted to look like making an excuse or anything and you only think as what you want to believe I guess. My words are worthless for now I dont blame you I guess you cant just get over with it. Then it not me needs to think. Maybe you should ask yourself if you can or not. I am telling you. I made my choice. Me: You say you wanna go forward but you don't want to admit you're denying things and then you say 'well idk what to do, you won't get over it, sorry you feel that way.' I don't just think what I believe Im thinking what I am seeing. I'm even giving you evidence. You don't blame me why? Because I called your ass out and your denying it and trying to tell me to just get over it. I don't blame me either. I've already thought. I know what I'm not going to put up with. And if you are not on the same page with my simple expectations then leave. Its really inconsiderate and unempathetic of you to tell me to just get over it. Trust takes time like you said and you broke it. I can forgive but I do not forget. You earn my trust it doesn't just come back over night. There was no communication on what this really was and tbh it happened really fast. I don't really even know what to call it because I thought it was a relationship for obvious reasons and apparently I was mistaken. Him: Hailey. I dont know why this is keep repeating txt back and forth. I already gave you my answer. If you dont want me say no. If you still wanna try out just say yes. I understand what you worried about ""relationship"" and I am on same page as you. So tell me what if you wanna continue with me or not. *the next 12 hours I dont reply* Him: (my name)... Are you still thinking? Me: What do you mean you dont know why? Im proving a point and call you out on bs and youre dodging my points by saying idk what to say stop repeating yourself, I appolagize if you cant take it. Thats not a straight apology. Thats a slap in the face, a backhanded apology. Its not sincere. I dont think you see this or maybe you know you do it. You just dont care enough to admit it. Stop playing mind games and own up to your bs. When you start out with an insincere apology as soon as I call you out your mistake it makes me lose trust in your ability to even sincerely own up to your mistakes. You seem to have a difficult time doing that, which as to do with you having a difficult time opening up as you previously mentioned and being vulnerable. This doesnt just make you immature emotionally it also makes you not ready for a successful relationship. In all honesty youre an interesting case, not in a good way. You wont have a successful relationship if you cannot be vulnerable with anyone. It will fall apart. You need to increase your emotional strength. You will either be hurt in the end, or you will end up hurting someone else, which you dont seem to care about based on your actions and half hearted apologies. Even at the end of your messages you wanna jump straight to saying if you think you cannot do this then I guess thats it. Or it seems like you cannot give me any trust, I dont blame you. Like its my fault I cannot trust you.... your deflecting the blame.... and you want me to drop it. If your doing these things this early on, Im willing to bet youll do it again. And saying I wont blame you is just like saying I dont blame you for walking away its not like I wont do it again if you do give me another chance again, I dont blame you, Im a broken man anyways. Idk who hurt you or why you cannot just be honest with me but its not my fault. Im not going to be in some relationship with blurred lines and have someone call me their gf when thats not this case. I really like you, youre smart, youre funny, we vibe but I dont want to continue if you cannot be honest and have integrity or even give my a straight sincere answer that you will do so. If you cannot give me that or even say you will. If your too broken to be vulnerable in a relationship them dont waste my time. Youve got some work to do Him: ??? I think you completely misunderstand. I mean I am stepping forward and want to build that relationship as what you believe what I use to believe. Honest and sincere to each other and try our best to keep it. I dont know where you misunderstand I am really feeling like you just dont wanna continue this and trying to make more reasons not to continue.. If that is what you think then I guess this is it. I do like you. I'm sure you know that. Im not playing games. I never play games when it comes to relationship and yes maybe I fucked it up wasnt thinking that deeply enough hurt you. I've been keep admitting everything and yet you are telling I deny it so looks like you just dont wanna listen to my voice anymore.. Me: What you used to believe? So you no longer believe in that anymore. Youre so vague. You want me to ask so I guess I will, what its it you no longer believe that I supposably do? Please elaborate. No (his name), I did not misunderstand and I called you on your bs and you cant admit it. You wanna forget about it, ignore it, deflect the blame, make it my problem, instead of taking responsibility for your own actions, giving a sincere apology for the both of us and connecting with me. And to try our best to keep it? How about we dont make excuses for ourselves to start off and actual make sure we do it right to eliminate the error of this being a train wreck in the first place. Because thats just going to be a head ache of both of us. Especially me. Maybe you should take a closer look at that I wrote you and think about it. Thank me later when you figure yourself out. You were not thinking hard enough to deeply hurt me. But enough for you to not hurt yourself or feel any shame which hurts me in the process, but you dont seem to see this. Im not making reasons not to continue because I dont want a relationship with you. If I didnt care about being successful with you, I wouldnt point any of this out. Id simply walk away, I wouldnt care. However, I care enough to not walk into a train wreak with you and if thats what the facts are showing me, Im not going to do it. If I wasn't listening to your voice I wouldn't be continuing to call you out on your illogical 'points.' We wouldnt have this issue if it was my fault, I can move and admit my mistakes. And if you think this is all my fault, which its not, then I guess thats it. ~ So he finally calls me I answer and we talk it out and I just say okay fine because he want to continue and so do I. I also told him if he is having second thought say so now dont lead me on, he said he wants to keep going. So after all this bs and arguing for two days we stay together. I get a little distant. We finally meet up two days later and when he comes over and is at my door with a rose for me and some wine I like. So its like love bombing all over again, huge red flag. Then when he drops me off at my house after coming back from his house he mentions how far it is to drive over and idk how much longer I can do this... Its like a 40 minute drive to my place. Ive dated guys that live further like three hours away and we saw each other less but still made it work. On the same day he also meantions how the culture gap between us might be too big. Like Ive dated guys with different cultural backgrounds before just fine, so when he says this I just say okay well if it too much for you break it off and hes like nah thats not what I meant.... its cancer.. So Im struggling because Im falling in love and it doesnt feel good. I just want outta this. TLDR; Met this guy on a dating app. We vibe we slept together on the first date. He asked me if Id be loyal to him and if he was my bf. I said yes. We had a disagreement on morals on the first night. He thought we should just be friends due to that. I have picked up on signs he is a narcissist, not respecting boundaries, silent treatment, crazy making conversations putting the blame on me being overly materialistic."
62,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,My reality is fucked,2,dm32dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/dm32dp/my_reality_is_fucked/,2019-10-24 05:01:57,"4 months ago my bf(22m) cheated on me(24f) and we are now going through reconciliation. I've been getting paranoid these days and felt like it was time to get a therapist, and now I don't know if I can trust my therapist either. Immediately she set a goal to let go of him, aren't therapists supposed to help you question yourself and help you lead to that?? Now she has put the idea in my head that he is a narcissist, so I'm all around a mess. WHAT HAPPENED: We had only been officially dating for 1.5 months. I would have NEVER seen this coming. We were good, yes maybe I was working a lot, but we were fine... this was supposed to be the honeymoon phase. We got really close, really fast (apparently that's a red flag). Things that have me believe he might be dangerous are the facts of his past: got a girl pregnant when he was 15, got fired from his job because he was interacting with one of the interns (but he was also an intern soooo fuzzy line there, she had just graduated high school, he told me he liked the taboo..., and this was who he had an affair with.... also they were previous fwb), he always seeks affirmation, constant love bombing? (but like how do you know the person isn't just being nice..?? I told him, that I need more reassurance so now he's always telling me all of these feelings he has for me), his dad cheated on his mom (really fucked up childhood), and most importantly... I told him how much honesty meant to me on our first date (I had previously been cheated on). WHY I GOT BACK WITH HIM: After a couple weeks of grieving, I decided to move forward and try and make things work with him. He confessed (a narc wouldn't do that right?), he told me every detail to make sure there was no trickle truth, he owned up to the two affairs. He owned up to cheating on three of his previous gfs (proclaimed he's never confessed and this is the first time he's seen it as something he needs to work on). HE was the one that called himself a serial cheater. HE was the one that decided to go to therapy and has been going since July (he now just cut it down to bi-weekly). He gave me access to his social media accounts, he's offered full transparency. He apologizes, he apologized while I was ""sleeping"" the other night. He cries. We always discuss things maturely. He talked to me about how his past has made him feel, he talks about his current feelings, he's not afraid to show vulnerability. He's been taking the criticism well, never defensive, always forgiving. He honestly seems to be very angry with himself. Leaving out a lot of emotions. Is it actually crazy to think he wants to change?"

How he is completely NOT who I thought he was. I just feel defeated. So MAD. I just found out yet another thing, and it's taking everything I have not to blow up his phone. I am currently 23 days NC... I want to go a lifetime but I'm just FUMING right now. I wish he'd change his passwords so I wouldn't check... I have no self-control. I want to say this to him so damn bad but I know he probably wouldn't reply anyway and I'll feel worse, right? Our last correspondence was him saying we should stop sleeping together and just work on our friendship and I said no thanks, not interested in that anymore after everything he has done. He said ""sorry you feel that way"" and ""And for the record I don't think I did anything wrong."" GOD I want to send this to him after what I just found out. (another woman that he lied about....) You're the biggest liar and biggest fuckin' asshole I've ever met in my entire life. I'm glad to know now I was never wrong about you. You pretend to be the nice guy, doing ""nothing wrong"" but you're a piece of shit. Fuck you for everything. Fuck you for taking advantage of my trust, my vulnerability, my feelings for you. Fuck you for using me to make yourself feel better. Fuck you for invalidating my feelings every time I let it be known I was on to you and your stupid shit. You're lucky I don't destroy you to all our coworkers. You've now done this to me THREE TIMES and that's a lifetime I'll now suffer of never trusting anyone again. A lifetime of never wanting to be vulnerable again. I worked years on building up my self esteem and trust in people and you have taken that all away from me. Probably forever. FUCK YOU for that. Good luck in life, I hope one day you'll realize the hurt you have caused people or one day feel it yourself times a thousand."
64,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Time to jump ship,4,d3aog7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/d3aog7/time_to_jump_ship/,2019-09-13 02:47:40,"My partner and I have been together for a year and a half, and the entire thing has been the wildest ride. Let's just say that I met him, at one of the worst times in my life, and one of the best points of vulnerability for him to sneak through. He was such a nice guy when I met him, but at the same time had a way of pushing my boundaries. The first real sign is when I told him I never had sex without condoms, which of course became his first goal. He managed to make me feel like that wasn't reasonable, and that I shouldn't hold him to that standard. Yup. Red flag #1. We knew each other for 6 months before dating. Our relationship started as we were definitely going to date, until he realized he wasn't at a point in his life for that. He told me he just needed a friend, and that I was one of the coolest people he had met. ""Cool. Fine. We can be friends, but can I hear the reason why you won't date me, when two hours ago you were asking me to move to you?""(I lived 3.5 hrs away and was driving to see him every weekend). ""I dont have to answer that question and if you respected me you wouldn't ask"". Okay.... I felt like I was clearly coming off as needy, so I attempted to back off. But he still constantly talked to me. He would call at 3 in the morning, talking about how rough his life was and that he just wanted someone that cared. He wanted me to come see him every weekend, (which meant 7 hrs total drive for me, around $100 in gas, and another $100 in food for both of us the weekend, because he didnt have a job, since he was just trying to get through his last year of school). He got extremely jealous if I said I was even talking to another guy. He kept acting like he wanted all the benefits if a relationship, without the title. But when I would just casually ask why the dynamic was that way, I was pushing him, I wasnt respecting him, I was being needy and crazy. Red flag #2. So, after being ""best friends"" on and off for 6 months, he finally came around to the idea of dating. Coincidentally, it was at the same time that I was juggling around the idea of dating a guy that happened to be an ER doctor. I had only casually mentioned it and mostly kept the idea hidden, because even though we were ""best friends"" I was already tired of the jealousy from someone who didnt want to date me. He noticed a lack of attention on his end and when it finally came out I was talking to someone, he was ready to date me within a few weeks. Red flag #3. I might have found someone ""better"" or ""more accomplished"" than him. So, here we are dating, and it got to the point that I wasnt able to set any boundaries in the relationship. I have two kids from a previous relationship, but me saying it wasn't his place to punish them was out of bounds. Of course, now that is such an obvious ""get the hell out"" moment. But, at the time he made me feel so unreasonable for saying it wasn't his place. He would tell me that all of his friends and his dad thought he should have that right. He would tell me I was crazy and selfish for not letting him. That I would never find anyone that would date me with two kids, especially if I wasn't going to let them set some rules for MY kids. Red flag #4. We have been dating for 2 months, and he wants the kids and I to move in. Okay. Even though he could be really cruel and vicious sometimes, he could also be really nice. He'd had a hard life. He was adopted as a baby, his adoptive parents were neglectful, his adopted mom died when he was 18, one ex gf used to punch him, the last gf left after a fight and not only never talked to him again, but got a restraining order. He told me he had done some things wrong in those relationships, but ultimately they were the crazy ones and all they had ever contributed to the relationship was pain, while all he ever did was go out of his way for him. They were using him. No matter what the situation, he was always being mistreated and was clearly the victim. Red flag #5. So, now we live together. And, now he wants to get married. Dating for 2 months, known each other for 8 months. He kept pushing the idea of marriage, and I kept saying I wasnt at that place in my life. I was divorced, with two kids, and definitely wanted to get to know my partner before making that commitment again. Suddenly, I was crazy and taking advantage of him. Didnt I know how lucky I was to find someone willing to do as much as he did, when I came with so much baggage? I would never find someone as smart, caring, and motivated as him, and I should consider myself lucky that he wanted to marry me. Amazingly, all of that drama, and he had never once actually proposed. Never once actually asked if I wanted to marry him. He just thought that we should and if I didn't agree, I must be using him. MAJOR red flag #6. After a couple month of us constantly fighting about marriage, he finally gave up. I wasnt going to budge, and ""if I was going to take advantage, he was just going to let me"". But now I'm pregnant. He's so happy. He's always wanted his own kids, he has always wanted a family, everything is going to be so great. And it was, for like 3 weeks before morning sickness set in. Suddenly, I dont want to continue our routine of twice daily sex. I'm nauseous and tired, and I might even want to take a day off. But, how dare I? Don't I know that sex is the most important thing to him a relationship? Don't I know how lucky I am to have him? He could be off sleeping with a different college freshman every night, but instead he's there with me. I should get an abortion. Sex is the only thing that matters. We would stay up fighting until early morning almost every night. I had to be up at 530 to get my daughter ready for school. I run my own online business and take care of my pre-k son everyday.l, and I was averaging about 15 hrs of sleep every week, while being in early pregnancy, because he wanted to fight about SOMETHING almost every night. I'm so tired. I have terrible morning sickness. And, he keeps going back and forth between how much he is going to love being a dad and how I should get an abortion, because he can't be in a sexless relationship (while we are still having sex at least 4-5 times a week). MAJOR red flag #7. So, for the next couple of months, we cycle. I try and do everything I can to make him happy, regardless of what I need or even want, and he still finds ways to be super pissed at me. Then, we get to my birthday. We have a pretty good day. We got out for dinner. We go to Wal-Mart to get me the first birthday cake I had in years. He seems like he cares so much and just wants to make ONE DAY special for me. Until, we are leaving walmart and he asks if ""we are going to fuck"" that night. ""What? I don't know? Maybe? Can we see how I feel????"". Suddenly, he is miserable. Don't I know how much he is giving up for me? Don't I know how close he is to killing himself? Why dont I care? At that point, I was done. Despite how often we were fighting, I am almost never confrontational. I hate arguing. I hate starting fights. I hate making people mad. But I was at the point that I was DONE. We fought all night, with me just trying to leave. I wasnt allowed to leave. He would block the door. He would grab me. He just wanted to know why I didn't see how lucky I was to have him. Finally, I gave up and decided on a better plan. I made him think he was right. That I was completely unreasonable for not feeling like having sex. My bad. I have morning sickness. I'm soooo sorry. I woke up early the next morning, with3 hrs sleep and started packing the kids and I up. He wasn't going to let me leave, so I was going to do it without him knowing. Until he woke up. He realized immediately what was going on (remember his ex girlfriend ghosted him) and tried to convince me to stay. I wasnt going to. So, he has me talk to a mutual friend (who he on/off HATES), so that she can try to convince me to stay. At first, she tried, and then even she gave up because she knew what he was like and was also tired of the narcissism he brought to their friendship. So, I left. I got about 45 mins away, and suddenly convinced myself that I was in the wrong. Wasnt he always saying how dramatic I was? How immature I was? This did seem dramatic and not at all how a mature adult would end a relationship. I already was convinced that I was all of the hurtful things he constantly accused me of being. I went back. Big mistake. I get to his house and he goes on and on about how sorry he is. He finally sees how wrong he was. He will do better, if I will just stay. I became hopeful. I wanted to believe him. He was so right, and I was the crazy one. I'm so sorry I walked out. That must have been so hard after the last girl did the same thing. 6 days later was Christmas. We went back to stay with parents in my hometown, on Christmas eve. We had a good car ride there, that night we were sweet to each other. Everything seemed great. Until We were about to go to bed. As I'm falling asleep, he wants to know If I think we are going to turn out like my parents. They seem to tolerate each other but he's not sure they actually love each other. I dont want to answer. This seems like an argument in the making. I just want to sleep. Can we discuss it later, it's Christmas? Suddenly, I'm the crazy one again. I'm taking advantage of him. I'm stonewalling him. Who cares if everyone else in the house is asleep and he's waking them up with his anger. Who cares if they dont have a good Christmas? We spent all night fighting and into the next day. I kept insisting we discuss it later, and he keeps demanding we fix it now. My kids are opening Christmas presents, and he demands I go outside so we can talk. My family wants to sit down to Christmas lunch that my mom spent all morning making, and he just wants to talk. He doesn't realize how insane he is making both of us look. If he would just calm down for a few hours, we can discuss it later. But he doesn't. He is just SO angry. He even manages to make my mom and stepdad think I am the one doing it. They have met him 3 times, known me my entire life, but he manages to make them think I am the bad guy. I am mistreating him. Don't they know how lucky I am to have him? The same tactics he used on me, he used against me, and they fell for it. I was hurt and quite angry that he was doing this. I told him that after all of that, we were actually done. It had been 6 days since I last tried to leave. I was 10 weeks pregnant and just wanted my kids to have a nice Christmas. So, he agrees we are done walks outside. I figured maybe he would actually go cool down, think it over, and realize all the drama he was creating because I didnt want to answer the question of if we would ""turn out like my parents"". Nope. He goes outside and texts my ex husband to let him know I was pregnant. Something I had been putting off, because we were still trying to work out coparenting properly, and I didn't want to cause drama between us. That was it. I went from being hurt and angry, to actually being livid. It wasn't enough to ruin Christmas for my family, but he just went and pissed off my ex, who was supposed to get the kids in a few hours and spend the rest of Christmas with them. He ruined christmas for my kids TWICE. I was past done. My parents are pissed at me. He's telling me how crazy I am. My poor grandmother is just sitting in the corner super confused. And I just stopped. I faked apologizing to him. Told him he was right. Told my parents I was so sorry. Loaded my kids in the car to go to their dads, and we left. We were supppsed to drive the 3.5 hours home, after dropping off kids, but there was no way that was going to be possible. He's still going on and on about how abusive I am when I shut down and stone wall him. He could have picked anyone and he picked me, only for me to abuse him. He could have fucked so many college freshman in the tome we have been dating. He lowered his standards for me. He was taking care of MY kids. I decided that if he was so convinced I was mistreating him, that he was on his own. I dropped him off at a bus station, and bought him a ticket home. This is something I would never usually do. I have never been that angry in my life. Dropping someone off at a bus station on Christmas is just heartless. But, I was out of options. I should have left a few days before, but I had been hopeful that I was the one that was always wrong, and if I just did better we would be better. I went and called the same friend that he had hoped would convince me to stay and she told me she was proud of what I had done, that he totally deserved it, and to come on over and stay a few days with her. He starts texting me and her immediately. She lets him know that my plan is to stay with her, and that she is just going to be neutral until things calm down. He then starts demanding that she make sure I get an abortion, while also blowing up my phone demanding I get an abortion. He wants nothing to do with me and if I decide to keep the kid, he wants nothing to do with it. He's going to stay with family a couple of days, and all my stuff needs to be gone from his life by the time he gets back. The friend says I can stay with her until I get back on my feet. So, we go a few days with him constantly messaging me to tell me how sorry he is, while also telling me how ungrateful I am, and that I should still get an abortion. We leave out after 2 days to go pack up all my stuff, while he isn't there. Now is also the time where I mention that on my birthday, I had gone to the doctor for an ultrasound and a blood test to determine the gender of the baby. We were told they would call the day or two after christmas and that we would definitely know before new years. So I'm driving the 5 hrs with my friend, to go and pack up all of my stuff, when I get the call about the baby's gender. What should have been a happy moment, was completely shadowed by everything else going on. I was having a boy, and I had just a few weeks to figure out if I wanted to keep him or have an abortion. Me, the person who is pro-choice but never saw myself getting an abortion, having to decide if it was actually the best choice. I went numb. I didnt know what the best choice was. Even though my friend kept telling me I had done nothing wrong and that there was nothing wrong with me, I still questioned. He had convinced my parents I was crazy. They've known me my whole life. I must actually be crazy. He was right. It was all my fault. Why hadn't I just told him that we would never turn out like my parents, kissed him, and gone to bed?? I started talking to him again. He was so sorry. He was going to work on it, please just come home. So, I told him that he had some things he needed to work on, but I would also work on some things. He told me he was convinced he had borderline personality disorder and that he was going to get counseling. He would work super hard and everything would be great. So, I went back. He starts counseling and they diagnosis him with BPD and OCD. He goes on medication, he goes to therapy twice a week. Things are really good. We dont fight. We rarely disagree. Everything seems quite normal. Until a few weeks before the baby is born. Suddenly, I'm back to not being super sexual (only 4-5 times a week, instead of 7) and he needs an outlet. If he could just sleep with other people, he would be super happy. Sex is one of the most important parts of his life, and I misrepresented myself when we first met by saying that I could have sex 5-6 nights a week. I'm back to being crazy and not caring about what he needs. I'm 37 weeks pregnant, but his main concern is sleeping with a college freshman. So I tell him, fine. If thats what you need. Do it. I dont want to fight about sex. Things had been really good, but if that's what you need, take it. I just want this to work. He didn't though, and I was so glad. He kept talking about him, I kept saying I was cool with it if it would make everything else okay. I didn't want my son to grow up without his dad, just because I could have sex regularly. But, I was so happy he didn't act on it and thought maybe just thinking he had the option was enough. Until the baby is born and is now a week old. He can't go any longer without sex and we are supposed to wait another 5 weeks. He wants to meet up with an old ""fuck buddy"" and just get a release. He doesn't know if he will actually be able to go through with it, but he wants to try. ""Fine. I will stay at home with a week old baby, and you go have fun"". So he goes. He comes back and claims nothing happened, even though he was gone for 4 hrs. They just talked, they attempted sex, but he couldn't go through with it. I didn't want to know details, so I just left it at what he said. But, he is now on Tinder, trying to find other hookups. He says he doesn't know if it was just the girl he was with and that maybe he could go through with it with someone else. He just needs a release. He talks to girls, constantly talks with me about sleeping with them possibly, but he never actually does anything. He's still not going to counseling, we are back to fighting, but not as bad because I constantly give in to whatever he wants to make it stop. I have a month old baby, I'm working 50 hrs a week and have been since he was 3 days old, still have two other kids. I'm just drained. Then, we moved to a new house. On top of everything else going on, we moved. So now, I'm dealing with baby, still working, kids, trying to organize and unpack, and all he wants to talk about is the girls on Tinder. We've been moved in 2 weeks, and he finds one he thinks I could be friends with. He wants her to come over and hangout. He's not going to sleep with her (more than likely), but he really wants her to come over. So she does. I tell him that I am not at all cool with him sleeping with her if she does, but if you are so convinced I would want to be friends with her, she can come. So she has a friend drop her off. She's nice, we talk, we all hang out, but then the baby gets hungry. I leave to go nurse him in our bedroom, and within a few minutes my partner comes in to let me know he wants to try to sleep with her. In his office. While the kids and I are in the house. Are you kidding me? Hadent I made my boundaries known before she came over??? But saying no to him is never an option. And I dont have the energy to fight. ""Sure. Go for it. Have fun"". He does. He claims it only lasted about 30 seconds before he felt bad. But, it still happened. And now I can't bear to go in his office. Plus, I had to take the girl home. Now, I'm back to being done. I can't live like this. I've just been diagnosed with postpartum depression, and I feel like my life is falling apart. I ask him to stop. I tell him it hurts and that I hate feeling this way. He says he understands and will uninstall tinder. A week later he is back at it. ""It's okay though, right?"". He just needs sex and since I'm still recovering, he should be able to get it elsewhere. Except, we were having sex. Had been since the baby was 2 weeks old. 4 weeks before I was medically supppsed to. I'm at risk for infection because of it. Who cares? He needs sex and I dont care about him if I dont let him get it from somewhere. I just want this to work. I have now built my whole life around him. I'm still possibly the crazy one and just don't know how hard life is for him. He was abused as a kid. He has all these past issues and sex helps him to feel better. I just wajt him to feel better so we can be happy. But I'm not happy. All he talks about is girls on Tinder or how I feel about him sleeping around. We dont talk about life. We dont talk about the baby. We dont talk about me or the fact that I am dealing with a month old newborn, breastfeeding, raising two other kids, and working 50 hrs a week. We do this for several more weeks, until 3 weeks ago I told him I can't. He tried to bring up tinder again, after I told him 2 days before that I didnt want him to do it anymore, and he got super mad. He starts telling me he doesn't think the baby is his, that it must be a guys a dated when I was 15-19 and hadn't talked to in years, because the guy randomly messaged me on FB a few weeks before. He started berating and belittling me, grabbing me and manuevering me like I was a ragdoll, while Im holding the baby. And it got so bad that his dad, who also lives with us, called the cops on him. THEY show up and he is still livid. They can't calm him down. They let him know if he doesn't they will take him in for disturbing the peace, they let me know that I have every right to take the baby and leave. He eventually tells them he will just leave for the night and they say good enough and leave. But as soon as they are gone, he is back. He just needs to grab some stuff, but he wants me to know that he never cared about me and that I need to get out, along with his dad. He calls the landlord at 3am, thinking she will back him up, but she doesnt care. He and his dad are on the lease, and she's not taking his dad off. We try telling him how unreasonable he is, and after about an hour he stops suddenly and claims that something is wrong. He has to have a brain tumor and he needs to go to the ER. At 4 in the morning. His dad and I are just stunned. He walks himself to the hospital, and messages me for the entire time he's there. He claims the nurses and doctors also believe that he has a brain tumor and that he should have had an MRI months ago. But, they dont have any dye on hand for an MRI, so they send him home and tell him to see his doctor. 3 weeks later and I still haven't even seen an ER bill, so I'm pretty sure it's all BS. We talk a few days later and I make it known that I dont want him sleeping around. Again. He says cool and he won't bring it up. Last week, he brought it up. I immediately tried to shoot it down and let him know the he needed to focus on our relationship. He says he gets it, But 5 days later he has already completely forgotten and starts talking about how he needs to find a new playmate. It took 5 days for it to completely leave his mind and bring it back up. 5 whole days. I'm pissed. I'm done. I can't anymore. I want to go home. I can focus on my kids and work, but I can't focus on him anymore. My life is falling apart and he hasn't truly asked how I'm doing in weeks. He says he will actually stop, but he just needs one more fling first. He needs to sleep with someone in the next 2 weeks, and then we can focus on us. I let him know that he has no idea how bad it is. That I'm already to leave ASAP, because I can't do this anymore. But he's adamant. He wants us to get better but he needs this and I dont care about him if I can't see that. Fine. Have your fling. You didnt even touch your son yesterday. You changed a diaper the day before and then left him to me. You don't care that all I want to do is talk to you about OUR life. I still haven't figured out how, but I am leaving. It sucks, but I have to be sneaky about it. Today is my mom's 60th birthday and if it weren't for that, I would be gone today. But he has me convinced that all I do is start drama, and I cant start drama on her birthday. Next week, Maybe? While he is at work? Just pack up as much as I can and go?? He will find a replacement for me, after all he has been telling me I'm replaceable from the day he met me. He can finally focus on just sex again, and I will worry about my kids and my job. And yes. Now I fully know why his ex girlfriend walked out the door one day, got a restraining order, and never looked back."
65,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"Hoover Bait, and I Know Better...",1,dac686,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/dac686/hoover_bait_and_i_know_better/,2019-09-28 15:53:01,"I know this is lengthy, TL;DR at bottom. Thanks for reading this if you do, Im open to any opinions and insight. I need to go NC and stick with it. Im hoover bait. 8+ years in and fully aware of what he his after countless devaluations and discards. I met him at a very vulnerable point in my life, and he expertly love bombed me. I should have known it, my late husband did the same thing, and was a covert N. His narcissism was so entrenched it literally caused his death, his need for control resulted in a total alienation of his medical team, and ultimately also of me. I met my N while my husband was dying, and had cycled into extreme physical mental and sometimes physical abuse that I couldnt defend myself against because he was terminally and critically ill. The night my husband died, I made a post on Facebook. I never portrayed myself as a long-suffering wife, but had discussed the course of his illness and my growing sense of isolation and grief very openly. When he read the post, he turned on me in the most vicious and vile way I have ever experienced. The shock of what he did actually overtook the shock of my husbands very traumatic death. Then he immediately discarded me for a couple of months. He reached out, never apologized for anything. And I stupidly welcomed him back. It happened many times. We had a long period of relative stability (LDR, with frequent trips to see each other), but privately I was unhappy with his lack of reciprocity with gifts, empathy, support, etc. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and then more, because he lost his son unexpectedly to an OD, 3.5 years ago, and I tend toward being an empath. His grief is real, and I really wanted to show him love, support, and kindness, I wanted him to always know he had a safe place to land with me. Things leading up to the summer seemed better than ever, although truthfully I had a lot of doubts about his stability. Then, I suffered a serious injury that required surgery and extended bed rest, and went out on short term disability and FMLA at work. Within a matter of days after my surgery he began to turn on me. His method of undermining things usually defaults to my Facebook page. He demands passwords, access to my friends list, forces me to delete and block anyone he doesnt like, he will not be my friend with his actual page, and I have no access to it, so he uses a dummy account where I am the only friend. I have consistently refused to give him passwords, I feel its a betrayal of my friends privacy and they ALL HATE him. He will launch a relentless campaign to force my compliance with his demands, and turns completely cold and cruel unless or until I give in. I did give in on the password issue last year, and he immediately violated every condition we had agreed upon so I removed his access. His timing in initiating that conflict when I was isolated and in a state of physical vulnerability was mind-boggling even for him. He blew up my entire summer and recovery, I was a wreck. I gained weight and lost whatever emotional stability I had left. Additionally, he expected to me to drive 5 hours to see him, at my expense (he has a lot more money than I do), against medical advice and at serious risk to myself, and was infuriated when I couldnt. He never offered to come and see me. In the past he has persuaded me to extend trips, at my expense, while promising to cover costs, and then refused to pay once Ive incurred the expenses which are significant. The one time he followed through, he literally threw two $50 bills at me while I was on the phone with my parents. That didnt even cover the cost of one night at the hotel, and then he ditched me for all meals. When I tried to talk to him about it, he made it so uncomfortable, I gave him the money back and then left as quickly as I could. It was obscene. Im not poor, but he manipulated me into spending much, much more than I felt comfortable with, and would not have spent had he not pushed me so hard and then promised to cover. He did it on purpose. The last few weeks has been rapidly cycling discarding, devaluation, and love-bombing. Ive begun to hate him. Having spent the summer in isolation somehow gave me strength, and now Im angry. I let him hoover me yesterday, and it lasted less than 24 hours. Things blew up tonight. Ive been standing my ground lately, not allowing any gaslighting, and redirecting him to the facts of his behavior. Im not reacting to his implied threats of not loving me or wanting me when I dont comply, the way I used to, in fact Ive started to walk out of the conflict, and tonight I told him that I wanted him to leave me alone, and wished to have no further contact. Im getting stronger, but its a process of two steps forward, one back. At this point even if he offered me the things I thought I always wanted with him; marriage, moving to be with him, a life together... I would never do it. I still have some vestige of self-preservation left, and the idea of it sends me into a panic, but Im still having trouble fully letting go. I am in PT for my injury, and just joined a health club; Ive refocused my energies on work, and begun to try and rebuild some friendships, and am hoping to make new ones. Ive decided despite my friends urging, not to join any dating sites, or even date at all for at least a year. No matter what happens that seems to be his biggest fear, me meeting another man, but that isnt why, I just want to spend time rebuilding my self-esteem and sense of who I am. I never want another relationship with a narcissist. Id rather be single than live with any relationship that creates so much anxiety it changes who I am and even how I look and act. Part of me hopes karma puts a reality rocket up his *ss, and part of me feels sorry for him. Hes addicted to mass quantities of benzos, and I suspect hes developed a form of anorexia, and his escalation in behavior makes me suspect hes begun to unravel. I dont think he realizes how obvious his deterioration has become, most will attribute it to his extended grief, but its more than that. Hes profoundly mentally ill. I think he knows I know what he is, and its triggering him big time, even though I wont directly say anything. TL;DR extended 8+ year cycle of devaluation, discard, controlling behavior, lack of reciprocity, gaslighting, and financial and mental abuse."

I wasn't informed enough to know what I was dealing with or how to recognize red flags. I think my prior trauma history and mental illness added to my vulnerability. Anyway, I watch out for free flags. All. The. Time. I find myself classifying a lot of people as toxic or Narcissistic now and I wonder if I'm being paranoid and unfair. It's like I've gone from being overly trusting to trusting almost no one unless they've been a part of my life for a long time. I guess I'm just unsure how to develop new connections that are healthy and not discard people too easily."

You all know me. I wrote [this piece here](URL about identifying manipulations from strangers, and [a simplified version here](URL of the same material. I've shared these pieces with a lot of people and occasionally have to explain a few things that I'm going to explain here. I'll be explaining: * trust issues * red herrings * we/they syndrome * lying about yourself to expose liars Some of this will come straight from my father's correctional manual. I'm also going to use basic examples that I hope will help everyone get this on a intuitive level. I wouldn't be able to help based your individual circumstance because there are so many different ways to use different cons. If I can help make sense of something for you then I'll try my best if you ask. Something I will add while I can. It's in everyone's best interest to **please stop reading about psychopaths.** There's a lot of misconstrued information out there and on this forum. Certain YouTube videos are what inspired me to make my first post back in March. Psychopaths and narcissists are not a subspecies of human. They are people with different personalities marked by some important common ground. You can't figure this out by trying to narrow these people down to a type. Science hasn't done it because the issue is that complicated even when it seems like some areas of that criteria are straightforward. You're making yourselves paranoid and you're reading too far into misinformation that's largely meant to make money off books and interviews at the expense of people desperately seeking answers; the whole reason I sought to have an article published is so there was a permanent free source for this material that prevents anyone from exploiting people more than they already have been. This will be my absolute last post. Please take advantage. I'll do my best. **Trust Issues** I got a lot of private messages from women who were absolutely confused about how they were exposed to their abusers even after they read my posts and comments. Reading their stories, I found that they all revealed that they had disclosed trust issues when first meeting him. This is a very big mistake for two reasons: 1) you're signally to possibly disingenuous people to try harder to earn your trust, 2) they assume you're disclosing this because you trust them. If they know you have trust issues then they want to know why that is. For a potential manipulator, this is a cue to get you talking about those issues so they can learn what it is that you keep doing in order to leave yourself exposed when trusting others. They know you're doing something wrong. They just need to learn your individual circumstances. Sometimes people disclose trust issues because they trust others to know about these things. Maybe this seems familiar for one reason or another. Someone says ""I usually don't trust other people"", which is sooner or later followed by some display of trust towards someone else. That's a vulnerability thrown right out into the open, and you didn't even realise it until right now. For this reason, I stopped disclosing trust issues in the past when I noticed that people were a lot nicer after I said that - people who later took advantage of me for money. It's always best not to disclose trust issues with anyone. It's better just to trust or not trust someone in my experience. Explain trust issues another day when you know them as a good person for sure. If you have a grim view of humanity then it can be assumed that you have trust issues. The only thing I can say to help you let that view go is that people are a lot easier to make sense of when you understand that good people can do selfish things and still be good people overall. There are some things that a good person would never do, but even dedicated parents have to think about their own needs sometimes; it doesn't mean they're now negligent parents. Personal responsibility enables you to take care of others better because your own obstacles are out of the way. There's no juggling act between your needs and someone else's. **Red Herrings** These are ways of throwing off your train of thought to talk about something else. Just like when many of you confronted your abusers about their misdeeds, and found yourselves talking about one or even dozens of completely different things instead, a total stranger will try and do this by splitting your train of thought so that there are now at least two talking points instead of just one - the important one that you brought up for good reason and they're trying to avoid. Suppose you talk to someone about a past relationship. Instead if a straight answer about the relationship, they say it didn't end well and then start talking about how they've grown as a person since the last relationship. If you find yourself talking about that personal growth instead if the last relationship then fell for it. You got distracted and then lost in the distraction instead of getting the answers you were actually seeking. Things like this are why I said never to tolerate metaphors. It's very easy to get distracted by things we may want to hear. In every day life, we like hearing stories about people growing from their past self. Its compelling sometimes. We find it easy to get immersed in those conversations, we know that growth means a lot to people, and we usually welcome the stories openly, so it's very easy to get distracted by such seemingly powerful premise. Similarly, with metaphors, some people are easily swayed by a bunch of words that sound nice in sequence. That's a very big problem for people sometimes when they don't realise that it happens. Reading this now, think back to how many times this has happened to you - your train of thought was divided by a compelling premise or you were swayed by someone's metaphors and the conversation changed. Don't worry. Its definitely not a personal problem. This is common human error. So, make sure you stick to one talking point at a time. For example, if someone gives you a metaphor, if you ask what it means, that's one talking point. They say it came from a movie, ask if you've seen it, then that's two talking points. If you talk about the movie and never figure out what that metaphor means, then you got distracted successfully. That's how a red herring works. **We/They Syndrome** This is something I read about outside of dad's manual as well as within it. In abusive relationships, its it's common for that couple to be isolated from the victim's social circle. The abusers often convince the victim that all they need is each other and that no one else matters - sometimes even their own kids. This works because it makes the victim feel important. So important that they'll neglect other loved ones to keep feeling important. Corrections called this we/they syndrome but I haven't seen one official term for this in a psychotherapeutic or clinical sense where abuse is the focus. You can see more about this in psychology by looking up Social Identity Theory, or in-group and out-group thinking. I'll borrow a short example from my father's manual: ""Recently one of our staff members attended an after work hours party, imbibing a bit too much, his conduct was less than professional. The following day, inmates overheard other employees discussing the man's behavior using expressions like: stupid, lacking in good judgement, and that the man has an alcoholic problem. [The inmates] not only told the employee what was being said about him but who was saying it. The inmates said ""they're wrong about you. They don't know you like we know you. We know the real you. We don't feel that way."" Hence the effective use of we/they syndrome. ""The controversial staff member took the bait [...] The situation provided inmates with the foundation for a Setup, which eventually culminated in the staff person bringing in whiskey and later being escorted off the premises."" That's the importance of keeping your vulnerabilities hidden from strangers. If an abusive person knows what makes you react, they'll look for a way to use it if they think it's something they can use. Bringing this to my article when I said that your words and theirs have implications. If you tell a stranger that you don't drink ""that much"" then they want to know how much is ""that much."" Sometimes ""that much"" is actually a lot. Same all applies when you're talking about any other vulnerabilities like depression, anxiety, past addiction, loneliness, social anxiety, and trust issues as shown above. You need to know who you're trusting before you trust people to know anything about yourself that can be exploited even just periodically. Remember: this method is key to a lot of these abusive bonds, and it happens very subtley. The subtle pace of these bonds is noted in dad's manual. Later on down the road, this is how you'll open yourself up to seeing another person's praise after being wronged by them as a reward. This happened to a friend of mine years ago; she was 25 years old, said she was dating this guy because she was afraid of dying alone and being unloved. He cheated on her, exploited an old opioid addiction, never did anything to support their child. No matter how bad it got for her, she fell for every apology because he convinced her they don't need anyone else except themselves. He was an ex-con with two strikes. She and I haven't talked her last visit to a psychiatric hospital for suicidal ideation. **Lying About Yourself To Expose Liars** I learned this from my abusive brother's ex-wife. She knew he was a chronic liar, lost patience with it in a near-daily basis. One day she decided to tell him it's OK to do something she usually objected to. I don't remember what she said but she got him to admit to something he had been lying about repeatedly (which for him, to this day, is EVERYTHING). The common example I tell my friends to use is the friends-with-benefits conversation. You don't expect someone that takes you seriously to be OK the idea of friends-with-benefits at all if you're looking for something truly monogamous. I've told women to do this if they had doubts meeting anyone new and a hell of a lot more often than not, she heard something she didn't want to hear after he said he was looking for ""something real."" Please keep in mind that this really works if someone's playing games. Those games add pressure to the conversation. For a manipulative person, if they don't feel that pressure then they just let go because they don't feel like they have to hide anymore and they're gonna get what they want from there. I don't recommend doing this to someone you trust because you run the risk of them reacting poorly to the premise you're suggesting is OK, which in this case is the friends-with-benefits conversation. You may not be able to tell anyone you're joking after this, so if you do this then make sure it's done to address a suspicion. **Superficial Voices** Someone requested that I find video examples of people using superficial niceness in their voices. This is the best I could find. URL You'll notice that there's a different depth on her voice when she's being herself and when she's trying harder to sell herself. If I find an example of male voices, I'll make an edit. If not, then I think you all get the idea."

69,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Ruminating about the abuser or the past with them,1,d0j0ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/d0j0ku/ruminating_about_the_abuser_or_the_past_with_them/,2019-09-07 02:33:27,"I'm not talking about reflection of the past and seeing how far you've come, but do you ever think that if you disapline your mind enough you can stop feeding the energy vampires power? They only have the power that you give them. If your empathic self dwells on them, you are drained of power. I'm not going to force some principles I have learned in my belief system, this is an area that I struggle with. But what we feed, we give our power away too. We ruminate over and over but usually about those things we let pass or when we overlooked red flags and warnings from others. We accepted less than we deserved, but that was the past. If we aren't careful we tie everything to our worth and worthiness. They can activate negative core beliefs that you hold for yourself from ancient abuse or neglect that you weren't even aware of. To cut myself from their clutches, to rid myself of the shame and guilt, I had to forgive myself and learn to trust me again. I have to live my truth and my reality. Something was flawed within me that allowed this person to harm me and I accepted it, thinking that they would love me. It's that people pleasing codependency fight, if I'm good to them, I will be loved. Transforms some of us to our past and trying to please parents who weren't consistent, who are abusive or who had been abused themselves. They didn't have the ability to adequately parent us and we took the blame. They didn't have the ability to adequately be in a relationship and we took their blame. In early childhood we took the blame because it's hard for a young child to understand that a parent is flawed. So young babies and toddlers can internalize their worth and worthiness by the action or inaction of their flawed parents. A parent didn't have to be abusive, they could have been distracted, overwhelmed in life, could have been mentally ill, etc. But a baby and child wouldn't know that. As children to cope with parents not meeting our needs we become people pleasers to get basic needs met. We must know that parents should be devoted to taking care of a child's needs. And had we had more of a securely attached start, we'd not be on sites like this looking for answers. We should have been mirrored correctly in our early years. I've read that babies who can't communicate yet will hurt in their bodies. Some of us who have fought depression understand that! We hurt for a reason. When we learn to communicate we internalize that we must be unlovable and unworthy of love from our treatment. We grow up and go to school. We people please some people and it works sometimes. But as we get older looking for another mirror, looking for someone to truly see our authentic self and love us, those people pleasing ways, usually lands individuals like our primary caregivers! Codependency is a self love deficit. So we pretty much abandon ourselves to seek that outside validation from others that at this point in our lives, is our responsibility to give ourselves. We are these wounded inner children who are crying for the love and acceptance that we wanted from the start. Instead of giving ourselves what we truly have within us, we hand our weak side over to a just a negligent and sometimes far more abusive one as before. How did the narcissists target You? Strangely just like a pedophile would. If you have ever been abused by one you understand. They try to play on that weakness and need we have. They mirror our sweet nature. We look into that mirror and see a brief glimpse and boom, we are caught. They make us feel worthy of love and belonging that only they can give us. They seem to have super powers, etc. You were targeted for qualities and things you don't see in yourself but they are there. They copied you and you couldn't see that. We should truly know ourselves and be deeply rooted in ourselves. We can find ourselves when we live our truth. When we stop lying to ourselves and turn all our love and empathy on ourselves. We have to be the loving firm adult to that vulnerable side of us. We can't hand ourselves over for others to love and fix us, that's our responsibility. Truth is, we have always been worthy of love and belonging from day one! The loving adult in us truly needs to be more logical and when your emotions are out of control, you have to understand that you are using more of the primitive brain (when emotions are out of control). Don't let that inner child take over. But have true compassion for your experience, realize that you are an incredibly strong person. You have to understand that babies can die of failure to thrive. You had to cope with things that some didn't have to. We are however human and many suffer similarly. Not everyone makes it out of abuse. But you hopefully have! You have incredible strength. It probably was the reason the narcissists also dumped you, you could see through the bullshit. We truly must exercise true empathy on ourselves. We are worthy of love and belonging and we are worthy of self love and care. We can give ourselves what our parents failed at. It's not a selfish love out of narcissism but it's a clear way of being more compassionate towards others. But we come first and the adult in us puts up the boundaries and raises the standards knowing, we don't have to please others. We accept that they are incapable of doing what we are responsible for. If we abandon ourselves in a codependent relationship we are so focused on the other person, if they are selfish, they are focused on themselves, that's 2 people focused on 1. You in a sense aren't even a part of the relationship. That's not even a relationship. Live an authentic life and don't settle for less than you give yourself! If you aren't loving and caring for yourself, nobody can do it for you. You have to do it. Don't date until you do. Otherwise you open yourself to repeat the cycle of abuse. Your history repeats itself. Let your adult self learn to recognize the truth by living your truth. Overlooking red flags can cost you your life! We must reparent those areas of vulnerability. An adult does whatever it takes to protect a child. Even preventing the child from dating bad people. Learn the narcissists patterns, learn to identify them and don't ever settle for less than you deserve. Stop giving these creeps credit for hurting you, you are survivors! They were scum of the earth to target You and use your most vulnerable side against you. True love won't try to rescue you but will point out your strength. And adults don't share their vulnerable side until you are well established in a relationship. We don't need anyone's sympathy. We can't mirror our victimness and expect to be treated any better. I'm more convinced that professional counseling is far better than revealing myself to the wrong person. We don't need another person to validate our existence, we must do the hard work of giving it to ourselves! Believe me, we are better able to validate others and attract it to us. If you are lonely, hurt and alone, don't you dare believe the garbage you have been fed. You are worthy of love and belonging, get yourself up and enjoy your life. Enjoy your autonomy and individualism. Enjoy your freedom. Wake up!! Reconnect with your belief systems that love and support you in a healthy way. Best of wishes from one survivor to another"
70,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,How to deal with a narc posing as an empath after you discard them?,2,bmu4jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bmu4jo/how_to_deal_with_a_narc_posing_as_an_empath_after/,2019-05-10 14:54:02,"My ex (female) narc is the best at posing as a victim only. We both had degrees of narcissism. She heightened mine overtime by the way she would emotionally interact with me, I always felt so uncomfortable like I was dealing with a grown pre-teen or something. She swears she is in an empath and that I am the full fledged narc. She heavily gaslighted me during a period of time she was slipping up and wrong all the time during arguments. She would never apologize and being that I already dealt with that kind of shit in my childhood I would get so enraged and then she would be all calm and shift the blame. All I could ever say to her is youre flipping the conversation and she would just deny it and Id get more angry. I grew resentment for her slowly, but still loved her when she was being easy and not manipulative. After horrible times together( I took a huge part of myself) involving physical fights and verbal abuse, we tried to keep it together, but I left her because I was so lost, I had lost myself and my mind. From that point she hated my guts. She said I betrayed her. That word is strong. We were still fighting over white lies and she would never acknowledge her wrongs even if I was wrong as well and I acknowledged mine. Now she just smears me online and Im sure everywhere she goes now and doesnt acknowledge her narc behaviors of isolating me from friends and family by emotional manipulation, and her initiating the physical abuse in our relationship. Ive apologized to her so much based off what I actually have done wrong, but she wants me to feel sorry for everything and once I bring up her part, she smokescreens by telling me Im not sorry for what I have done and am just trying to get guilt off. I know for sure she is a narc as well though she labeled me one first, this is the smartest narc move I have ever witnessed after knowing more about what they do to people they find vulnerability within. I let her move in with me, she contacted me first after we met. She made her way into my life and changed me for the worse and now wants me to believe this was me all along. I know I have serious issues, and childhood trauma out of this world, but she brought all of the worst parts of me out when all I ever wanted to do was be a good person. I think she quite literally turned my loves into my nightmares."
71,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Help! - my ex wants revenge for accidental blackmail I found,1,bnad2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bnad2j/help_my_ex_wants_revenge_for_accidental_blackmail/,2019-05-11 19:47:45,"So I accidentally found some info that could be considered powerful blackmail against my ex. I have no intention of using it against him but the problem is he doesn't trust me and he's hinting at revenge. Please help. The long version: So my ex is a self-professed sex addict. He moved away for work so we ended, but I looked at his twitter Likes and found a secret account of his (hiding in plain sight I guess?) that he uses to talk to a handful of pornstars that represent girls he knows in real life, including me, like a private digital harem. Then I got nosy and following his trail of twitter likes, discovered 20+ more accounts... he spends all day tweeting, his fake profiles even talk to each other, it's like a whole world. Well I accidentally outed myself by liking one of his posts and he flipped out, posting images of violent sex with the surrogate pornstars that represented me, and humiliating comments towards me, and threats. I thought it would help to tell him that I found it on accident, and stayed because I missed him and got addicted to reading his tweets about missing me, not to judge, and wished him the best. So I tweeted all that at him from a private account thinking it would be less confrontational than calling him. He didn't reply. I tweet once more that I got the hint and I'll be leaving him alone now, then delete my account. His angry posts continue. Days later I get a text from an unknown number, ""don't show anyone"". I post a quote about silence being golden on my social media as my hint to him that I'd keep his secret. His posts went from angry to relieved. Well, a day later and he's posting revenge fantasies on twitter again. He doesn't trust me. Our relationship cost him a lot and that's all the more reason I'm afraid he'll seek revenge. The day we met was like lightning, we were both so shaken we could hardly sleep because it felt like he saw under the mask I'd been wearing my whole life and the feeling of vulnerability was intense. I only found out he felt the same way by finding his social media. But we had amazing conversations, and I think it's because my mom was a narc and that delusions-of-grandeur mentality is within me too (though I think I'm a codepndent, not a narc). So I think I got under his skin more than most people, and when I grew critical of his lies and mistreatment of me, he kind of had a public unraveling on social media, and the girl he's in love with and that he's been friends with for years pushed him away because of this. So, he has extra reasons to hate me. It's hard to prove any of his revenge threats or accounts are his since it's all through fake profiles and he speaks in metaphors a lot. If we talk again, I'm scared to even meet up with him. What do I do?"
72,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Thoughts on moving forward in new relationships after NeX,6,bpz4aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bpz4aq/thoughts_on_moving_forward_in_new_relationships/,2019-05-18 10:51:09,"Hey All, &amp;#x200B; So to give a little context, February 2018 my (33m) 2 year relationship with my suspected Narc-Ex (26f) broke down. Before I kick into the real meat of this thought process which will lead into a question, that more is interested in whether anyone else has a similar experience. Just for context; I'll include a fairly basic summary of the relationship which led me to believe I was dealing with a Narc. The first year to 12 months with my Ex was a relationship that felt nothing short of incredible, I had never truly felt this way about anyone previously. She appeared pretty perfect with in that time, planning and taking trips away, reasonably good conversation and we hung out together pretty consistently, she seemed pretty interested and committed to me and the sex was amazing. It wasn't until the relationship matured to a point which required emotional vulnerability that a few things started to feel off, though there was a few signs of bizarre behavior which I just shrugged off rationalizing it as ""we're all human, we have insecurity"" and didn't think much of it. After the 12 month period I started noticing some really odd behavior, and reflecting upon the experience I hadn't noticed some of the more subtle signs and behaviors that at the time I knew was off, but shrugged it off once more. The most constant thing that happened in the second half of the relationship was the constant complaining, like, attention seeking sympathy victim behavior. It dominated our conversations daily and I tried my best to support it for quite some time, say a few months if I had to guess. I wanted to support the person I cared about, and I fully realise that it's important to actively listen to ones partner, so I maintained the status quo of the man that is emotionally resilient and listens. It got to a point where there was no longer ""hello"" or ""good mornings"" and ""I miss you's"" it just started off with complaint after complaint, for example ""I slept like shit and now I'm grumpy"" and that was first thing in the mornings. After some time (a month) this behavior started to irk me to a point as there appeared to be no consideration for the other half of the relationship, it appeared selfish, I was stressed out with a pretty heavy work schedule at the time and I started to become more assertive and tired of this behavior. So one day after a tirade of complaints in the morning I responded with ""I'm doing really well this morning too, thanks for asking"" which was met with ""WHOA, where'd that come from?"" which essentially resulted in a huge fallout of her saying she was in tears at work, and that what I said was really rude. It didn't matter what I said to justify my position from that point on, it seemed I was painted black. There was significant silent treatments throughout the relationship, so I'd just carry on with my life without appearing to be too affected by the behavior, but it did play on my mind. The oddest part was the selective responses, which then manifested into the messages being read and not responded to at all ( this is after asking a specific question). When I asserted myself as to this behavior isn't acceptable the response I got was ""You'll have to get used to it, I'm known for that.. I even have a nickname in my friend group for that"". In my mind I was thinking after hearing that ""What the actual fuck; if you care for someone surely they'd be up the list of priorities of people to respond to"". My point of mentioning these things is that I'm still not sure I was dealing with a narcissist, or just someone really odd and possibly toxic; but the patterns and signs of narcissism are there which I can't shake. I can't help but feel that there was a lot of selfish behavior, and odd traits displayed after I had asserted myself on things I would not tolerate in a relationship and the response to this by my partner at the time was incredibly bizarre. I could add many more instances of very strange behavior which still makes me question the motive behind it ever 12 months later, but I also accept that it wasn't to be because otherwise I wouldn't be in the position I'm in. &amp;#x200B; Now; Onto my actual point here. Through this experience it didn't change how much I really loved this person. I've dated some other women since then. I just don't feel the same level of butterflies and adoration I did for my ex, Is this normal?, Am I just not dating the \*right\* women, or have I been conditioned to feel this way by my ex through her behaviors where by it plays on the ""We want what we can't have"" idea. The women I've dated since then have been caring, fun, smart and great people, but I just don't get that same level of \*passion\* and excitement from the relationships. &amp;#x200B; TLDR; Does the narcissist condition you to second guess yourself in any relationship after them where you don't feel that same level of excitement? Thanks for taking the time to read this, it's been on my mind for a while and haven't come up with any real answers on this topic."
73,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"Recovering from three years of narcissistic abuse, this is my truth.",16,bblp5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bblp5k/recovering_from_three_years_of_narcissistic_abuse/,2019-04-10 22:57:31,"I must have typed my story a bunch of times and then would decide not to share it. Often on social media we only post the good parts of our lives rather than being vulnerable and tell other truths. This is my story, I spent three years with someone who said I was the love of his life but then most of his actions would contradict that same thought. Narcissist is a pretty harsh word and if the person hasnt been properly diagnosed it can be defamatory. However, I (28F) can only tell my truth of the story and go from there. Im three months out of a toxic relationship and I still cry almost every day from all the mind games and feeling like I dont recognize who I became or who I am now. I let someone take a piece of me bit by bit and thats something I am now working on as to why I did let someone treat me as less than I deserve. I would not wish this pain and confusion on anyone in the world. Theres no way to really describe how it slowly toys with you and the weaker you become when youre in it, which eventually resulted in me fighting back and speaking up that then lead me to be always called stupid for having an opinion. That same person would tell me my friends werent true friends and that drove a wedge between my best friend and I, and tried to isolate me. In a way he did because I never told one soul, other than eventually my parents, what he did for the entire first year of our relationship, which was cheat on me: after each time confronting him, he claimed never physically only online. And yes there were multiple times I caught him online, and as I said Im working on why I allowed to be treated that way. One of the first times, my friend saw his profile on POF and sent it to me, I defended him. I went through all that alone, because we also had mutual friends and I didnt want to tarnish his name, but god was that ever lonely. Once he had me isolated from my friends, he tried really hard to do the same with my family. My family who opened their hearts and home to him as if he was always one of their own. He would say some pretty disgusting things about how my family was dysfunctional and lazy, which is so far from who they are. They are the most selfless people I know and I would not have had any strength if it werent for them teaching me how to persevere through the tough times. This is ultimately what led to our break up, that he couldnt come between us and isolate me from my family; well that, and then deciding once again to cheat after a year and a half working through the infidelity issues and building the trust again. However, this post isnt about the cheating and those lies, its about all the other behaviour I tolerated that slowly broke me. Its about the times where when I had hard times at work and he would in the moment be very supportive, only to use those same hardships during an argument to put me down and use it against me. Its about the time I threw him a surprise 40th birthday party and he acted like he was appreciative around his family and friends and then later when we were alone tell me he hates surprises, picks a fight, and hardly speaks to me for the next week. Its about those times where I would be told no, [my name here] after every time I had an idea or an opinion. Its about those times when trying to express how I felt about something he would always say I was trying to ruin the moment; its for those times that I was always reminded I didnt have a voice. Its for the times he always told me this is why people dont like you; Its for that time I made a life decision to follow him to his home town and then to have him cheat on me less than 24 hours after I came back to the city to wrap up the final few weeks of my old job, its about him lying to my face about it, and its about how through this break up hes acted like the victim and is still trying to attempt control over me and my phone usage. Its that even though I was the one who decided enough was enough that I was still discarded so easily and that hurts; its for that I now commute four hours a day to get to work; or for that the first 6 weeks I slept on friends couches; its for the therapy sessions I now attend once a week just to make sense of the entire relationship, break up, and who I am now. Its for that hes already with someone new living in our dream home that I still pay half the mortgage until it sells. This is my truth, this is my pain, and this is my vulnerability. This is for anyone who is going through something similar, we will get through it. We will come out stronger, wiser, and much much happier. And him/her? Lets wish them luck, because in the end all we can do is feel sad for them, because they are clearly holding a lot of pain in. No one who is happy and loves themselves treats others like that, especially loved ones. Its their truth and whether they ever let those closest to them see it or not, is not our issue. Its completely and entirely on them. Whats on us is to move forward the best we can each day, each moment, we are strong and capable. We must now look inward and determine what made us tolerate and vulnerable to let someone take so much of us. We are in the process of healing and we will never let anyone treat us this ways gain, and that my friend, is the beauty in this fucked up situation."
74,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"Signs that you've been abused by a narcissist. A great resource on the sidebar. Website: ""Life After Narcissistic Abuse""",208,bf3q91,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bf3q91/signs_that_youve_been_abused_by_a_narcissist_a/,2019-04-20 06:12:26,"1. YOU DOUBT YOURSELF Do you recognize that youre doubting yourself more than you ever have before? Victims of narcissistic abuse often appear uncertain of themselves, constantly seeking clarification that they havent made a mistake or misheard something. This reactive adaptation to narcissistic abuse is because the narcissist is ALWAYS finger pointing and shifting blame to YOU for ALL of the ups &amp; downs both in the relationship AND in the narcissists personal psyche. Because this relationship has NON EXISTENT boundaries, you will find YOURSELF constantly PUT UPON and FORCED to accept responsibility for things you didnt do or say. This borrowed humiliation and shame is exactly what the narcissist intends for the victim to take from the narcissist. Their own unfelt core of shame. 2. CONFUSION Just refer to the above explanation of self doubt and boundary transgression if you want to understand the CONFUSION that is part and parcel of narcissistic abuse. Daily boundary transgression and criss crossing of responsibility starts to wear on even the clearest minded of targets. Suddenly you wake up and realize that all the realities and borders between yourself and others is not only BLURRED but MISSING. Its confusing to KNOW that you arent responsible for someone elses behavior, thinking and feeling but to be CONSTANTLY SCOLDED for behaving, thinking and feeling as if you ARE. Its crazy-making and a narcissist purposefully causes this confusion. They know that a divided and conquered mind is their most vulnerable and susceptible target who wont be able to identify that their confusion is caused by an abusive technique called gaslighting. Gaslighting is a technique of psychological abuse used by narcissists to instill confusion and anxiety in their target to the point where they no longer trust their own memory, perception or judgment. With gas lighting, the target initially notices that something happens that is odd, but they dont believe it. The target attempts to fight the manipulation, but are confused further by being called names or told that theyre: Just Too sensitive, Crazy, Imagining things or the narcissist flat out DENIES ever saying anything hurtful. Gradually, the target learns not to trust their own perceptions and begins doubting themselves. Broken and unable to trust themselves, they isolate further. The target now doubts everything about themselves: their thoughts and opinions, their ideas and ideals. They become dependent on the narcissist for their reality. For it is in your CONFUSION and acceptance of responsibility that belongs to the narcissist, that a narcissist is able to successfully CONTROL YOU and USE YOU as a scapegoat for their problems. 3. FEELING CRAZY Every minute of every hour of every day of every year, a Narcissist, who has a DSM classifiable personality DISORDER (ie: not playing with a full deck) is PROJECTING their disorder onto those around them. If you dont think that having a crazy person constantly blaming you for being crazy will make you crazy, Id like to introduce you to a narcissist that will convince you otherwise. This disorder isnt a relationship gone wrong. This disorder isnt kid stuff. Its MALEVOLENT. Its a transference of malevolence and MENTAL DISORDER from the person who has it to the person who DOESNT.LOVE QUOTES (39) Frankly, before a narcissist, Ive not once in my life, FELT CRAZY. Neither have I ever been told by a psychologist and Ive seen lots of them  that I had anything WRONG with MY own MENTAL HEALTH. Personally, I always had it together. I was resilient, mentally tough, and withstood many events in my life that would make others crumble. Yet, when I unwittingly dated someone with this serious mental health malady, I wanted to slam an entire set of broken porcelain down his throat sideways and every obtuse moron that believes the garbage that comes out of his mouth. No, its not that I suddenly became a person interested in physical violence, I suddenly became a person who was witnessing a DSM category all wrapped up into a physical being  who turned his mental health problems ON Me. I became a target of a person with a problem. They say, Hurt people, HURT people. I say, Narcissistic People DESTROY PEOPLE. 4. EMERGING CLUSTER OF SYMPTOMS THAT HAVE NO OTHER EXPLANATION All I could muster to the narcissist in my dear john letter when I broke up with him that wonderful New Years Eve, was I DONT KNOW whats WRONG!! But I just dont feel like myself. Something feels EXTREMELY TOXIC and I dont know why..This should be the alert when a victim of narcissistic abuse presents themselves to therapists. The inexplicable complaint. My first visit to my therapist were those words exactly. I dont know whats wrong with me, but Its SERIOUS! I felt it. I did  I felt BEWILDERED inside, but I could not articulate what it was. (another red flag for someone usually able to articulate every feeling and explanation about myself in-depth). How was it that after 43 years of explaining, analyzing and discussing my own deficiencies quite well, I could NOT for the life of me explain to my therapist what was so wrong with me that it was palpable. His answer, set me free, it really did. YOU HAVE BEEN IN A DOMESTICALLY VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH A NARCISSIST  My therapist had some background with this person. Hed WITNESSED the narcissist calling me, berating me during sessions. I held the phone away during one session, so that my therapist could hear the narcissist on the other end questioning me about cheating, Accusing me of having an affair with the therapist. Grilling me about what the therapist looked like and would speak to me like. He even accused the therapist of wanting me sexually and that was the reason the therapist spoke so lowly of the narcissist. (of course it couldnt just be that the narcissist had a bad reputation and the community was on to him) Sufferers report that their spark has gone out and, even years later, find they just cannot get motivated about anything. Unaware that weve been living in a war zone with a tyrannical narcissist, we cant quite grasp the words to articulate the abuse, yet at the same time, we VERY MUCH FEEL IT. We present ourselves to the mental health community, incapable of speaking about an abuse we yet know nothing about. Until that word, NARCISSISTIC ABUSE is given to us, we have NO IDEA that is whats causing our pain. Thats why its SO IMPORTANT to get the word out there, what narcissists look like, their modus operandi, the words and phrases they use, so that when a victim of their abuse begins looking for answers, they quickly will be able to identify that they are involved with a narcissist. In Narcissistic Victim Syndrome you are looking for a cluster of symptoms to emerge many are the symptoms of trauma (avoidance, loss of interest, feeling detached, sense of a limited future, sleeping or eating difficulties and nightmares, irritability, hyper-vigilance, easily startled, flashbacks, hopelessness, psychosomatic illnesses, self-harming, thoughts of suicide etc). Some victims develop Stockholm Syndrome and want to support, defend, and love the abuser despite what they have gone through. 5. DISSOCIATION Victims tend to dissociate or detach from their emotions, body, or surroundings. Living in a war zone where all forms of power and control are used against you (intimidation; emotional, physical and mental abuse; isolation, economic abuse, sexual abuse, coercion, control etc), the threat of abuse is always present. Dissociation is an automatic coping mechanism against overwhelming stress. Symptoms of dissociation resulting from trauma may include depersonalization, (disconnecting your body awareness from your physical self) psychological numbing, disengaged from life and passions, or amnesia regarding the events of the abuse. It has been hypothesized that dissociation may provide a temporarily effective defense mechanism in cases of severe trauma; however, in the long-term, dissociation is associated with decreased psychological functioning and adjustment. Other symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of traumatic abuse (often referred to as sequelae to abuse) include anxiety, PTSD, low self-esteem, somatization, depression, chronic pain, interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-mutilation and suicidal ideation or actions. These symptoms may lead the victim to erroneously present the symptoms as the source of the problem. 6. PTSD Lets face it. If I didnt mention PTSD, or Complex PTSD, I would NOT be doing the topic of narcissistic abuse syndrome ANY justice. Ptsd, in laymans terms? From a fellow sufferer? A Cerebral anxiety attack that makes your whole body come alive with PALPABLE FEAR. The rapid heart beat, the intrusive and spinning thoughts and fears  just like the abuse is CURRENTLY HAPPENING SEQUENTIALLY ALL OVER AGAIN. This is called RE-LIVING. Its as if the traumatic abuse event is occurring in the present tense. All the emotions of fear, shame, shrinking, wincing, looking over your shoulder &amp; walking on eggshells waiting to be attacked ruthlessly AGAIN. Physical numbness  (toes, fingertips, lips) is common, as is emotional numbness (especially inability to feel joy). Avoidance  of places, sounds, tastes, and songs that remind them of their abuser or the abuse. Intense feelings of anxiety even in anticipation of having to revisit the memories. Memory Loss  Almost all targets report impaired memory. Partially due to conscious avoidance as well as from the damage done to the hippocampus, an area of the brain linked to learning and memory. Need for solitude / tendency to isolate  Were EXHAUSTED after narcissistic abuse. Feelings of withdrawal and isolation are common; we just want to be in our own head for a while, find our own answers; thus, solitude is sought. Lack of Joy and Hope  Inability to feel joy (anhedonia) and deadening of loving feelings towards others are commonly reported. One fears never being able to feel love or trust again. The target becomes very gloomy and senses a foreshortened future sometimes with justification. Many targets ultimately have severe psychiatric injury, severely impaired health and/or stress related illnesses. Sleeplessness- Melatonin became my new best friend after narcissistic abuse. The nightmares and night terrors can be overwhelming that good restorative sleep becomes impossible. Napping became my new favorite passion. Sleep becomes almost impossible, despite the constant fatigue; such sleep as is obtained tends to be unsatisfying, unrefreshing and non-restorative. On waking, the person often feels more tired than when they went to bed. Depressive feelings arrive very early in the morning, making falling back to sleep an impossibility. Feelings of vulnerability and loneliness may be heightened overnight. Anxiousness, Guilt &amp; Disturbing thoughts  Targets have an extremely short fuse and are easily irritated. The person frequently experiences obsessive visions of violence happening to the narcissist hoping for an accident for, or murdering the narcissist; the resultant feelings of guilt further limit progress in healing. Fight or Flight Response  With your system on alert for ever-present danger in the environment its easy to react sensitively to sudden changes  causing the startle response. Awareness of symptoms  Its very harrowing to realize that you are different from you were before the narcissist; FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. When you are very aware that PTSD has replaced the narcissist, it emotionally drains the target of any hope for being PERMANENTLY NARCISSISTIC FREE. We dont want to be constantly reminded and aware of the person we escaped. We want to live freely, however symptoms, are a constant reminder that we DONT. URL"
75,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Letter to my abuser,32,bj7ig4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bj7ig4/letter_to_my_abuser/,2019-05-01 05:33:06,"Youve told people that you miss me and wish that we could still be friends and that you feel bad about what happened, but I just dont believe you. This was never even a friendship. All you ever did was lie to me and manipulate me and use me to feel good about yourself. That isnt how you treat someone who you care about or have any respect for, especially not a friend. You dont miss me. You just miss having someone naive enough to believe in you. You never cared about me. You just needed a constant source of attention and validation; someone who saw you how you wanted to be seen. You are the biggest phony I have ever known. You act so self-righteously, yet you are the biggest offender of the transgressions you ridicule others for. The good man you pretend to be is all an illusion. That man would have wanted to make things right, but you tucked your tail and walked away like the coward that I now know you are. As soon as you realized that I was no longer going to play along with whatever this was, you left me alone to piece together your lies and bizarre behavior. Maybe you were just hoping that I would never figure out who you really are and what sick game you were playing. I honestly think that the only reason that you pretended to feel guilty and said that you miss me is that youve burned bridges and ruined relationships with other people. Its obvious that you're grasping at straws here, and its honestly pretty insulting. If I was half as important to you as you pretended that I was; if you value our relationship at all, then you wouldve had something to say months ago. One honest conversation would have solved everything but you were too busy fucking my manager to even bother. Im honestly really glad that you didn't bother because that gave me the time and space to heal and to build real, healthy relationships with good and honest people. My connections with other people have shown me that even the good days with you were bad. You are an all-consuming bottomless pit; ravenous for admiration and approval, with no consideration for those you drain the life from. You constantly lie, and you use exaggerated gestures to confuse people with your charade. You are so obsessed with being perceived as the good guy that you play the white knight in shining armor just to get your validation when you have no actual regard for those that you manipulate. You are always on the hunt for new people to convince, chasing new opportunities to play your role. But, you take no initiative to maintain the relationships you already have. You go to great lengths to live in drama and novelty instead of putting in the effort it requires to have anything tangible or worthwhile. I suspect that most of your relationships and friendships go this way and that's why you cant keep people in your life. You have to keep everyone at an arm's length in order to maintain the mask of lies. Your charade is a cheap imitation of love and intimacy, and it ultimately leaves you unfulfilled and unsatisfied. And that is your tragedy. Your desperate need for love, true acceptance, and genuine human connection will always be thwarted by your insatiable desire to be deceitful. I can see that the disconnect is slowly killing you. You are empty and lifeless; for that I pity you. At this point, I truly believe that you are incapable of having honest and meaningful relationships. You choose to play the same games over and over again with ALL of the people in your life, knowing all the while that it will never fill the void. Its a sickness. You are a predator; the way you go after vulnerable people who you force dependence on, making them feel like they cant speak up or leave. You twist the narrative of every situation to somehow always play either the hero or the victim without realizing that youve been the villain all along. Our entire relationship was just a sick game of how bizarre you could make things and how much bullshit you could sell me before I would finally stand up for myself. You spent months pushing boundaries, moving goalposts, gaslighting me, and creating double standards just to see how far I would let you push me. You made me feel crazy for holding you to the same standards that you pretended to hold yourself to. You proved time and time again with your actions that you have no real morals or integrity. I played along for as long as I did, not because I was desperate to keep you around, but because you are so moody and unstable that I was honestly afraid of what you were capable of. Youve lied about serious, horrible things to get sympathy and attention; faking vulnerability to create a false sense of trust and intimacy. Then you made everything a tumultuous whirlwind of intensity and confusion because you realized that no intelligent or logical person would fall for any of your bullshit if they were in their right mind. Your behavior was outlandish; from making grand gestures, big declarations and promises one moment and then treating me like an afterthought the next. You did everything you could to make this as confusing and miserable for me as possible because you got off on the attention and thinking that you had power over someone else. You feed off of the reactions of other people. You loved making things so muddled and uncomfortable that I doubted if it was even my place to question what was going on. You got off on watching me squirm. Youre so manipulative that you had me apologizing to you for pointing out your abuse. And you would rather walk away and leave me alone in the mess that you created than even entertain the idea of being honest for once in your life. I know you well enough to know that you arent smart enough to be this master manipulator. All of this demented behavior comes from the fact that deep down you know that you are insignificant and powerless. Its childish, desperate, and honestly hard to watch. I cannot say this enough times...You need professional help. Im sorry that something must have happened to you that was traumatic enough to cost you your humanity. You sacrificed your ability to have authentic relationships with others and even yourself all in the name of protecting yourself from being hurt. But anyone can see that you are hurting every day. You hurt so much that you have to project your pain onto other people. Who put you down so badly that now you have to inflict abuse on others just to feel relevant? Even after all of this, I dont hate you. I forgave you a long time ago because I dont want to carry around any resentment or bitterness because of you. This relationship was incredibly toxic and going no contact with you for the last several months is a decision I will always stand by. I really do hope that you grow as a person and make some changes because youre currently headed down a dark and lonely path; ultimately you have no one to blame but yourself. But I dont know if there is anything I or anyone else could do to get through to you. You have lied so often and for so long that I dont think you can face the truth. I get to let go and move on, to walk away and go live my life. But you are forever trapped in the mess youve made and the messes you will continue to make. There is nothing you can do to fix things between us or make it up to me (not that you would even try). I no longer need you to respect me enough, to be honest with me about what I am to you because I respect myself enough to never subject myself to you and your toxicity ever again. Im not even going to give you this letter because I know that anything I say will fall on deaf ears and that youll most likely find some way to twist my words or lie about what I said, if you dont lie about having read this letter at all. Even your apologies are disingenuous. You fake remorse and quickly steer the conversation away from the truth. I know that I scare you; and that you can never face me because nothing terrifies you more than having the truth of yourself revealed to you. I know that youre going to try to spin this as me being obsessed with you or something but the truth is that it took a lot of time, and a lot of head and heart work to process what you did to me. It took months to piece together all of your lies and abuse. I just want you to know that I know who you really are and that you didnt get away with anything. No matter how much you pretend to have it all together, no matter how much effort you put into your good guy persona, deep down you and I both know that you are a fraud."
76,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Dealing with years of N Abuse in a public hobby community,3,bjbdhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bjbdhz/dealing_with_years_of_n_abuse_in_a_public_hobby/,2019-05-01 11:16:17,"TL;DR Pissed off a Narc 2 years ago and they're still throwing fire at us. Very distressing. &amp;#x200B; We unfortunately were taken in by a Narc in a time of great vulnerability, and we joined his inner circle as two people valuable to him. As two shiny members of the small-yet-international hobby community we are part of, that he could claim as his and show off to others. Eventually we did not bend to his will, and he was unable to keep us in line. We made friendships with members of his group that he neglected and found no value in, and when the Narc ousted us from his group in an unnecessarily public way, those people came with us. It bit him in the ass, too, as his timing caused our newly formed group to gain instant validation through competitive success in a tournament setting immediately after the falling out. My husband is one of the top participants in our hobby and very well respected. I'm respected for my administrative ability and known as someone who is often involved in a lot of recognizable positive endeavors in the community. There have been a few times, as two groups in the same city or as people with fairly high visibility in the community, that we have had conflict. Either through their purposeful attempts to discredit us or my refusal to back down in situations where that was the only way conflict would be avoided, or even just as simple as having an opposing opinion about something major in the community such as whether XYZ standard should be established. As someone bullied a lot as a kid, I have perhaps an unhealthy amount of stubbornness against backing down from bullies. While it can be seen as admirable, it's also seen as unnecessarily confrontational. As a woman, I think I'm expected even more to shut up and take it, especially in a male-dominated hobby. We have dealt with slander and libel, complete defamation of our characters through outright lies as well as manipulations of the truth. It's surprising and disappointing every time I see another person believe everything hook, line, and sinker. Recently, as of this year, things have gotten worse. In my attempts to act like the other group does not exist, we ended up in a situation that should have been a non-issue, however the Narc and/or his friends used it as an opportunity to claim that we were purposely undermining them, which was a big deal due to one of my volunteer positions. Not only did I lose that position in a very public way even though I did nothing wrong, I also had no opportunity to defend myself or debunk the claims before being removed. They simply believed the lies and I was hung out to dry and labeled as a troublemaker, losing at least 2 professional relationships with it. A minor narc made a splash in our area in the past year and caused further havoc as I did not realize his true nature until recently when yet more things went wrong. He may have even been involved in the loss of my volunteer position. We chose to attend a large event he held, which wound up with a situation that, if it were any other 2 people besides my husband and the Narc, would have been fine. It wasn't, and my husband had outbursts that are easy to empathize with if you know he's a victim, but otherwise just seem like poor behaviour. The Narc's behaviour was also poor, but somehow he got a pass, of course. It's that whole scenario where the Narc is perceived as acting normal while his victim seems frayed and out of character. Now we are being shunned by the minor narc who ran the event (who I can say literally put my husband in harm's way) and another fellow with a big ego who, while annoying, was a consistent part of one of our yearly events, well, until now. It just feels like every few weeks something new happens and one or two more people abandon us and turn their backs on us who we either respected or at least didn't have a problem with. Meanwhile I can tell our extended friends view both of us as fraying, while the Narc sits pretty. Most of them don't even like him, but they still think we're overreacting. I feel like calling the Narc out on anything just makes me look whiny, childish, and petty, while anything the Narc does that could be perceived as cheating or manipulation of the situation is simply okay. Things that effect others in a negative way. Including public social media posts that label us as terrible people, and we have no way of defending ourselves without being seen as being trash magnets. Leaving this hobby or community is not an option, and neither is burying the hatchet with this bully. I truly do want justice, and I mostly have enough self-worth to not be bothered by losing what are obviously worthless relationships with some people, but it still takes a toll. We have so many friends in the community because we're genuinely nice and supportive and thoughtful. And that's great. But sometimes one or two of them ask me why can't I stop pushing back. And it makes my heart sink. I don't want the terrorists to win, and I don't want them to get away with hurting anyone else. Thank you if you got this far. And yes, I'm working on getting into therapy."
77,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Was I dating a narc/sociopath? Im starting to realize that maybe I did,3,bjr1sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bjr1sp/was_i_dating_a_narcsociopath_im_starting_to/,2019-05-02 14:55:00,"Briefly put, my boyfriend hurt me but he doesnt think he hurt me. He labels the reason why he abruptly broke up with me as 1) were incompatible and 2) Im too emotional for him; when in reality, he sees any sign of vulnerability as a weakness and he used my vulnerability as a reason to break up with me. He told me that I should be balancing my emotions with reason and that I shouldnt be feeling the way I was. Um excuse me but you DONT have authority over MY emotions. Only I know how I feel and no one has the right to question that, let alone take authority over that. It felt as if my vulnerability made me useless to him, and so he disposed of me as if I was a commodity. He also cited previous frustrations about certain events that he had which I was never made aware of, to justify his abrupt departure. He probably thinks he has better values than me because he acts out of logic all the time, meanwhile I think that there is a very fine line between being logical and being a sociopath/narcissist. He is 7 years older than me, is super intelligent, and can retain so much information in his brain it was sometimes intimidating - but I realized that had nothing to do with emotional intelligence. He lacked emotional intelligence and was emotionally illiterate. Whenever I spoke to him about my emotions, it was like I was speaking a different language. Based on his inherited tendencies, environmental factors in his upbringing, signs of alexithymia, lack of remorse after he broke up with me, I honestly think he is a sociopath/narc who feels minimal to no empathy. I may have dodged that bullet hard. Usually I start my day off being deeply sad and feeling betrayed and missing him, thinking about the happy memories, and then I usually transition into being angry, and then I usually feel disgusted and apathetic towards him by the end of the day because of how guiltless and inhuman he treated me towards the end of our relationship. Its the same cycle of emotions everyday. Its been about a month of no contact with him and I plan to keep this streak going. It just really bothers me that he walked away from this relationship thinking that he didnt do anything wrong or didnt disrespect me at all... and he is probably thinking that there is nothing inherently inhuman and toxic about the way he treated me towards the end of our relationship. But I know that he is the most stubborn person in the world and he wouldnt believe a soul who suggested to him that he has sociopathic/narcissistic tendencies because his mind is too rigid and he is too stuck in his ways to believe opinions other than his own."

Although I dont think he does. I was in an abusive relationship awhile back and while I thought I was healing from it, Healed, even. I dont think I ever truly did. I stopped caring about him &amp; realized my intense feelings for him were largely a result of his manipulation/lovebombing... it was an addiction I felt I had kicked. I thought I was in a good place. Mostly. But I was still lonely and in the end, I attracted a similar situation in the end. My gut told me it FELT the same in the beginning, but it didnt LOOK exactly the same. My my last abusive nex was physically abusing and pretty obvious in his manipulation. This one was a lot more subtle. Maybe because he knew about my past. Instead of telling me I was a bad person or lashing out when I tried to put up boundaries, he told me I was amazing and he didnt deserve me... he made me feel terrible for and his displays of vulnerability made me feel maybe I could trust him. At first. I opened up to this person so Im sure they knew all my triggers. Eventually they started devaluing me in really subtle ways. Denying affection, blaming me for their behaviors and feelings, pitting me in harms way and making me feel guilty for not being okay with that. Saying hurtful things, pretending they werent directed at me. (Weird, I was the only other person in the room. ) Reality became blurred. And I started to feel a familiar feeling. I was losing myself. As soon as I felt this and was met with complete refusal to discuss any issues or feelingsI knew I had to go. Right or wrong. I know that feeling. I know it never gets better. None of the promises ever become reality and things only get worse. In the past, I stayed and it almost killed me. I saw a flash of similar anger in this person and I knew what would happen if I didnt leave. Not to mention, my life had become significantly worse within just 6 months of being with this person. I know I will be okay... my feelings are back and forth, but I know it gets better. This sub helps so much. Your stories help. Reading the similar experiences and holding onto my truths, or what little remains of them. This was therapeutic to write. Thanks for reading. TLDR: attracted a different type of narcissistic personality a year after leaving physically abusive nex. Much more subtle but realized it faster and was able to separate myself. Trying to heal and grateful for similar experiences."

All you ever did was lie to me and manipulate me and use me to feel good about yourself. That isnt how you treat someone who you care about or have any respect for, especially not a friend. Youve told our friends that you miss me but I dont believe it. You just miss having someone naive enough to believe in you. You never cared about me. You just needed a constant source of attention and validation; someone who saw you how you wanted to be seen. You are the biggest phony I have ever known. You act so self righteous, yet you are the biggest offender of the transgressions you ridicule others for. The good man you pretend to be is all an illusion. That man would have wanted to make things right, but you tucked your tail and walked away like the coward that I now know you are. As soon as you realized that I was no longer going to play along with whatever this was, you discarded me. You left me alone to piece together your lies and bizarre behavior. My value to you was equal to my compliance. Maybe you were just hoping that I would never figure out who you really are and what sick game you were playing. I honestly think that the only reason that you pretended to feel guilty and said that you miss me is because youve burned bridges and ruined relationships with other people. Its obvious that you're grasping at straws here, and its honestly pretty insulting. If I was half as important to you as you once pretended that I was; if you valued our relationship at all, then you wouldve had something to say months ago. One honest conversation would have all but solved everything and you couldnt even show up for that. You invested so much time and energy into smothering me and controlling me in ways that I never asked for, but you were never interested in open communication or any type of actual healthy relationship. Im honestly really glad that you didn't bother because that gave me the time and space to heal, and to build real, healthy relationships with good and honest people. Relationships based on mutual respect, and honest communication; two things you could never sustain. My connections with other people have shown me that even the good days with you were bad. You are an all-consuming bottomless pit; ravenous for admiration and approval, with no consideration for those you drain the life from. You constantly lie and use exaggerated gestures to confuse people with your charade. You want to believe that youre this generous and honorable man but your benevolence is all a display. Your over the top grand gestures are unsolicited and always come at a price. You are so obsessed with being perceived as the good guy that you play the white knight in shining armor just to get your validation when you have no actual regard for those that you manipulate. You are always on the hunt for new people to convince, chasing opportunities to play your role. But, you take no initiative to maintain the relationships you already have. You go to great lengths to live in drama and novelty instead of putting in the effort it requires to have anything tangible or worthwhile. I suspect that most of your relationships and friendships go this way and that's why you cant keep people in your life. You have to keep everyone at an arm's length in order to maintain your mask of lies. Your charade is a cheap imitation of love and intimacy, and it ultimately leaves you unfulfilled and unsatisfied. And that is your tragedy. Your desperate need for love, true acceptance, and genuine human connection will always be thwarted by your insatiable desire to be deceitful. I can see that the disconnect is slowly killing you. You are empty and lifeless; for that I pity you. At this point, I truly believe that you are incapable of having honest and meaningful relationships. You choose to play the same games over and over again with ALL of the people in your life, knowing all the while that it will never fill the void. Its a sickness. You are a predator; the way you go after vulnerable people who you force dependence on, so that they feel like they cant speak up or leave. You twist the narrative of every situation to somehow always play either the hero or the victim without realizing that youve been the villain all along. Our entire relationship was just a sick game of how bizarre you could make things and how much bullshit you could sell me before I would finally speak up. You spent months pushing boundaries, gaslighting me, and creating double standards just to see how far I would let you push me. You made me feel crazy for holding you to the same standards that you pretended to hold yourself to. But, you always had an explanation or excuse that you sold so confidently no matter how nonsensical it was. You proved time and time again with your actions that you have no real morals or integrity, and you never actually did. I played along for as long as I did, not because I was desperate to keep you around, but because you are so moody and unstable that I was honestly afraid of what you were capable of. You berate anyone who speaks out against you. Youve lied about serious, horrible things just to get sympathy and attention; faking vulnerability to create a false sense of trust and intimacy. Then you made everything a tumultuous whirlwind of intensity and confusion because you realized that no intelligent or logical person would fall for any of your bullshit if they were in their right mind. Your behavior was outlandish; from making grand gestures, big declarations and promises one moment and then treating me like an afterthought the next. You did everything you could to make this as confusing and miserable for me as possible because you got off on the attention and thinking that you had power over someone else. You feed off of the reactions of other people. You loved making things so muddled and uncomfortable that I doubted if it was even my place to question what was going on. You got off on watching me squirm. Youre so manipulative that you had me apologizing to you for pointing out your abuse. And wasnt I just the perfect victim? I made this so easy for you by giving you the benefit of the doubt time and time again, because I always want to believe the best in the people that I care about and I find it nearly impossible to give up on those I love. You knew I was too unsure of myself to ask what the fuck is going on here? The second I FINALLY spoke up, you were nowhere to be found. You would rather run away and abandon me in the mess that you created, than even entertain the idea of being honest for once in your life. But I get it now. You cant afford to be honest with yourself, let alone me. I know you well enough to know that you arent smart enough to be some master manipulator. All of this demented behavior comes from the fact that deep down you know that you are insignificant and powerless. Its childish, desperate, and honestly hard to watch. I cannot say this enough times...You need professional help. Im sorry that something must have happened to you that was traumatic enough to cost you your humanity. You sacrificed your ability to have authentic connections with others and even with yourself all in the name of protecting yourself from being hurt. But anyone can see that you are hurting every day. You hurt so much that you have to project your pain onto other people. Who put you down so badly that now you have to inflict abuse on others just to feel relevant? Even after all of this, I dont hate you. I forgave you a long time ago because I dont want to carry around any resentment or bitterness because of you. This relationship was incredibly toxic and going no contact with you for the last several months is a decision I will always stand by. I really do hope that you grow as a person and make some changes because youre currently headed down a dark and lonely path; ultimately you have no one to blame but yourself. But I dont know if there is anything I or anyone else could do to get through to you. You have lied so often, and for so long that the real authentic you ceases to exist. I don't even know if anything is alive behind that mask. I get to close this chapter and move on with my life. But you are forever trapped in the mess youve made and the messes you will continue to make. This is your whole book. There is nothing you can do to fix things between us or make it up to me (not that you would even try). I no longer need you to respect me enough to be honest with me about what I am to you, because I respect myself enough to never subject myself to you and your toxicity ever again. Im not even going to give you this letter because I know that anything I say will fall on deaf ears. You refuse to hear anything that contradicts your narrative. You would most likely find some way to deny everything, twist my words, or lie about what I said, if you dont lie about having read this letter at all. Youll try to write me off as just being bitter that you didnt want to be with me, when thats never what this was about. Im sure it never even occurred to you that maybe I had MY reasons for not wanting to be with YOU. But, that doesnt mean I didn't have love for you. You will never admit what you did, hold yourself accountable, or care enough to be sorry. Even your apologies are disingenuous. You fake remorse and quickly steer the conversation away from anything that even gets close to the truth. I know that I scare you; and that you can never face me, because nothing terrifies you more than having the truth of yourself revealed to you. I know that you would try to spin this as me being obsessed with you or something, and you would love to believe that. But my real, honest truth is that it took a lot of time, and a lot of head and heart work to process what you did to me. It took me months of replaying everything that happened to finally piece together all of your lies and abuse. I got the answers and closure I needed, no thanks to you. Now that I know what hides behind the curtain, it is so clear to me. I dont know how I ever saw you as anything else. I just want you to know that I know who you really are and that you didnt get away with anything. No matter how often you play the victim, no matter how much effort you put into your good guy persona, deep down you and I both know that you are a fraud."

My nex said ""i feel like i'm a terrible person"" and ""i don't deserve love"". But if he thinks he's a terrible person, then why continue to be a terrible person? I also found this interesting, he once said ""there's nothing good to say about me, i'm not a good person, i hate myself"". I really felt for him when he finally showed some vulnerability, I asked ""why?"" and I thought he was gonna say something about his shitty behaviour, but then he said ""because I got dumped 14 times"". Not ""because I have no empathy, because I insult people"" or something like that. So to me it seemed like he was still incapable of actually seeing his faults and shitty behaviour, and only put the emphasis on getting dumped. Or, was he actually aware of all of his shitty behaviour, but was just too scared to mention it to me?? He also always blamed his exes for dumping him and never blamed himself. He said that it was women's fault, and that his exes went on and dumped the guys they dated after him as well, so it wasn't his fault. But one time he said ""it's hard to not be insecure after 14 failed relationships, i can't help but feel like it's my fault"". I was confused about him only blaming his exes and not looking at himself, and if he might need to fix need himsel, but suddenly now he said that. What is that about?"

Because this time, you took that from me, You took my desirability, my sexuality, N, I don't want anyone anymore. I hear about my friends in relationships and I cringe, I watched tv today and my stomach didn't even flutter at the sight of an actor that would usually have me in butterflies, I see guys in suits every day and I'm just ""meh"", When usually I'd be giggling with the girls at lunchtime, I don't feel sexy anymore, I don't see people like I used to - it is like a glaze over my eyes, The thought of dating terrifies me and yet, Oh god maybe I shouldn't admit this?

I'm terrified that if anyone comes between my legs it won't work properly, Like that time it didn't work with you, and you blamed me for it. I don't like anyone else, I don't find guys hot like I used to, The dating apps don't give me an ego boost like they used to, And it's so unfair, it's so unfair, Today's a bad day and I'm sorry because This is long, and it's sad, and probably not helpful but it's either this or send it to you, so... I don't know anymore, I'm scared I'll never feel that way with anyone, of wanting to just rip their clothes off, of wanting them inside me, Because I've linked that - and the lack of that - with you, You have made me feel so undesirable, And somehow... so \*undesiring\* And in such a subtle and underhanded way, that no-one else can ever see it, And it's just not fair...

82,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Discovery of a Narc friend in plain sight all along after therapy,3,b3qrw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/b3qrw2/discovery_of_a_narc_friend_in_plain_sight_all/,2019-03-22 00:52:01,"**NARC FAMILY &amp; NARC FRIENDS - BE WARNED, BE AWARE - KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN** I \[32 F\] was best friends with a gay male \[36 M\] for about 13 years. Because he lived in Germany and i was in Australia, our contact was limited to text, skype, calls and a catch-up somewhere in the world every 1.5 - 3 years. Although we *did* live together at 19 (me) and 23 (him) for about 6 months when we met in Australia, we were so young and a lot has changed since. &amp;#x200B; I've been undertaking intentional personal growth. I was raised by cluster B disordered parents and was the eldest of 4. I was parentified and basically a 'child therapist' to my mentally unwell mother, often talking her down from major depressive episodes and trying to navigate her and my fathers fiery tempers away from myself and my 3 siblings. &amp;#x200B; Meeting a wonderful man at 27 meant finally, i'd found something that was loving. Not perfect, but loving - and 'good enough' to feel seen, heard, respected. So, the last thing i expected was a breakdown about 2 years later, and I beat myself up about it at the start, but now i see i finally felt safe to process trauma, so it was meant to be and bound to happen, and ultimately, healthy. &amp;#x200B; I started having nightmares and flashbacks of awful memories and incidents in my childhood. Often I'd be simply washing dishes, and little triggers like the fridge noise would bring back memories of seeing a child being thrown against a fridge (my mother did this to one of her daycare kids and swore it wasn't on purpose - but it absolutely was and it was sick!). Eventually I sought out therapy, it was too much to stand alone and i didn't want to dump everything on my spouse, the way my parents dumped their trauma and issues on me. I felt ashamed and scared I'd lose the love I had from my partner, but he was nothing but supportive, if also a little shocked, at the revelations as they came up. &amp;#x200B; it has been over 2 years of therapy now (2 years and 3 months!) and I am so happy to say i've been able to process trauma, grieve the lost childhood and identify similar people to my parents in my circles. I NEVER expected it would be my best friend who'd be cut out of my life though. In fact, because *he* did therapy for 7 years, i thought he was wise, well, etc. instead, last year i realised more and more, how he wouldn't *really* listen when i spoke and shared vulnerability, or he'd get competitive and mean-spirited i.e. *'ohh pooor you, you're still stuck in that place in therapy right now - i'm sooo glad i'm past all that! i feel great'* (on me reading Alice Millers 'the gifted child' and feeling it resonated in parts). &amp;#x200B; He made me doubt my relationship a few times and often tried to get inbetween our debates or start fires where there wasn't smoke. My partner picked it up and warned me. I felt so naive and silly but once pointed out i could see it clearly. When I moved overseas my 'friend' was hyper critical and ghosted me, when i fell in love - same thing, when i got sick, same thing. So last year after identifying this pattern, I started observing his behaviour from afar. I saw as he started to seemingly 'lose it' the more boundaries i set, the less i told him about my private life and therapy, and the more i respected myself. &amp;#x200B; Eventually he started pursuing his friends boyfriend and got angry when i didn't approve or encourage it. And this was typical of him. Any time I was happy, not in agreement, or vulnerable (sick) - he'd go cold. So I realised, if i can't be myself in this friendship - i mean the real me, raw, without placating to him, then there's no place for me here. I haven't spent  and time on therapy to shit all over it and not use it. That would be sadistic and pretty sure i got the shirt from childhood and ain't that great! no spank you! So, i told him honestly that i didn't think he was going down a healthy path, getting between his friends longterm relationship and having an affair, he told me 'love is love! what about when YOU fell in love!' and i told him it was different, i didn't sabotage a friends relationship. Well - he didn't like that. So he ghosted. Eventually, he texted me a lot of 'i'm so busy right now' messages in a passive-aggressive way and i thought - no need. Just live your life and if we talk at some point, we talk. If not, c'est la vie. But he kept insisting on trying to make me feel small with these texts like 'ohhhh i'm SO busy with friends right now and i'm in love, omg life is amazing!! hope ur fine' i just called him on it one day - literally phoned him, we spoke. I told him I'm aware there's a pattern of ghosting when i don't comply with his wishes - he went silent. I told him i don't like how he treats me and tries to make me feel small - i told him no need to keep messaging 'i'm so busy/so in love/so wonderful' - just live your life! No need for updates. He HATED it. I shared that i didn't think it was a good idea for us to keep being friends, as it wasn't feeling real or genuine to me anymore. He agreed 100% and said 'i've been thinking this for a while actually' - it was news to me but i accepted it. I told him that due to the past, how he'd 'hoover' after a disagreement, i wasn't going to be up for reconnecting later as i just felt we were on different paths. He agreed to that too. &amp;#x200B; 5 months later i get an email *'I know this is out of the blue but I just wanted to let you know that if I died tomorrow I would be absolutely grateful for the friendship we had and that I just want the best for you.'* I told him this makes me uncomfortable when he does this sentimental stuff and i don't like it. I said ""we had our parting, and we wished each other well. I would prefer to just move on. These sentiments don't feel genuine, not after what has happened. And i've had enough. So as i said all the best and everything, but we're just on different wavelengths."" &amp;#x200B; After, he sent me this (like a poem structure no idea why): *What you assume is wrong.* *You have changed and this is ok.* *But me too I feel uncomfortable with your behavior.* *I just said what I wanted to say cause I am confronted with death again.* *My dads brother passed.* *Out of the blue.* *And I just wanted to tell you what I feel.* *Nothing more.* *I didnt intend to come back to you or us.* *There is no such thing anymore.* *And I am ok with it - believe me.* *So your assumptions werent right.* *But thanks for replying this way.* *Take care.* *Not gonna contact you again.* *Dont worry.* *Good luck.* &amp;#x200B; and i waited a week thinking - no. no need to reply, leave it. But something in me snapped, i felt so p\*ssed off at how he'd manipulated things! he didn't fight me on the point of parting when i raised it in fact he thought of it first apparently - so why now try to bait me and get pity or sympathy? I basically told him i don't owe you empathy and attempting to dump feelings on me after we agreed to part is self-absorbed with no consideration for the other person and their clearly communicated boundary. This time, I clearly said don't reply, don't contact me in 5 months with a new sentiment, because i'm not interested. I said I think it's disgusting how you're using a death to try to somehow make *me* feel like i'm bad or insensitive! I shared that I'm wide awake, and i'm not the 'supply' anymore - never will be again. &amp;#x200B; I **know** 100% i shouldn't have replied. But I got so sick of his manipulative sh\*t! Who he was on the phone 5 months ago to these emails today are like literally two different people. It's CRAZY MAKING!!!! And he ALWAYS does it! Everytime he discards me due to be being vulnerable, too happy or too sad, he comes crawling back. Well that's it i am done. I grieved the friendship for about a month last year - and i cried, and felt sad, like a failure and a loser. now? F\*ck right off 'buddy'. I see how you work and never again. &amp;#x200B; By the by - his fathers brother? Is 90!!! And he makes out as if they were buddies. They weren't!! I'm just **so done.** &amp;#x200B; **thanks for reading sorry for the novel - had to get it out - had to share. Please stay aware who's in your inner circle. Don't be afraid to review and reflect. Not saying you need to cut people out - but boundaries are key - and normally (in my experience) people who don't like boundaries or punish with silence, are red flag kind of people. Just be careful.** &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"
83,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,How To Handle Persistent Covert Narc?,1,b7swi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/b7swi1/how_to_handle_persistent_covert_narc/,2019-04-01 08:18:01,"Hey all, Sorry in advance if this turns out to be a bit long-winded. When I get on a roll it's hard to stop! Haha I posted here a couple of times a few months back about the mistreatment I was getting from a girl who had come into my life while I was at an emotional weak point. I firstly just wanted to thank the good people of this sub for pointing out some of the red flags and confirming that there was a very good chance I had a covert narc on my hands. (I wasn't even familiar with the term before this girl arrived on the scene). And secondly I was hoping to pick your brains for some advice/reassurance on her latest attempt at messing with my head. I have been told by many people that the worst way to deal with a narc is to challenge them on their behavior as they immediately take the defensive and set out to sabotage you, so I'm just wondering how exactly I should go about firmly creating distance between myself and my narc after her latest hoover attempt. To give you a little background, this girl was left by her former boyfriend of 10 years for another woman in January of last year, and I was going through a break up of my own at around the same time. She must have seen a certain vulnerability in me and latched on to me almost immediately after my previous relationship ended. Things were very intense in the beginning, during what I now know was the love bombing phase. She was saying all the right things to keep me on side. Telling me how I was ""one in a million"" and that she now realized that her ex ""never loved her and never treated her this well"". Eventually we slept together, and from about two days later there was a dramatic shift in her behavior and she was totally different. She called me at midnight bawling crying on the phone saying that she had just been verbally attacked by her ex over the phone for an hour. Turns out she had contacted him the night before we slept together to tell him that she was ready to move on with me and she was just letting him know out of ""decency"". Naturally, he didn't give a shit, having already settled down with his new lady (who it turns out had also left someone to be with him). She then proceeded to tell me that she had contacted the ex of the other girl (who she had never met) through a private facebook mail when she was drunk later that same night. She wouldn't elaborate on why she contacted him but I suspected it was for a revenge booty call. The bloke, not knowing her from Adam, was freaked out and told his ex about the contact...hence the angry phone call that reduced her to tears. Don't ask me why she felt the need to confess any of this to me but during his phonecall to her, her ex apparently told her that he feels sorry for me and almost obligated to warn me about the type of person I'm getting into a relationship with. A red flag for sure, but she had 100% reeled me in by this point so I was looking at EVERYTHING through rose tinted goggles. I reassured her, told her not to worry and that I wasn't going anywhere. She apologized for being such a mess on the phone and burdening me with that shit and promised it wouldn't happen again. The following two months were a f**king roller coaster to say the least. If you can believe it, we ended up in a situation where she would text me from sunrise to sunset every single day of the week, bar-none. But it is with a heavy heart that I tell you that despite this, I could NEVER get her to commit to another date from that point on. Any plans that were made (and then subsequently broken) were all made on her say-so. I had quickly learned not to put her on the spot and suggest anything specific as she would fly off the handle saying it was ""pressure"", so ultimately left it to her to make plans for dates etc. What would happen is she would feel me losing interest every couple of weeks and then dangle a proverbial carrot in the form of vague plans to ""maybe do something this weekend"" to reel me back in, and then she would of course find an excuse to break said plans on the day. I'm ashamed to admit, this worked on me...probably for a lot longer than it should have. The last straw came on the day of my birthday...By mid afternoon I hadn't heard a peep out of her. I had already been contacted by my nearest and dearest with well-wishes...including my ex. But nothing from her until late afternoon and only in response to a text I sent her asking how her day was going. She apologized for not getting in touch sooner, that things were crazy at work and joked that it was my fault for having my birthday at such an awkward time. Ain't that some shit??? Saw everything for what it was at that moment and suddenly any positive feelings I had for her evaporated and I just felt jaded. Immediately cut contact with her and booked myself a holiday. Believe it or not she tried to strike up conversation again only a couple of days later, acting like the unpleasant conversation on my birthday had never happened. I was just matter-of -fact in my replies and made sure not to keep the conversation going. Sometime around November she seemed to get the hint. Christmas and new year both pass without any contact from her. Then I went on a skiing holiday to France with a group of friends in early Jan. Posted some pictures on instagram and almost immediately upon seeing them she gets in touch, telling me how she was so jealous of my holiday and that it looked amazing but I really deserved it after the year I had (The irony was not lost on me). She then said ""Miss you. Let me know if you'd like to get a drink and catch up"". Once again, ashamed to say that I fell for it. At the time I was working every weekend and she worked Mon-Fri so we picked a Saturday and it looked like the date was actually gonna happen this time. I booked a day off work for it and told her that I had done so. She said ""great"" and then I didn't hear from her again until 8pm on the night of the proposed date. Call me crazy but I don't think you can give someone a more clear cut sign of your commitment to a date than by telling them you've booked a day off for it, so as a matter of principle I wasn't making the next move. So 8pm rolls around on the Sat night and a text comes in ""did you forget about tonight? haha""... I couldn't believe my f**king eyes. She had done it again... thrown some semblance of doubt over whether this was just a misunderstanding or something more sinister. I said ""of course not...I did book the day off for it after all. I just assumed when I didn't hear from you that you had lost interest."" She said ""Oh my God...I thought the same"". (F**k outta here with that bullshit). I said I didn't know whether to laugh or cry but that it was still early and we could still meet if she wanted. Then she started with the ""Oh well, I'm actually feeling a flu coming on too...I feel awful, you booked the day off for this"". I told her not to worry about it. It was around this time that I stumbled upon her on tinder as well...Which I found interesting. So I went right back to keeping my distance and only replying politely whenever she would contact me. This past Thursday she contacted me again asking if I had any plans for this weekend. I told her I was free on Saturday (out of curiosity to see what she was up to more than anything else) She took a half an hour to reply (after being the one to instigate the conversation) and she threw out the most blatantly half-assed suggestion for a date I've ever heard in my life. She said she was ""half thinking"" of going for a couple of drinks in her town on Sat night if I fancied catching up. But made sure to point out that it would be just a couple of drinks as she had to be up early on the Sunday morning. I should also point out that she lives three towns (about 15 miles) away from me and that the public transport system is unbelievably shitty here. So since we'd have been drinking that meant I wouldn't have been able to drive so my only way to get there would have been a taxi - $30 each way. I should also point out that our towns are both an equal distance from the next big city with endless options for public transport, so we could have both made an equal effort and literally met in the middle...but no...this offer was exclusively for a drink in her hometown and nothing else. She even ended the message by saying ""don't know if that's too awkward for you"". So all I could see when I read the message was ""Listen, I could use a drink and you're clearly a pushover...so I want to be clear that I'm making fuck-all effort in this scenario...This either happens on my doorstep or it doesn't happen at all"". I politely replied with ""I see...Yeah to be honest it's not ideal for me. I'm looking at a $30 taxi journey each way...bit pricey for a couple of drinks"" She replied with ""no worries"" and I haven't heard from her since. No suggestion to meet in a neutral place, or no plans to reschedule when she didn't have to be up early the next morning. Just a simple ""no worries"". Almost like the whole thing had been some sort of big shit-test. But history has shown that just when I think I've heard the last of her, she resurfaces as a new and improved covert narc. What do you guys think? Is it just a matter of time before I hear from her again? And how do I tackle the situation if I do? Thanks again for the advice, and just generally being awesome!!!"

85,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Is it all about shame?,5,bahafk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/bahafk/is_it_all_about_shame/,2019-04-08 01:19:34,"(Disclaimer: You should NOT use this theory as a basis to break NC or justify sticking around. This is for information purposes only.) Today I watched an interview on the YouTube channel Inner Integration with Dr George Simon. His key theory is that at the core of who these people are is a deep and toxic sense of shame upon which they have built their entire personality. He proposes that if these people are to have any chance of changing they need to fundamentally change how they deal with shame. This makes a lot of sense to me, and explains the accountability and vulnerability avoidance. If anyone found out how truly ashamed of themselves they are it would destroy their ego. How do you deal with that level of shame of what you've done? You bury it as far down as you can, under layers and masks, and you do everything you can to prevent anybody finding out about it. You take it to your grave. I spoke to a friend yesterday who admitted to me that he had been like this in the past. He hit rock bottom and sought therapy for depression. All I can say is, the therapist he found must have known and realised the truth. He admitted to me that he had dug himself a hole that he couldn't see a way out of, so the only option was just to keep digging. It takes great courage to admit to any of this, and the effort he has put in is truly paying off. I work with the guy daily, and I've noticed the change in him, but only time will tell. What are your thoughts on this?"

Innocent as it started, The love that grew in vain, As toxic as they come, Yet no reason to complain. No validity or solace, Still that feeling would remain, As the years went by unconscious, And with them went disdain.

I cant think straight anymore, I think Ive gone insane. "

This made me livid. We live in a small town together, he knows what my career is and where I work. You can't tell me he didn't put 2 and 2 together, and do this on purpose. When I called and confronted him about it (which was a mistake, because I can't argue with someone who thinks they're right all the time, or get the truth out of someone who is angry about the fact that I know what he is) he of course lied to me, gave me indirect answers, or no answers at all. What was interesting though is that he kept telling me, ""I haven't heard from you in two months, I haven't heard from you in two months"" like he was hurt by it. Then cleared himself from any vulnerability and desire for me by telling me he had to block my number, because I was texting him mean things. I had texted him some very hurtful and attacking things, but it was only because I discovered what he was and what he had been doing to me, and I wanted him to know that I knew. Yes, I initiated ""no contact"" when I discovered he was hoovering me for the third time after he broke up with a girl he had left me for in the first place. I had to to protect myself. I wasn't going to let him use me like that again. I think it made him royally angry, and that's why he's dating this new girl at my work. Anyway, I'm starting to notice some triangulation going on here. Being a former partner of this NARC, I thought I was done with him. He shows up constantly at my work. I had to move offices to prepare for this, because I knew he would. He shows up to hang out with her, bring her flowers, or even drop her off and pick her up from work. He did all of this for me when we were dating, but didn't make such a show of it like he's doing now. I thought for the longest time that this new girlfriend had no idea about our history together. Then, she weirdly got personal (probably because this new boyfriend of hers won't listen or demeans what she has to say, so she's become lonely) confided to my boss that she knew. That he told her I was still incredibly broken up about it, and still wanted him. It's so obvious that he's projecting that image onto me to create a jealousy triangulation dynamic. Thank god my boss knows my side of the issue, because she told this new girl/coworker that I was absolutely done. Anyway, I fear that this triangulation he's trying to pull is not working exactly in his favor. So far, I have pretended like I have no idea this new coworker is dating my Narc. I have helped her out with work issues, shown her the ropes of the place, and been genuinely friendly. After all, it's not her I have a problem with. She's seemed to notice this too. Not only did she confide in my boss about how much she actually likes me, she mentioned in front of my entire fellow staff at a meeting that I've been very helpful to her at this new job, that I've taught her a lot, that I know what I'm doing, and that she appreciates and likes me. I can't imagine she's doing this for personal gain. Sometimes I think she might've gone home to my Narc, told him this, and that's when he finally admitted to her that we dated. He was so shady and manipulative when we were together that I can't imagine him offering up this information until he absolutely had too, and even then he couldn't make it out to be as bad as it was, because it would make himself look bad. Since this triangulation doesn't seem to be working in his favor (I imagine he wanted to make her jealous of me, and hate me as much as he does), should I be prepared for smearing in the future? Since I have not reacted negatively to him showing up at my work when it's unnecessary for him to be there, him showing up to volunteer at work events, or even friending my other coworkers on Facebook, I fear that his button pushing is going to get meaner/nastier. He's already been in my office without me there. He's going to events that are closely related to my department, and not his new girlfriend's. I'm fearful of his next move, because it's obvious to me that even though I have not been reacting negatively to any of this it's making him more powerful and brave with his actions. I imagine he thinks he can push the envelope eventually. Has anyone had similar experiences like this? I know there's not much I can do aside from continuing to ignore him, but it seems like he's not going to let up. I guess what I might be looking for at this point are some ideas as to what his next move will be. I want to be prepared. "

He's not an extrovert or flashy but instead is this externally charming and quiet and smart guy with a tragic childhood and all this vulnerability. He's hypersensitive and insecure and passive aggressive, but he's also always right and controlling and belittling and randomly outright emotionally cruel. I think it gives him pleasure and sustenance to cause emotional pain, like he's a bee sipping nectar, and it tastes sweeter if the emotional pain is like a sucker punch when I'm least expecting it. The thing is we're long distance in two different countries so we keep up daily by text and phone and skype to stay connected between visits and it can be very intimate and bonding and involved... but things have deteriorated so much, the cycle is SO tight right now it's like we go through the building tension and explosion and pain and silence every few days, it's constant and I'm in so much pain all the time. I've tried everything to change myself, to shut up, agree with everything he says, never defend myself, always let him have his way, avoid the words he'll jump on, take the blame even when I didn't do anything - nothing helps, there's always another thread to pull. I love him so much, I would have done anything for him, anything. And I feel like I'm being dragged under our relationship like roadkill, like he will only feel good when I'm squashed flat and buzzing with flies. About a year ago out of desperation I started to do this thing where I 'go on vacation'. Only I wouldn't actually go anywhere, I'd just tell him I was going on a hiking trip in the mountains with friends, or a work trip to somewhere really remote. Both are things I actually do, but I just add in an additional fabricated hiking trip here and an additional fabricated work trip there. And I delete all my social media apps and take a few days or a week of a break from him, but really I'm just at home and going to work like usual, without all the fights and checking in and misunderstandings and tension and pain. It's like when I give him a false vision of my current life I'm protecting the life I'm actually living from his eyes and his mind. When I say Im hiking and Im actually at home, my home is protected from him. His mental image of me is three states away in the mountains with a friend, so my real life alone at home, putting up cabinets in my house, watching tv, going for a walk  all of that is private to me and invisible to him. He cant touch it. He cant see it. He cant pass judgment. He cant own it. He cant control it. I feel safe at home for that week. It's like I've build a small secret cabin in the woods i can escape to when I need it and there is so much peace in that little cabin, and coming home (reconnecting with my partner) is very hard at the end of the break. And this plays out in other ways too, I no longer tell him anything personal or vulnerable about me, no more secrets because there's no trust left. He's used every vulnerability to hurt me and every secret to humiliate and I can't give him any more of that. Sometimes when we're laying in bed and he's whispering to me and asking me intimate questions, to tell him secrets from my childhood, or intimate confessions, I make something up that's not an outright lie, but not quite close enough to the truth so that when he tries to hurt me with it later, it doesn't hurt as badly. I realized this last month when we were spending every day together that maybe the reason he hurts me so much is that he senses I'm giving him a decoy version of myself and he doesn't love the decoy. Maybe he hates the fake version of me and knows I'm a liar and a faker and is disgusted with me. I really want to leave him but I feel so tied to him and so tired. I feel like I will never be normal again for another partner, like I'm a tree that has bent into the opposite shape of a conjoined tree and if I walk away, I'll be twisted into his reflection and will only ever fit someone exactly like him again. Thanks for letting me get this out. "

Now I know you're a narcissist; please prove me wrong.,1,a8kmrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/a8kmrk/an_unsent_letter_secret_love_and_work_mate_now_i/,2018-12-22 23:58:53,"A Despite so many tries to show you my remorse and vulnerability and to be mindful of the potential trauma exacerbated by the situation at hand, youve refused to offer any real chance to talk. It seems youve have chosen a path of silent treatment and discard to me. I use these terms very succinctly. These are forms of physiological abuse and punishment. Even if a relationship is over, warm, caring, heartfelt people do not do this. This wasnt no contact, to protect yourself. Instead you set an ultimatum where you would only recommence communications once you felt that I had been sufficiently exposed, shamed and punished for alleged misdemeanours in front of my business partner. I suspect you were even trying to use me to cultivate this person as a new source of supply after discarding me; to enlist a negative advocate in J. This was just a worsening of all the emotional withholding and isolation you dished out in D and I got more of while you were visiting W. Again, warm, caring, heartfelt people just do not do this to someone they have loved. Nor would they isolate someone they care for, to ultimately be left to conclude such things of you!! I believed we had a real bond. There were deep meaningful feelings on both sides; feelings that could really be hurt. But now you act in an abusive manner of control, punishment, avoidance, disempowerment and a shame gaming. By blocking me, youre repudiating my very existence and denied any expression of either of our feelings or needs. You insist that I am THE hurtful person. However in choosing the silent treatment what else can I think but that you seek to evoke pain and suffering in me in order to derive supply to feed your self-esteem and control? Nice people, even if incompatible and parting ways just never do this to one another. Unfortunately for you though, from the outset, this is a game Im sadly all too familiar with. I am no mind reader, and as long as I do not receive any answers, it is not my job, nor responsibility to analyse the message you may actually be trying to address by your silence. You shouldn't expect from anyone to read your mind. It is up to you right misunderstandings or to set the record straight. And a good person would strive to be caring to do. Independent of anything you feel I may have said or done, what you have done is beyond any acceptable boundaries and will not be tolerated. If you ever decide to adjust your behaviour, and open up I promise I will be respectful, supportive, not be angry, nor will I take advantage. I remain prepared to reset, to compromise, but this is *mission impossible* as long as I don't get a clear answer and you dont show signs contrary these conclusions. Sadly, for me this is how the situation now rests and I will move forward in work and life accordingly. T"

Telling this story from my new point of view feels as good as it did to finally get rid of my NExs final gift to me.] My NEx dumped me 2 years ago. On my birthday. I was devastated at the time because I hadnt realized that he was an N. Well, if Im honest I recognized some N traits but he hadnt sicced his N side on me in the 4 years we were together and besides I was so besotted with him I didnt let myself fully recognize for example how he ignored and scapegoated his son and put his golden child daughter on a pedestal. I felt completely safe with him. He listened to me, was compassionate, empathized, validated and supported me emotionally, and I did the same for him. We had had similar abusive childhoods and we both often said how grateful we were to have a strong mutually supportive, emotionally intelligent bond with each other, a bond that we didnt have with anyone else. I held his hand and let him cry on my shoulder when his son didnt call him on Fathers Day or his birthday. Then he fell in love with another woman. Our relationship was open so this normally shouldnt have been a threat. Initially he told me he wanted us both in his life and that while he connected well with his new partner he didnt have the same emotionally supportive bond with her that he and I shared. I told him I was happy he was happy in his new relationship. I also was honest and said while I knew he still loved me I was feeling a bit less than, in large part because Id been the scapegoat in my family growing up. He already knew about this and had always been supportive about it. He understood, didnt try to gaslight me, and asked what I needed to feel loved and supported. I said I needed his reassurance that I was still loved and valued, both verbally and through action, such as telling me he cared and making time for quality time with me. He agreed to do this. In open relationships its conventional wisdom to make sure existing partners feel supported when someone has a new partner. But he didnt. He took the vulnerability Id trusted him with and turned it against me. He said the right words but didnt follow through with action. He spent nearly all of his time with the new woman and didnt communicate with me unless I initiated it. The rare times he and I got together he was distant and acted like he didnt want to be there. His birthday came around and he spent the weekend before and the weekend after with her. He made a weeknight overnight date with me in between so I could celebrate with him also. At the last minute he changed it to dinner only, claiming he had an early meeting. I put on a brave face and accepted this (stupid me). I told him I understood he wanted to spend a lot of time with his new partner but I asserted my need for time with him too. I said I missed him. He responded I dont miss you as much as you miss me. Ouch. I should have walked away right then but I let myself believe he was so wrapped up in new relationship glow he didnt know what he was saying. What a fool I was. A few weeks later he did include me in a community picnic event where Id meet his new partner and her kids for the first time. I was looking forward to meeting her. The event was crowded and very noisy. Im an introvert and my NEx had always been supportive when we were in similar crowded noisy situations, checking in with me often to make sure I felt safe. Not this time. After Id spent some time making amicable small talk with the new partner I got overwhelmed by the crowd noise. I excused myself and went off to a quiet part of the picnic area for a time out. My NEx walked over to me. I thought he was there to support me like he used to but instead he yelled at me for looking miserable and said I was acting childish and sulking. I had officially become his new scapegoat. My birthday came around after about a month later. I was unavoidably out of town on the day but we planned a weekend date to celebrate my birthday when I got back. Again he changed it last minute from overnight to just dinner. At the restaurant he gave me my birthday present, three aromatherapy candles labeled happiness and love and another positive thing that I cant remember. He said he wanted me to be happy, then said that since I was so unhappy about his new relationship it was best that we ended ours. Just like that. I had mixed feelings - in spite of the way hed changed toward me I still felt very connected to him but OTOH I was miserable over being pushed away and tired of being scapegoated while he put the new woman on a pedestal, even though all the while he told me he loved me and wanted to maintain our relationship. I wasnt unhappy that he had fallen in love with a new person, I was unhappy because of the way he treated me when that happened. I said I understood he wanted out and that I was sad to see what had been such a beautiful relationship end. He said Im not sad. Im very happy with [New Partner]. Way to kick me when I was down. And over my birthday dinner at that. It took me a long time to sort through all the pain, sadness, and anger. I was mostly angry with myself for overlooking his N-ness until he turned it full force on me. I see him now for the abusive narcissist he is and am getting on with pursuing new relationships. Mutual friends who watched all this go down sympathize with me and confirm what an asshole he was. Im no longer in contact with him. But those damn aromatherapy candles. Love and Happiness and Whatever. They stayed in my hall closet for 2 years. I didnt want to use them and be reminded of that awful birthday and all that led up to it but I also didnt want to turn my back on the positive messages they represented. I dithered over this until yesterday when I said screw it and took them out of the house and put them in the trunk of my car. My plan was to drop the candles off in a Goodwill donation box but this morning when I parked at work I took them out of the car and threw them in the trash. It felt freaking fantastic. "
91,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,THE EMPATHIC SUPERNOVA : The feeling that I've become a narcissist now,1,ad6gm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/ad6gm5/the_empathic_supernova_the_feeling_that_ive/,2019-01-07 02:26:26,"In the devaluation and discard phases of the third cycle with my nex, I had started to get back at her manipulations and games, in quite similar ways to hers. After the eventual discard and me going NC, I have had a lot of introspection time. I was beginning to think that I had turned into a narcissist myself. Thankfully, I came across this article by H.G Tudor (a narcissistic sociopath and writer), and now it makes a lot of sense. What is the Empathic Supernova? In order to detail this phenomenon, it is first necessary to consider when it might appear and what is behind its appearance. The repeated application of our manipulations is deployed for the purposes of maintaining control over you. This control reinforces our notion of superiority, omnipotence and impregnability and enables us to draw fuel from our appliances and most of all you as our primary source. I have made mention of the Empathic Group, the group which lies to the left of the empathic-narcissistic spectrum and within this group there are three schools of the empathic individual; the Co-Dependent, the Super Empath and the Empath. The sustained application of the many and varied manipulations produces results for us. It also takes its toll on our victims. The Co-Dependent will cling on, desperate for the self-definition which manifests as a consequence of their ensnarement with us. They will soak up the abuse, the confusion and the control until they reach a point of breakdown. The cumulative effect of the silent treatments, the gas lighting, the physical abuse, the psychological trauma, financial mistreatment and sexual degradation eventually causes the limpet-like Co-Dependent to collapse into numbness, malfunction and potential hospitalisation. They gave and gave until suddenly they fell off the cliff and their fuel provision remained impressive on Monday and by Tuesday it had stopped. No longer capable of pumping out fuel, attending to our requirements and showering us with appropriate traits and residual benefits, this failure to function invariably brings about the discard of this individual. The discarded Co-Dependent, although distraught at the loss of the narcissist which they crave, is in no position to try to bring about the resumption of the relationship and thus, whilst we focus on their replacement primary source, they are allowed a period by which they can recover and once the lights switch back on again and the fuel starts to pump, the devaluation of their replacement has begun, so we come looking and hoovering for the Co-Dependent. Unable to resist, because of the nature of the hoovering and their own vulnerability, they are hoovered back in and the narcissistic cycle continues. Whilst third parties may try to assist the Co-Dependent to see and understand what has happened to them, their own substantial need to connect with a narcissist means it is very hard to make them take notice and stay away from us. Unless physically removed and isolated, the Co-Dependent will drift back to us. If not the original narcissist, a replacement narcissist will invariably be found. The empathic-narcissistic spectrum is a sliding scale that represents both empathic and narcissistic traits. On the far left the empathic traits are more numerous and stronger whilst the narcissistic traits are fewer and weaker. Move to the right and the empathic traits begin to lessen in number, their effects less evident and the narcissistic traits begin to increase and become more prevalent. Eventually, as one reaches the Narcissistic Group, on the right of this spectrum, the empathic traits have disappeared and all that remain are narcissistic traits which become more numerous and stronger the further right one goes within this Narcissistic Group. Accordingly, with the Co-Dependent, he or she will have many empathic traits and they are strong in nature. Their devotion to love, their honesty, decency, excellent listening skills, positivity etc are most evident and contribute to create a highly empathic individual. The narcissistic traits are almost invisible and the few that exist are weak. Accordingly, this prevalence of empathic traits attracts and is attracted to the prevalence of extensive and strong narcissistic traits. They locked together, complementing one another and consequently the Co-Dependent is inexorably drawn to those within the Narcissistic Group, with next to nothing in terms of their own narcissistic traits to act as some kind of repellant. The Empath may also find themselves shutting down, but more usually they are prevented from reaching a position of complete numbing though the intervention of a third party. Sure enough the toll exacted on the Empath is considerable and has damaging consequences, but, in general, they manage to avoid more often the fate of the Co-Dependent. Instead, rather than giving and giving until shut down occurs (as is the case with the Co-Dependent) the Empaths performance deteriorates in terms of fuel output in a more gradual fashion which means that when it dips below a threshold of acceptability for our kind, the Empath is also discarded. Not so damaged as to be unable to function, the Empath will endeavour to re-connect with our kind, having sufficient energy and ability to do so, but they will be shunned as part of this discard until it is time to hoover them. Unaware of what they have been ensnared by and with capabilities improved after a period of respite arising from the discard, the Empath is sucked back in by the narcissist and thus the narcissistic cycle continues. The Empath however may also realise that something is wrong, or assisted by third parties and more amenable to listening, takes notice of what these third parties are telling him or her. They have a moment of awakening and with that realise that they must remain away from our grip, however hurtful and hard it may be and thus they eventually escape, putting distance between them and our kind. The Empath has numerous empathic traits and they are of strength but they are not on the same scale as the Co-Dependent. The Empath will have some narcissistic traits, not many and not especially strong in nature, but they will have more narcissistic traits than the Co-Dependent. Their status as an Empath (along with the fact that there are more Empaths than Co-Dependents) means that Empaths become the bread and butter target for our kind. They too are attracted to us, not with the almost hopeless vulnerability of the Co-Dependent, but they remain not only attracted to our kind but a target. Finally, there is the Super Empath. The Super Empath is an excellent provider of fuel also and comes with a confidence and a fieriness which proves most tempting to our kind. The Super Empath sees his or her role as helping, fixing, healing and brining goodness to those around them. They have considerable energy, they are capable and their capacity for sustaining our abuses also makes them a considerably attractive prospect. The Co-Dependent can sustain considerable abuse until suddenly, like a light being extinguished, that is it. The Empath also can sustain our manipulations but their slide is slower and more gradual. The Super Empath, blessed with a vast capacity for empathy and goodness is also somebody who can sustain a lengthy campaign of abuse. There is no slide downwards with this individual like the Empath. There is no sudden collapse like the Co-Dependent. Instead the Super Empath goes in to Supernova mode. The trait make-up of the Super Empath is different from their cousins in the Empathic Group. Whereas the Co-Dependent has strong and many empathic traits with little and low narcissistic traits and the Empath has few and fairly low narcissistic traits but more and quite strong empathic traits, the Super Empath has a different constitution. The Super Empath has very strong and numerous empathic traits. He or she also has a number of narcissistic traits (more than the Co-Dependent and the Empath but not as many as the Narcissistic Group) and they are stronger in nature than those experienced by the Co-Dependent and the Empath. This arrangement is not problematic. Liken the Super Empaths narcissistic make-up to the light from a candle and their empathic make-up the light from a spotlight. The intensity of the spotlight is so bright that the candle light is barely noticed. Accordingly, the narcissistic element to the Super Empath does not appear. The Super Empath behaves in an empathic way and thus is a target for our kind. There comes a time however when the sustained abuse and the awareness of the Super Empath reaches a critical point. Rather than switch off or slide into decline, the Super Empath will decide that enough is enough. In some instances, this means that the Super Empath will escape and follow a similar route to that of the Empath and distance themselves from the narcissist. On other occasions they enter into Supernova mode. When this happens, the Super Empath will dim their empathic traits. This can only be dimming. The empathic traits cannot be shut off as they are wired into the empaths dna. Moreover, this dimming can only continue for a period of time and is not permanent. The naturally strong empathic nature of the Super Empath means that it will blaze bright again. However, when this dimming takes places, the gap between empathy and narcissism in the Super Empath lessens so that the narcissistic traits are more prevalent. They do not dominate nor do they take over, but they are allowed to shine. However, whereas in our kind the application of our narcissistic traits is unfettered since we have no empathic traits and thus these traits are directed in a malevolent, harmful and destructive manner, the Super Empath uses these unleashed narcissistic traits for good. This means that they will fight back against our kind and remain in the relationship with us. They will shut off the fuel provision, they will engage in manipulation of us, having learned how to effect it form their accompanying journey with out kind. The Super Empath will wound and wound, striking blow upon blow against the narcissist. It is worth pointing out that the Super Empath does not necessarily know that they are with a narcissist (they may only realise this later) but rather they know that something is very wrong in the relationship and it must no longer continue. Thus when some people ask the question Can you become a narcissist from being with a narcissist? or Can I pick up narcissistic traits from my experience of being entangled with a narcissist? The answer remains no. But, if you find that you are exhibiting such traits and you are deploying them against the narcissist, what has happened is that you are allowing your inherent narcissistic traits to have greater prominence. You keep them under control and you are not allowing them to harm or hurt innocent parties, but rather you are applying them against the narcissist in order to strike back. You always had these traits, you have not gained them by being with us, but what you have learned is how to manipulate from being with us and now you are turning those manipulations against us. The effect against us is varied. The Lesser Narcissist will discard immediately with a display of ignited fury as he seeks to escape the turning of the tables. He will need to get away from this empowered Super Empath and find a new primary source straight away. He wants to shrink from this blazing supernova of power which is causing him considerable difficulty through the cessation of fuel and the wounding from repeated criticism. The Mid-Range Narcissist will find himself in a tormented loop as he tries to assert control. He will not comprehend truly what is happening. He will not want to lose the Super Empath owing to the fuel provision, but he is finding that his ability to manipulate and the reasonable degree of calculation that he has, is being sorely tested. He will try to assert his control through passive aggressive means, even pleading with the Super Empath to stop and why cant you be good to me again? He will roll out the pity plays and sympathy cards in order to try to achieve superiority again. However, either the Super Empath decides to escape and leaves the Mid-Ranger in a confused and bewildered state or the Mid-Ranger slinks away and discards,unable to sustain the fight and needing a new and far more compliant primary source. The Greater Narcissist will rail against this insurrection and fight back. He will draw on fuel from alternative sources (usually the IPSS or IPSSs he has in the wings along with fuel form those NISS who are his inner and outer circle friends). He will relish the challenge shown by the Super Empath and a real battle of wills ensues as each combatant deploys manipulation after manipulation against one another. This hammer and tongs clash of the titans sees the Super Empath applying what they have learned, similar to the apprentice turning on his or her master, as the old hand seeks to slap down the irreverent upstart. The Super Empath may withdraw and escape, satisfied that they have made their mark and scarred the Greater. The Greater may ultimately recognise that only a stalemate (for now) can ensue and breaks off, discarding the Super Empath and focusses on the acquisition of a new primary source (or more likely the promotion of an already ensnared IPSS). The Greater however will not leave matters there. A note will be made to rejoin battle in due course and bring the Super Empath to heel. Thus the Empathic Supernova is when the Super Empath determines that enough is enough and he or she reduces their empathic traits, allowing the narcissistic traits to come to the fore and in so doing he or she trains their sights on making life difficult, miserable and awkward for the narcissist. This is why our kind proceed with caution with the Super Empath. Their capacity for sucking up the abusive devaluation and their impressive fuel provision is tempting indeed, but reaching the critical point and causing the ignition of the Empathic Supernova can have dire consequences for our kind."

The ones he knows he could walk all over and dominate. He is NOT a fan of the ones who clearly have a mind of their own, are assertive and outspoken. He classified them all as tough and speaks about them with contempt.

I from very early on loved you  your openess and clarity on things relational (I dont have that), your being and presence, your fun and simple approach to life all keyed with my soul in surprising and delightful ways. There is not a minute that I did not like with you. In our relationship I was the fucked up one and you were the normal one  you were stable to my instability, you were secure to my insecurity, you were open to my closed, you were tender to my harshness, you were communicating in my withdrawals. If you have regrets or mistakes  I put you up for it. Even recently I have tried to load what has happened onto your shoulders to make myself feel better (taking from you again what you didnt have). I fessed up because I couldnt take the pressure of my own making  you did not make me and if you had done anything differently the result most probably would be the same because the problem lay with me. &gt; &gt;You are beautiful, tender, sensual, open to life and experience, a great companion, fun, active, a complete wonder in the bedroom, uncomplicated in a beautiful way, discreet and a good and loyal friend with a precious heart. The gaps you feel in your life are because of all of these things not in spite of them. Because of all of these things you need to be able to share them with someone of the same and that makes for a good deal of pain and distortion when you are not. You, by and large do not experience pain because you are broken or faulty  you experience it because you want to give and share so much. With no one or the wrong person you will always struggle in a self destructive way. I am the really broken person - I did not value and struggled with the bleeding obvious. My pain in contrast to yours is because of my broke. You deserve better than that. &gt; &gt;I am not going to contact you again, not because I have changed what I feel or hate you, or think there is something wrong with you. You are fine. Im not going to contact you because Im really bad for you and I will be just perpetuating the hurtful cycles I started so long ago with you. &gt; &gt;I have told \[ex-wife\] that she is not to blame u or think poorly of you, I did the pursuing and I treated you poorly and you did not deserve it at all. &gt; &gt;Sorry seems a stupid word in this context so I will just end by saying that I am in a lot of pain over how I treated you  Im not seeking anything from you at all  forgiveness, compassion etc but I wanted you to know that I know Im not ok and you are. Please remember this as you go out further in your love of life and look after yourself ok."" &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Then this one after two months after he ghosted me a year ago and had given me the silent treatment: &gt; ""I dont want to hurt you or anyone else again - thats why Im out of the loop.

Now, when it comes to vulnerability, I'm ok with it. I don't go out into the world trying to project an image and I don't play games with people. I'm very straight-forward and manipulation isn't my currency. But I'm thinking that this actually puts me at a major disadvantage when it comes to narcissists, and maybe with people in general as well. It seems like everyone plays games these days. People are so determined not to ""lose"" that they go to desperate lengths. I tend to assume that people function above-board like I do, but this is so not the case, and it makes me think that I should be taking greater precautions to wear a mask, too. My ex narc used to say to me, ""Don't give it all away"". I had no idea what he meant at the time, because to me I was just being my normal, kind self. But knowing now who he really is, I completely see what he was saying. He saw me as stupid and foolish for being kind, honest, and open. He saw it as pathetic, weak. And I'm not saying he was right to feel that way, but with the sheer number of manipulators in the world today, is it not simply safer to always be on guard, and to be ruthlessly selfish like everyone else?

So, it's for the internet. I'm crying so badly. \----- Day in day out, I am really struggling to come to terms with what has happened. I don't take back what I have said regarding emotional abuse. I've insisted that bad behaviour happened both ways. I get really angry when you ""advise"" me because I don't think you have a right to be my perpetrator and my savior. I wanted to ask whether you would like to join me in therapy from January. We can find a therapist that we both like - I think it would require about a year to see results. Earlier this year I was already in the waiting list for the abuse recovery course. I told the social worker or whatever it's called that we could do a different course for couples in recovery and that you would join me. She was very patient and told me I would fail, that ours was one of the worst cases she'd ever seen, and that I would fail - of course I am again in the waiting list having achieved nothing - I really did believe you would come with me and solve it together. It happens in one every thousand of the cases they see; and that one-thousandth chance made me try again. When I left, I already knew all of this. I started researching it in 2016 (one day, if you are ever well, I can tell you the story and we can laugh); and I've been observing you for a really long time. It's not something I assembled together post-breakup to make myself into a ""winner"" (this is what you say). I put the story together beforehand, to allow myself to finally trust my gut and leave. Nothing in my pilgrimage to therapists, social workers and panic attacks at the night shelters is the story of a winner. I know I am not making it up when I'm in tears and other women in the support groups get me, they get me so intimately and so profoundly. I know it when in the middle of the day I have to go home vomiting and shaking with fear at the memories. I thought that in time, you would see it too - the damage that can be done without lifting a finger. I tried to explain it for a whole year; metaphorically, directly, indirectly. I am not the best but also you're not listening! That you can't see it - is like screaming underwater. You can't hear me from the shore and I'm going to drown before I know it. I'm an idiot, the biggest kind of idiot there is, because I was (am?) prepared to die trying. I hope you will come. It's a glaring mistake to send this, I know it, but I do hope you will see it, and know there's only courage and vulnerability lying ahead - and I continue to hope you will join me. Why? Because I really believe that you can't be this way, I believe in the person I've seen (sometimes) underneath the shell. Ah, did I only see him when he was injured? I hope you can do this. Please don't continue to live this limited existence. "

I am 7 weeks postpartum and 9 weeks post relationship with the narc who ruined my life. &amp;#x200B; I held on to that relationship so tightly, because I could not control the loss of my daughter. But I could at least try to control to the loss of this relationship that I felt I needed. I was in denial for several weeks after he discarded me. Then I found out that he had been cheating on me the entire relationship with multiple girls and that he had gotten engaged to his secondary supply before he even broke up with me. I disassociate with myself and think about myself at 36-37 weeks pregnant, raging hormones, uncontrollably sobbing because this man was mistreating me every day. Being as pregnant as I was, my vulnerability and low self esteem was at an all time low. He milked it. He milked me. He would send me into a breakdown and then tell me that I was overreacting and that it wasn't the hormones, I was just crazy. &amp;#x200B; I recently went on a 10 day trip to the mountains of Arizona to see my family. I was terrified to see them honestly, and had chosen not to go on this trip. My family has no idea that I was pregnant, because I found out at 31 weeks, and then I lost her at 38 weeks. How do you tell people that? You don't. It's nearly impossible to explain that to people who aren't in your every day life. But if I can say anything, it's that I am so thankful that I chose to go on this trip. Because I came back with a part of this void in my heart filled. Not fully, but partially. When I removed myself from my environment, I felt like I could finally breathe. I wanted to cry as we were leaving the state, because it felt like my demons were just rolling off my back, and it was empowering. &amp;#x200B; I stopped thinking about my nex every second of the day. I stopped obsessing over his new supply and what she had that I didn't. I stopped the contact with the ex girlfriend of my narc who told me what kind of a man he really was. She didn't have my best interest in mind. I realized that she was in it for the long haul and planned to obsess over him forever. She was prepared to be miserable forever. She was a projection of what my future would look like if I didn't let go. &amp;#x200B; I am still working through the healing of these two losses, every day. But I have stopped reading this thread. Because I feel like it still gives him precedence over other things in my life and he doesn't even deserve to be thought of. I won't lie. I still have moments where I think about him and I miss him. It hurts for a few moments, but then I remember the way that he treated me when I was pregnant. I remember all of the times that he lied to me or cheated on me. This was the first man that I ever felt I truly loved, and to know that he was feeding off of me and using me the entire time is disheartening. &amp;#x200B; But I am finally on the other side. My foot still dangles in the tunnel here and there, and the demons still follow me. But I think they always will. I just wanted to reach out and say that I'm okay. Time makes it better. Changing your environment makes it better. &amp;#x200B; I'm here if anyone wants to talk."
98,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,I fell in a hole and now I can't climb out.,1,9ryptc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/9ryptc/i_fell_in_a_hole_and_now_i_cant_climb_out/,2018-10-28 10:19:22,"Here's how I see how I found myself married to a Narc when I already knew he was a Narc... I had a hard time transitioning from being a teenager to an adult with divorced N Parents that would shuffle me around from one country to another. I was trying to find my place and where I fitted in, where my home was, all while getting medical attention for things I never did when I was younger, PCOS and ADHD. I dropped out of college because of promises of getting it paid for that never happened. Fast forward after my coming of age crisis, I had someone in my life that had showed me before, years ago in high school, that they liked me and were always so nice about it but I wasn't allowed to date in school so I gave it a chance now that I was free. As the relationship progressed I started seeing the flags, things he would say sometimes would mimic exact words my father had said to me before in his other language, but my thought was ""whatever, not like I've never dealt with anyone like this before right?"" Pretty sheltered and naive I kept the relationship going, opened my heart and talked about all kinds of things like how I wanted a family and what place I that more like home to me, he fed into it all, said all the things I needed to hear to believe he related to how I grew up and why I wanted all of that and that he wanted the same things as me. After a year he decided to enlist into the Air Force so he could go back to school. He asked if I wanted to go with him, that we would do all the things we talked about and he would only serve for a few years. I had explained to him my situation I was not legal in the country because of how my parents handled things, but that didn't really affect my life I still worked and lived like everyone else I also never asked him for help with any of that and didn't really talk about it unless he brought it up since it's a complicated subject and there was only so much I could do about it myself. He offered to help me, he said regardless of that he wanted to marry me, it was something we talked about and I agreed it was ok. Some time later on he proposed and we had a small ceremony which was all we could afford and most of our families live overseas anyway. We left and went to live in the Midwest where he was stationed, both under the impression it was not gonna be long before they made us move again. Since the time we've been here to now over 5 of his work colleagues and friends have killed themselves. This place really gets to you... Needless to say it got to met too. After we moved in and he got to work I spent his 16h shifts alone, I didn't know anyone yet and I didn't have a license so I couldn't drive. I relied on him for everything; groceries, dr. appts, meetings, anything. I had never actually felt loneliness before and it was strange, I used a lot of that time to look back at my life and my parents and reflect. It made me a little depressed, things were not between us when that started to happen, but eventually I overcame my own thoughts and adapted to the place. A couple of years later even though we were not doing so well, I decided it was a good time to be a mother, I talked to him and he agreed. Blessed that I am on the very first try after stopping my medication I got pregnant, and it's a good thing because exactly 1 week after that I had changed my mind, alas the sweet little person that came into our life was ready to go and had he not come that first time he probably would never exist. For those of you unfamiliar with PCOS one of it's most well known symptoms is infertility. My worst symptoms are painful cyst ruptures that lead to hospital trips sometimes. PCOS is never a one size fits all, and you never know what can happen but it's been known for symptoms like mine to lead to removal of one or more ovaries early in life. Before getting pregnant I didn't even know about much of this at all. And the chances of being successfully pregnant on 1 try with all of this is just so unexpected that it's something I still think about all the time... I Believe in the ""Universe"" I guess, whatever that means. Sometimes some things are just meant to be. Those are the basics. And the rest everyone already knows all too well. There's screaming, there's throwing things, there's breaking doors, there was a hole in the wall but after he had to fix that himself because we live in a rental and they are going to charge for that it never happened again lmao. Some gaslighting and all the other classics. My first thoughts were that he had a mood disorder since he seemed to lose it at really stupid small things, not in a way that it happened all the time but in a way that it was so random I never knew when to expect it. But after a few years of course I did learn. He is aware of some of his behaviors, in a rare moment of vulnerability he confessed his fears of having his son be the same way he was with his mother and sometimes me, amongst other things about what he feels and does. And it's interesting to see his awareness in lack of control of himself. In his core he believes he wants to be a good person but it's just not something I believe he can be to those closest to him. I've seen that I can't let my son grow up living in the same home as him, though I want him to be a present father to whatever point he wants that as well, and I know that with time after not being in the same house we will be good parents together, since we were already good friends before and have similar values. I just have to find the right way to get to that point without letting him blame me for all of the problems in his life that he will find once he is alone and doesn't have anyone taking care of him. My legalization process took so long I only was able to get a license after 4 years, and it's still a learner's permit because he got a sports car and I didn't feel comfortable taking the test on it yet since I haven't driven in 6 years. He's supposed to help me parallel park a few times so I can go get the test done on his giant boat of a car, but he never really does, there's always something else more important that needs to be done... I've been reminding him to call his bank to put me on the account or open one for me for about 2 months now, he keeps putting it forward and forgetting because of this and that, granted he does work an awful lot but I always remind him at home, and he knows he forgets later since it's happened so many times already, at this point he's not doing because he doesn't want to. In sum: I've been in a codependent relationship with him for 6 years. I don't have a driver's license. I don't have a degree. I barely have a high school degree (because it's foreign and need to be officially tran$lated). I have 2 year old that probably needs speech therapy because his development is so delayed, he used to but he doesn't even say mommy or daddy anymore. I don't have family in this country anymore other than a distant uncle and my sweet mother in law (thank god for her in my life), they all live in the east coast where it costs an arm and a leg to have a home. I don't even have an existing credit score, not even a bad or low one... It doesn't exist. I only have 2 options, work myself out of this in a way that won't jeopardize my ability to keep my son with me, trying to build a credit score, get a few school credits in, while working a job that probably won't pay enough to pay for childcare and a car/insurance and some of my school so who knows how long it would take. Or say fuck it and leave it all to go back home, where they may or may not be a chance that he would try to take him away from me out of spite, but I know that I have a better chance of getting a better job, only with no money to leave and no credit score to rent it would take a long time before I figure out my life from there and the uncertain only scares me now because of my son. He doesn't deserve being pulled away from his home but he doesn't deserve being taken to be with his father who has no idea how to parent since he never does it and has zero patience to do so alone. I've known and been pondering these things for a while now, it just gets so hard sometimes. Being stuck in a house with a toddler with an attitude is no easy thing, he sure doesn't help when he piles on the load. In truth I'm scared, he will always have his mother to fall back on, but I have no one. Once I leave it will be my son, and me alone. And we have a dog that I can't take with me, he's over 100lbs and I would never be able to find a place to live with him, but I know he doesn't care for him anymore, he only liked him when he first picked him out then he got bored and wanted a different one, it kills to think I have to leave him because he was always there for me in the worst of time and he is such a good boy. I think he may be 5 or 6 we don't know his age but the older he gets the worse I feel about not being able to take responsibility for him, it really breaks my heart. In a few weeks I'll be meeting with my therapist again to talk it out and maybe try planning things for my life. I had been reading things here for a while and wanted to leave my story too... "

I used to be super open, dedicated to authenticity and being transparent with everyone. Then I was abused by a Narc and I realized how naive I've been the last 25 years. I will be more selective and have more discretion when it comes to vulnerability. * Some people actually can't be reasoned with. I've always believed the opposite, that if I just give people a chance they can come around. However, accepting this sad truth has given me peace. * While ghosting is completely heinous in most situations, ghosting the Narc is completely reasonable, and even wise. * It is possible to ""love my enemies,"" ""forgive as Christ forgave you,"" and ""as far as it depends on you, if possible, live at peace with everyone,"" WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBERING THAT ""bad company corrupts good character,"" and not forgetting about ""looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted."" * Reacting won't upset the Narc. It feeds their frenzy. * Exposing the Narc won't help either. They will ""punish"" us for doing so. * Attempting to explain to other people rarely helps. The Narc already smeared us to all of them. * THE ONLY THING THAT GETS TO THE NARC IS US LITERALLY DOING NOTHING."

I pour energy, pain, love and time into someone who hurt me over and over again. But I allowed this person to hurt me. I allowed him to make me feel this way. In no way does it justify his actions or what he put me through, but it allows me to accept that I have control over how someone treats me. Because I love(d) him so deeply, I ignored all of the red flags, I patiently tried with him more times than I should have, and I showed vulnerability. Ive learned that vulnerability is a beautiful thing. It may feel scary at times like this, but without opening ourselves up to be hurt, we cant open ourselves up to be loved either. Please, be gentle with yourself. Remember that this person chose you because you are kind hearted, beautiful and light. They need you like someone would need water supply from the purest lake. You are good, and you will be rejuvenated with what they took from you. Remember that they simply took batch after batch of your energy, but they didnt take you.

WELL, that is where the term narcissist supply comes in. He needs to create false self and needs to feed it. Ultimately, people are not seen as geniune personalities to create healthy, emotionally satisfying relationships but to feed his false ego. So whats the deal with whatsapp? We humans are evolved to have mirror neurons, so we can tell what emotions the human we talk is really feeling. I dont know where I read it but people who listened their gut and run away after interacted with a serial killer psychopath they actually survived. Thanks to mirror neurons and miracle of evolution, like empathy, these people sensed something was wrong. On the other hand in whatsapp or in other online talk platforms you arent really having a conversation with a human being. It is like the difference between watching porn and having sex. Our minds do indeed know the difference. Both human to human social interaction and sex have emotional, physical, cognitive benefits. On the other hand you can talk to 80 people in one day via using whatsapp or masturbate via using porn, and you may still end up empty. Well you feel empty because we are HARD WIRED to have geniune social connection. Secondly and most dangerous part imo, for narcissist, you are one of his fanbase in online platform. Since his true self is long gone, he considers people as tools to make them admire himself. You think that you had a pretty sweet conversation with narc last night but in his mind I swear you are just the hot chick which makes his false self high and will be discarded when the time comes. Well, cant narcissist seduce you via just real life conversation? Well I assume it is possible, but in real life relationship you can know person better because it will take longer to bond, he cant wear mask too long and ofc you can really know what your gut is telling you about that guy. Thats my personal opinion and I am really done using social media, I am pretty sure it makes everything far worse considering both of my narcs seduced me via social media. It is just a really good tool to hide your trueself. Metaphorically speaking devil can introduce himself to you as an pure Angel in there. In real life that requires a good dedication to decieve other person. "

She told me everything from how it all started to how he totally disappeared from her life and blocked all contact with her. At first I was livid and wondered why the hell she was contacting me, after all shes married to someone else Now! But the more she revealed about how he had lied to her, triangulated her, used her and exploited her vulnerability - the more I just started to feel sorry for her. our experiences in life basically mirror each others, including the narc abuse, the difference being she had no idea about narcissists and narc abuse until I told her to look into it. I woke up to a tonne of messages from her after shed read up on it, she was disturbed but said she finally realised his behaviour wasnt her fault and felt liberated. A few days ago after that conversation, she messaged me a screenshot of him trying to contact her on Instagram this week after his most recent relationship had inevitably failed, despite discarding her months and months ago with no explanation or warning. We both laughed at the sheer audacity he has and she went on to send him a very long, cutting message in which he tells him she knows now what he is- she showed me the message and honestly I wish I had sent him something so well composed and finalising. Somehow this experience has brought me peace and the ability to let go more and more. Im not sure if its the realisation that it was never personal or that people are finally deserting him back but I really do feel like a weight has been lifted. "

Speaking/reacting with emotions or merely expressing them, opened you up to vulnerability. So I always internalized my own pain, my hurt, my questions, my love, my admiration. Im hard to read and very rarely express what I feel (good or bad). I avoid any sort of confrontation and just take it upon myself to come to terms with things, people, and situations....it made me the perfect mark. 2.5 years ago I met him M. He was tall dark and handsome and I was completely uninterested. He was flashy smooth and charming, lies pouring out of him within minutes of us meeting. Ridiculous lies. I always tried to avoid men like him, men like my father. I could always smell a manipulating womanizer a mile away. He was a tall drink of red flags and I politely declined getting to know him any further than the night we met. Through mutual friends he eventually got my number and we started texting back and forth. He seemed arrogant and overly confident, but that was apart of his charm, and after a few months I fell right into the trap. As soon as I did, he was a completely different person, the nature of our relationship changed. I think it was the movie The Prestige, where Scarlet Johansson asks Christian Bales/Hugh Jackmans character to tell me if you love me today because they were two people being one (sorry I just butchered that synopsis). But thats how I feel and have felt for years. Like Im dealing with two completely different personas with different needs. One that is kind and sweet and the other is straight from the depths of hell to punish me for all my wrong doings. I swear I have looked into the eyes of evil. He trusted me, not sure if he thought I was dumb or if he was super smart. Eventually, he either got lazy or over confident, because his stories no longer added up. Hed let things slip about his job, where he slept, his exes etc. I caught on, but was both too shy to confront him or believed this was for me to get over. Girls would call/text/FaceTime him at all hours of the day/night. His phone never shuts up ( that iPhone ping sound sends chills down my spine). Im not sure if he thought I would not look at the screen or just knew I would never say anything. Not to say I never confronted him, it just never went well for me. He would talk in circles with lies and nonsense, until I eventually tire and the fear of what hes emotionally and physically capable of just shut me up. He always knew how to make me feel guilty and crazy. He has made me question my own sanity, my own stability and my own reality. He has flat out said  this didnt happen, youre remembering it wrong, you are questioning my character with your accusations,  that wasnt with me, its the other guys youre fucking. Its an endless list. Eventually, he threw me away like I mattered zero, not just to him but in this universe. I was an annoying little pest that he finally had enough of. And still I said nothing. I took it in stride. I did not call. Did not text. Avoided anything remotely close to his neighborhood. I changed jobs friends and hid in my house for three months. Slowly, my mind became more clear. My anxiety subsided. I no longer hid under my covers, afraid of sitting on my front porch for fear of an emotional drive by. No more crying and wondering who hes with or filling in the gaps of his stories. This was truly the greatest form of love he ever showed me, was to disappear. Then my three months were up! One night out of the blue I missed 8 calls from him. I remember waking up in the middle of the night sick to my stomach looking at my screen. My first instinct was somethings wrong. I quieted that with hes obviously drunk. But of course I had to make sure he was okay so I followed up in the morning. Which leads me to today... Its been three months since that phone call. At first he seemed changed, and though for the past two years I have read and studied and have a very strong sense of where he sits on the narcissist scale, I fell right back into it. Its exactly the same except the girls names on his phone are different and Im now bottom of the totem pole. The neglect, lies, mindfucks are all the same. My mind is spiraling and I am so lost. I always hated my mother for not teaching me to express myself and communicate better, but at this very moment I truly do wish that my silence was my strength. I really wish to never speak to this person ever again, I just dont know how. I dont know how to let go of this self torture. I dont know how Ill survive it. Im too embarrassed to confide in my friends, they dont see me as this person, so itll be hard for them to understand. I have been trying to find a therapist but when it comes to actually emailing or calling I get so scared and just tell myself to do it later. So Im telling you my story.... Thanks "
105,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,My stepmom my is a narcissist and she has painted me to seem like the bad guy,2,9k1qhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/9k1qhs/my_stepmom_my_is_a_narcissist_and_she_has_painted/,2018-09-30 09:56:48,"I need help and support moving on I made a recent post on here about having my dad recently marry a narcissist. My mother was narcissist as well, but this new woman is off the charts. Having to move on from my Nmom and my Nex were some of the hardest things I ever did. Ive been NC with my mom for almost four years and NC with my Nex for five years, despite when I recently ran into my Nex a couple months ago at the store; I didnt speak to him but thats a whole other topic! Also just for context, he married this woman within two weeks of meeting her. LIST OF WHAT MY NSTEPMOM HAS DONE: -Projects her insecurity and low self esteem on to me. I called her out on/ questioned her on her insecurity/ low self esteem and she immediately lost it, started yelling at me and said maybe I did. her lack of integrity onto me (I thought this one a lot, I thought of myself to be very honest, and full of integrity) her eating disorder onto me. We both have one (or at least are working on it, its not severe its just a preoccupation with loosing weight/bingeing). Shell call me out when I binge (sees dishes in the sink), but hides the fact she gained like twenty lbs in a month after she lost a lot of weight before the wedding. How do you gain 20lbs in a month? BINGING! But shell never admit that. Talk about lack of integrity. My dad had to hide food from her but shell tell my dad when I polish off any food. -bends the truth: She tried to make it look like she had a bachelors when she only had an AA -Talks constantly -Interrupts and talks louder to win arguments -Manipulates my dad by walking away -Talks about her self in third person like shes special (got to get used to that when (her name) is around) -Uses personal information against me to make me look stupid or invalidated. I opened up to her about some stuff (my edad suggested this) and she used it all to attack me -The very definition of a bible thumper. One who uses the Bible to attack/defame others' characters instead of as a guide to proper living. These people tend to be depressingly ignorant of anything else except the Bible and behavior as expected by the religious.This definition is admittedly from urban dictionary but I find it pretty accurate. She tried to make me seem like an inadequate Christian compared to her. -Has to be the star of the show -Extremely controlling -Has convinced my dad Im toxic and manipulative -Snooped through my room when I lived there (I have since moved out). She justified in front of my dad by saying she was just walking by and happened to turn the door knob. Then she realized that answer was full of shit and said I just wanted to open some windows to let air through the house. Its my room, she had no right. -Pushed me and kneed me behind a door where no one could see when she was drunk. I pushed back a little and said dont push me. I didnt dare fight back because I wasnt going to give her any more fuel to make me look like the bad guy. My dad and brother tell me it didnt happen. Tbh this part really hurts. My own father is married to this piece of shit. -Told me she cared more about her sons than my brother and I, but my dad cared about all of us (her sons, and her boys) -Controlled the finances right when they got married. She wanted to buy a mustang and make my dads property a wedding venue. My dad and I found it far fetched by let her gab about the idea of it any way. -Shes labeled herself an empath -She wanted me to go to college and come back home after college. I asked her why and she said because your the girl... and something about grandkids. I found it sexist and insulting for her to assume she was entitled to my future children (if that even happens). -EXTREMELY SEXIST AND RACIST. I have a pretty dark sense of humor tbh and crack a few jokes that might make some sensitive people cringe but she takes it wayyyy too far. To the point were she actually believes she is superior to other races! -Is very vague about her past failed relationships and one marriage. She paints the image that her family is perfect. Labels her son (WHO REFUSES TO SPEAK TO HER) a narcissist, his wife is a whore, and her dad is a malignant narcissist. She claims her two sons that speak with her are closer than ever (she barley sees them except the one who in in fact a mamas boy (I pity him)). -When you call her on bs or challenge her point of view she becomes extremely defensive. -She manipulates my dad to think that men lead. Im not here to debate this theory. My point in is that she is a hypocrite when she says this because she leads, not my dad. She just says this to make my dad think he does, he has no control. She nags my dad, and interrupts him. He has no say. -Shes a huge hypocrite. -Tried to convince me I was had no excuse to be sad or have issues because I was never sexually or physically abused. The list goes on... shes honestly worse than my Nmother. I was more blind trauma bonded to my Nmom, which made it hard to let go of her. After the event in which she physically pushed me, I moved out the next morning. My dad begged me to come back but I declined and said it wasnt happening. They all said I couldnt do it and I proved their asses wrong. Im doing just fine on my own financially. My dad later admited it was good I moved out. Im having an extremely difficult time moving on. My family is convinced Im wrong. Ive been used as the scape goat in many situations before. I know Im easily manipulated. My dad believes Im a bad person. He is with this new woman almost 24/7. My dad is happier than Ive ever seen him in my life and I am so happy he is happy. That being said, my dad is convinced Im in the wrong. Not only have I lost my mom (I havent spoken to her in four years) Ive now I lost my dad. Over the past few months I have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to become self aware and examine my own faults. Ive looked at were I could be wrong in specific areas. Ive looked at where others were wrong in specific areas. I even admitted my own faults to my dad. Im driving myself crazy convincing myself I am the bad guy. Ive made mistakes, but does that mean I have to be guilty forever? I have apologized to my father and others about how I was wrong. I made a long list and read it to him. This was all shit before and in high school before he married this woman. Here is the letter I read to him, feel free to scroll through to the bottom. **~**names have been token out to conceal identities (end of letter is marked by a bolded **~**) *Dad I love you, I feel that your choice to be with a woman who controls you and your relationship with your children is toxic I would love to have you in my life, but I didnt marry (my stepmom). Her choices are her own, but I only want loving kind and supportive people in my life. * *Im an adult now, even though I would like your support love and guidance, I will not sacrifice my mental and emotional well being by having (my stepmom) in my life. She has never offered love or made me feel welcome in my own home and even around you. She has alienated me. She had to control me, and everything in the house.* *I want to start off by saying how I wronged you. I am in no way and angel. However, I am in no way the mentally unstable, alcoholic, bad guy your wife has painted me to be.* *Freshman year* *Lying: I lied about where I was, who I was around.* *I will admit getting out has taught me a lot whether you know it or not. I know it was hard but I feel like I had to see what was bad to know what was good. This wasnt about you, I didnt intend to hurt you.* *When I was little you were always the one that had to carry out the discipline. I hated you when I was little for being the disciplinary figure. I actually felt guilty about this later on and expressed this to mom. Mom was always the one saving me. This is how mom manipulated me.* *I tried to protect mom from you dad as a child. I remember you and mom were fighting once and I stepped in and called a name in defense of mom. You got a hold of me, then my mom grabbed my feet and finally you got me and put me in my room. When you were gone mom let me out.* *It wasnt until I got older did I finally see mom for who she truly was. I finally saw that you werent really the bad guy. You said how actually had to stay married to my mom because you didnt want to lose me to mom and never see me again. I cant thank you enough for that.* *In high school I began to rebel. My freshman year of high school was probably one if the most chaotic times of my life. Mom began drinking more frequently than I had ever seen her, I was surrounded by toxic friends, you were dating a woman with a daughter who had a piss poor attitude (we had to accompany you to visit her every weekend) and at the end of the year I was getting ready to put moms intervention together (I was fifteen).* *I was beyond selfish with all this stress. I was treating my good friends like shit, and drinking all the time. I treated you the worst. You got me in trouble one day and grounded me basically all year for smoking a cigarette. I was barley able to hang out with anyone which really pissed off little fifteen year old me. I talked mad shit about you even though you were really only trying to protect me in the only way you thought you could. Mom was the one who came to the rescue, she gave me some freedom. Again, is is how mom manipulated me.* *I ran away from home once that year. I got caught within four hours (I know I was that dumb). You were at the school when they brought me back. I had nothing to say to the school and went back to class. I felt nothing.* *A couple years later you expressed to me how hurt you were. You said how the principal gave you look like you abused me. You started to cry. I barley ever see you cry. I had nothing to say, I just cried silently. I never gained your trust back again. I feel terrible for how I treated you.* *I also stole tequila from you.* *Anorexia manipulation* *Being so sick and making you worry for my health when you shouldnt have. In my irrational mind at the time I was afraid that I wouldnt get what I wanted if I gained weight. I know you may not understand this but I felt like a kid again in a sick way. I was being coddled and babied again. I know it was wrong.* *Bulimia manipulation* *My bulimia was wrong. I put my health at risk and wasted food and money.* *Alcohol stealing justification* *I stole you and grandmas booze. I didnt pay for it. I was not legally 21. I had no right to steal your liquor.* *My pride/ego* *I know I have this issue sometimes. I like to make myself seem bigger and better than I really am. Im trying not to do this so much anymore and just be my authentic self. Ill find myself inflating my self image a lot when I shouldnt. Im making people think Im something Im not.* *I know my pride and ego stop me from having relationships. However Im also a picky person and am very choosy about who I spend my time with. Theres a lot of screwed up people out there I choose not to hang around and there is also a lot of good people I just dont connect with. I like to enjoy who I am around and I dont want to fake it. Im not exactly the most normal person around and Im making an effort to learn to be more social. Work has helped me a lot with this.* *Grandma was right. I am manipulative. I feel guilty about it.* *I know its hard to find people out there. Especially at your age. You chose this woman. I did not.* *Im not asking you to break up with your wife.* *I appreciate your help. In a world like this you really are all I have.* *I want to invite you into my life. However, Im setting boundaries on who I choose to allow into my life. I will not allow people like your wife into my life. Its draining.* *I know you dont trust me. You havent since my freshman year. I dont tell you everything because I know youll worry. I cannot put my life on pause to keep you from worrying.* *I want you to know I will always love you whether you chose to co-sign or not. Your truly are one of the best people Gods given me within this life. Without you I wouldnt be who I am today. Thank you for what you have done.* *I know we are all human and we are just flawed. I know I am not perfect, and neither is anyone else.* *However I am older now and am able to understand more. It took longer for me to navigate than Id like to admit. Yet I think Im beginning to understand more now.* *Youre my dad and I always want to be open with you. You wont always agree with me, but that doesnt mean I dont want to have a relationship with you.* *I suppose all I am wanting from you (because obviously I didnt write this letter for nothing) is to think for yourself and allow us to have a relationship without your wife.* *I also want to spend time with you and (my brother) if he would like. Id also like to spend time with grandma and grandpa if theyd like. I know Ive been busy and my schedule is not exactly the easiest to plan around.* *However I want to make this work. I know you wont always agree with me. However Id still like to have a relationship with you and do fun things again, I mean your my dad, I know I dont live there anymore but your all I have.* *I will admit I feel betrayed. I know I am not really betrayed by you, I know your actions are not meant to hurt me. I cannot help but see this manipulation. I cannot help but see how you are in fact being manipulated. I cannot help but see that you are in fact a contribute to this toxic family dynamic we have had all our lives. It started with my mother, and your doing it again with (stepmom).* *YOU ARE AN ENABLER. YOU ARE CODEPENDENT. I saw it with mom, I saw it with me (yes I did indeed take advantage of you to justify my drinking and my eating disorder, etc) and Im seeing it with (my stepmom). Im no doctor, Im not god, but I cannot help but call bs when I see it. Im not telling you to not be with her, but I dont think this should stop us from having a relationship without (my stepmom).* *Im not an alcoholic. Do I like to drink; yes, did I push my limits when I was at katies; yes, did I push my limits when I blacked out; yes. Is there any justification for this, absolutely not.* *Idk exactly what (my stepmom) had been telling you but I feel like I have to sneak around to tell you my side.* *Its so easy to paint me to look like the bad guy. I drink when Im underage. I enjoy my freedom and lied to get it. Im labeled as toxic because I struggle socially and I choose not to speak to your wife.* *You dont have to give me any money, and you dont have to agree with me. However Im writing this out of truth. Im writing this out of vulnerability (as hard as that is whether you know that or not).* *I just want you to stop bringing up coming over and being around your wife when I have already told you I will not be around her. My view of your wife stands firm and it has not swayed. Ive logically thought this though. Ive tried to make myself seem like that bad guy in this current situation and it just doesnt match up. Im justified and had the right to leave. I may have left the house, but that doesnt mean I dont want a relationship with you.* *Have I been hurt by you in the past. Yes. I have. Ive always wanted to make you proud and Ill never succeed in doing that no matter what you say, Im not perfect. Making you proud all the time is impossible and Im just going to go my own way now. You may not agree with me all the time but I have to go.* *Also for the record when you said drinking and drugging that other day. I dont drug and havent had a drink since I moved out. I dont even smoke weed, it makes me sick it always has and I didnt want to admit it because I didnt want to look like the pussy that I always was when it came to weed.* *This is the life I chose. It comes with consequences, like having to take care of myself and work hard. Mother chose her path and so did you. I chose not to speak to my mom before I had knowledge of toxic family dynamic. I chose not to speak to her because her drinking (her choices) effected our relationship. The bad out weighed the good, she was unreliable.* *However, its you call. Has the bad out weighed the good with me in your eyes? You literally live five minutes away from me and your work is right next to my house. I may not be able to come see you, but we could go out to dinner, we could fish or take a walk.* *I truly dont want to continue hurting you. But whether you acknowledge it or not, your wife has hurt me.* *We could call and chat but I know thats not really your thing and frankly it isnt mine either.* *Im telling you all this because I feel like there is a wedge between us. Having your wife try and make you think how horrible and toxic of a person I am doesnt help either. So I thought Id go ahead and admit my short comings to you. You bring up having a relationship with (my stepmom) and coming over to the house every time I see you. Its all you talk about. I dont mind hearing about her, shes what you enjoy and its what makes you happy. However, dont force me to have a relationship with someone Im not willing to have.* ~ Every time I see my dad he is trying to tell me to burry the hatchet and forgive her. As if she has nothing to apologize for. My dad says, okay, maybe she was a little wrong, but he actually gets angry at me for not burying the hatchet. Ive already hung out with them, he wants me to apologize to her. I HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. I cant even have a conversation with my dad without him talking about her when I ask him how he is doing; shes literally his life! I lost my dad. I lost respect for him. And he lost respect for me. He claims I dont respect him because I dont respect his wife and they are one. I cant fake respect unless its a job I suppose. Im moving on in life without my parents. Its a lonely road, but Ill get there. Where ever that is. **TL;DR;** My stepmom my is a narcissist and she has painted me to seem like the bad guy. My dad and my brother treat me different. I have sense moved out and I have no control over it, I just accept it and try to be self aware and do better. "
106,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"Although I made a mistake breaking NC today, I realized so much positive about myself",1,9lsfmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/9lsfmm/although_i_made_a_mistake_breaking_nc_today_i/,2018-10-06 12:07:08,"I shared earlier that in a moment of anger and anxiety that a Hoover was going to happen when I was weak, I broke 9 days NC to vent anger at my nex. I shared earlier that one positive consequence I am experiencing in breaking away is I am regaining my trust in my perception. I was fearful that an angry vent would wake the sleeping dragon and evoke a Hoover so he could regain control. This perception was correct. That absolutely happened as I knew it would. His response was a mixture of negativity and strange positivity. He cut me down and made sure to try to impress upon me using literally every vulnerability and insecurity he knew of that I hated myself. And I needed to forgive myself. He claimed he loved me so much, he missed me so much, had wanted to go against my request for him to stay completely away so many times...that he had been checking his email every day hoping to find that I had written an email taking responsibility for what happened, praising and encouraging him. This was the Hoover. Him declaring how much and how undying his love was. Ranting about how everything was my fault, my responsibility, that I couldnt face how I drove away the best man I would ever have in my whole life because facing it would crush me. This was my cue as it had been in the past...to fall over myself saying Im sorry, it was my fault, I am crazy/unstable/imbalanced and I am getting help, please forgive me, dont leave me, please love me...and then he would deliberate over the matter and grudgingly take me back. And the cycle would begin again. Not today, I decided. No. I stood my ground. Because I knew the Hoover would happen at some point. And in a way, though I regretted waking the sleeping dragon.... I got to see the sleeping dragon awake. I got to see the sleeping dragon for what he was. My perception guided me in reading that message, speaking to me within. This is exactly what you knew would happen, it spoke. See this? You knew. You know what this means. This man is predictable. And somehow, his words like bullets at me intended to weaken, maim, render me vulnerable did not penetrate me. No. Like...the Hoover didnt work. It didnt work! And then I really surprised myself. I learned today something strongly positive about myself. I am very compassionate and my capacity to love and forgive is very strong and these are qualities that I am proud of, that will make me a treasure to the right person. Oh, I railed off a bit first. I did. But then I came back around. And I spoke what is my truth for only the sake of speaking my truth and being who I am learning that I really am. In a very calm way, I laid out for him the details of his lies, factually. I laid out the truth of how I did not believe him about the Flickr incident. I explained that I identified the pattern of cheating and I laid this out factually. I explained, this is why my perception told me not to trust him. Because he had a track record of being untrustworthy. And then I found a piece of myself that I am glad I to get to know. I just told him, I didnt think he did any of this on purpose necessarily. I told him that I felt that he likely did want to be the person that he presented to the world, that I perceived that he got so very religious from time to time trying to escape from the compulsions. I explained to him, being Cluster B is frightening because it is like your brain hijacks your ability to make choices that are in alignment with who you really want to be. I told him, you can overcome this if you choose to. You just have to be honest, admit this to yourself, and seek help. I told him I would support him and help him if he wanted to change. But this was the only condition under which I would choose to continue with him. He never responded. Now: I would not suggest this for everyone. Most narcs would capitalize on this and milk it for all its worth and make promises that would never come true. I only made this gesture because I know my narc doesnt Hoover in this way; he Hoovers by demeaning and degrading and offering his love if I comply with giving him control. So I did this for myself. Again...I knew he wouldnt go for it. He will never get honest, get real, own up. Could he? I think yes. But just like alcoholics get sober by choice, so do any other sufferers of things. I realized tonight that I do know how to love. I do know how to perceive. And I wouldnt abandon a partner just because he had weaknesses and imperfections. I would help him to see them and I would help him to find his way to something better if he wanted. This is not possible with a narc. But it is good to know some new things about me today. Although this was a mistake...I know a little more about me today. Me is an alright kind of gal. "

Upon my reaching puberty, she could no longer outmatch me physically and resorted to emotional abuse and control through manipulation. We no longer live in the same house, but I'm caring for a sick parent and my sister perceived that it might be a good time to test my vulnerability. She asked that I call today under the guise of mutual concern for our ailing mother, but as the conversation was, by her request, a matter requiring discretion, I knew it was going to be abusive. She only ever wants privacy with me so that she can treat me poorly without repercussion from family, and she apparently thought that I would be tolerant of this behavior. I called her anyway, mentally prepared for a struggle. This was my opportunity to declare my independence from her outright. She proceeded to belittle me and insult me before asking to help me manage my finances, and I told her first that she's a disgusting person, then that she really ought to give thought to the cruel way she treats people, and finally, that I won't trust her with my money ever again because she made me sorely regret it in the past. She was displeased with my resistance, and she pressed me harder, really trying to carve out my self-esteem, so I told her that she's sick and I hung up on her. I hate how bitter and hostile she makes me feel, and I don't like talking to anyone in this manner, but she leaves me with no choice. I really think I'm the only person in her life right now who reciprocates her disrespect, and while I'm not glad to, I will defend myself as long as she chooses to behave as a predator."

I went through a couple years of therapy and that helped me a lot but I still can't shake off some tendencies and it has me wondering if I still am one- or if it is even possible at all to change or grow out of them. I'm still judgemental, I still have a hard time connecting truly to people- I'm quiet in social conversations and hold back my opinions- I tell myself it's because no one wants to hear my opinions- no one has asked for them and it would be unwelcome. In some ways I like to think I outgrew them- I no longer feel the need to try and be special or unique for the sake of it or try to justify my standoffish and 'weirdness' as being special- I can't stand who I was and while I feel like I've made progress I'm scared I'm still mostly narcissistic.

Ive been trying to make sense of my last serious relationship to a woman my therapist describes as a narcissist. Ive done a lot of research on PDs and its clear she would fall into the cerebral/introverted narcissist category if at all. However shes not vulnerable or waiflike in any sense (QUITE the opposite) and most covert/introverted narc descriptions involve vulnerability so I just wanted to describe her antics to see if others can relate. We were friends for over a decade, dated for four years, and were engaged for one year. She is extremely intelligent and always had a hardass edge to her, two qualities that had attracted me from the day we met in undergrad. Fast forward many years and Im just about to move abroad to start grad school when she tells me shes had feelings for me for years. I was in a relationship that for unrelated reasons wasnt going to last through this big life transition, so I was pretty damn vulnerable to my decade long crush telling me she was into me. The first thing I said in response was that Im a big sappy cuddly wussbag and I thought that someone like her would find someone like me too overbearing. She assured me she was a much warmer and more romantic person than she appeared to be (she was literally proud of the nickname Ice Queen so I really shouldnt have fallen for this). Six months later I had ended my existing relationship and we started dating long distance. The lovebombing stage was intense, she was indeed a far more sexual, romantic, and affectionate person than she seemedfor about a year. Most of that time we were living thousands of miles apart so we spent every free moment on Skype and I made my visits home as long as possible, which I now realize made it easy for her to pretend to be something shes not. She decided she wanted to switch disciplines to mine and apply to grad school, and I helped her with her apps, my family let her stay in my old room while she saved, and my parent endorsed her first year of loans because she had no one else (parents died very tragically when we were in undergrad). I used loans I was meant to use for therapy to help her move over as early as possible. I was never once thanked by her for any of this. We were in domestic bliss for the first six months. There were some red flags: she became seethingly angry over small issues like clutter and messes made by roommates, the sex waned pretty quickly, she accused me of giving her a book on ADHDwhich I did to help her understand why Im a space cadetto prevent her from ever criticizing me (wtf??), she seemed to take issue with all my friends and relatives, etc. I also recognized early on that she wasnt really interested in my opinions, passions, likes or dislikes, etc. I had feelings of loneliness when we were together, and there was always a sense of disconnection when we spent quality time together. But she was also doing things that appeared genuine if out of character for a hardass, like making a cute scrapbook of our relationship and such. Theres something especially addicting about a crotchety asshole who lovebombs you. You think you must be extra special to them to receive their rare instances of warmth. After the first year, things started getting more challenging. She gradually killed off our sex life but utterly refused to talk about it. The most she ever said about her total disinterest in sex was that it had come up in prior relationships, but she refused to discuss it or possible solutions. Eventually I just stopped trying to initiate anything outside of a hug because the rejection was making me feel like a creep. I would still compliment her and show my attraction, but even that would get a cold response and certainly no reciprocation. I tried to sit her down a few times and say gently that I had already had partners lose attraction to me, that this is what it feels like, and that Id rather she just break up with me and be honest if thats what was happening. Every time she insisted it wasnt true and played it off like she was just too stressed to be intimate. To be clear Im not just talking about sex, this woman didnt give me more than a peck on the cheek for half our relationship but was consistently gaslighting me about her lack of attraction to me. To say it destroyed my self esteem is an understatement. Fights with her were bizarre and passive aggressive. We were both politically conscious and nearly 100% in agreement about politics. We only differed on a few slight nuances, yet if I didnt fully agree with her take on something, oh fuck. Once I made the mistake of wondering aloud what one social minority thought of a certain protest on behalf of another social minority, just as a means of testing my view and making sure I wasnt missing an important perspective (we were social scientists in training so this is literally the basis of the discipline). This led to a screaming tirade against me as some kind of reactionary and she wound up leaving the apartment for TEN HOURS. When she came home she gave me the silent treatment until I forced a conversation about it. This happened at least two other times, and each time she would interpret my comments in the least generous way possible and then leave for hours and hours. Contrast this ideological Puritanism with what happened when I decided to cut off my hair. Her academic expertise was gender and feminism, so when I went to her and said that I was considering cutting off my long hair to challenge my internalized shame over being gender nonconforming, I expected at least a pat on the back in support. When I told her I thought it was important for me to do but that I was worried about her being even less attracted to me than she was, her response was an ice-cold Well see. This asshole is supposed to be an expert on exactly why such a haircut was important to me, and thats her fucking response. I still cant believe it honestly. I watched her realize she had said the wrong thing, considering her supposed ideals, and she tried to cover her ass but it was very revealing. She never once tried to fix a fight or initiate a solution, it was always me tracking her down and accepting a wildly insufficient resolution with no apology for her behavior. And again, these fights were over disagreements in ideology so small that they really cant even be called disagreements. This behavior especially confused the shit out of me. About halfway through our four years together, I suddenly became very ill with multiple chronic illnesses. I was mostly housebound for a year and was in so much pain and fatigue I couldnt even shower without having to rest for hours afterward. My whole life came to a screeching halt and my medical care was substandard. I struggled to keep up with my degree but there was no way for me to do everything early career academics have to do. I eventually had to withdraw from my doctorate, meaning I lost my student visa and my loans and was entirely dependent on her to live and maintain a visa. I had to start thinking about a different future, especially given that we were living in a country where I didnt qualify for disability. I tried talking about these things with my partner but she would simply shut down. I felt like she had finally gotten herself where she wanted, living in Europe, becoming an academic, etc, and now. I was threat to all that. She began spending all her time at the uni, which wasnt unusual for a PhD student, but she made even less time for us. We got engaged and had a family ceremony in the US, planning to do the legal stuff when we had our wedding in the country we lived in. I became very suspicious when gay marriage just happened to become legal the day after our family ceremony but she refused to go two miles down the road and make it official. But I forged ahead just hoping something would magically improve. Surprise, it did not! For the next nine months she basically moved into the living room while gaslighting me about it. She began to say cutting and hurtful things about my health and body. She would even walk faster than I could keep up with for blocks, then realize I was far behind her and wait impatiently for me to catch up. I was so incapacitated I was using a fucking cane and thats how she treated me. By the end of our fourth year she spent all of her time away from home, then would close herself off in the living room and snap at me if I tried to speak to her. I couldnt rely on her to help with housework and she sabotaged a mutual research project by just not doing the work. We lived separate lives, she stopped watching our shows with me, we didnt cook for or eat with each other, she even started sleeping in the living room. All without acknowledging or talking about what was happening. I was so depressed I was having suicidal thoughts and spent most of my time alone. The final straw came when I told her I had made a reservation at a restaurant she always wanted to visit for our one year wedding anniversary. Her response was so cold and indifferent that I snapped and called her out. It had only been nine months since our wedding and she was acting like she couldnt stand the sight of me, all while denying there was any problem. I felt like. I was going crazy. I asked her if she was trying to get me to break it off by pushing me away, she said no. I asked if she had romantic feelings RA for me anymore and she said no but didnt know why. We had another brief but unhelpful conversation about her lack of interest in me, during which she did her usual routine of pretending she didnt know how she felt or why this was happening. We had plans to discuss it further after the weekend so she could finish a dissertation chapter. When Monday rolled around, she stayed away from home all day and night. I knew then that it was over, she couldnt even come home and have the talk. I was totally devastated. The next morning I had a long awaited specialist appointment where I hoped to get on a new medication, so I had to get myself up and dressed. When I came downstairs to leave, the scumbag was sitting in the living room. All she said was she didnt want to have a marriage like her parents (lol good job there) and she had booked a hotel for a week. I called her a coward and left, thinking my appointment was my last chance to secure medication before I lost my health care. Bawled and panicked all the way through my appointment, left with no meds, and came home to an empty apartment. I never saw her again. I had to call my parents (who I had distanced myself from due to their own toxic behavior)and ask if I could come live with them. Fortunately they agreed and I left a week later, leaving my beloved cat behind and not knowing if Id ever get him back (I did!). As long as I live I dont think Ill ever hurt as bad as I did that week. My now ex partner spent the next year refusing to take care of ties between us: closing our joint bank account, taking me off the lease, handing my cat over to a friend, putting my shit in storage, etc. It took our friends stepping in and forcing her to take care of these things, after which she cut them all off entirely. She refused to communicate with me about the sentimental things she left with my parents when she moved in with me, things that belonged to her dead parents even. Just dropped me like a rock and proceeded as if I never existed. With her new life made possible by me and my family. I recall saying to her once that I felt like she didnt need me in any way (what I meant was I didnt see how I fit into her life, not that I wanted her to be codependent or something) and she responded that she didnt think need should come into a relationship. Which was quite something considering she needed me and my family to get into grad school, and I certainly needed her given my poor health and life falling apart. Basically she just left me feeling repulsive, useless, burdensome, and inadequate in every way despite me having played a huge role in getting her from glorified executive assistant to professional academic. Everyone in my life describes her making them feel the same way. She had no ability to talk to or relate to people who arent also academics and she looks down on quite literally everyone. She doesnt even know how to talk or relate to other people unless theyre also intellectuals, and even then shes pretty awkward. Shes not in the least bit charming or concerned about making good impressions, nor is she visibly grandiose or desirous of attention (though she craves admiration from people she thinks are on her level). My therapist described her helpfully as overidentified with her intellect and thats pretty dead on. She made me feel like an object she kept around while I was useful, then easily discarded when I needed her in turn. I also feel like despite being friends and then dating and getting engaged, I still dont really know her at all. Anyway Im just wondering if this kind of shit sounds familiar to anyone. Thanks for reading this rambling nonsense. Its been almost three years and Im doing much better, getting my life on track and dont spend much time thinking about this coward. But man it was such a trip that I still find myself so confused by what happened. "

In his few moments of vulnerability he admitted to me that he drove himself crazy over wondering what the meaning to life is and was in a constant state of emptiness. He read books on quantum physics and other topics I dont understand, and even started doing psychadelics looking for answers (as explained in my other post. His initial theory was that we all reincarnate into a next life, and the quality or level in his words was determined but how much we learned in our previous life. Its like he needed a reason to do anything in this life so that it would benefit him in his future lives, not just for the sake of now. During a later acid trip he told me that he realized that his theory was only a way to feed his ego and motivate him to be better aka smarter and oh so selfless. Ive been thinking a lot about why narcs are the way they are and thought this was some interesting insight. "
112,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,The girl that left me for her Nex might be the biggest covert narc of them all?,5,96b29o,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/96b29o/the_girl_that_left_me_for_her_nex_might_be_the/,2018-08-11 07:32:37,"I wrote a post the other day about an awesome girl leaving me for what I thought was her narc ex who broke up with her 5 times. After going through situations in this past year, Im beginning to think that perhaps the girl is the very talented covert narc, and he was the victim. She told me at some point that she was a great liar, and had to be, given her life growing up, and has given me examples such as her and her mom co-conspiring to lie to her dad about graduating high school. She has her GED, her dad still thinks she graduated high school. No judgment on the GED, but thats pretty upgraded lying circuitry. At the very least, I now see patterns of behavior from the past that lead me to believe she was lying and manipulating as much as he was, or perhaps herself was the mastermind. Im thinking of sending this to him because 1. if hes the victim, he should know. 2. I want to set the record straight on where I stood if she was the one manipulating the situation. 3. Im genuinely curious at this point, and if he was the victim then I don't want to cut him out of my life. 4. If he is the mastermind, I see this leading to a blow up sooner that may very well save her some time and get her out of a toxic situation, but thats where Id love the opinions of the community. Names are (L)etters for obvious reasons. ==== BEGIN==== DO NOT TELL (S) ABOUT THIS TEXT UNTIL YOU READ THE WHOLE THING. Then decide what you want to do (warning this is long). You know, in the beginning I fully believed all of (S)s stories about you, despite not seeing the evidence of the worst of the accusations myself. She spoke of gaslighting situations, kicking her out of the house when she was crying, throwing her out of the way of your car during random breakups mid-trip, driving her around while tripping, of you rudely confronting her in public, spreading stories about her, threatening to send her dad her cam-site link, of you driving up on my lawn and banging on my windows screaming dumpster cunt, (creative, by the way) and of you speaking very ill of me to her and to others totally unprovoked because you felt threatened by me (at the time when we were still hugging when we saw each other which seemed sincere to me). The most serious of those claims was that she wanted to stay your friend because you threatened suicide on numerous occasions. I confronted her on many occasions during that time (before she was living at my house) that from what youre telling me it seems like (M) still thinks youre together, but she would counter that fervently by saying you would be very clear when you two were hanging out that you werent, in fact, together. Of course silly me didnt think to cover that with you directly, probably because I had written you off as an unstable liar from the above stories. I want you to know if you thought you were still together at the time, I was not aware of it, and that I posed it to her many times because Im not that type of guy. All of the above claims might be true, and if so that suggests you have a problem or two that I hope you can work through for your own sake and your kids but Im beginning to think that she pitted us against each other because of her own deep issues, and designed multiple triangulations where she was the perpetual victim that needed saving you, me, (R), (A) a constant supply of attention alternating between unwavering white-knight to defend her from the devil-in-the-flesh that must be persecuted, but of course not directly by her. Im no shrink, but what she described of you is textbook narcissistic personality disorder. The more I marinate on the past year plus, the more it seems clear that (S) has a bit of that herself and could have been the agent provocateur (unwitting or intentional) of this whole maelstrom of shit. Doubly so if the stories she told me about you are embellished or fabricated. One example: She told me you asked for details at the park about the sex with me. Your texts to me said that she volunteered this information, that it wasnt asked for Im curious whats true here. Because if she shared without you asking; inspiring jealousy that way? THATS classic triangulation. The love-bombing she sent my way over the past few weeks, the Im the luckiest girl in the universe letter she wrote me, also pretty classic signs of pretty unhealthy relationship dynamics idealize, devalue, discard on full display, especially poignant given that she was going back to an ex she accused of abuse. Perhaps youre the mastermind who engineered it all, perhaps its her. Perhaps you both are wrapped around the axle of similar mental hangups. Although it seems out of character for a committed narcissist to respond the way you did when I told you that you hurt (E)s feelings you went outside and apologized for 15 minutes then came inside and thanked me profusely for pointing it out. Its hard to square that behavior if the rest were true. Conversely, for (S) to be so bubbly and otherwise seemingly mature, the way she responded when we tried to work together (even recently when she took pictures at the office), screamed red flags to me that were difficult to articulate and definitely didnt square with the rest of her behavior like a darker side of herself she hides or exposure of some deep vulnerability. Not even sure why Im texting you other than the fact that I dont live my life with hate, and Im genuinely curious how much of what she told me about you was true (and no telling what shes told you about me). Humans are silly creatures, but they can learn and grow. Ive seen it myself, done it myself. Just so the record is straight: I dont hate you, I dont hate her, I wish you the best; no one deserves to live in misery. Theres definitely something amiss there, and I hope you or her or both of you together can work it out. The world deserves to have high functioning, truly loving (M) and (S) not some toxic shadows of what could be. === END=== Im probably not going to send this, but Im curious the downsides/upsides if I do. Perhaps I shouldnt be so curious?"
113,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Narc admitted to bad behavior,16,96msqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/96msqc/narc_admitted_to_bad_behavior/,2018-08-12 14:43:19,I wanted to know if anyone else has had the same experience. There were times when my narcissist would admit to all his bad behavior. Sometimes he would even admit that he knew what he was doing and how he liked it. He would say he knew that if he was horrible to me I would be weak enough to stay. He literally admitted to how he wore me down overtime. Of course when I would bring this up he would deny it but it showed that he was semi self aware at times. Of course he would still put all the blame on me for everything. Also during times of vulnerability he would confess how badly he felt about himself and how he needed me because I was the only one who put up with his shit.
114,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,"Don't Feel Bad For ""Losing"" To A Narc",82,8vraty,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/8vraty/dont_feel_bad_for_losing_to_a_narc/,2018-07-03 21:01:30,"I realized something yesterday. Sometimes, when you ""lose"", you win Think of life like a race. The narc is willing to cheat. Here you are, practicing, eating healthy, getting ready for your 20-lap race. You are in shape, rarin' to go, with the right gear. The narc shows up in his old basketball gear from when he was in high school. He does one lap and goes to the porta-potty. An appropriate period of time later, he gets out, does another lap, and proclaims VICTORY! Meanwhile you are on lap 15. That's how the narc convinces your friends and family that you are crazy. And, perhaps, for a time, the kids and the court. They cheat. Don't feel bad when a cheater 'wins' - and don't feel bad about yourself for playing by the rules. Projection works both ways. Most of the time, when we are talking about projection, it is someone like a narc or borderline, attacking YOU for some internal emotion they feel. They hate themselves, they assume you hate them. They lie or cheat, they accuse you of lying or cheating. But projection can work the other way. It's possible that are an idealist, that you seek honesty and vulnerability. That you genuinely wish the narc well. You can PROJECT that onto the narc, and believe they wish you well, that they are being honest, etc. So they can lie and take advantage of you. Most of the world calls that being ""gullible."" It might mean you ""lose"" something. And it is okay to grieve. And being a little too innocent might be something to grow from, you might never be innocent like that again. But there was something pure and good in your innocence. Believing the best of the narc, trusting the narc, said something good about your character. So maybe they ""won"" by cheating. They were willing to lie and manipulate when you weren't. That only says good things about your character. Sleep well tonight, and get to healing. Unlike the narc, you have everything you need to heal. Keep going. "
115,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,I've been hoovered and I'm looking for some perspective. :(,2,8xhc23,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/8xhc23/ive_been_hoovered_and_im_looking_for_some/,2018-07-10 08:55:49,"I hope this is okay to post here, as this is the sub I've been most comfortable posting about my narc ex and all the stuff that went down in our relationship. I left him a couple of years ago and have been happy and at peace ever since. Our relationship was (of course) volatile and so incredibly painful. I tried to leave him over and over again, but he's a covert narc and like most of them, so persuasive and manipulative - and I think I was kind of drawn to the drama, as well as feeling like I was completely in love with him and always one step away from unlocking the secret to being with him in a happy way, to stop fighting so much, to show him my real self and have us both relax and calm down. That never happened. Of course it didn't. And it just got too overwhelmingly painful to me. In fact he used me up, wrung me out and by the time I left him I was empty. He's tried to hoover several times over the last few years, and for two years straight I was relatively immune. I'd talk to him again but always guardedly, and when he showed signs of his old behavior I'd bail and block again. So I've been feeling really over it and very strong. I had an incredibly hard day at work two weeks ago. I was involved with helping a group of people who had been horribly abused, and it really ate into me, and I left work with a stomach ache and my head in a tangle. And ran directly into Nex. I wasn't prepared for it and especially not in such a vulnerable moment. After the surprise of seeing each other, Nex was in his full covert narc hoover mode - he was serious and like ""I can tell something is wrong, let's let bygones be bygones and talk like old friends."" In my hazy confused mine I was just glad to have someone there to talk to. Anyway not to go into any more detail, but that started us off talking again. I told him I appreciated him listening to me that day, but that I just don't trust him anymore after everything that happened between us. He gave me the ""I've changed, and also your perception of what happened isn't what mine is, so maybe we can both compromise and reconnect"" spiel. I've heard it before. It's manipulation and I know it. But here's the thing. The second we started talking again, it was like all of the ""happy"" and ""peaceful"" I had been feeling the last couple of years suddenly seemed like a joke. Like I was actually unhappy and bored and numb, but didn't know it until Nex came back into my life. In the last few days people have been telling me, ""You look so cheery!"" and I really feel like I'm firing on all cylinders for the first time in ages. But I KNOW that just the day before I ran into Nex, I wasn't feeling dull at all - I really felt peaceful and low-key happy. My current 'high' is just... what? Like a trick, or an illusion. But it feels so real right now. Today, reading his messages and chatting with him like old friends had me smiling all day long. And I KNOW it's not real. I know it's the way he manipulates me, and that the knife between the ribs comes when my defenses are down. But in the moment I'm so lonely that his presence feels like a long lost friend. I guess what I'm looking for is advice. A reminder. Tough love. Some realism. I already know this is a really, really bad idea and that he slipped in through the narc's favorite trap door (temporary emotional vulnerability). But it's almost like I had been a drug addict, got clean, and now had a surprise dose of my drug of choice. Is there anything that can talk someone down from this place? All help is welcome. "

I'm shaky, nervous, &amp; feel a little nauseous. The only thing I've done by that point is wake up &amp; get out of bed. My Narc wasn't home from work yet, &amp; the wait to see what kind of mood he would be in felt like an excruciatingly long amount of time. Although I try to bottle these feelings, &amp; mask myself from the outside as a defense mechanism. I guess I know I am weak and vulnerable at that moment, and I can't let anyone see that, because if they do, they WILL step in and take advantage of it.. He got home, seemed to be a decent mood, until he had to take the dog that HE wanted, the dog I told him I wouldn't have time to properly care for, outside to go potty. I heard a little annoyed yelling, nothing too out of the ordinary, our puppy is huge and a big hyper doof sometimes. But it put me in intense fight or flight mode I feel, I just sat there, listening to it, feeling my anxiety worsen as I became visibly shaky. Just from listening to my partners voice. On a seemingly ""normal"" day so far. He was mildly grumpy, and a little sulky, but I'll take it. He went to bed since he works night shift. With a clear mind I sat and thought; If these relationships usually begin because the vulture sees vulnerable prey, where did he see my ""vulnerability""? Before we got together I was an extrovert. I loved going out, hanging out with friends, I worked out, was muscular and healthy, I was confident and felt comfortable in my own skin. Despite manic depressive issues I've had since I can remember, I was happy. I was independent. When was i vulnerable? Then it hit me. Several times he's thrown the fact that in the beginning of our relationship, I self harmed and was having a lot of issues with having suicidal thoughts. He sat with me in my car for nearly 3 hours telling me every reason I had to live, everything I couldn't get back if I chose to end it, how devastated family/friends would be, the works. He reassured me that people cared. He reassured me that HE cared. That was him laying the foundation. His leg to stand on when I'd finally begin to question if he really cared, or even loved me at all because of how he would eventually treat me. He has thrown it in my face several times since them. Example: he will tell me he loves me during an argument and begin to go on some spiel about ""I love you to death, but..."" I will respond by telling him to stop there, I don't want to hear anymore lies. You've never loved me, you've never cared for me. I've found that calling things out like that is a dangerous game to play, but in a relationship like this I have to play my cards right and test waters before leaping. Anyway, he will hit me with the whole ""well, if I didn't care about you why would I have sat for 3 hours when I didn't even know you to tell you your life mattered and convince you that your life was worth living??"" And there it is, ladies and gentlemen. Just like that. YOU explain to ME why you did that. I can guarantee your answer will not be ""Because I spotted a weak point and played on it. I was grooming you for what I had in store. I was collecting ammunition before shots were ever fired. Or even I convinced you to find your will to live, so you would still be around as a ragdoll? No. "

He was quiet and from what I could tell SO sensitive because he talked about how badly his ex hurt him and how hard it was to get over her. Yet at the same time I missed how he devalued her and said how she only wanted to drink, party and sleep around. He seemed so vulnerable and I just wanted to be there for him.. and he said I was the most beautiful and amazing woman he had ever met. I waned that love story that songs are made of and poems are written about. No one ever told me that you needed to beware if it all happens in a matter of weeks, he moves in with you and talks marriage right away. His vulnerability was what made me think he was sincere and wanted the same things as I did. I now know I was everything he wasnt and yet wanted to be. Hes said a few times now my apartment and car made me look like I really had myself together and that attracted him and he was disappointed to find out my parents helped with my apartment and car. Yet who in their second year of college doesnt have help from their parents? But anyway, he convinced me that he was who I wanted by love bombing me...and it was so intense I had never experienced anything like it before. He broke a lot of my boundaries sexually right away and he likely knew I was his from there on. In addition, I met his family, he moved in almost full time, he left me Flowers on my bed, Yet it was short lived.. he couldnt keep it up.. the degrading came soon... a month? Or two? I really hate those women that have all those shoes, its really stupid how they need a million pairs of shoes so I decided I didnt need so many pairs of shoes. He didnt like most of my friends so I stopped hanging out with them. I dont like horses, I think women who like horses are weird so my saddles went in storage. (All wording a bit different Im sure.. but you get the point) I started changing WHO I was to be with him. The biggest was sexual... he started to get so angry with me that he has to teach me sexually and I didnt and couldnt take charge as I was a LOT more inexperienced sexually and he had lived with someone for over a year etc. I felt terrible about my inexperience and this was the beginning of the sexual abuse I have continued to receive from him for the last 20 years or so. Man he just must have KNOWN what I was looking for because he molded himself in to that person. He wasnt REALLY my type physically (a little skinny and tall) but he somehow made up for all of it. He seemed shy and like a little boy in some ways and I loved that part of him. This made me feel like he was openly sharing his whole self with me... yet now I know it was a disguise. I believed he was that victim of his ex... and that since I wasnt like that, we must be perfect for one another and we were one of those love at first sight stories. We moved in together much faster than I would have normally. It wasnt in my plan yet somehow my plans changed to follow him to another state and move with him.. away from my friends and my family. All the while it was picking at my boundaries, my vulnerabilities...and giving me more and more self doubt. He said he wanted a girl that was hard working and yet I was already getting sick and needing lots of surgeries. Much of our time he kept telling me.. if I only had a job we would be living just fine.. we could get a better car, a better apartment and so on. So I kept trying despite my health going downhill. I kept going to school but he never really supported it. I was stuck in this terrible place where I was told I was loved and accepted for who I was.. yet I was constantly being told to change. It took a really long time for a marriage proposal, and when it came it was terrible and half assed. Nothing that I deserved. The ring was pretty, but it was pretty clear his mom picked it out. The sexual coercion continued for years and my boundaries kept getting broken down. I almost agreed to a threesome a few times and Im glad I didnt. I was ready to leave when the marriage proposal came because I felt as though it was long over due. I waned a marriage and a life.. maybe a family and I felt like he was dragging his feet. He was likely waiting to make sure there wasnt a better option. He used and abused me sexually.. always saying I wasnt good enough and it wasnt frequent enough.. yet still telling me I was the love of his life. I was his soul mate. He must have felt entitled to the sex of which he coerced me in to.. water boarded me for. I have horrible memories of it. He LOVED to get me so drunk that I barely would remember the sex the next day. He always hooked me in by telling me how empty he felt without me and how he needed me to feel whole and right with the world and the BEST and most Effective way for him to feel that was with sex. Because intimacy = sex for him and sex = intimacy and there really arent any other forms of intimacy that pure penile penetration. No matter what I have done in this relationship I have been held at fault. He is so far bubble wrapped his ass in denial that he really has no fault as I progress with the separation/divorce and I have to just be ok with that. I am leaving a marriage where I know I have been verbally abused, sexually abused and coerced, manipulated and so much more... and its a lonely place to be. Only a few people truly believe me about what happens behind closed doors. NARC. You only want me for my money Me: No if that was the case I would have already divorced you and looked for a richer husband. NARC: no, you would have to have sex to find a husband and keep a husband Me:  speechless I have always FELT like something is missing, but its only now that I really understand that the relationship I thought I had.. hasnt been real the whole time. I have watched him be envious of people we dont even need to be envious of, he dislikes anyone who is doing better than us. He feels entitled to fancy vacations and nice hotels, but really we should be paying off debt. Yet he takes these vacations to show off to others that he is a success. When really it would be important to just focus on making our family happy and building a relationship within his kids. Yes hes fun Dad who buys them things and what not, but hes never there to help with homework, come to concerts or be there when they had a horrible day. Thats always been my job from day 1 of their lives. In fact he has often been jealous of the time the kids take up of my life and he doesnt get as much from me because they often wear me out. He keeps saying hes looking foreword for when they grow up. Im sure not ready for my kids to grow up yet. As time has passed... I got sick... and I got my priorities straight by going to marriage counseling alone. I wish he would have joined me, but he said he didnt have the time. So in many ways I have outgrown this. I have found a healthy self that isnt codependent... and realized that this relationship isnt healthy for me or the kids any longer and I NEED to get out of it. Its going to be hard because he has everyone convinced that he is the victim and I am the villain, but I have no other ways to do this. I know that he is ever going to change..therefore... I will never be happy in this marriage and I need to walk away from it. My children also need to see me walk away. I know he will only think of himself and he will make this separation/divorce as hard as possible and wont care what the kids need. Yet I will be doing my best to speak for the kids if I can. Im angry that his denial and flat out lack of empathy has got us here. Hes already threatened to loseor quit his job, so I feel like Im on a time crunch. You see Im disabled and have been a stay at home Mom for 12 years and no matter what the court decides, HE will not feel its fair.. even though I am taking care of HIS children. You can bet that when my children are dating age, they will learn the red flags that I missed. I cant change the past, but I can change the future.. even if he continues to play victim.. so be it.. though I admit its hard sometimes. To realize what a mess this is and that I havent Really been loved for who I am completely and without conditions... and neither have the children. I just want to move on, and he says right now that he will let me... but I suspect hes going to change his mind, get angry and try to sue the pants off me. I just hope that no matter what, the truth will prevail. Thanks for letting me vent again.. "

But it wasn't as simple as that. You mirrored me. You played back the warmth you saw in my heart. Coaxed everything beautiful and light out of me as if it were your own...although you could not understand a bit of it. I loved you, but you weren't real. The reality you masqueraded was everything I possessed. I'm still trying to find my way out of this darkness you led me into. As I am finally beginning to see the light of the other side, another realization comes to me. I fell in love with the warmth, the passion, the sacrifice, the vulnerability, the trust, the investments and commitments. Nothing is truer about my past with you than the fact that all of that, every single good thing I thought I'd lost, were all parts of myself. Even though it may feel like all of it is gone, like I'm mourning some kind of strange death, I can console myself with the knowledge that all of these beautiful things were born out of my own heart. Knowing this, I have hope that I can find them there again. "

The relationship with my Nex really did a number on me. We dated for 5 years, got married (by name only, it was a farce marriage to him) stayed married for another 5 years, separated (not legally), I almost died in a car accident and 2 weeks later he served me with divorce papers. I was lucky enough to have the presence of mind to not let him get away with a summary divorce in which I wouldve been left without health insurance when I *really* needed it, and I lawyered up. Legal separation was filed and the divorce was finalized a year later, giving me enough time to heal from all surgeries needed. Ive been in therapy for years. I feel like Ive talked and cried and screamed about everything that happened: how I felt used up and discarded when he no longer needed me, how stupid I was to not recognize his emotional abuse because it happened so slowly, how the life he now has would not have been possible without me (yall, I agreed to marry him so he could get a green card and stay in the country because I looooved him). I questioned whether he ever loved me, if he played the long game and dated me for 5 years just to get citizenship. (I mean, he couldve just paid someone to go through with it, or chosen another girl.) Ive questioned everything I ever thought I knew about him. [Side note: his sister did the exact same thing; married her boyfriend so she could get citizenship, and theyre still together after 10+ years!] I even questioned the god I believed in because he was the narc who used me but I had to suffer through the accident and subsequent surgeries. It got to be so much that I wished I had died that night, and I even tried to kill myself by oding on my prescription meds. Fast forward a few years and Ive moved on as best I can. I dated a bit, found my amazing fianc and Im very much looking forward to burning my past chapter with Nex and starting an awesome new one. But its not always easy. Sometimes I feel completely over him, other times I get sad or angry because a memory is triggered. I was doing pretty well for awhile and plans were in the works for moving in with my fianc (!), when Nex texts me. Its like he sensed I was about to make a major life change. It was the week of thanksgiving and he said hed be in town that weekend for work and wanted to see if he could pick up any of his mail. All of my wuts? First off, he sounded so casual like weve kept in touch and we were old friends and I didnt hate his guts with the burn of a thousand suns. Second, I hadnt seen his face since the divorce and I DEFINITELY never wanted to again. (At the time his junk mail was still delivered to my home but it was from things he signed up for when we were still together.) I shut that down and then he did something he never had since the divorce. He opened up to me. He said that whenever he comes back it feels like hes coming home. And that he regrets moving out of state, and now just realized he is a whore to his company because whenever they call, he comes. Guys, I actually felt sorry for him. He NEVER showed vulnerability like this before. I didnt know how to react. If I was smarter/stronger I wouldnt have replied but I did. I told him off, said everything I ever wanted to tell him but hadnt because I knew it wouldnt get me anywhere. And he responded the way I thought he would. With silence. The whole incident messed with my head. I had realized a long time ago that Id never get any type of closure from him, so every time I felt the need to pen him a long letter or email detailing exactly what I thought of him Id talk myself out of it. The worst part was that I actually felt bad for saying those things to him. I even cried, though I wasnt sure if it was from the relief I felt for finally getting those thoughts out or what. My question is, how could I recognize that hes a narc and pathological liar, yet still feel sorry for him? Ive been NC since this happened, but I want to get rid of the presence I sometimes feel from him in my life once and for all. Thanks for reading"

It's also kind of sobering. There are only narcissist and borderline adaptations. This psychotherapist fully believes that these adaptations are treatable. The more I do Somatic Experiencing therapy the more I see, too, that this *thing* in me is going away (and I've only been doing it for 6 weeks). The three guys I've paired with have *all* had lots of trauma. I have lots of trauma as well. They've all been the ""nurturing"" ""self-reliant"" types. *Both* of us rush intimacy. They rush this process of intimacy through excessive fawning and future planning...and I rush through piercing the vulnerability core, focusing on deep intimacy. They idealize me, I idealize the connection. I'm a man...and I've always related to this deep intimacy search that women stereotypically are known for. Why am I posting here? Because if we view Borderline as an adaptation and not a ""personality disorder"" you will find so many overlaps of the co-dependant idea with borderline...and there is often this dichotomy idea out there of narcissists pairing with codependents and vice versa. So i guess I'm posting for those who have borderline adaptations and pair with narcissist adaptation people quite easily (to destruction). URL"

We broke up, I went NC for around 2 years, I got over him. I dated other people, I felt what a normal healthy relationship was like, it eased my pain and fears. None of those relationships worked out for good reasons. Eventually my N comes back into my life asking for forgiveness etc. And bc of some health related issues. We reconnect and have been together again on and off for the past year. For the year, it was fine I was able to just enjoy the sex, compartmentalize, and he had really made some changes in his life- his career was going well, now a millionaire, no more lashing out, still severely lacking emotional depth but better than before. It made me question if he had NPD, maybe he did change. But today after spending time with him I realize that he still is somewhere on the spectrum because we've been getting closer and as he found me learning more about his life, he suddenly wanted me out and said some berating comments. What hurt me the most was he said that he wants a serious relationship in the near future, but he doesn't see it with me even though I'm the only girl he's ""loved"" or been with. Even though he's an extremely successful, intelligent, and good looking guy, I think deep down he knows that he can't emotionally satisfy me and therefore is bound to being rejected by me. His success makes me feel like he does everything right in life and being that I just quit my job, this rejection makes me feel worthless. I know he had trouble keeping up with my vulnerability, personality, depth, and sense of humor etc. And I had better connections with other guys, but I don't know why I can't help but love him. I guess I have gotten over this before and I will again, part of me still hopes that he will change and we will fall in love again as new people. So dumb, I know. TLDR: It's been years since I've been through a severe N break up, remind me why they do this and why it's going to be okay, sigh. "

(That's the background, on to the present): I am pretty sure ""in theory"" with idealizing/devaluing it's not about me/not a reflection of reality and more about the N (right?). Can anyone talk me out of caring about this (particularly re: someone who isn't even in my life anymore/we're NC, yet I somehow still care what he thinks)? I keep worrying that if he devalues me forever it's because I 'failed' somehow at being good enough/attractive enough/trying hard enough in that relationship, etc. and fell short of being worthy of him not devaluing me. But that's actually not what it's about, right? If he devalues me forever is it just because that is what is needed for his own ego (I was the one that left him, and in sort of dramatic fashion)? Is it like the things he despises about himself projected onto someone else or just generally self shame/hatred projected onto me? Can someone help me see this as being ""about"" something else and not actually a reflection of me and my 'failure' in that relationship, somehow? I deeply fear it being 'deserved' or some sort of 'true reflection.' I think, though, that with non-Ns, people tend to remember exes slightly more three-dimensionally and not as ""all good"" or ""all bad"", etc. and can even retain some nostalgia for the good times/generally wish the person well once everyone is healed from the breakup, etc. I try to tell myself these things to remind myself that a non-N ex in this situation (even if I hadn't been perfect in the relationship) probably wouldn't just go on hating me/devaluing me forever...it's not something I 'deserve'/it's more about the N than it's about me...is that true? Help me figure out how to think about this....thanks! "

Who knows I am cherished and adored. Im not always nice to him, he kind of takes all my moods and has to work around them. I got with someone else, twice, although he doesnt know that. I dont want to her him, I dont want to be that person. I tell him to tell me when there are things that bother him, when I hurt him or he disagrees with me, but clearly the power imbalance is too great because we talk about it and then I make an effort and things are a bit better for a bit and then they slip right back. I dont like this version of myself. I tried to end it once but the extent of which he was upset and my own cowardice at both hurting him and being alone won over. Is this just fleas? I want to be more honest with him and talk about this issue but I feel like I cant show him this much vulnerability. Thats exactly what being a Narc must feel like, right?

126,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,I hate how popular psychology is trying to portray narcissism.,5,7u57pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/7u57pg/i_hate_how_popular_psychology_is_trying_to/,2018-01-31 10:08:57,"Well you know the story. Child has borned into a family with uncompossinate mother and cruel dad. So thats how she or he developed narcissism. Poor little kid. Or not? I dont agree with that statement and with most of pop psychology in general. Unless you agree with the idea of we humans don't have free will. Not everybody is born into good families become a good empathic person. Nor everybody is born into awful families become narcissists or sociopaths. Btw  am not talking about people here who just wants keep going in their way. Pop psychology portrays narcs as selfish people, thats partly true and mostly useless. That doesnt give any idea about how horrible is to be in a relationship with narcissistic person. For example we may consider most of great scientists and philosophers in the history as selfish. It is ok for a person to be selfish and emotionally unavailable, thats his or her life and we dont have a right to judge people about it. But it is not ok to abuse someone by pretending you love them, you care them even though YOU NEVER DID. thats another point  am angry about pop psychology, narcissist are not selfish people, not everybody has to be alturistic this choice depends from person to person. Narcissist people are fake, the false identity he pretended to have is never ever going to be real in their life. Thats the real issue, nothing they do has real point. A Narcissist's all trouble, is to look good, and have power in the eyes of other. Thats all he wants. He wants to be admired, she wants to be somebody who is unrealistically perfect. And he is in love with that fantasy. No matter how beautiful, handsome, intelligent, or hardworking you are narc was never ever going to love you. You are someone too beautiful ? Well it is good because narcissist will look good in the eye of his friends and family and other people. Because ""being with someone beautiful makes him look good"" thats all about. His concern isnt loving and having a connection with her, his concern isnt admiring her beauty. His concern is all about using a spesific quality of other person to feed of this imaginary false self. I would call it permenant existensial angst honestly. We all exprience existensial angst or how to call it, existensial depression and feeling lost in the world. But our ways differ from narcissist to deal with it. A narcissist will look for shortcut solutions to fill this void and fantasy image he has in his head. For narcissist we are toys but he knows we are not actually toys. Thats why he will act like shapeshifter. He is cynical. Would you let somebody to use yourself if he would come and say ""well I like to be admired and you will be my slave and do all things I want without any request"" nope? Sure, narcissist knows this. Thats why he/she lovebombs you. Otherwise he cant get under of your skin. Dont forget, narc loved your love for her/him. But narc never really loved you. Not because you are deficent, but because he perceives close relationships, and vulnerability as a form of weakness. Because he is too concerned about how perfect is his false image. Loving someone is one of the Most ultimate form of accepting vulnerability of human nature. Because it includes the risk of break up, death, seperation, grief and possible rejection... And all these shake his false perfect image. Thats why he is not capable of loving. At best, he will love you like how a child loves his new favorite toy, he will enjoy with it for a period of time and then get bored and throw it away. Narcissism is more than selfishness and what DSM-5 tell us. It is not just a grandiose self. It is trying to create a perect false identity, avoiding nature of human vulnerability and using others to own advantage. Don't forget, having some of narcissist tendencies are normal also a part of human nature we may all have a few of them. Thats Fine. few But, all the time, emotionally abusing another person upto the murder of his/her soul, driving someone important to you(!) crazy, causing them to suicide, depression, anxiety ptsd is not something normal. I see people say if you had healthy boundaries narc couldnt be in your life and make you feel guilty about it. Sure if you could ask yourself ""what the hell, why did she change suddenly, act cold and hot"" in the first devalue phase, and somehow pull out of yourself the trap you could have reduced the emotional scar you took. But still, You just COULDNT know what was under the mask. developing boundaries are needed for sure, but developing emotional intelligence and prefrontal cortex activity are essential as well (I think) t is simply being in touch with your feelings, how to utilize them, ability to control stress and etc. It just doesnt happen through the night, but I found out mindfulness meditation, aerobic exercise, healthy diet and reading books are essential. I hope I explained well why having a close relationship with a narcissist is more dangerous than media portrays. Also a Narcissist's problem is more than having bad parents, as I said before, thats the bullshit side of popular psychology. Parents have huge effect on our lives upto a point. But a Narcissist's existensial problems and the way he handles with them cant be reduced to ""poor narc, he had cruel father"" he is willingly choosing this. You cant save him. Best wishes for you. "

I think if I tell people I was in an abusive relationship in recent years it doesn't fully convey how deeply and badly it screwed up my developing brain. And that trauma signature during the developmental period relates to him. I just feel like I had an otherworldly experience (in a bad way) in which I completely lost touch with reality. I do not understand what happened to me--I became a shell of my former self. It was so otherworldly and strangethe devastation to my life was so extreme, the degree to which I lost myself and lost touch with reality was so extremeI think it is just nearly impossible for most people to graspso I probably just seem like a crazy person or a weak person or who knows whatwondering if anyone else can relate?"

I started to think about how this relationship with nex was probably due to our childhood traumas fitting together (this is a very good thing, btw, because it's been getting me to start processing THAT more, which I think will help me in life/future relationships)...I started to think about how that made sense/what my family dynamics were...what his family dynamics were/how he came to be this way and thus why none of it really had anything to do with ME/e.g., he just got this contemptuous proclivity, etc. from his dad/family, etc. etc. I thought about how we are all born deserving of love from our parents and if they don't treat us that way, it reflects on THEM, not on how lovable we are/what our worthiness of love is conditional ""on"" (it shouldn't be conditional to begin with...). I was thinking about the screwed up messaging I got about my lovability and how that matches up with that relationship dynamic. And I realized that part of healing and getting into a healthy relationship is realizing I was given the wrong message about love from my family and just because it was directed at me doesn't make it TRUE. I was born inherently worthy of unconditional love and if my parents didn't give it to me, that has nothing to do with me/says nothing about me so I should not take that message with me/internalize it in the sense of my self-worth going forward. OK--liberation! My self worth, therefore, has nothing to do with Nex either. I can stop worrying about what he now thinks of me post-breakup. It doesn't matter. It never mattered. It never had anything to do with me. It was all about his own processing of childhood trauma. This all being true, he ALSO was born worthy of unconditional love and got the wrong messages about love from his parents. So here's where maybe my mind derails...so then I started to feel empathy for him and I started to think about how his bad behavior stems from mistreatment and extreme vulnerability deep down. I felt really bad about various things I said and did to him during the relationship. For instance, I think I acted judgmental about him not speaking to his family for several years--thinking he was just this bad guy being mean to his parents (this was before I realized they had mistreated him, btw). I guess in learning more about N parents and all I now know that I was so wrong to be judgy about that toward him and I feel guilty. I feel bad realizing that things ended with me telling him how terrible of a person he is and probably in a sense trying to make him feel worthless compared to me and saying I never want to speak to him again. I realized I was probably abusive in some ways in that relationship, too. Then I started thinking maybe one day I should send him a very brief email telling him I don't blame him anymore/see him as such a terrible person (goes along with my thought above about how all people valuable--no one is better or worse than anyone else and wanting to convey this kind of more enlightened message). I asked my roommate if I should ever do this and she seemed to think maybe it would be a good idea/(I kind of intuited maybe she thought I was terrible for making him feel like such a bad guy/worthless as the last interaction). I started to feel like a terrible, abusive person for treating him this way and ashamed of myself and embarrassed and wanting to correct that and also wanted for him to know I am more enlightened now. I also started to think I could tell him in this email some things I appreciate about him/that relationship in hindsight, etc. I mean I was just kind of thinking about how in this big picture sense we were two people hashing out our inner demons/childhood traumas together and there is something a little bit beautiful in that (we dated during a kind of important developmental stage)/we are just inherently important people in each other's life journeys, even though we ended up being really hurtful and destructive to each other. Since I had started to feel kind of 'enlightened' in the sense of thinking of him, myself, and all humans as equally valuable people, I thought maybe one day (maybe when we're old-ish or something) we might both be fully 'enlightened' like this (I can come to this realization but it's another thing to totally internalize it) and then maybe we could ever be friends and just appreciate each other as important figures on our life journeys and kind of always ""love"" each other in a nostalgic 'important figure in one's past' sense. I thought that could even be incorporated in the email, too, somehow. I know it takes a lot to ""heal"" from childhood abuse/trauma stuff but he actually seemed more 'enlightened' than me in some ways when we met (at least in terms of understanding what this ultimate goal should look like--similar to what I said above about all humans inherently having worth/value and thus we don't need to search for it in our parent's treatment of us or in anyone else...it's just there). I know he's also been trying on this path to healing from this childhood stuff. So then I started to feel kind of anxious/upset like...what if he IS able to heal and become enlightened and become this kind hearted functional person anytime soon? And then what if someone else gets to be with that version of him? If he were able to be this healthy, kind, functional type person I *would* want to be with him as life partners, I think--he's really important to me. I just can't be with the version of him that existed when we were together. That was really dysfunctional, contempt-laden, destructive, and toxic. But I would just feel so jealous and like I had missed out/been wrong to say ""I never want to speak to you again"" if he got fully healed and someone else got that version of him....(I think this may actually be a common worry among people who break up with Ns...) And I realize that I've kind of started being derailed somewhere up there...I don't know if anyone else feels this way but I just find it really hard to distance myself enough to see things objectively at this point. I know he is not evil at his core and is also a product of his circumstances, like me. I know that it is a defense mechanism for me to need to see him as horrible and evil and the bad guy and the worse one of the two of us. But I also know that's probably not true and I feel bad about myself/ashamed when I think of how I acted toward him when I DID think of him like that (horrible/evil person). The danger in trying to let go of that for the sake of healing ('truth?')/letting go/goodness on my part, etc. is that when I take that wall down, the pendulum starts to swing back towards idealizing him again (per where that derailed part went). And then I start to feel bad about myself/my behavior/feel like I was the bad guy/worse one and I start to feel nostalgic toward him and miss him and jealous of anyone who might get a better version of him than I did... Sorry that was long but wanted to show the thought process...can anyone else relate to this? "

A little about her: 1) Had an abortion and told someone else that they caused her to have a miscarriage 2) had an important High profile career, which ended after she got arrested for a confrontation with a police office where she screamed at him and threw things at him saying you dont know who youre dealing with 3) get extremely angry a lot and screams over small things (ie, one of her kids making a mistake. Her kids cower when this happens) Shell be ina great mood and this shift is very abrurpt over small things. Has never screamed at me though 4) lies constantly about small things to make herself sound better, like telling people shes been going to the gym a lot when shes told me differently 5) name drops and brags 6) is obsessed with dating people that are semi famous or in positions of power. Dated one semi famous guy very briefly who ended up rejecting her because he thoughts she was nuts . Is now trying to date his cousin 7) talks a lot about herself. Will occasionally ask about other people because she knows its expected, but doesnt listen half the time 8) is exceptionally beautiful and is constantly seeking out attention. Meets a bunch of guys on dating sites and the majority of them she just will Snapchat or FaceTime, often saying very explicit stuff, sending sexy pics. Will do this in front of me, because we are friends 9) has slept with around 30 people in the last year, a lot of whom she wasnt into but wanted their attention and validation 10) Also, would invite me to hang out with her and her  friends and shes be at wherever on a date with some random guy she met from Tinder or a bar the night before. I confronted her about this and she did stop because i felt so uncomfortable 11) has a history of very volatile short lived relationships. Almost always ends with her going off on the other person and her deleting and blocking them. The guy shes obsessed with is the only guy i know that rejected her which is why i think shes still so infatuated So why do i love her? She can be so, so sweet and complinentary. She brags about me to people (Im fairly accomplished and have some good things going for me). Also she is more open with me then she is with most people and does tell me her insecurities sometimes, and i do find this vulnerability endearing and attractive. I have a bit of a thing for sad people i guess, Im also kind of sad. I do see a lot of what she does comes from a place of extreme insecurity. We do have a good time when she just relaxes and acts like who she really is instead of putting on this annoying facade. Lately though shes been saying some mean things to me. She got really upset because we were hanging out but just kept FaceTiming, calling and snapping guys so i left suddenly and shes still mad about it Im assuming. I dont know what i should do. The majority of people i know who know her tell her to cut her out that she is manipulative and not good. I dont know if a conversation would be worthwhile or not because i do feel like people should be given the opportunity to know what theyre doing wrong and correct their actions "
130,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Feel like Im losing my mind,3,7hkcqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/7hkcqa/feel_like_im_losing_my_mind/,2017-12-05 08:00:44,"Ive posted here before, I just delete my posts in fear of him somehow seeing them. Please be gentle. I have a dissociative disorder and sometimes feel like a scared child. I know Im an adult and have been committed to therapy and bettering myself as much as possible. My dream is to one day help others, if I can make it out of this storm. Im so confused and sad I cannot function. Could all the pain Ive felt from his words and criticisms really just be my PTSD from childhood (or as he says its your BPD). Or could he actually be abusive. I understand it could be a bit of both, but my heart and gut seem to want to believe hes been horribly abusive. Its the only way any of this makes sense. My therapist said hes gaslighting me but Im terrified I left out some crucial detail, and that all of his criticisms of me are warranted. Also - how could someone be so cruel and cold as he is. Its tearing me apart. I got sick and he was mean. Not a cold, like a chronic illness. Recently Ive started showing signs of another chronic illness, and was emotional about it. That night I asked him to be gentle with me and not so upset with me all the time going forward and understanding and patient. He said he would help out more with tidying up, and would be careful with the conflicts. Then 2 days later hes acting all cold and distant. I could sense his rage and contempt at me under the surface. (He tells me I misread simple tiredness for anger and stuff because im transferring my abusive parents onto him... I told him about transference and now he uses that as his main argument why Im wrong). I ask him about it, then he tells me Im starting conflicts. He said, You dont realize it, but you know how to target someones deepest vulnerabilities and use it against them. Youre like my sister. (He hates his sister and shes not a nice person so this tore me apart). My gut tells me hes projecting, *but what if Im wrong?*!I cant bear it. I cant bear the cold. He can see me cry for hours and not comfort me. He can know that my body is falling apart but still pass righteous judgment on me for not cleaning enough. Its enough that hes working and Im not. Hes sacrificed so much for me. I should not expect him to help out more with the cleaning or at the very least be gentle with me when he is upset. I feel a huge part of why Ive struggled to clean and function is because Im always exhausted and trying to recover from his venomous attacks on my character. Yes my physical illness and anxiety make it hard, but hes put me down so many times for it hes convinced me of my worthlessness and incapability. I tried telling him when hes mean I cry the next day and cant function, and he angrily said, You need to work through that anyway! But if I ask him tobee gentle he says Im angry you cant just expect me to control my emotions. Youre not in therapy right now I cant take it. I want to disappear. How could anyone view me so negatively and have such anger towards me unless I truly am that bad. :( He says I provoke him. Sometimes when hes mad I do have flashbacks of child abuse and regress to my inner child. I cry and beg him to just hug me. He stays on his side closed off, refusing to acknowledge me. Its too much pain for me to bear and in those moments I cant snap out of it. All I want is his approval and love. After, he says I cant believe you harassed me like that. You can never tower over me like that again. But if he had just hugged me or acknowledged my existence it would calm the situation. Im in therapy, took DBT (and took it seriously), try to meditate, all of that. Sometimes I just need support though especially when he triggers my shit like that. If he was crying and wanted support, Id drop everything and run to be there for him. Especially when I remember times he was nice to me and seemed to like me, it makes me feel like I must be so horrible for him to be so upset at me all the time. And its true I dont clean enough. Even texting post is driving me insane. There are s many feelings and memories and nuances I could never explain here. I am absolutely crushed that Someone could be so cruel and cold. Ive lost everything. Im a puddle of misery. Im physically and emotionally weak. I have no idea how Ill survive. Yes Im in therapy and yes I know youll all say its ideal to just walk away. But I am currently in no state to do that for many reasons. I am trying to survive and take care of myself. But Im scared to do anything thats not cleaning. I feel guilty all the time but also angry at him. It feels my mind is split. Half of me feels he has been absolutely vile and used me and my vulnerability... the other part of me feels he is right and Im horrible and dont do enough. But for years there has always been some reason he is justified for spewing angry hateful words at me. But if I tell him I feel this way, he says its not true. And I believe him. :( But why would I experience massive suffering during so many of our conflicts and so much pain from this relationship, if he hasnt been horribly abusive. He does exhibit narcissistic traits - nearly all of them in my opinion. But when hes been nice it seemed so real. But when he denies being abusive and explains how its my fault or my misinterpretation, it seems so real. Hes extremely smart and becoming more and more successful in his career. Meanwhile I have nothing. How can someone hurt someone so much and not care when theyre suffering and sick. How? And what if Im wrong? These questions torture me. I have so much more context I wish I could give and wish I could write better but I cant even eat. Its been a week of me barely eating, and lots of random physical problems. He seems to think when I ask for support Im manipulating him. This accusation is excruciatingly painful. But what if hes right and Im blind somehow. Ive been practicing mindfulness and doing therapy for a couple years now and my therapist doesnt think Im that unaware. Sorry this post is a mess. Im going through a crazy difficult time trying to get a grasp on reality and accept it. I cant accept reality if I cant discern what is going on. And just when I think Im figuring it out, something happens to make me doubt myself. I ask for support OR some random thing happens and he gets mad, I crumble, then he points at my crumbling and says Im the problem. Edit: I try so hard to be careful with him. Sometimes I set goals, like okay, this week Im just gonna make sure I dont do anything that could cause him to be mad. But things fall apart anyway. Its been that way for years. Sometimes he just gets mad bc of having to buy me a juice I use for my supplements he thinks costs too much but its for my illness. Him acting like I use my illnesses as some tactic is destroying me. If he read this post hed have a million problems with it and say Im taking things out of context. But I dont intend to mislead anyone; its impossible to tell the whole story in one Reddit post. It feels like hes like the bad guy in frozen. :("
131,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Found this perspective on empathy very interesting and something that offered me closure.,9,7is7sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/7is7sr/found_this_perspective_on_empathy_very/,2017-12-10 16:52:50,"This is not my article but I am pasting it here. I am not sure if this is allowed on this subreddit. I do think this is really useful for anyone trying to understand empathy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ive written about empathy before  the consequences of having no empathy and why empathy is the ultimate game changer. Empathy is the ultimate game changer because the level of happiness, understanding, fulfillment, security, appreciation and CONNECTION that you feel in your relationships will always be directly linked to the level of empathy that both you and the other person have. Same goes for the relationship that you have with yourself. The level of self esteem, gratitude, love, connectedness, relationship luck and confidence that you feel is 100% of the time, linked to the level of empathy that you have for yourself. If you have no empathy for yourself, youll keep chasing after the love, acceptance and validation of those that cannot empathize with you either (but that you somehow, despite their disconnectivity, continue to have an abundance of empathy for). Friendsh*ts and relationsh*ts are always built upon a foundation of empathetic bankruptcy. Where there is no empathy, there is no connection, depth or understanding. Okay so CLEARLY, empathy is an integral in having a healthy relationship, but what do you do when youre in a relationship with someone that has no empathy? How do you deal? Is it even POSSIBLE to date (or have any kind of relationship with) someone that has no empathy? Wikipedia defines empathy as the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within the other beings frame of reference, i.e., the capacity to place oneself in anothers position. In the past, I would always overly empathize (read: people-pleasing-doormat myself) with others, but continued to find myself in relationsh*ts where the other person had zero empathy for me. **WHY?** As I always say, we will only tolerate relationships with people that treat us no worse than we treat ourselves and you cant give a dollar that you dont have. I didnt have any true empathy to give others because I had no empathy for myself. The empathy that I felt for others was nothing more than me feeling for them, making it all about me needing to be good enough &amp; save the day, and then tying my worth to impossibility of ever being able to do so. Empathy is when you feel with someone, _not_ for someone. I used to find myself in relationsh*ts and friendsh*ts where I felt more alone, judged and misunderstood than if I were to be physically alone in a jail cell. This is because there was no empathy. If youre involved in a relationship where you feel as though theres no empathy and you notice yourself tying your worth to the fact that the person who you always emotionally cater to has no empathy for you, heres what you need to know: Just like you cant be a millionaire and claim poverty when it suits you, you cannot be selectively empathetic. You cant. I used to get down on myself because I would struggle so hard to extract one DROP of empathy from someone and that would literally JUMP at a mere text message and cancel all of their plans to go help out to the cousin of the sister of the uncle of the brother of their friend/acquaintance/coworker, whatever.. that needed them. They would volunteer, play Bingo with their grandmother, rescue animals, be a shoulder to cry on, etc., for others but have no empathy for me  the one person that got a PhD in seeing everything from their point of view. This is what Ive learned about that scenario: The reason that some people seem to withhold/have no empathy for you and so readily give it out to others isnt because youre not good enough. They do this because as long as they can prove to you that they have the capacity to empathize with others, they can keep you in a state of fear-based hopefulness that one day, if youre good enough, they will do the same for you. This is what makes you oversee red flags and stay in relationsh*ts way past their expiration date. Your constantly trying to be better for them. What I learned and what you need to know: 1. These people arent truly empathizing because selective empathy is impossible. They have no empathy for themselves and therefore give out selective validation wrapped in a cloak of pseudo empathy. This disintegrates the self worth of other person so that the un-empathetic can weaken them enough to ultimately push their agenda further along and get what they want. 2. Empathy is the most vulnerable decision you can make. If someone cant be vulnerable, they have no empathy to give. In order to connect and empathize with you, they will have to be vulnerable enough to connect with something within themselves that can feel, remember and recognize what youre going through. 3. Just like empathy cannot be selective, it also cant be conditional. There cant be conditions on empathy and if anyone tries to do so with you, its not empathy its lets see how far I can push my agenda and how desperate you are for my validation/approval. 4. Judgement and empathy cannot coexist. To judge is to pedestal yourself while failing to see the very connectedness that empathy is defined by. The connectedness that we all share as spiritual beings having a human experience. Okay, so the person that youre in a relationship with has no empathy. How do you deal? Can it ever work? Understand and accept that without the other person being able to put themselves in your shoes, feel with you and see themselves within you and your experience, a deep, genuine and mutual connection in which you feel safe, secure and understood cannot ever exist. Yes, this can be very painful to acknowledge and accept but I promise you, the pain you that feel in that acceptance will be short-lived and will ultimately translate into a lifetime of (finally!!) feeling valid, understood, respected and cared for  from yourself first and foremost. Accepting people for who they are is scary as f*ck. Its scary because the moment that you stop fighting it, tying your worth to it, and trying to make sense out of nonsense, you have to do the one thing that youve been avoiding at all costs: accept YOU for who youve become. If you find that you keep getting involved with people who have no empathy, the best thing you can do is start to work on empathizing with and building empathy for yourself. And the only way to do that is through vulnerability. Consistently strive to be the adult that your younger self needed and didnt have. Lastly, if youre involved with someone that has no empathy, let go of the expectation that theyll one day magically empathize for someone better. Let go of ALL expectations and remember  once you know that they have no empathy, if you keep re-engaging, thats not them hurting you, thats you continuing to immerse your head in the toilet and then cry because youre sick and smelly. Keep your boundaries in tact and understand that you wouldnt be in this situation if you had more empathy for yourself. People that have no empathy are all about themselves and this is why theyre so impactful on you and your emotions. Because they withhold from you and keep you in the emotional desert, when they do give you a little drop, you overvalue it and mistake it for a gallon. Its just a dirty drop and just because they appear to give gallons to others, that doesnt mean your worth a drop (or that the gallons theyre giving arent contaminated)."

133,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,DAE think they were both the GC and SC in a fluctuating fashion in their family of origin? Is that a thing that can happen? I have some thoughts about this as a particular vulnerability to Narc relationships later on...,9,73cmz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/73cmz8/dae_think_they_were_both_the_gc_and_sc_in_a/,2017-09-30 13:01:00,"The whole Golden Child (GC)/Scapegoat (SG) phenomenon didn't seem to resonate with me at first...until I realized that I think I may have been both. If that is possible? What makes me sad is that I think my mom was so caught up in her own emotions, dysfunctional relationships, and insecure unstable sense of self (largely emanating from her OWN experience of emotional abuse from her parents) that I was merely a sort of mirror to her on which she projected her unstable, fluctuating sense of self. A sense of self that could fluctuate back and forth between all the way up and all the way down. I had always felt that she deeply loved me but now I wonder if she ever really saw me at all or if she was so caught up in herself and her own unstable identity that that ended up being what our entire relationship has been about. She had widely varying emotions and attitudes toward me that largely had nothing to do with seeing me at all. I don't get the sense that her relationship with my siblings is as dramatically fluctuating--maybe there are projections of various things onto them that are more constant? The trouble is that if you don't understand this as a child and internalize this dramatically fluctuating behavior toward you from your mom as a reflection of who you really are, it is quite confusing and anxiety-inducing. I believe that set me up to be particularly vulnerable to being lured into an N romantic relationship and the fantasy-laden mirage it appears to offer. Since I was very confused about who I was (and anyway, regardless of if it was ever up or down it was all about my mom anyway), the lure of an N idealizing me and seeming to truly ""see"" me for the first time and love me--darkness and imperfections and all--was so seductively irresistible. I guess in the absence of my parents to help establish a sense of self and a sense of feeling valued in that self, I was desperately seeking someone(s) to help provide that for me. I was given the sense that this N was the first person to truly see, accept, and love me in all my depth, idiosyncrasies, and imperfections. Of course as well know, this rapidly all comes tumbling down and begins a cyclical pattern of idealization and devaluation...since I was pretty young and inexperienced when this happened (and coming from the family that I did), I had no idea what was normal. I guess I shouldn't say that because even plenty of grown people in this situation have no idea what is ""normal."" Anyway, I, of course, came to believe that this person's feelings, behavior, and attitude toward me were true reflections and I was completely desperate to keep the 'loved/valued/idealized' side of the lightswitch turned on. I guess that is why it became so important, to the point of incredible sacrifice and destruction, to remain in good standing with this person and to keep getting affirmations that he valued me. Without that, it almost felt as though I had and was nothing. It was a game I was set up to be completely desperate to play and win. 'Winning' here being succeeding in getting the N to consistently value me, basically forever. My sense of self became so tied to what he thought of me. Not understanding how NPD, etc. works at the time, I internalized any fluctuations to be caused by me and loss of being valued to be 100% my fault and true. I was intermittently rewarded with feeling valued and unpredictably devalued at the drop of a hat (all while being convinced that this was not random but rather my fault and if I could only figure out how to be better I really *could* keep the ""valued"" side of the lightswitch on forever). Of course I was also discarded repeatedly--sometimes in incredibly dramatic and demoralizing fashions. The more dramatic and demoralizing, the more confused I became and the more desperate I became to understand the ""truth"" about how this person really felt and nurtured an almost religious hope that the ""truth"" was that he really did and could love me all along. It is definitely liberating to realize this and it takes away power from his thoughts to see where all that force and power comes from now. It is all just an illusion. It also helps illuminate how some of us start out in life with the dice fully loaded to wind up in these situations (unless an adult can recognize this and intervene before it's too late--which maybe should happen more). I wish there could be less stigma and victim blaming because different people carry varying levels of risk for this due to a multitude of factors that started early in life and are completely not their fault. I feel somewhat liberated and also somewhat sad to realize that I don't think my mom's love for me was entirely about me or real. Can anyone else relate to these things at all? "
134,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,I want to get better but I'm still financially dependent on them?,3,75482j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/75482j/i_want_to_get_better_but_im_still_financially/,2017-10-09 07:35:19,"Hi guys, I'm new here and my English is getting rusty so, sorry about the potentially weird sentences. Also, it's going to be lengthy. I'd be grateful if you had some advice though, because I'm lost and can't afford a therapy right now. Earlier this year, I had a """"""boyfriend"""""". I vaguely knew something was wrong with his behaviorfor instance I didn't understand the huge gap between his affectionate gestures and his cold ass wordsbut I was incapable of letting him go. I thought things like ""it must be me"" and ""I'm almost 25 and I've never had a boyfriend. Maybe it's because I'm not tolerant enough, I should change that and trust him."" So I proceeded to overlook many, many red flags. When we were together, I spent my time apologizing and I felt impossibly lethargic. On our second date, we were supposed to watch a movie on my bed. Instead he told me ""I want to lick you down there"" and I fell asleep before he could do anything. It's like my entire body shut down. I had warned him I would need time, care and gentleness before doing anything like that, because I was sexually assaulted and sex scares the hell out of me. But he was incredibly impatient and I understood he wouldn't wait forever. Later that night, I reminded him we were supposed to watch a movie and not have sex, to which he answered ""If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd do it on my own, in my apartment"". Took me weeks to process that answer and see it for what it was. That guy broke up with me VERY suddenly right after the third date. He had asked so many questions about me, had wanted to meet my family, had written to me day and night for weeks, but I guess I should have known better since he had refused to show me HIS apartment and HIS family. His explanation for breaking up so brutally was that he'd never had any feelings for me, and that he just never missed me when I wasn't there. He had told me the exact contrary some time before. It really feels like I've been emotionally raped and I still struggle with nightmares and anxiety attacks from time to time. I also still think about him, almost daily. I feel like puking whenever I smell his perfume and I can't think about anything sexual without thinking about him and his trying so hard to get laid. I also feel guilty for not having incredible sex with him, like he wanted. ""That's probably why he left and any man would have done the same,"" some part of my brain keeps saying. Anyway, that was one of the most damaging relationships I've ever had, and I've come to understand that it fits in a pattern of similar toxic friendships I had before him. So I've tried to understand what is wrong with me, why I keep attracting that specific type of vampirey, pathologically lying profile. Took me a lot of time and energy because I had to face my own behavior and my own lack of courage, and kick myself in the butt. Long story short, my vulnerability may come from having been raised by two narcissistic parents who have always acted irrationally (and randomly) harsh, manipulative and dishonest, selfish, unstable and often unloving towards me. It's only recently that I realized you're not supposed to constantly fight to make your parents (and other people) love you less irregularly, or less superficially. It's like I desperately wanted someone, anyone, to make me their priority just for once, or to have deep and unconditional feelings for me. I also realized there is nothing healthy in staying all day in my room, avoiding the outside world as much as possible, and spending my time trying to please my parents - even if that takes lying or ignoring my own feelings. It's not exactly normal to pay attention to all their reactions because I'm scared they'll start yelling at me again. I shouldn't be still waiting for validation, or hugs, or genuine kindness in general. And I probably shouldn't be paralyzed and torn apart between 6372726 life choices and hobbies, hoping they'll find I'm good at something and start encouraging me. Understanding that is great, but it doesn't solve any of my problems. Now I don't trust myself enough to date or befriend anyone new. I'm scared I'll get involved in more toxic relationships. I'm also stuck in the deep pit of depression and I don't know what to do with myself. Sometimes I even think about ending it all, because I find everything ugly and dull, especially me. I have dreams and projects somewhere, but can't find the strength to even try. Either I cry for hours because of my ""ex"", or I cry for hours because I'm slowly unravelling what's been happening for years in this family. I hate myself for understanding everything so late. Plus, I have no job and I'm still stuck at my parents'. I'd love to get a job and move out but I've sent I don't know how many CVs and only one employer said he'll contact me... In March. Unemployment is very high here. The best I could find for now is temporary jobs. I can't go no contact on my parents either. Knowing my mother, she would use that to turn my little sisters against me. I don't want to lose them. I want to show them that we can break this cycle, that they can grow up to become healthy, kind, independent adults unlike me (for now). So I'm trying to heal and be an example but it's a very hard thing to do in my parents' environment. For example, today I've had nausea because I was scared my mother would give me the silent treatment for asking her to stop shrieking every time someone drops or spills something. I don't even know if I had legit reasons to be scared, of if I'm paranoid. Do you think healing here is still manageable somehow? Does anyone have advice on how to start loving oneself, on how to stop being affected so deeply by everything narcs imply? I know why I feel like an empty and shitty person, but I don't know how to stop feeling like that. Would reading more books on the subject help me somehow? Also, how do you stop associating sex with someone in particular? It's really annoying, I can still feel my ex's hands all over me and it disgusts me. And I feel very bad about all the things he probably thought I didn't do well in bed. I'd like to get rid of that way of thinking. (Again, sorry for the length of my post, and thank you to whoever will answer.)"

Spinning all these shitty signs into a ""poor me"" I don't want to be that! ""I just want to care!"" way and then they don't understand the implications of no empathy and or continue on lying and abusing you? Or avoiding and ignoring you when you catch them again until they come up with more lies and excuses to make you feel guilty for being upset or holding them to any kind of accountability. And my pet peeve, say you're in the middle of your FOG so you're still sending big long texts and explaining that you're hurt and why. Only to be ignored until the next day or so. Then they act like you never text them or brought the issue up. Or try to act so incredibly and painfully lost and stupid so as to waste your time. No, repeating yourself is too easy. They act like you need to explain basic concepts of human interactions to them. Or they can't scroll up the one page and ""remember"" anything. VVLC is about over and my therapist is helping me. But realizing all this manipulation and crazymaking has me so pissed off at him and myself. He's still trying his same shit and I know I need to ignore these things, it's just really hard. I have him blocked on social media though, which is sad because I did that when we were ""together"" and he never noticed. Last step is to change my number when I can which is soon. I guess I'm just venting and reacting here even though I don't want to. The cut in contact has made my doubt and anxiety skyrocket. I know he lies and everything else and I'm ok with my choice, but I don't understand why it's bringing on nightmares, panic attacks, and other stress induced stuff that isn't this bad. And YesILeftHisAss was right. He tried to hoover me back with promises of therapy and not wanting to be like how he chooses to act, he ""canceled"" because he couldn't get off work but took a write up to take a trip with his mom the same day.

I know there's a difference between then and now but it still is not good enough for me. And it will still be an issue with full nc. I'm so mad. I'm realizing more and more if I want to or not.

I've been mostly NC with my narc ex for a year and haven't even approached dating someone else seriously before now. I had one physical fling early on, just needed to be held and related to human to human - I hurt the guy because he mistook my vulnerability as openness and thought we were falling in love. So I backed off even looking for a kind human touch and just did my own thing for the next year. I met someone recently and I thought: ok, this is when I take the plunge and experience a normal relationship. I double, triple checked EVERYTHING for signs I wasn't violating my own boundaries, that he wasn't asking me to, that he wasn't love bombing, that I wasn't doormatting. I think I was so busy checking for those things that I wasn't even really paying attention to his words and behavior as a way of getting to know the man himself. I realized this and shifted into a different mindset (by force, at first) and I think the relationship might have really started just then. He seemed so very nice, and solid. ... only just around this time, Nex came back around for the first time in a year, like he had radar, got around my blocks by calling a land line, then ambushed me in public - seeing his face after so long and remembering how much I'd loved him just cut this zig zag through me, but no, I wasn't hoovered, I didn't feel nostalgic - I remember the bad much more than the good. Gave Nex 'polite boredom' and after a few tries to engage me, he scuttled off. But after this, strong as I felt, back in my new budding relationship I turned into a complete needy/cold/victim/asshole. All in turns. I asked for reassurance (in a new relationship that hadn't even built enough to make it to any natural 'reassurance' stage) and he gave it to me, but in a way that I could tell had some healthy and appropriate evaluation in it. In response, knowing that I was acting badly and feeling even more insecure because of it, I gave him the silent treatment, telling myself I was 'regrouping' - of course I wasn't, I was reacting as if 'no contact' was a strategy to employ every time I felt hurt or scared, rather than a specific healthy safety measure for dealing with Narcs. It's like in my mind, ""uh-oh! I feel uneasy in a relationship!"" just necessitated ""go dark! hide!"" -- when that's clearly not the response across the board. Ugh, what an asshole I was being! Finally, I backed out of a weekend we were supposed to spend together. I was up all night the night before filled with regret for my immature behavior, anger at myself for still being so unlike my former self a year after the Nex was gone, filled with suspicion of the new guy without any grounds, feeling filled with disgust at myself - and I cancelled the weekend with a lame excuse, then immediately regretted it and tried to take it back. To my equal parts sadness and relief, new guy backed respectfully out of the relationship. I don't blame him, it was the right thing to do, and I'm kicking myself more than ever now because it's a sign he was probably at least a moderately healthy person with some self respect and certainly didn't find my clear insecurity a ringing dinner bell the way a Nex would have. I've been in therapy, but am still totally unprepared for normal human behavior again. It's like I still dont' have skin. I want to be a normal, loving, happy woman again. "

No psych or PCP knows the truth neither do I but i'm nervous about losing my new job this week. I am diagnosed ADHD with anxiety and depression and once I saw a psych and she put me on wellbutrin xl 300 mg with zoloft 25 mg (a very minimal SSRI dose, not a full standard 50 mg dose) I was communicating more but seem a bit agitated when speaking to people and lacking some confidence (lethargy comes with confidence and my family calls it irritability but it could be because of what they did to my past relationship, my range of emotions are for sure dulled down though and couldnt do well on any law exam once I take a full dose, but anyway). I got this associate attorney job on Adderall XR 25 mg which I only have 4 left not enough to get me through the week and my psych or pcp wont give me more until 30 days because they prescribed me vyvanse 30 mg which doesnt work as well but less physical sides. I have this serious PTSD from sexual abuse in my childhood that traumatized me from my father and older brother and thats half the reason I always need meds for anxiety and cant be around them, so my psych gave me Xanax 0.25 mg as needed but I go through them very fast and wouldnt if I can figure out what the truth is here, on the higher SSRI zoloft 50 mg dose lethargic but at least approachable to people other than the ones in my house I guess and i dont care what people think, but the lethargy really sucks and the SNRI Effexor 75 mg seemed to have sparked me up a bit more but i heard the withdrawals are harder to get through and it triggered my fight or flight system which not sure was good or bad but less lethargic and more of a sex drive. Today, I notice that i'm missing a piece and my family for sure wont be the ones to tell me what to do because they destroyed my life for a year and abused me but i just needed to share this if anyone else has been alone and in this situation, does an antidepressant make you more like yourself and so what if your irritable if you dont need validation? or is that vulnerability required to hold this position or is that just my family's way of controlling me? thanks really appreciate the help "

So I want to work on my fear of conflict, I need to be more honest with myself, and learn to make my needs more clear with others and myself. But I also came up with this little list for any future dating endeavors. What are your guys' red flags you will never in a million years ignore again in the future? Warning signs/questions -How do they treat waiters/staff/employees? -What is their past/patterns of behavior? -How do they make you feel? (Intuition) are you on edge? -Do they let you take decisions? Can you speak to them openly? How much of the relationship is about them? -Do they push for things to go unnaturally quickly? -Are they secretive? -How do they answer the question 'how would you like to grow and change'? -Are they able to reflect openly on themselves? Be vulnerable? Vulnerability not just as a weapon. -How do they respond with empathy in films? -Moral judgment/tolerance of others? -How do they respond to your vulnerabilities/your opening up? -How honest/accurate are they and the memory? -How good are their gifts? -How good are they at listening? -How do they display possessiveness and jealousy? Can they tolerate you speaking about your ex (in a non-bad way)? -Can they admit their motives behind doing good things? Do they show off doing good things? -Boundaries? Do they behave appropriately? -What feeds and motivates them? Glory? Admiration? -How consistent are their actions with their words? -Do they apologize and admit they are wrong? -Are they like a perpetual victim? -Does it feel like 'too good to be true'? -Do they talk about how much they talk about you with others? Do they talk about having your children and living together too soon? -How does the issue of money make you feel in the relationship? -Are they sometimes cold for no understandable reason, hard to reach? -Can you openly discuss them and their behavior with others? Or are you keeping things secret because you fear people will misunderstand them? -What does my best friend really think of them? -Do you feel the need to please them? -Do you ever feel fear? -Do they make you feel like you need to work for it, in order to deserve them? -Are you waiting for the 'real' relationship to start? To get to know the real person? Are you put on hold, are other things prioritized over your needs? -Do you feel submissive/patronized/treated like a child? Do feelings from the past you can't quite place come back to the surface? -Do you feel like you aren't yourself, things are not in your control, this isn't you? -Do you remember that you can live without them?

All of my friends and family were taken in. He took care of me when I was sick and communicated that he was interested in the long run. He said he was old-fashioned and wanted to take things slow. Last week it came up that he might have to leave my country, so he said ""Is marriage off?"" That was another way to bait me I think into thinking he was serious. He also went on about how he has not tried to be in a relationship before me for 15 years - amazingly his parents and friends say this is true, not sure if they're all gaslighting as well. Yesterday we met to discuss his living situation and it's like his personality has flipped. He was cruel to me, snapped at me for being 5 minutes late and for asking a question. He then told me the following: 1. He feels he can't form attachment to anyone after always being on the move for work in the past 15 years. He isn't interested in marriage after all. 2. He laughed when I asked if he cared about me and said that it was ridiculous for such a goodlooking and confident woman to be so insecure. 3. He wants me to wait for him when he's back from work trips and in return will take me on fantastic nights out, weekends away and shopping trips. This is really galling because I am 30, have never accepted presents, plus I pay my share and am successful, though not as much as him. Since then he has sent his customary good morning message but ignored all of my replies. Probably tiring of me now he realises I have been hooked. I am really hurt and shocked that he's really like this, I've cried all day. It is a huge difference seemingly overnight. I feel so exhausted thinking about how I have to get over this and then resist him. I would really like some advice on what to expect and how I can plan to break up. Do you think he will make it difficult? My concern is that he greatly enjoys sleeping with me, we are sexually compatible so in his moments of vulnerability he will let slip - and get angry that he let slip - that I drive him crazy in bed more so than anyone else ever has. So I am worried that this will make him try to manipulate me and make me feel worse. A big part of me really just wishes he would go back to how he was before, like just be nice and lovely again. Any help would really be appreciated."

She is seven years older and was fairly coddled so she doesn't really acknowledge my struggle with my NM and enabling father. Although I'm the baby of the family, I was treated like a nuisance even though I was quiet and compliant yet my sister could do no wrong. I always thought it was because she was older but I've realized we live the GC SG dynamic. To set the stage for my home life, I was sick in the hospital when I was born and had an operation as a toddler. I remember having issues eating at the same rate my family did at the dinner table. my mother would set the timer on the oven and tell me if I wasn't done in ten or fifteen minutes, I would get a spanking. No one else in my family batted an eye. My mother loved controlling us with fear but my sister was much older and experienced than I was at dealing with them and was able to laugh things off and disarm my moms temper. There were times where we would be having fun together playing innocent hide and go seek when my mom was shopping and she would tell us we were going to get it once we got home. She loved to terrorize us with the wooden spoon, especially me. I remember moms blue but strangely dark eyes lighting up at the idea of punishment. My sister was faster than my lazy stay at home mom and laughed as she got away. I was hollering as I had to lay on my mom's lap on the toilet in the bathroom, she yanked down my underwear (I couldn't have personal boundaries or dignity) and I would take the brunt. Over something trivial, for being a kid. My sister would inadvertently lure me into the trap because I looked up to her and didn't understand the double standard. Fast forward to my teen years, she would make fun of me for liking fashion and basically being a normal teenager. Like my mom, she wanted to live in roots sweatpants, thought fashion was ugly but wearing 2-3 layers out at the lake every summer looked better? Each to their own. She got jewelry and a beautiful bedroom set, new bicycles. I got the hand me downs, don't get me wrong, I wasn't resentful but all my other friends mothers who weren't raising younger children worked so they could help provide for their families. My dad had expensive hobbies but he refused to give me the same advantages my sister had, now that I look back. If I ever said anything, even having a reasonable argument, my parents would accuse me of being ungrateful. Maybe I was, I was too young to get a job at that point and my clothes were poor fitting and often childish for my age. My room was painted like a nursery and I wasn't allowed to change it - but my sisters was whatever she wanted it to be. I broke away from an early age, became dependent, got a career, bought a home and am in a happy long term relationship. My sister had a child with a male narcissist who lived in his sisters basement, he lied and cheated on her and it was super obvious but she didn't leave for many years. I think she enjoyed being the victim because she only worked part time and would complain and always expect help and babysitting. My parents started to feel used up. Over the years while the dad has had custody and she'll have a full week off work, she'll lay around and eat fast food. It was always a Netflix and chill day. Never using the time my other single mother friends would use to be productive. She always has a story about how horrible her ex was being but I noticed he simply pushes the buttons he installed in her and she chooses to react. I don't want to judge her but she can be very two faced towards me and takes every opportunity to throw me under the bus or scrutinize me. I spoil my nephew but when I babysit, she'll always find something to complain about when she gets home. I've never had anyone else I've babysat for have an issue. I can't win.Btwn her and my mother I've felt really put down. I went nc with my mother and been honest about it but now she's using it as a vulnerability to exploit. I'm already seeing triangulation and games as she's close with my nm... If I don't get anything out of our relationship and it's always going to be one way (my nephew is an infinite source of hand outs for her), should I just go nc? Anyone else go nc with a gc sibling?"

It describes quite well what I went through and the pain I've been trying to understand after my ex cheated and turned into this terrible uncaring person. I thought it might be helpful for some others to read. I was married before, my ex husband wasn't a narcissist but I eventually discovered he was incapable of caring for me as he needed to feel cared for and looked after constantly. I got quite sick for a long time (was eventually diagnosed with two different illnesses but it took a few years) and he just couldn't cope. I felt abandoned and unsupported when I needed him most. I met my N ex towards the end of the year my marriage had ended. He portrayed himself as this wonderful caring man who was moved deeply by what I'd been through and the strength I displayed. He was supportive in a way I had longed for in my marriage and used that vulnerability to hook me. When he took away that care, it came out of the blue. After being up on a pedestal like that it was a massive shock to just be discarded. He just became this different person entirely, I realise now that it was just his mask finally slipping off. It's been the single most painful experience I've had in my life. I'm a very caring person, I come from a good family of caring people, I've never before experienced someone like my N ex and it's been a life changing experience. I didn't know people like him existed, people who would build you up, find your weak spots and then tear you down using those vulnerabilities against you. I don't want to waffle on too much. There was a lot more abuse and manipulation from him, but all of it under the guise of him being a good person trying to rectify his problems and bad behaviour. It took me a long time to see it was all words and little action. Because a lot of it was covert it took me a long time to understand it was abuse. We've been broken up a month, but I still crave his care and get upset and angry when he dangles it in front of me then takes it away. We're still in contact but I feel close to going no contact soon. I realise I have to learn to care for myself in the way I hope that my partners will, to feel safe and secure and supported without someone else there to do it. "

We have been trying to get this narc pig out of her SL life, but he keeps on coming back. Earlier today, when I was busy doing stuff, jerkface comes on and complains about the event I was running and more. he got told by someone else to ""suck it up, buttercup."" The following is his ""goodbye"" to the group the three of us were all in. Calling me an ""attack dog,"" that made me want to take him to task. What better way than to point his awful words here. BFF saw none of this, until way later, when someone handed her a notecard. She has him blocked, and rightly so. Whine: Just stopped in to say goodbye actually. Whine: To my lost friend... You have won. You, and your conspirators, have pushed me from this sim that I enjoyed so much...no...that we enjoyed so much, for so long. The pain that you targeted me with is complete. Just this once, I will not wish for your happiness. I hope this cheap victory will haunt you through your whole SL experience. As you spin your tunes, and your lies, I hope you will look around the Mansion and be haunted by the memories we shared. You say I'm obsessed with you, you say I scare you. Lies, and you know it. Is is me your afraid of, or are you afraid of confronting your own guilt and shame. I don't like setting blame, but everything that has happened between us is your fault. I never asked for anything but your friendship. I would have always been content to simply be your friend. Why did you come to me and push our friendship to a higher level if that's not what you wanted? Why did you lead me on to believe you really loved and cared about me? Was that all just a game? When have I Whine: ever failed to wish you happiness? Well, not this time. This time I wish you guilt. Guilt, for all the pain you've caused me. Guilt may be the only human emotion that you can still feel, or do you now get pleasure from cruelty? Have you sunk that deep into depravity? I pray not. I've heard it said that villains aren't born; they're made. I fear for you. I fear that those who claim to love you, as well meaning as they might be, could be leading you into darkness, not light. Yes, it may give you confidence, imitation self-esteem, but at what cost, the lose of your humanity; your soul? Please, if you feel you need help, get it from someone qualified to give it, and not from someone whose only therapeutic skill set is a comprehensive familiarity with Pokemon. Whine: Why, when I played the role you wanted me to play, did you turned on me? Why did you set your waifu attack dog on me? Why couldn't you have had the decency, courage and honesty to talk to me yourself? When did I ever fail to show you anything but love, friendship, acceptance, and support in all things? How could you return the best that I could give you with such hatred? I never demanded one thing from you, did I? What happened to that wonderful girl that I knew? How could you have turned into something so cold, dark and heartless. Which one is the real you, and which is RP? Could that remarkable girl I knew have been only an act? Are you losing yourself in your Lycan RP? In life we make many choices; some important, some not. Many choices are between good and evil. Those choices contribute to our happiness or unhappiness because we must live with the consequences. Why? Why would you do this to someone who you once professed to care about? I hope no one will ever break your heart like you've broken Whine: mine, and I hope you will never put any other guy here through such heartbreak. You are too good for all this. I have to believe that, and I may be a fool, but even after all you've done, I will still be here for you. I don't have to be in your friends list. You know where to find me. If...no, when those who claim to love you are done exploiting your vulnerability and wielding power over you, I'll be here with a shoulder to cry on, just like I was when we laid in the hammock here on the beach after you lost your first SL love. That's what real love looks like...the true love of a friend. Whine: Goodbye CFNM Mansion. Whine: I will miss you TL;DR: Jerk has been harassing my BFF for months on Second Life and won't get the clue to leave both of us alone, and decided to gaslight his goodbye."

She would recount an innocent conversation she had with a colleague or friend of mine and make me out to be a fool or villain. She is crippled by shyness, constantly demands ""vulnerability"" and suffers from extraordinary anxiety, anorexia, and sleeplessness. She would inexplicably exhibit rage and domestic violence like I have never seen. Just 6 months in she said on video, ""Why would I ever be with someone like you?

While I know that this isn't the topic of the subreddit, I'm mostly interested in knowing if my wife sounds like a narcissist/psychopath/whatever. We're divorcing, and based on past events narcissism seems like a likely diagnosis for her. I know that this isn't a place for medical advice or diagnosis, so I'm mostly just curious about your thoughts on personality traits before I start planning my exit strategy. Thanks in advance for any input. Quick demographics: I (34 M) divorcing wife (34F) after almost 9 years. No kids, no major financial entanglements, division of assets pretty obvious aside from savings and checking account (not a ton). I've offered her everything except my money, clothes, and car based on the horror stories I've read elsewhere. Arrangements not yet settled, but mediation is most likely given the relatively uncomplicated nature of our marriage. This is going to be really long. I apologize in advance for that and am honestly not doing this for any other reason than to vent my own thoughts. Input or advice are obviously greatly appreciated, but mostly I'm trying very hard to process my own emotions. My wife and I decided to divorce on Saturday, and I cannot untie this knot I feel inside. I feel so stupid and blind and ashamed of myself. I met my future wife 13 years ago in college. From the beginning, there were red flags. She was very controlling, prone to rage, and made active efforts to isolate me from my friends and family. She was very sexually aggressive and, at 21, my first experience with a woman. Whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted it. No problem. And then BAM. Nothing. She was extremely provocative and suggestive, would begin a sexual act, and then immediately stop and laugh. Now, a person has every right to stop a sexual act at any time. I'm not some selfish guy demanding gratification regardless of the wishes of the other party, but it was clear that she was really enjoying the tease. I should probably mention now that I am a person prone to severe clinical depression and suicidal thoughts. Also, I have adult ADHD and terrible insomnia, both of which have hijacked my life. About a year before I met her, I was institutionalized briefly, misdiagnosed as bipolar, and prescribed a cocktail of drugs that made me gain 50 pounds and made me a zombie. Do NOT let yourself be talked into taking zyprexa unless there's an extraordinarily compelling reason to take it. So I was still in a pretty bad place when I met her, and the vulnerability likely cost me 13 years of my life. Anyway, this pattern carried on for several years. We moved in together, but her level of selfishness was shocking. She absolutely refused to answer the phone when I was coming home from night class (I was taking EIGHTEEN credits, 9 of which were at the graduate level) despite my working 25 hours a week in addition to the crazy school workload. She worked a typical 9:00-5:00 job. I'd get home at about 9:30 PM and she'd start begging for me to go out and get Oreos or whatever. When I pointed out that I literally just called 15 minutes ago, she'd get crazy defensive and insist that I was the one being unreasonable. So like a pussy, I'd trudge out to the market that I passed not 10 minutes ago to get her treat. So guess who took on the bills, the majority of house cleaning, and things of that nature? Me. It was always like that. No matter how easy she had it, no matter how much responsibility I took on, no matter how much effort I put in, it was never enough. She was ALWAYS the victim, always the unloved one, always battling against an inconsiderate husband. It was truly baffling, but as usual, I sat there and took it. Fast forward 2 years. We're engaged and planning our wedding when she decides that she wants to buy a house in her hometown. Her hometown is an economically depressed shithole in the middle of nowhere and 45 minutes away from the organization I was working for. We also had no savings given that we were both in graduate school at the time (this was a different program than the one referenced earlier). I protested strongly, pointing out all the ways in which this was stupid and pointless and unfair. She bought one anyway without consulting me. In my rage, I packed my shit, but she managed to convince me yet again that she was the victim here, that I wasn't understanding her needs, that when will it be her turn to be happy? Of course, I bought into it, moved into the shithole, married her, and commuted almost 2 hours a day to my shitty job while she continued to snap her fingers, demanding all kinds of shit that she should have been doing herself. When she moved out of our apartment, we made an agreement to divide the responsibilities fairly. We would rotate weekends so that neither one of us would shoulder an unfair burden of the travel (how many times can one person fall for the same shit?). She would bring the pets to my place and spend the night once a week when she went to school, would clean up the absolute filth she left behind because she couldn't bring herself to ask the help to remove their shitty muddy shoes, would have the house on the market within 2-3 years at a profit, etc... In the 8 months between her move and the marriage, she visited me exactly twice. She blew off the promise to clean up the house, leaving me to clean up a dirty, shitty mess because leaving shoes in the foyer is too much of a hassle. The overnight visits with the pets? Never once happened. The house remains on the market 9+ years after the fact, unoccupied for over 3 years now. Her ""we'll bank $20,000 once it sells"" has turned into a massive loss that will actually be more than the price she paid for the home when all is said and done. I feel terrible about this, but a little bit of me is LOL'ing hard right now. Unproductive, unhealthy, indefensible, and out of character for me, but I can't help but smile a little. I ended up having to move away after a year to take on a job 2 hours away. This was during the peak of the economic crisis, and I simply could not walk away from the salary and benefits given conditions at the time. We made similar arrangements (I'm a fucking fool), and you can see where this is going. A year later, I again left, but she cried and admitted that she had done horrible things and she wanted to go to counseling to try to work things out. I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. I'll spare you the details, but suffice it to say that multiple sessions in the presence of a licensed therapist still wasn't getting it. We made an agreement that we would meet in my hometown the next weekend to visit my family and then I would drive back to my apartment. This would at least spare me the burden of driving in the wrong direction for almost 2 hours and then heading back to work on Sunday. She noped out at the last minute because ""it isn't worth it if you're not going to come visit me."" We're talking about 100 unappreciated, unacknowledged trips on my part over the years, but ONCE wasn't good enough for her. She cried, agreed to talk it out, and again, I came running back like a codependent fool. I'm trying so hard not to hate myself, but goddamnit, I could be married to a wonderful woman and have a couple of kids by now had I just walked out. Nope. So we reached a tentative peace in which she seemed to be doing well. Finally! I have reached her. She understands the effect of her actions on my mental health and finally sees me as an equal. Ha! After a few months, she stopped visiting altogether, restarted the bullshit with the phone, and then painted herself as the victim because I wasn't coming home every weekend. Same song and dance. She actually did get better at that, but those actions were just replaced with more petty shit. She is extremely bossy, and I have been pushing her to explore that for many years. No. She pestered me relentlessly on issues where I had told her my thoughts literally dozens of times, and she just kept at it until I blew up (VICTIM!) or just told her what she wanted. She has steadfastly refused to address the issues for whatever reason. So fast forward a little more. I get a job halfway across the state that I couldn't pass up. She readily agreed to go and supported my decision, but I told her, in no uncertain terms, that I would not be offended if she decided that it wasn't for her and wanted a divorce. You know...because I cared about her. She insisted that she was ready to go, we made the move, and everything was fine. Except it wasn't. The pettiness continued. It's almost like a statistics problem. The more that something would improve my life and the less effort it would take on her part, the harder she pushed against it. Am I the crazy one? I'm soliciting honest feedback here. She bullishly refused to see a therapist about things that would make me feel valued. That's all I really want in a relationship. She is a fantastic cook and would make these huge meals under the guise of doing it for me. Nevermind that I never once asked for them, clarified that while appreciated, the little stuff mattered most, and kinda hinted that maybe it wasn't so selfless of an act considering that cooking is her favorite thing to do. Nothing got through. I simply don't understand. Aren't these things just basic courtesies in any relationship, romantic or otherwise? I can't fathom seeing a buddy call at a time that I know he might be in a jam and ignoring him because I don't want to lift the remote to press pause during a Seinfeld episode I've seen a dozen times. How does someone press for 13 years to just be addressed with a sliver of respect and get nowhere? I just wanted to feel like we were in a partnership where decisions are based on ""we"" thinking, where my partner considers my needs and wants before doing something monstrously selfish. I never made it that far. Okay, Thursday. After watching the second season of You're the Worst (100% saved my life. A week earlier I was prepping the belt to hang myself. If you're clinically depressed, I beg you to watch the show), I'm aggressively pursuing cognitive-behavioral strategies in an attempt to claw my way out of a depression that seemingly had been happening for years. I also began a CBT-based insomnia program, and while I'm not yet sleeping more, it has balanced my REM/nREM sleep and given me energy I haven't felt in years. I get sleepy at night, but I don't feel that relentless physical fatigue that ruined so many opportunities. I've dropped 25 pounds so far, am exercising like nobody's business, and while I don't have a great self-image at the moment, I'm making slow, steady progress. I decided that this was the perfect time to finally lay my cards on the table. In a very non-confrontational way, I sent her an e-mail stating that I didn't know how much longer I could hold out on these petty issues. She's currently seeing a therapist, so I thought this was a perfect opportunity for her, or more appropriately us, to address and finally overcome these issues. Because I still believed that it was possible for her to change. When things were good, they were great. It wasn't always this relentless push/pull battle, and we had some laughs and fun times along the way. Why wouldn't she want to make us so much closer? Well, she didn't. Buh-bye. Not worth it. I wasn't issuing an ultimatum. I sincerely thought that it was a push towards closeness, rather than separation. But she just decided to end it, right there on the spot. My financial situation is pretty fucked at the moment, so we've agreed to civilly cohabitate until the very second that I have enough money to get on my feet. The sooner, the better. I need to be fair now and state that I'm not an easy person to live with. My mental struggles make me prone to self-directed rage and negativity that must be hard to witness. She always pushed me to therapy and was supportive, which is completely out of line with most other things in our marriage. This is the only positive thing I have to hold onto, although I'm now wondering if there's a more sinister motive at play. That's about it. There's much more to it, but this is the gist. Typing this out helped reinforce to me that this is the 100% correct decision, but I don't know how long that will last. For those of you who got this far: what do you think? Am I being unreasonable? Is it likely that a narcissist has been knowingly preying on a weak-willed person for over a decade for her own gratification? What is this all about? Does it have anything to do with me, or is this deeper shit that started way before we ever met? Were the good times bullshit, a temporary ruse to keep me around until I became disposable? Is my newfound commitment to mental health the reason she's bailing (in other words, she knows it's over and is getting out before I have the opportunity to do so)? The answers to these questions are unknowable, but what I'm really looking for is honest, direct feedback and/or advice. I'm so confused, hurt, and terrified at the moment. I'm trying so hard not to hate her, but fear what the process will do to me. Thanks for letting me bitch for a while. tl;dr: Wife and I are divorcing after many rocky years. Trying to process my feelings. I suspect she's a psychopath or narcissist, but can't make sense of things. "

Or, any other experiences people may want to share. I ended a seven year relationship with a narcsissist about two years ago. I am certainly in a better place with my life than I ever have been, but I still meet care and kindness in a traumatized kind of way. My ex would with hold care in extreme ways. For example, I went so long without being touched, that when a friend put a hand on my bare back while adjusting my bra for me, it was so overwhelming I almost started to cry. Obviously, touch isn't the only way to express care, but hopefully it makes sense as an example. I also find myself always expecting new people in my life, including both friends and people I am romantically involved with, to be mad at me-for everything and anything. I could elaborate more, but mostly I'd like to hear from others about their experiences and/or how they've worked through the harm done by being in a relationship with an emotionally abusive narcissist. I should also say that I started therapy today, but found myself feeling really awful afterward. I think that may be part of the process of learning to talk about myself and do vulnerability, so I'm still going back. Anyways. Thanks for listening and sharing. Love to you all."
147,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Do abusers put people through what they experienced as kids?,6,53a8z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/53a8z4/do_abusers_put_people_through_what_they/,2016-09-18 11:49:26,"I just had a strange thought that being abused, getting no apology or vindication, receiving very little empathy from those around me, being targeted by more abuse due to my vulnerability and even having my abuser turn people against me might be exactly what my abuser went through as a child. I grew up in an emotionally abusive and invalidating home but it could've been much worse, and I really had no idea what REAL pain felt like until this happened to me. Hell, maybe I still don't. I've also noticed that trying to explain my pain to people seems pointless, even to those who offer empathy, because they just don't get it. Like I don't talk about going through psychosis in person because seriously what's the point. I can't put into words how painful it was, and even if I did, they wouldn't get it until it happened to them. If this had happened to me as a kid, I would've assumed no one cared or understood. Like not just the people around me, but everyone in the world. I also started to wonder if my psychosis, triggered by the abuse, wasn't some sort of literal interpretation of how people who turn to narcissism start to feel after their childhood abuse. At my worst, I thought all my family members and friends were secretly taunting me and had been my whole life, animals were taunting me, the wind was taunting me, the tv, the radio, creaks in the house (not gonna bother trying to explain how this worked). The whole world turned completely evil. Maybe this is how narcissists/sociopaths/psychopaths begin to feel as kids, but they're unable to process it or put words to it in their mind, so they unconsciously adapt to a world that seems evil to them. I imagine this would then create a cycle, where they act out, people hate them for it, the persecutory beliefs are reinforced, and then they act out more. I can remember being out in public before my psychosis became completely debilitating, and thinking that these people have no idea how lucky they are. That all of the things they complain about were so trivial compared to the hell I was in. That I would give anything to get to feel what it's like to have a normal life. To have friends, to love someone, to be loved, to feel ok for once. All things these people take for granted. I guess what I mean is that I would've become a narcissist, or worse, if this had happened at a younger age. I still dunno what I think this means. I still know that offering a narcissist empathy is toxic and I really hope this doesn't convince any of you to go back to your narcissist or contact them again because they will continue to abuse you. But maybe if someone could explain their point of view and change how society perceives them, then society could come up with a way to help them instead of demonizing them?"
148,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,Is it me? (and why I suspect he is a Narcissist),6,53ofyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/53ofyg/is_it_me_and_why_i_suspect_he_is_a_narcissist/,2016-09-21 03:14:17,"Okay, so I know I have serious issues with depression and anxiety, etc., but I am by no means in any way abusive or argumentative even. All this time I have thought I was the problem (because that's what he tells me), but I am starting to think I am actually the TARGET. Like maybe he saw my vulnerability from the beginning, and whether he consciously planned it or not, it is why he was attracted to me. I have only recently started to consider that he is likely a N. Here's why: 1. In the beginning, he put me on a pedestal, everything I did was wonderful and perfect. Within months though, I couldn't do anything right. He made sure his disappointment was known DAILY. 2. I'm very nurturing by nature, and he always wants to be babied. ex.- I had an abscessed broken tooth that caused severe pain, nausea and swelling, and he dismissed it completely telling me I was pathetic (I didn't even complain- just mentioned that I might have to go to the dentist). In the next breath he was asking me to get him some medicine and rub his back because he had the sniffles. 3. I'm a freelance writer and things have been slow- partly due to job availability and partly my own fault because I have been so depressed that I can't think or motivate. Last week things started looking better and I told him the money was picking up. Within 30 minutes he was telling me that my measly paycheck wasn't cutting it and maybe he will ""decide"" to be depressed so he can be lazy too. 4. I have learned to walk away when he starts telling me how worthless I am&lt;&lt; which he tends to do whenever I am feeling better and being productive... but these days he FOLLOWS me, even stands at the locked bathroom door to scream at me about how I am nothing. Sometimes it goes on for nearly an hour. (he can't handle it when I don't argue back). 5. He talks over me. No matter what it is I have to say, he talks louder, and almost always about himself. How important HE is. How I can't make it without him. Even when the father of my kids had a stroke and was being lifeflighted, it became about HIM. 6. He tries to tell me how to do EVERYTHING. Cooking (and I've been told I'm a great cook), cleaning, he is an expert at everything. 7. He talks badly about everyone like the world is beneath him. 8. He threatens to leave me, divorce me, and reminds me that I NEED him. Last night he told me that I am an embarrassment because I stayed in my room when his friend came over instead of socializing. I'm disgusted with myself and don't want to be seen by anyone. With the depression and everything I already have, though, I know relationships can be tough. My reality is starting to waiver. There is always that doubt that maybe he is right. I know I've let him down. I know I'm not perfect. "

Looks like its too new to find an actual online test, but the description of what it measures is profound in and of itself: 1. Hypersensitivity to approval/admiration 2. Covert sense of entitlement 3. Inhibition of self-exhibition 4. Insufficiency of self-soothing 5. Insufficient sense of purpose URL The purpose of this study was to develop a scale measuring narcissistic vulnerability from the viewpoint of Kohut's self psychology. It was assumed that narcissistic vulnerability could be measured through the following five indications: hypersensitivity to approval/admiration, covert sense of entitlement, inhibition of self-exhibition, insufficiency of self-soothing, and insufficient sense of purpose. Factor analysis on preliminary 52 items yielded five factors corresponding to the above indications. The 40 items selected through the factor analysis were grouped into five subscales, the whole of which was named Narcissistic Vulnerability Scale (NVS). Narcissistic vulnerability as measured by NVS was found to be positively correlated with hypervigilant type of narcissism. **On every subscale of NVS, respondents scoring high exhibited greater intensity of anxiety and stronger depressive tendency than those scoring low. Patients with mental disorder showed higher scores than normal individuals on all subscales of NVS.**"
150,vulnerability,NarcissisticAbuse,dealing with anger,5,4kfefn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/4kfefn/dealing_with_anger/,2016-05-22 06:49:25,"How do you deal with the anger? Is it normal to be told you're the abuser, and start to believe it? What if you're the type of person who puts up a good fight, but still stays? In my family growing up, anger was okay. We are Irish. People got mad, yelled it out, and we moved on with our lives. There was a lot of love, so hard feelings did not linger when anger was expressed. The narcissist husband focuses on my anger. He seems to believe that anger is never, ever justified. Very early on in the relationship I remember screaming at him, You just want a fucking blowup doll, you can't handle a real woman! This kind of display of emotion would only serve to strengthen his position that I was a rageaholic, incapable of resolving conflict. When it was really him who couldn't handle conflict and that's what drove me to screaming in the first place, the fucking four day long fights. It would piss me off, the fact that he wanted to stay angry that long, and pout like a child and ignore me for days and refuse sex and oh my God, the heavy hugs. He'd hug me after a fight had ended (supposedly ended, it never really did) and it was like being hugged by a bear with its leg stuck in a steel trap. He told me that my anger issues were the sole cause of our relationship problems. If only I would not get angry, and remain calm, we wouldn't be having these horrible issues. Not only did he say that, but our marriage counselor said it, even my parents said it until he did some stupid manipulative trailer park-style validation-seeking stuff and I asked them to stop talking to him and they agreed, that was a good idea. His sister until recently was asking me why don't you try being calm, until finally the other day I started yelling at her, I HAVE FUCKING TRIED THAT!!! I TRIED BEING CALM!! IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE!! WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THIS? I'M DONE EXPLAINING NICELY HOW HARD I'VE TRIED TO MAKE THIS WORK, TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AND WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DEALING WITH HERE!!! My friends, bless them, saw through the whole fucking charade right off the bat, but there comes with that a concomitant intolerance for listening to me re-hash my relationship drama. I can't blame them, I'm the same way with them when they start rambling about some asshole I've already heard the whole story on. So yeah, I stopped getting angry for a while. I worked hard on processing my emotions. I went to therapy and paid a shit ton of money for it. I did what the therapist suggested. I also did yoga. I meditated. I quit smoking and drinking. I read a ton of books about intimacy and marriage conflict. But nothing about HIS behavior changed. He was still stonewalling me and abandoning me, but now for really trivial, petty shit, because I was no longer doing anything that could be construed by anybody as inappropriate. Some part of me realized that he had honed in on that particular vulnerability of mine, the tendency to lose my temper, and taken advantage of it, blindsided me really. It took me eight years to figure out what was really going on, and realize that possibly this hell I was living in wasn't always, always, always, all my fault. My life wasn't perfect before I met him, but it wasn't this fucked up, and somewhere my logical brain is drawing the correlation between my sense of losing control over my life, and the devaluation phase of my relationship with my husband. It was the gaslighting, the blame game, the weaselly behavior that made me so angry. The outright lying. He would deny saying things that he literally said one minute earlier. Every argument became a days-long torture session with his main objective being to convince me that if I would stop being so confrontational, we could stop arguing. Basically what that meant is that I had to agree with his version of reality, and consider mine invalid. My period would sneak up on me and I'd find myself getting snappy with him. By the time my period was over we were still fighting, and it was my fault because I can't let anything go. Meanwhile he's locked down on the computer, pouting, and making me work for scraps of affection, even basic conversation. What do you want for dinner? I don't care. Why are you still acting mad, I thought we made up? I don't know, I guess it's because the way you talk to me really hurts me. I remember being sick with the flu, miserable, throwing up with a fever, and he walked out of the house and didn't come back for three days. When he did come back, it was another five days of him pouting until I had sufficiently apologized for my horribly offensive behavior of yelling at him to please not fucking barge in on me when I'm in the bath. (There was no door to my bathroom and it was my sacred space, but he was constantly coming in there and asking me questions, stupid stuff like, Where is that steak we bought the other day, I can't find it.) We did mushrooms one time together, and I must have blocked this one out, but this is what I wrote in my journal: No nice person flips out on their girlfriend and starts verbally attacking her when they are both tripping on shrooms. I couldn't respect him after a certain point. I stayed with him, because Irish Catholics do not give up on marriages easily, even if they have given up on the Church. But I hated his guts. I couldn't even stand the sound of his breathing. Now I've realized that he's a narcissist. And I've gone down the stupid road, attempted to call him out on his narcissism, which was a really dumb idea as it resulted in a ton of absolute nonsense being catapulted into my phone and I actually threw it against the wall in frustration, just to get his negative vibes away from me. His whole thing now is, I cannot be in a relationship with someone who believes me to be an abuser. Well, yeah, duh, so why hasn't he filed for divorce? It irritates me, the constant bitching about how I don't love him and never did but if he really believes that, why the fuck hasn't he filed yet? He's made a bunch of dramatic phone calls to lawyers, right in front of me, but I've never been served with papers and now I see it's me who is going to have to do the serving. So anyway, he's a narcissist. There is no cure. There is no way to reach him. I tried changing my entire personality around and basically became a doormat. It didn't work. The Virgin Mary would not be saintly enough for this man. I have to let him go and try to spin this like I know I was raised to spin it. See the positive in the experience and move on... tougher, wiser, stronger and more fabulous than before. But this is a lot to process and I know it's going to take some time, and I am trying to be patient with myself. He's fucked with my head so much that I think I may have taken on narcissistic qualities myself as some sort of protective measure. Like, abuse begets abuse? Or maybe he's right and I'm the abuser. Maybe it is my anger that's the problem, or we are the problem, but I still think it's funny how it's never, ever about just him."

A thank you to everyone who manages to read the whole thing. I still have doubts if this is the appropriate sub, but my post doesn't seem to fit in anywhere else and I really need some advice. Last week on Wednesday, I told one of my three closest friends (we'll call her Mary) that me and my bf of seven years broke up. It took me some time to call her and tell her, a) because I'm the kind of person who needs to figure things out by themselves until they go get support and b) because I was dreading her reaction. What I was dreading was that since Mary never liked my ex-partner and best friend, she would say something nasty. Or be relieved that my relationship was over. She used to say 'In my opinion, you deserve more. Someone who is also smart but earns a lot of money. Not like your boyfriend. Someone who doesn't have depressions. Your boyfriend is just draining your energy. You only take care of him all the time and your friends get the short end of the stick.' This, of course, was not true. But I forgave her because she spent a few years in an abusive relationship with a cheater. How could she understand? I was still kind of hoping she would be supportive and understanding anyway, after all, she knew how much I loved him, but at the same time I feared that she might possibly even get angry with me for not telling her earlier. So I dragged this out and thought about how to approach breaking the news. It took me days. I didn't think too much about telling my other friends (let's call them) Anna and Sophie a week after my break up, who were really supporting, nice and really empathic. (If you wonder about all the calls  we all live in different cities.) I told Sophie how I still dreaded telling Mary and how I was scared that she would be kind of miffed about me not involving her earlier. Even while talking to Sophie I started justifying why it took me a week to tell her, Sophie. She just interrupted me by saying 'stop with the justifications, for god's sake, and don't try to find a fault in what your heart told you to do. If anything, I should be worrying about what kind of friend I am to you if you don't feel like you can rely on me in dire times. It's all right, you did nothing wrong. You have to do what is good for you.' I love her. She added 'and if Mary really says anything that will hurt you, especially now, she is NOT you friend.' I also send Anna, who has somewhat autistic tendencies, a text. She texted back: 'Thanks for the heads up. If you ever need anything, tell me. Anytime.' That's our code for 'I have your back'. Now I still had to tell Mary, the third of my girl friends. But how? About a week later, last week on Wednesday evening, I happened to be online on facebook and saw that Mary was online, too. I casually started the conversation by complimenting her on her new hair style (maybe because I knew that this would get her attention?) This was followed by a flood of new pictures of said hairstyle. I told her it looked nice. After a few minutes of no conversation, she asked me how I was. We had talked on the phone in between my break-up and that night, but I tried to keep it shallow on my side and usually she had enough topics like her work troubles and which colleague was being a bitch even though she was sooo nice to them last time and how they always take sick days and everything. That was fine at the time. So I wrote that I wasn't doing that great, but that I'd rather talk to her on the phone about it. So she told me to call her, even though it was really late. So I did. A few sentences into the conversation I said 'Yeah, no use talking around it. [BF] and I broke up a couple days ago.' There was an outburst. 'FINALLY! Now you can move back to [Mary's and my ex-home town]!' She triumphed. On my side there was a sting, numbed in resignation. I had been right with my assessment of her reaction after all. Then came the inner correction. 'Well, you know her, she can't help it... ', I thought. I said that I somehow knew she would say this and quickly kept talking. I told her about my future plans. Saving up some money maybe and go travelling. That I would probably be staying in my current place for a few more months or years before I'd be going back to uni for my master's. And I started justifying. How I didn't have the money to move back to [home town]. How I needed to get a job first anyway. How it didn't even make sense to move because I might have to move again in about 2 years for my master's. How I needed to take this chance to figure out what I would like to do with my life. Figure myself out. She grudgingly accepted all of this but towards the end of our talk it got a bit weird. I don't quite recall what she said, but it was something like 'of course, I feel sorry for you' appended by something that expressed in unclear words how she didn't take well that I anticipated her reaction. Also, acquaintances of her would be moving out of a really nice apartment soon but it was a bit expensive for one person. So I should not dismiss the idea of moving back 'just like that' but instead SERIOUSLY consider it. We wished each other a good night and hung up. And I sat there thinking. And thinking some more. What the fuck just happened? Why do I feel so weird? I knew she would react like this. Was I disappointed? In me? In her? I went to my ex-Bfs room (we're still good friends and live as roomies for the time being) and I started telling him about my talk with Mary. And for some reason I just started crying. And then I noticed that I felt utterly hurt. Just plain hurt. We talked for a while and he pointed out how he always told me that she was the most egocentric person he's ever met. I started defending her. Well, she had a bad childhood and has a weird relationship with her foster parents. She never knew real unconditional love. She has abandonment issues and all of that is not really her fault. What should I do? If I tell her how she has hurt me, she will be scared that I will withdraw affection. To her, it will be abandonment. My ex got kind of angry. He sat me straight. 'Right now', he said, 'you are in a vulnerable position. And your so-called friend comes along and ruthlessly waltzes all over your feelings and you keep defending her? Please think of your own well-being.' It was kind of an eye opener. I went back to my room and googled. Egocentric led me to narcissism. I got doubts. Narcissism? No way!  Yes way? I couldn't figure it out, but I really felt the need to get my feelings out in a clear way. I wrote a letter. Almost ten pages of explaining. That I noticed afterwards how her reaction hurt me. Why I think it hurt me. Trying to make her empathize with me. Explaining how it isn't easy breaking up with your best friend just because you can't make the other person as happy as you would want them to be. How I really didn't think that moving back was a good idea. That I needed to be by myself and figure things out. What friendship meant to me. Trust. Respect. Not dependency. How just because you 'invested' in something, it didn't mean that you 'deserved' something in return. Telling her that I wished for her to find solace in herself without being dependent on others for her well-being. How I always tried to tell her that it is not other people's responsibility to make one happy. How the biggest challenge in life was to still want to continue living if you had nothing and no-one around but yourself. And also telling her that I felt hurt. That I was asking myself why in the world I told her about my break-up in the first place and how I think it's not right having to ask yourself this question when it concerns a friend. That for the first time, I got this weird impression that I always seemed to have more understanding for her and her feelings than she for me and mine. That for the first time in our friendship, I didn't feel like understanding or forgiving her. I sent the letter shortly before the weekend. At first I felt great. I got the message out and told her in a respectful manner that I felt hurt. Then came the doubts. I noticed that I started dreading Mary's reaction. Trying to anticipate it. Would she just delete me on facebook without saying anything? Would she be angry with me and attack me? Would she call me up crying on the phone, essentially begging for me to console her and apologizing to her for being too harsh? Maybe what I wrote in the letter WAS actually too harsh? I knew she couldn't take criticism really well. I had the letter typed out on my laptop. I tried to find answers in it. I kept re-reading every sentence. Looking for something that was maybe over the top or unnecessarily mean. Read it again looking for unspoken emotions. Did I want to get revenge? Did I write it to hurt her? Did I maybe just cunningly choose the words to make her feel horrible? Was I a horrible person for feeling this way about her? Where did I go wrong anyway? Maybe I had been too sensitive? After all, I was handling the break up okay. She was weaker, quickly lost direction and needed understanding and support. Horribly dependent on reassurance. Wavering self-worth. I cared about her. She could be so gentle. Always ready to take my side. Very agreeable. Seemed to care about me. For all of the 7-8 years of our friendship, I tried to support her, help her be independent while keeping my own boundaries. Or so I thought. She used to tell me that I was her only real friend. That she could never rely on others but she could always count on me. How she told her family about me. How she is always boasting to others what a great, smart, compassionate and capable friend I was. Every one of those sentences took me another step away from the position in which disagreeing with anything she said was still possible. For her, I was the saint on a pedestal. And everyone knew. The damage would be horrible if I ever openly disapproved of something she did. She trusted me with her weakness, her secrets. After all, I was the 'only one who really understands' her. She said she wished she could be 'as strong as' me. How could I abandon her like all the other 'fake' friends in her life? Disappoint her? Hurt her? I felt responsible. But over time, it just got harder and harder for me. In hindsight, objectively, the only boundary I had left was not picking up the phone when I didn't feel like talking. In my own head, I even turned never logging into facebook into a principle. So I could say, I don't know, I don't care so much about facebook whenever she asked if I saw her new pictures on facebook or why I was never online. She would leave me messages on my answering machine. Playful. 'Are you dead? The voice of your answering machine is horrible. Call me back.' Hurt. 'Hello, I hope you are ok. I have tons of problems. Call back soon.' Demanding 'You are NEVER picking up your phone these days. I will call again this evening. Two days ago, she texted me. 'Hello, I just found your letter in my mailbox, haven't checked it for some time. I have to think about your words for a bit because they really affected me. I will send a letter to you in a few days.' I feel weird. Doubting, again. Scared. And for some reason, angry. There, a first chance to apologize, passed up just like that. Did I really do something wrong? Maybe I'd really been too harsh. Maybe I really was too sensitive. Maybe I am the egocentric person in our friendship. Asking for too much. I googled again. Egocentric. Narcissism showed up again. I started researching. Something I always do whenever I'm in emotional doubts. I rationalize. Try to understand. I found a blog post about ending friendships with narcissists. I saw thousands of parallels. People described this uncertain fear they had. All my doubts, uttered by anonymous people on the internet. This feeling of responsibility for the other person. For the narcissist. Trying everything during the friendship, or relationship, to make the other person understand that they will not be left on their own. Feeling sorry for them. Like an addiction. Wanting to be the one, true, dependable friend. How speaking your mind will be followed by crushing doubt. By wanting to undo, unsay, unwrite what you know the narcissist will perceive not as criticism between friends, but as a personal betrayal. Trying to even undo the damage that other flaky horrible people have imposed on the narcisstic friend. Always being mindful of their vulnerability, taking this responsibilty, because you know the narcissist can't help being the way they are. Taking all the hurt, shielding, protecting, reassuring. Feeding. I still have doubts  maybe I really am overreacting. Maybe I'm the narcissist here, trying to shift the blame, shirking responsibility for my actions. Maybe this post is not just asking for advice but trying to have people tell me that I am an okay person. That I'm not wrong. Begging on the internet. What a great friend I actually am... I'm scared of her letter. I'm scared of the future. I'm scared that she knows that I know many of her secrets. I would never use them against her. But I'm scared that she will feel threatened anyway, should I try to end our friendship. That she will lash out. Try to hurt me 'back'. I know what happens whenever she finds someone to be 'not a real friend'. I'm also tired. I feel drained. I don't know what to think, what to do anymore. Do I owe her a 'proper ending'? I feel like there is no way that I can back out of this unscathed. For some reason I'm really glad that all the things she knows about me are things that I would openly admit in public because I strive to be a person of integrity and honesty. I know I should just stop feeling responsible, but I myself have trouble believing that she is THAT bad. I can deal, I'm stronger. But I'm scared that I won't ever be able to get out of this friendship, or shed the role that I have in it. And it is already taking a toll on me. Please help. **TL;DR Found out in an emotionally taxing situation that my friend might be a narcissist and has no empathy for me, and I don't know how to cut ties or stop feeling responsible. Advice welcome.**"

I also teach cybersecurity and Operations Security (OPSEC) for the federal government. ""Operation: Safe Escape"" initiative is our program to combat domestic violence and help people safely escape an abusive situation. We work with both victims of domestic violence and shelters / safe houses to improve the security of both. As a non-profit, this is something we do for free- it's just a part of our charter. We just completed an app that I wanted to share with you. It's based on the paper ""escape plan"" document that many shelters use, and some of you might be familiar with it. The problem with the paper form is that it's a single point of failure, right? The abuser might find it and get access to very sensitive information, like when the person is leaving, where they're going, etc. So our goal was to take it off of paper and get it digitized so it can be accessed anywhere, any time. An app made sense for this, since so many people have a phone. But sometimes a solution can raise more problems! If we had an app that says ""domestic violence escape plan,"" and if the abuser checks the user's phone, that's even worse than a paper form. So here's the solution we came up with: the app is ostensibly a ""quote of the day"" app, just like so many others. You open it up and it just looks like any other, with inspirational quotes (carefully chosen to be relevant without appearing relevant, by the way). But if you know the secret, you can get into the password-protected section that includes your escape plan and important safety tips. It's broken down by phase so the user won't get overwhelmed by information, and it allows you to focus on one step at a time. You can put in all the information you'll need to safely get away, and you won't have to try to remember so much information when you're going through a very stressful time. You're probably thinking to yourself, ""what happens if the phone is taken? Shouldn't I leave their phone behind anyway so it's not tracked?"" Yes, you should! And we planned for that. Because the data is stored in an encrypted Google Firebase server, you can download the app again and use their same username and password to retrieve their plan. So if you go to Walmart to get a burner phone (or when we provide one, in some cases), you can install it on that device as well. Here's the [iOS version](URL Here's the [Android version](URL Note that we're hosting the Android version directly on our website, rather than through the play store. So when you want to install it on your phone, it will prompt you to accept installation from ""unknown sources."" After you install the app, make sure to revert the settings back to the original configuration. If you have any questions about how to do any of this, feel free to send me a message or comment here. Also, this is a good time to open up for any security-related questions at all. I personally specialize in OPSEC and computer security, but I can reach back to others on the team with any other questions in other security disciplines. Chris A quick security notes about the app: the data's encrypted and secured. We can't even access it. Only the user can access it. And there's NO password recovery option, for obvious reasons. The abusive partner probably knows the user's pet name and mother's maiden name. It's too much of a risk to have that feature. "
