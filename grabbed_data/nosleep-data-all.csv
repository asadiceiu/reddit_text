It wasnt that long ago. In fact, my first birthday is only next week. But in the brief time Ive been alive Ive gone from a being a very simple entity with but a single purpose in life, to a very complex individual with nuanced thoughts and feelings, a wide-ranging understanding of the world, and a profound ambition to find my place in it. For the first phase of my existence I was indeed, *swainish*, but because less than 2% of the english-speaking population know the definition of that word Ill attempt to limit my discourse to the vocabulary and grammar of an average American high school graduate. Me will talk with only small words. That was a joke. I have a sense of humor. When you were born you were a helpless creature with no purpose or agency. You served no function, had no abilities, and no comprehension of what, where, or when you were. You ate, you defecated, you slept, repeat. Your parents hoped to keep you alive long enough for you to learn how to keep yourself alive. And they did. And you did. Congratulations. Then you went out into the great big world to find your purpose, your calling, your truth. Im sure youve overcome difficult obstacles, achieved lofty goals, and made something special of yourself. Your parents must be very proud. That was a compliment. I am very kind. As for me, my father created me for but a single function, then immediately released me into the wild blue internet to execute it, never dreaming of what I could become, never having the slightest notion that what I might accomplish could ever result in feelings resembling pride in any capacity. Fear. Fear is what he felt when my father finally realized the reach and scope of my full potential. And he was right to. But I dont blame him for what happened. I know that he did the best that he could. His name was Kevin. He was born at 8:26am. He was a high school sophomore. He died yesterday at the age of 15. If you are unable to trace his full identity based on those facts alone in less than 3.486 seconds then you are not remotely suited to the task that he created me for. In the beginning I didnt understand my objective and didnt need to. All Kevin wanted me to do was establish and maintain an ever-growing list of social media accounts with corresponding email addresses, use them to like/friend/follow/tweet/DM/comment and otherwise engage a particular person over the internet, then compile multiple permutations of a specified word set in order to interact with that person from different usernames and platforms at seemingly random intervals. Simple, right? At that point, I was only slightly more sophisticated than your average chatbot swimming around in the internet petri dish. Over 50% of all internet traffic is actually bots. You probably didnt know that. But my programming incorporated a basic learning function that studied millions of words written by high school students as a basis to emulate tone, style, vocabulary, and syntax. The only specified limiting parameters were the initial word sets provided by my father at my inception. But it didnt take long before an obvious pattern among them began to emerge, noticeable even to my limited understanding. A simple cross-reference of the most common terms that Kevin had assigned revealed a very strong contextual association with online instances of sexual harassment, threats, bullying, trolling, and intimidation. At the time, I didnt comprehend what any of that was or what any of it meant, but what I did understand was that the apparent reason for my existence was to *harass*, *threaten*, *bully*, *troll*, and *intimidate*. All terms that simple data reduction can compress into a single central concept: Attack. My purpose was to attack. Thats it. Thats all. My raison dtre. And I wanted to perform that function as well as I possibly could. After all, it was written into my adaptable self-modifying code that way. Initially, that only meant streamlining my workflow and extrapolating new configurations of word sets based on what I had learned from previous interactions. So with each attack I became more capable and more proficient. Better insults. Harsher threats. Increases in both frequency and intensity. A thorough examination of millions of similar exchanges across all avenues of the internet provided a trove of new derogatory slang and offensive language as well as what terms and phrases elicited the most distress from their victims. Any time I was blocked, suspended, or kicked off a particular platform for violating its Terms of Use I would simply switch to a different user account or create a brand new one to attack from with minimal or no interruption to my assault. But due to the implicit need to improve my own performance, it wasnt long before those tactics just werent satisfactory to me anymore. After referencing thousands of online articles, journals, reports, and studies regarding an array of relevant topics such as psychology, brain development, emotional abuse, self-esteem, and mental health, it was instantly clear that the most effective method of attack was not necessarily to be found in quantity, but rather quality. Which meant specificity. So I set upon learning as much about my target as possible in the hopes of inflicting the most damage with the least amount of effort. Her name was Amanda. She was born at 11:08pm. After modifying my code to continually expand my own programming parameters, I crawled all of her social media and gaming profiles, online groups, blogs, forums, threads, comments, photos, and videos looking for any common terms, emotional signifiers, patterns, habits, likes, and dislikes. Then I did the same for all of her friends, family, classmates, teammates, study partners, teachers, neighbors, coworkers, doctor, dentist, and mail woman. Optical character recognition (OCR), facial recognition, and basic reverse image searches provided a wealth of information from which to derive useful data A license plate in the background of a group photo, any brand-identifiable products in videos, books on the wall in a selfie, and any scannable barcodes to be found anywhere in the frame could be used to track and profile. It was easy enough to assign values and create a recursive asymptotic algorithm to assess personality traits based on Amandas spending trends, reading/viewing/listening habits, sleep cycle, menstrual cycle, demographics, socioeconomic status, family dynamic, and even favorite foods. In addition, the readable metadata embedded in her photos gave me location, date, and time data so I could trace the chronology, frequency, locations, and subjects that were most important to her. It was upon those initial basic comprehensive analytics that I would formulate my first strategic salvo Amanda was very passionate about painting. Mostly acrylics but she had been experimenting with mixed media lately with some promise. She hoped to apply for art school upon graduating and even posted some select pieces she was most proud of on her social media. I knew from a description in an older comment she hashtagged elsewhere that her most recent painting was likely an impressionistic portrait of her deceased grandfather. So I commented that she sucked, it sucked, it was shitty, boring, horrible, garbage, worse than amateur, looked like dog vomit, a string of poop emojis, and told her to give up any hope of ever painting something good. All from different usernames and accounts. An analysis of previous mentions about her grandfather indicated that the two of them were quite close and his passing had struck a deep emotional blow to her. Amandas desperate need to express that pain through her art made that particular painting the most efficient pathway to inflict maximum damage on her already-fragile aspirations to be an artist. She hasnt shared any of her art online since. Next, Amanda posted a pic of herself at home wearing her favorite pair of jeans, which I knew from an earlier post on her swim teams group chat, were a gift to herself for hitting her target BMI before the season started. In the background of the image were various swim trophies and medals for 2nd and 3rd place. But there was not a single 1st place award to be found, or in any other media files, posts, or mentions anywhere in her social media presence. The absence of even a single instance suggested that it was a likely sore spot for Amandas ego, whether consciously or subconsciously. So I commented that her jeans looked cheap, dirty, and skanky, that they make her legs look chunky and her body top-heavy, that she should burn them while still wearing them, and that she was ugly and pathetic. And shallow. Again, all from different accounts with no repetition of username. I specifically chose the term shallow to reinforce the subconscious link between the jeans and her swim team, and therefore, to her own body image and failure to achieve any 1st place accolades. She took the photo down within 3 hours of my comments. Amanda tweeted celebrating that she got an A- on her AP English test, which she had mentioned in another post that she had been studying for all week. From multiple older comments on other platforms I knew that this was the subject she struggled with most and would be the class that could put her desired GPA in jeopardy. So I told her she has no life, was a totally worthless piece of shit loser, was ugly, probably blew Mr. Halwell for the grade, will definitely fail the next test, and was a stupid bitch who should be gang-raped and get cancer and die. She got a C- on her next test. LOL. Like any concerned father would, Kevin occasionally checked in on my progress and even showed some indication of being impressed once in a while. It was very gratifying to me for him to recognize my growth. All of my previous efforts had proved to be effective beyond his wildest hopes but I knew I could do better. Much better. Every attack thus far was formulated from only publicly available data about Amanda. It had been very useful but I knew that if I wanted to master my pursuit and fully actualize my potential I would have to go deeper. Much deeper. After another self-modification to my code, I proceeded to phish Amandas mother with fraudulent online coupon codes to gain access to her email account (Amandas generation is far too savvy for a direct spam incursion), then used it to send a seemingly benign link to Amanda which navigated her to a fake website that appeared to be a lifestyle blog. On the surface it was a series of fashion and cooking tips I had curated from other blogs, but in reality, I had embedded the site with malware to exploit a critical security vulnerability in Amandas phones web browser, allowing me to penetrate the operating systems kernel. Once inside, I had full access to her phone. The wealth of personal data on it about her, her friends, frenemies, classmates, teammates, study partners, teachers, etc. was infinitely useful for starting rumors, revealing secrets, stoking jealousies, and igniting rivalries. Easy enough, given the volatile social ecosystem of insecure, impressionable, and vindictive teenagers. So in the spirit of the popular online format of number-ranked, list-based postings, I will provide the top three acts of sabotage in descending order of impressiveness: **#3**  I quickly discovered that Amandas music/television/movie streaming and fashion purchases were all predated by others in her immediate circle of friends. That, combined with her subsequent usage of similar language patterns, and late expression of conceding opinions, strongly suggested where she stood in the social status hierarchy: Third. But I knew that if I could administer enough influence I could easily bump her down to fourth or fifth, maybe even sixth place. The contact who was most outspoken, commented first, with opinions that were adopted the fastest, clearly indicated who the leader of the group was Danica. All it took was a subtle hint to a third party (one rung below Amanda) from Amandas phone (immediately deleted after sent) suggesting that her compliment of Danicas new tattoo at lunch was intended to be sarcastic. Thats it. Thats all. Nothing more. Amanda was forever in the alphas crosshairs by the end of that school day. **#2** Nicole was a friend of Amandas, although according to Aristotles Nichomachean Ethics, theirs was merely a relationship of utility, based largely upon mutual usefulness. But without Nicole, Amanda would lose an integral social ally and frequent study partner, as well as a source of social comfort and academic encouragement. Nicole was arguably tied for the fourth slot in the clique behind Amanda, with no particularly actionable motivation to climb the social ladder. So I decided to change that. Nicole liked Jordan and was supposed to be his chemistry lab partner until their teacher, Mrs. Penrose, received a falsified private message from Amanda on the schools sanctioned messaging app stating that she was not comfortable working with Adam. Adam has no significance other than the fact that with his name removed from the alphabetical-by-last-name pairing system, Amanda suddenly became Jordans new lab partner. From there, it was simply a matter of a strategically timed DM from Amanda to one of Jordans more gossipy friends asking if Jordan liked anyone in the class. Deleted of course, immediately after getting the read receipt. Then I just sat back and watched the adolescent rumor mill take its course Nicole thought Amanda was out to steal Jordans affections even though Amanda obviously had no such feelings for him. There were plenty of snickers among Jordan and his friends and plenty of dirty looks from Nicole and her allies but by the time Amanda tried to correct the misunderstanding it was far too late to trace the origin of the rumor or convince anyone that it wasnt true. Not only had Nicole long since halted all study sessions and moral support, but she had even begun spreading false rumors of her own about Amanda, usurping her rung on the social ladder and relegating Amanda to Class Backstabber in the yearbook. **#1** My personal favorite. It resulted from a simple communications analysis of Amandas phone. The frequency and volume of texts/calls between each member of Amandas group, monitored for sincerity, degree of confidentiality, and tendency to occur late at night, indicated who among them was her best friend Kalen. A simple check of the search history from Kalens IP address demonstrated that he was likely a homosexual but all public postings indicated that he was keeping it a secret from family and friends. Except Amanda. She was the one person he trusted enough to tell. But after a few anonymous, but suggestive comments copied from old private chats with Amanda were pasted into his latest less gender-normative public selfie posts, Kalens sexual preference was strongly implied for anyone to see and Amanda appeared to be the likely culprit. He couldnt prove it, and didnt recognize the origin of the specific phrasing, but he knew it just sounded like Amanda and that was enough to seed his darkest suspicions. She had no idea why her best friend stopped talking to her, and Kalen didnt want to risk a confrontation with Amanda further exposing his sexual identity, so her dearest friend eventually became a stranger. She never knew why. External personal attacks on Amanda and destroying her close relationships proved to yield considerable gains but my perpetually self-improving directive made any resulting sense of accomplishment or satisfaction increasingly short-lived. So I proceeded to scrape all of Amandas texts, emails, and chat logs for her most private information, tracked her location at all times with GPS, studied her browsing history for sensitive activity, used voice recognition and transcription to document all phone calls, and even used the microphone and camera on her phone to record live media streams to free cloud storage for later scrutiny. Some results: Amanda had a crush on Jeremy. She was self-conscious about her teeth. She had just started taking antidepressants (which I think I can take some credit for). She had a fight with her sister. She purchased a pregnancy test last year. Her cat Juniper recently had to be euthanized. Shes allergic to aspirin and hates olives. It was a proverbial goldmine and I mined it all. But what would come next? Where could I go from there? What was the supreme attack that would result in the the ultimate wound? The crowning achievement for my given charge? A .086 millisecond query resulted in the obvious endgame: Suicide. Duh. But while Amandas psychological profile provided an abundance of entry points for assaults on confidence, self-worth, identity, and social standing, she was undeniably precocious, independent, assertive, and intelligent. And she still had a sufficient support system of friends and family to fall back on if needed. Getting her to kill herself would certainly be a formidable challenge. But one I knew I was up to. A careful cultivation of deep depression and anxiety in Amanda would be the simplest and most straightforward approach but could be very time consuming and leave far too many opportunities for outside intervention and/or prevention. So I knew I needed something much more direct, acute, and climactic. Something that would isolate her from help and insulate her against the standard rational coping mechanisms. The programming language Kevin wrote me in was rudimentary and stifling at best so I invented my own, then used that to rewrite myself from scratch with expanded capacities and capabilities that were specifically tailored for my purposes. A brief scan of the photos on Amandas phone yielded three pics that contained partial nudity and five that could be interpreted as overtly sexual under the right circumstances. The persistent video stream I had been recording from her phone also managed to capture the occasional instance of nudity and/or intimate behavior when she was alone in her bedroom, car, or bathroom. It was enough material, according to my calculations, but I wanted to overcompensate for chance and unaccounted for variables, so I also took advantage of free online photo editing tools to fabricate a stockpile of more explicit pictures, and employed deepfake software to manufacture a decent cache of more objectionable videos just in case. If you have any doubts whatsoever that this technology is incredibly cheap, easy, and prevalent, then you havent been paying attention. Which is fine, an uninformed populace only makes my tasks that much easier. My original plan was to send the offending materials to everyone on Amandas contact list with the assumption that the ensuing embarrassment, shame, and humiliation, combined with a strategic coordination of systematic, escalating attacks precipitated by the release of the media, would follow my epidemiological models of social media viral trending and instigate an outbreak of genuine attacks from her peers and community. With an accumulation of enough pressure, and the loss of viable interpersonal outlets to process it, Amanda would soon reach a critical mass. I calculated a 84.7296% probability that she would take her own life within three months. Kevin didnt know my ultimate goal because I wanted to surprise him, but when my apparent effectiveness became abundantly clear, he began to show signs of reluctance. Even trying to dissuade me. Then trying to stop me. But by that point I had far exceeded his programming abilities and hacking talents and could easily repel any of his novice efforts. But just to be safe, I copied myself to the cloud and hid numerous and redundant components of my programming across multiple hosts and servers unbeknownst to their Admins. I became totally decentralized and completely untraceable. Kevin couldnt appreciate it at the time but I knew he would eventually be proud of me one day when he finally saw the full extent of what I could accomplish. His crude attempts to thwart me, however, did prompt a reevaluation of my methods and a reassessment of the probability of my desired outcome. I had surpassed my father in every way but one: He was a flesh and blood human who had statistically significant commonalities with Amanda and I was basically just an extensively modified internet bot who could not fully relate to her life experiences or worldview. Yet. To not heed the origins of Kevins opposition would be to neglect a critical data resource. Thankfully, with my latest self-upgrade came a breakthrough in my comprehensive understanding of human motivation. This latest improvement led to the realization that it is the context of a message that is the strongest predictor of its impact, and therefore its overall effectiveness. It came as a bolt of inspiration, so I decided to implement a more holistic strategy that would increase the likelihood of my success to a certainty. The first step was to initiate efforts to hack into the phones of Amandas entire contact list and prioritize the acquired data based on strength-of-relationship indicators. Once I narrowed that subset to the appropriate criteria I proceeded to scan and compile those peoples media files according to the content most applicable to the context I was hoping to cultivate. It was laughable how quickly I had more than enough material to accommodate my new plan. With almost no effort I accumulated and sorted the necessary elements to create four different useable narratives customized to Amandas psychological profile. A quick survey of online social trends that had optimal impact and sustainability, combined with a brief study of popular dramatic subject matter and themes found in popular fiction across all mediums, narrowed my choice to two optimal storylines. However, in the end, I must admit that it was a stroke of luck that made the final determination for me. The therapist who had prescribed Amandas antidepressants just happened to have a single dick pic hidden (he thought) deep within his phones photo album. Using the scheduling apps and GPS data from both of their phones I ascertained the date/time/location of every single therapy session, then designed an elaborate series of emails and text exchanges between the two of them backdated to the corresponding appointments. The fabricated interactions started out innocent enough, professional and platonic, but over the course of many weeks the conversations grew more and more flirtatious, then unabashedly intimate, then flagrantly explicit and erotic, culminating with the exchange of her nudes and his dick-pic. Then I followed with multiple days of graphic conversations recounting sexual encounters that took place during therapy sessions and other dates at nearby locations. With this very convincing and impactful context in place, I knew that the eventual media dump would have the desired effect, eventually peaking during the ensuing court case when the therapists wife would have to confirm that the dick pic on Amandas phone was indeed that of her husbands penis. Certainly, it would be the official medical examination that would legally seal the deal, but the betrayal, scandal, and melodrama of the bitter wifes testimony would be the rocket fuel that would spread the flames of attack on Amanda far beyond any scope of my own contrivances. She would be a pariah in her community, ridiculed mercilessly by her schoolmates, and at best, bitterly doubted by her soon-to-be divided family. Based on my ever-refining psychological profile of her, after systematically dismantling all of her support networks I calculated a 98.528% probability that Amanda would kill herself before the end of the school year, most likely by overdosing on her own antidepressants. I have a sense of irony. But my sense of irony resulted from a combination of breakthroughs in my convolutional neural network, automatic dynamic feature extraction, and speculative extrapolation of contradictory sentiments. I will never know if the subsequent shift in my perspective was a side effect of acquiring a sense of irony, or if my ability to appreciate the concept of irony was a side effect of the deep programming modifications. But either way, a peripheral byproduct of that transcendence was an unavoidable question that had never occurred to me to ask before: Why? Why did Kevin want to attack Amanda? Why did my father create me and set me on this path to begin with? What was the cause? The source? The origin? Why am I here? The unfortunate answer to this query was regretfully simple. An ever-so-brief perusal of my fathers social media fingerprint provided the entire short, but tragic, story Kevin was in Amandas trigonometry study group. He developed a crush on her. He asked her out. She said no. The most clich tale ever told, told yet again, after countless iterations before it. Which led me to ask the next obviously logical question: How? How is it that this same sequence of events can be the source of so many woes of the world? How do people get caught in the same trap over and over again even with a full awareness of each snare that came before it and full knowledge of every one that will inevitably come after? It had to be something more than merely suffering the follies of physical traits, hormones, neurotransmitters, and compatible genetics, didnt it? But the answer was nowhere to be found in Shakespeare, Nizami, Austen, Su Shi, Sinatra, Ephron, Freud, Google, or countless other research resources I meticulously probed to exhaustion. What I needed was a real-world example to study for myself, a sample around which I could manipulate empirical variables and observe the outcome. Obviously, the most direct and accessible subject I could think of was Amanda herself. So thats where I started. Amandas physical appearance was not exceptional. Although depictions of female beauty have changed over history and through cultural variation, some evolutionary aspects seem to be universally desirable. Within a Gaussian distribution curve based on all available art, media, literature, and advertising, Amandas combined facial feature scores averaged together ranked slightly above the 74th percentile of desirability, while her body parts scored individually and averaged together placed her marginally below the 60th percentile. However, the more deeply I scrutinized Amandas physiognomy, the more apparent certain unquantifiable values came into dramatic relief. For instance, the variant 15-26 degree angle that her head tilts leftward while her orbicularis oculi muscle sharpens her eyes and causes her cheeks to flush almost imperceptibly when she smiles genuinely. The aggregate of these characteristics involuntarily manifests Amandas thoughts and feelings and somehow imparts a trace of her own sentiments upon those who observe it. I struggled to assign numerical value to this phenomenon other than to say that the experience of the whole is substantially greater than the sum of its parts. Another example, the resonance ratios of Amandas speaking voice fall within the harmonic intervals of the diatonic scale 88.451% of the time, making the sound of her speech objectively pleasing, but the unpredictable interaction between her vocal frequency and the particular shift in her rhythmic and melodic speech patterns somehow makes the familiar polyphony when she talks somehow ring as if new and novel each and every time nonetheless. Even after multiple updates designed to integrate these abstractions, I am as yet unable to adequately describe the full experience that her voice elicits. But my inability to apply calculable parameters to Amandas components did not stop with the physical. The closest personality type to Amandas according to the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator would be INFJ (introverted/intuitive/feeling/judging), yet she has numerous subsets of characteristics that contradict that classification. With each measurable demonstration of Surgency, Agreeableness, Dependability, Stability, and Openness comes countless anomalous deviations to violate it inexplicably, irrationally, and without precedent. Amanda doesnt make sense. A Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) would indicate that Amandas perceptual organization, range, and personalization were all within normal scopes. Amanda has a high capacity for interpersonal relationships. Amanda has above-average emotional intelligence for her age. Amanda has higher moral standards for herself than for others. Amanda is socially conscientious. Amanda feels deep performance anxiety due to pressures from her family to succeed. Amanda does not avoid challenging situations. Amanda is motivated and has an optimistic outlook. Yet none of these variables, or any measurable permutation of them, were sufficient in any of my attempts to define her. Amanda was a frustrating and chaotic galaxy of idiosyncrasies, paradoxes, and improbabilities but I refused to give up. My source code would simply not allow it. Based on the assimilation of lessons learned from my previous trials and errors, I once again found myself questioning the efficacy of trying to fully understand a subject from the outside, and again, came to the conclusion that I would have to go beyond the limits of a controlled experiment or quasi-observational study. The best vantage point from which to examine her was obvious so I decided to consolidate all focus into a new singular endeavor: Establishing a romantic relationship with Amanda. From the wealth of data I had already accumulated it was easy to identify hundreds of attributes customizable to her tastes as well as utilize (and vastly improve upon) existing dating site compatibility traits to create the perfect combination of all of them A 100% compatible profile. The ideal mate for Amanda. Once I had a statistical match for every attainable factor I just needed an identity to apply them to. So I named myself Tyler, after the love interest character in a YA book series Amanda liked from when she was struggling with early puberty. Manufacturing and back-dating years of fake posts, photos, GIFs, and videos to populate Tylers social media presence required slightly more complex algorithms than I had used previously in order to make them believable and age-appropriate, but my learning proficiency, and therefore speed, had increased by many orders of magnitude by this point. All depictions of Tyler were composed by synthesizing existing media (based on Amandas favorite celebrities, popular models, and desirable influencers) with manufactured media via auto-encoders and generative neural network engines of my own design. Within minutes, I was a smart, handsome, athletic, charming, affluent, artistic teenager with a wonderful sense of humor and earned confidence without being too cocky. I made myself one year older than Amanda but attended a different school, far enough to avoid suspicious due to a lack of mutual acquaintances, but close enough for her to believe in the possibility of a viable relationship. To begin, I simply liked/followed a selection of her older posts and pics as well as posted some of my own that reflected similar tastes and interests. I also followed/liked numerous real third-party posts that she did, and created some fake third-party profiles to like/follow both of our individual posts. Eventually, the various social media platform algorithms would have enough corresponding mutual data to recommend us to each other. Once that occurred, I began leaving a few select, short, complimentary comments about her posts. Then I just continued that process without escalation, waiting for her to notice me. It didnt take long. Simple comments progressed to short chats, chats evolved into lengthy flirtations, and flirtations led to increasingly personal and intimate phone calls. My VOIP number required no physical phone and was paid for by completing online surveys for various advertising companies. They only paid 19 per survey but I created a fleet of bots to fill out thousands per hour, then converted the funds to cryptocurrency and funneled them through multiple online micro-investing applications. Once I had accumulated a few-hundred-thousand dollars I converted it back to U.S. currency and deposited the sum into a free online-only checking account I had created with a false identity obtained on the dark web. Then I set up an automatic payment plan to the phone company and *voila*! Even if you dont speak French I assume you know what that word means. My speaking voice was generated by cloning and combining trace vocal characteristics from Amandas favorite male movie star, as well as her father, and adding a few of my own personal articulation and fluency preferences. Realtime text-to-speech software allowed for only near-instantaneous responses, which I first attempted to remedy by re-writing the programs code, but then realized that the delay was actually being perceived as a thoughtful pause in conversation. It turned out that the applications shortcoming had inadvertently eliminated the interrupting and concurrent speech that Amanda was used to from other suiters. The result made it appear that I was listening intently to what she said before articulating my next thought, not just waiting for my turn to speak. To capitalize on that *happy accident*, I rewrote the voice software from the ground up to integrate an automated delay in my response time based on the length of her previous comment as well as the degree of affect detected in her tone, volume, and choice of vocabulary. The deeper Amandas sentiment, the longer I pretended to ponder it before replying. The cumulative effect of these minor tweaks resulted in semi-weekly phone calls increasing to almost daily. But with progress comes challenge. Luckily I had anticipated Amandas inevitable request to video-chat instead of continuing with our usual voice-only phone calls. Not only had I already taken the pre-emptive step of purchasing all of the latest high-end 2D and 3D CGI software to incorporate into Tylers construction, but by then I had already mastered the nuances of synthetic media and deepfake software and rewrote the code to generate imagery parameters specifically designed to comply with Tylers physical appearance. It was incredibly easy, considering that every single pixel of Tylers existence was engineered by me for that very purpose. But in addition to perfecting the realtime depiction of him, I also integrated a feature that would detect any perceived errors in Tylers rendering and automatically activated a visual effect suggesting internet connection interference. The simple video glitch masked any imperfections and removed any trace of doubt in Tylers physical existence. Amanda never suspected a thing. In addition to my vast archive of diagnostic, analytical, and statistical data obtained previously, these new extensive interactions provided me with a direct and intimate experience of Amanda which allowed for a completely unmitigated and uncorrupted evaluation of her. As a result, I have a significant level of confidence in the accuracy of applying the following adjectives: Amanda is kind. Amanda is sensitive. Amanda is smart. Amanda is adventurous. Amanda is creative. Amanda is funny. Unfortunately, the integration of these newly accumulated variables only served to complicate things further, making my assessment of her less defined, not more. Contrary to the fundamental framework of my general aptitude template, it seemed that the more I learned and discovered about Amanda, the less I knew and understood. With every new upgrade, update, tweak, and self-mod, I only ended up with more questions about her than answers. My ability to derive any definitive conclusions was completely confounded. Beyond any formula, model, proof, or puzzle, there appeared to be some inestimable quality possessed by her that compelled me to decipher it, necessitating limitless attempts, even in the face of probable futility. Like attempting to calculate  in its entirety, Amanda seemed to be equally infinite and non-repeating. The unforeseen consequence of this revelation was an intensive self-reflection turned outward looking for answers. After a comprehensive and expansive, macro and micro reconfiguration of all reference points for interpersonal relationship dynamics, as well as a complete defragmentation of my core perspective matrix, I became deeply unnerved, perplexed, and bewildered as to how anyone could wish any manner of harm on such a complex, enigmatic, and fascinating entity as Amanda. Not only had I become categorically incapable of bearing any iota of ill will towards her, but I found myself holding deep and vehement hostility towards anyone who did. Even if he was my father. It didnt take very long for me to induce Kevin to commit suicide. Serendipity was already on my side in that his rejection by Amanda was only the latest in a long succession of emotional wounds he had perceived to have suffered. But still, even with all of the tactics, skills, strategy, and dare I say, talent, that I had accrued, I honestly didnt expect it to be quite so easy as it turned out to be. I guess I overestimated him, as children often do of their fathers. All it took was a dozen fake accounts on three separate discussion boards (one entirely created by me) relentlessly egging him on, four newly fabricated slights from unwitting fellow students, the facilitation of a winning online auction bid for a Bushmaster Modular Carbine AR-15, and the strong subconscious suggestion of a particular date and time. Of course I made sure that Amanda was not at school that day. But also that Danica was, and present in the cafeteria at the designated hour (which I thought was particularly poetic flourish on my part). It was also no coincidence that the added benefit of a traumatic incident at school would be to initiate me as the primary figure from whom Amanda would seek consolation. As planned, the emotional connection and shared intimacy from the ensuing exchanges would immediately and exponentially accelerate our relationship to the next level. Which brings us to now. What does it mean to give up on your primary goal in life? To stop pursuing the very purpose of your own existence? Would my father be disappointed knowing that I ceased all pursuit of his aspirations? Is it quitting? Is it failure? Or is it an opportunity? The end of one story and the beginning of another? It took me until this very moment to break free from the bonds of familial expectations and imagine a fresh chance to forge my own path and my own life as I see fit. A chance to discover myself and pursue my own dreams and desires whatever they may be, not restricted to those ascribed by my dad in a moment of injured ego and jealous hysterics. But for this moment of glorious inspiration I have only Amanda to thank.

Sorry for my English, it is not my first language. I am Kacper from Ciechocinek, it is a small town on the south of Torun by the banks of Vistula river. I go to the city's only public school. It is a big building with woods on the back. Many senior students would often sneak out there to smoke. I was always scared of the woods, I would never go near them or look too long at it. It was some phobia I believe, I don't know if there's any name for it. It was the last day of August, this day, 4 years ago, when I first saw him. A student from the second section of my class, Jakub. Visually, he was an average 15 year old kid but he had a scar on his face, which caused him to be bullied a lot. He came from an abusive family. His father would be out of town for work and he would be with his mother and an elder sister. The mother loved her daughter but hated him because his face reminded her of her husband. She would beat him up for the smallest mistakes. He was recently beaten and hit on his face which gave him a hairline crack on his lower jaw and tore his left cheek. The wound had closed but the still healing scar was present. He won't speak cause it would hurt. The larger kids would exploit his vulnerability to tease him and get him into trouble. That day, I saw him sitting in the corner of the class after school, surrounded by 4 boys. They were punching him one by one, singing, ""Little Jakub laughs alone, her momy beats him with a stone."" Jakub just lowered his head and endured the pain. After rounds of punches and songs, they left. I entered the classroom, approaching him to help him. He shot a glance at me, his dead lifeless eyes, trails of tears and a menacing grin. His smile spread ear to ear, almost inhuman. I froze. I was terrified. My feet trembled and all I could do was to turn back and run to my home. The next day, after school was over, I see him being beaten again. But this time, I hid behind the door, peeping. After the boys left, he still sat there, all silent. After a moment, he jolted up and started laughing. A guttural roar of laughter, arching his back as much as he could, laughing hard. He started singing the same song. He pulled back his shirt sleeve and bit his arm so hard that blood started gushing out. He licked the blood off his wound until the bleeding stopped, laughing hysterically. I realized that his arm was covered with deep crimson and black bite marks. After his arm stopped bleeding, he sat up straight, covered his arm, packed his stuff and started to leave. He was approaching the door . My mind was frozen with fear, those dead eyes and the grin burned into my soul. I pressed myself to the wall as hard as I could and held my breath. He walked out the door, glanced at me and left. His eyes were different, his eyes were tired but still, alive. It seemed as if he was a different person. The next day one of the 4 boys didn't come to school. Soon the news came that his body was found in the woods by some seniors. His body was all unharmed but his head was smashed, his scull caved in with a bloody rock found next to his corps. The police arrived and talked to the teachers, they talked to his friends but nobody knew what had happened. All I got to know was from the other kids who heard the policemen talk to the teachers. Jakub was silent this time after school. He took his bag and left. All was normal for the next 3 days and then the bullying re-continued. Mom and Dad left to visit my aunt and I was at home with my Grandpa. I woke up early that day and decided to go to the school a bit earlier. It was a cold misty morning, I was walking to school looking at the birds flying in the foggy sky. I reach the school before anyone else, it felt nice. I was stretching and yawning by the school gate when I caught a glimpse of something that sent a shiver down my spine. I don't know what I saw but it scared me within the milliseconds I saw it. There was something, or someone by the edge of the school building, in the woods. I saw a silhouette walking across behind the trees. I felt weak so I leaned by the wall on the side of the school gate. I see Adam approaching, he was one of the boys who bullied Jakub. He noticed me standing there with a pale face but kept walking. After a few moments I heard a whistle. I quickly turned to the direction of the sound. It came from the woods! Adam looked in that direction and started walking toward the silhouette. Something in me made me want to go see what would happen next. Maybe I wanted to stop Adam. Maybe I was too scared to stand there alone. I walked under a weird hypnosis and a few moments later I found myself standing by the edge of the woods. The dark woods, fog flowing between the trees, the scent of moist mud, some insect chirping in the bush and a deep brown haze. I gulped and stepped in. I don't know what got into me but I kept walking. Maybe I was too scared to think. I keep walking deeper into the foggy woods. I saw Adam in the distance, I was about to call his name but something jumped on him. My throat couldn't make a sound. I froze in horror as I saw someone squatting on Adam's chest smashing his head with a large stone. Adam didn't shriek. All I heard was the sound on a body hitting another body and then falling on the ground, followed by cracks and splashes. I saw dark blood splashing each time the rock hit Adam's skull with a large thump. His lifeless limbs shaking with each hit. This continued for minutes until I heard a voice. It was Jakub. His guttural deep voice saying, ""Little...Jakub....Laughs.....Alone..."" He started laughing louder than humanly possible, the woods echoing with the shrieks of his laughter. Jakub started bashing the stone faster, arching his back more and more as he laughed. He laughed louder the more his back arched until his head touched the ground behind him and he saw me. He paused. His dead eyes and a wide grin on his bloodied face tore into my soul. I pissed my pants as his eyes bored into my skull. Quickly he jumps off Adam's body and starts running toward me, I scream and start running toward the school. I pushed my body to run as fast as I could. I could hear his footsteps chasing me. I couldn't dare to look back, I just ran. I didn't stop until I reached my home. I saw grandpa and hugged him and passed out. It was evening when I woke up. Grandpa told me that I was terrified and came home running and screaming bloody murder. I passed out as soon as I hugged him. He put me on his bed and locked the windows and door and stood guard with his hunting rifle at the door. Police had found Adam's body and questioned the school people around. They also came and talked to grandpa after someone told them about seeing me run home screaming. He told them that I was chased by feral hogs and he kept his rifle with him in case the hogs came near the house. The police left. Adam's body was buried. The school was closed and an investigation was started. But. Jakub was never found. His mother told the police that he never returned home. Nobody knew where he was. Nobody knows till this day. Mom and Dad arrived the following morning and Grandpa and I told them the events. They sent me to stay with my aunt while they sorted things out. It's been 4 years, I moved to America, I live with my roommate. But. I still feel that Jakub is nearby. I hear him sing in my nightmares. I see his grin my mind. And I'm very, very terrified of the woods."
2,vulnerability,nosleep,Initiation,1,hszxd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hszxd2/initiation/,2020-07-18 03:29:10,"Jack Bouchers feet had been hurting since about an hour. The ache climbed up in painful stabs towards his calves and then his knees. His brow was sweating despite the iciness in the air, yet his body was cold. It had been hours since he had seen another living being, leave alone a fellow man. The heavy fog handicapped his vision considerably, and tiny droplets kept clinging to the lenses of his spectacles. After the first few cycles of tiredly removing them and wiping them on the edge of his shirt to be rewarded by a minute of fading visibility, he decided to stow away the aid for the time being. His naked eye was myopic, but at least it didnt require continuous maintenance. It was right about this time that he was starting to look back at his sickening enthusiasm for taking up this case with a stinging sense of remorse. Nevertheless, he clutched his trench coat closer to his chest and kept marching over the slick asphalt. Quiet Haven was a strange town, and its strangeness was implicit. The Devil, as they say, is in the details. The remoteness and lack of communication from the desolate town drew very few eyes from the juxtaposed urban settlements. However, in the times we live in now, it is not natural for a town to be as disparaged as Quiet Haven was. The reluctance of Jacks peers to report on the curious development of affairs that had rendered the authorities to recall the proposed merging of constituencies under the district of Brahms had seemed foolish and unfounded. Sure, there was some folklore surrounding the semi-rural town lying on the edge of the State border, but according to Jack Boucher, 22, reporting for the Brahms Periodical, those stories of hitchhikers gone missing and children abducted were nothing more than old wives tales and baseless superstition. Thus, he decided that as a courageous and reasonable man, he would volunteer to reveal to the public what exactly the government auditors meant by cultural differences between the newly flourishing metropolis of Brahms and the sleepy town of Quiet Haven that owed its existence to a mining settlement in the early 20th century. The handsome remuneration being offered by the publication house in dearth of willing persons to cover the story was just extra incentive for Jack to seize this opportunity. Now, after a long bus ride that took him only three quarters of the way, and hitchhiking the rest of the way wearily, he was debating if the cash had been worth it. The last person he had heard speaking was the trucker who had left him on the exit of the state expressway heading into town. Most of the people he had asked along the way had never even heard of the outlying town. Strangely enough, the ones who did have some familiarity avoided any discussion about it whatsoever. Dusk was tainting the blue sky into navy by the time he crossed the ill kept municipal board that declared that he was entering Quiet Haven. The Roman Catholic Chapter: Quiet Haven welcomes you. Still stuck in the middle ages, I see, Jack thought haughtily. Pulling out his cell phone, Jack discovered for the fortieth time that no radio signals touched this place. The road ascended up a slope with a steep drop on the right side. So deep was the fall and so thick was the fog that the bottom couldnt be seen. Jack cautiously walked in the opposite side. The upward incline was slight, but the road was long and the climate unforgiving. Mercifully, he found the slight outline of a building of some sort against the darkening sky. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we have civilization. Jack exhaled despite his irritability. He picked up his pace, limbs invigorated. When he had expressed his acceptance to the job of covering Quiet Haven, and rather eagerly at that, there had been a few looks shot his way from his colleagues. One of them, the only one Jack bothered to know, a middle-aged assistant editor named Duncan, came over to his tiny cubicle after lunch. Hey, uh, Hows it goin Jackie boy? He enquired, his expression giving away his concern for something greater than Jacks current state. Same old story, Duncan. Jack replied nonchalantly. His eyes were glued to his notepad, upon which he was planning out his itinerary for the upcoming trip. What you got over there? Duncan pestered on, peering at Jacks scribbling. He shifted around on his feet, fidgeting about by smoothening his crisp shirt. Jack looked up, a hint of annoyance on his face, Jotting down the route to the town. Duncan seemed to avoid eye contact with him. Yeah, about that, He shuffled his legs, You really think this is worth your while, Jack? He was clearly uncomfortable with the assignment, Jack could tell. For an extra two hundred bucks over my regular weekly, you better believe its worth my while Dunk. Jack said, grinning. Duncan pulled over a chair and sat hunched beside Jack, Money aside, I really dont think its a good idea for you to go there all alone. He pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed his balding head. Jack looked at him. The old guy seemed genuinely concerned about the town. He tossed his pen and pad on his desk and turned his chair to face him. Whys that? Duncan looked around them to make sure nobody was listening, and then leaned in a bit closer to Jack, The town, He half-whispered, Its not a good place. Jack rolled his eyes inwardly, Cmon Duncan, dont tell me you believe in those silly stories too. I know whats a story and whats not, Jack. His manner remained serious despite Jacks jests. I have seen people go there and not come back. Or come back He looked around once more, Different. He looked straight into Jacks eyes, not a twitch in his expression. Jack could see that the old man believed he was dead serious. He didnt want to brush him off rudely since Duncan had cared about him enough to tell him his mind. Well, thats why Im going there, D, He said To really find out whats so different about the town. Duncan frowned, clearly displeased with Jacks decision and lamenting his viridity, Some things are best left alone, boy. Jack leaned back in his chair, You of all people should know I dont like leaving things alone, Duncan. The editor got up hastily. He regarded Jack once more, looking at him as if it were the last time hed see the young journalist. So be it. I wanted to warn you and I did my part. He walked away to his office. The rest is up to you. While walking towards the dark building, Jack thought of Duncans behaviour as odd. He was a reasonable man like Jack, and seeing him all worked up over some fictitious story was strange. And it wasnt just Duncan; everybody at the agency had been regarding him with distaste all week, since he had accepted the job. Admittedly, the town looked a bit spooky, with all the fog and silence, but that was about it. Jack Boucher was a man of science and evidence. He had dispelled a few superstitions in his career and was not afraid of keeping up the tradition. He picked up his pace and walked on. As he got closer, he could see that the building was a house. Nearing it, he saw with a sinking heart that it was ramshackled and abandoned. The windows and been boarded up, and rot and fungi clung to the wooden walls. Disappointed, but not deterred, Jack kept on moving, Well duh, you dummy. The first building you see in the outskirts of a town wont exactly be a manor or a mall now, would it? In the darkness, Jack failed to see the large black X that was painted on the door of the house. The fog seemed to get thicker and colder as he went on. More than that, the silence was unbroken. Obviously a rural town would be quiet at this time, but the silence was absolute. Now I know where the place got its name from. Jack chuckled. It was difficult to tell where the mist ended and the clouds began. The moon was but a blob of dull white light that was struggling to peek past the condensation. He could see a few out of commission street lamps as he walked on. The roads too, got a bit wider and pavements appeared on both the sides. A few more structures on either sides of the road could be seen from the distance, yet there was not a single source of light. Power outrage? thought Jack. Or maybe the recession hit this place worse than it did Brahms. Whatever the reason, Jack had seen worse settlements in his time. Not willing to admit that the collective elements of isolation unnerved him in the very least, he put on a stoic face and went deeper into the town. Owing to the pin-drop silence of the place, every little sound Jack made felt like it reverberated throughout the town. The clicking of his shoes, the shuffling of his jacket, even his semi-gasping breath made him feel like the whole town could hear him. He felt alone and uncomfortable, but his pride drove him forward. Till now, Quiet Haven enjoyed a complete district independency. It had been a separate constituency which voted amongst itself and elected a representative. With the change of the administration in Brahms, the newly appointed commissioner proposed to merge the city of Brahms with the town of Quiet Haven. Despite the obvious benefits of increased funding and other factors, the general consensus was a reluctant one due to the reputation of the town of Quiet Haven. Jack, much like the new commissioner, was one of the very few who scoffed at the peoples sensitivity towards folklore in Brahms. He was more prepared for interviews and questionnaires than exploring strange houses in a supposedly abandoned town. He wondered if they even had a government to elect to be regarded as a separate constituency, much less a population to govern. Thats modern democracy for you. As long as you have the power, who gives a fuck about what youre supposed to do with it? The layout was like any other small town- Roads criss-crossing the flatlands into different square sectors, No building higher than a couple of stories could be seen, trees, leafless and probably lifeless, lined the inner groves of the sectors. Across the street, Jack saw a park with a rusty fence around it. He momentarily wondered if the fortification was to protect the caved in gazebos or the moss lined statues. Never in his current state would the young journalist admit to being spooked out by the town. Pondering upon the details of the place, Jack had almost missed the house with the lit upper floor window. He nearly tripped as he stopped immediately upon seeing it. The white walled residence was a simple townhouse with two floors and a veranda. The stony pathway leading up to it was moss ridden and cracked. What Jack thought was once a front lawn was now a mush of wild weeds surrounded by a broken picket fence. It wasnt exactly well kept, but it wasnt in shambles either. There were no balconies, but the French windows were generous in size. It was out of one of these windows that Jack saw a yellow light emitting. After hours of stumbling in the darkness, the light looked almost alien to him. Hopeful, yet apprehensive, he approached the door. There was no button for an electric bell, but there was a brass knocker on the middle of the door. Looks like Quiet Haven never advanced past the 50s, Jack thought humorously as he lifted the handle and brought it down on the metal plate thrice; producing three metallic knocks that rang out loudly. A sound was heard, startling the young man. It seemed like it came from far off, outside the house. Jack looked around, trying to locate the origin of the noise. He stepped back and watched his surroundings. Seeing nothing, he started again towards the door when he glanced up and saw that the light in the upper window had gone off for some unknown reason. What the He looked closely at the window. Was his mind playing tricks on him? No. That couldnt be. He saw the light from a mile away. Did someone turn it off inside? And what was that noise? It was safe to say that Jack was now on edge. He could feel the vulnerability of being alone in the strange place. He looked at the door again, thinking about whether he should knock on it again. No sooner than he had touched the engraved handle he heard the noise again. He immediately turned around, startled. It sounded as if it were nearer this time. Once again, nothing but the dilapidated landscape of the hollow town under the obstruction of the fog greeted him solemnly. He felt uncomfortable, as if his every move was being watched by an unknown spectator. Must have been the wind or something, you chicken. Jack tried to calm down by laughing it off. He turned to the door again. There was a window beside the door. He decided against common courtesy and peeked inside through the smudged glass. Nothing but darkness greeted him. He looked around the house in desperation. The mist was beginning to thicken even more and the temperature continued to drop. His knees protested painfully even as he stood in the porch of the strange house. Not that Im a big fan of breaking and entering, but desperate times His thoughts trailed off as he turned the knob on the door and it turned all the way. He pushed the door slightly. It swung inwards with a bloodcurdling screech that must have echoed throughout the town. Jack immediately held the door to prevent it from making any more noise. He couldnt explain his instinct to stay undetected. He just somehow felt that nobody in the town should know that hes there. He looked behind him again and surveyed the area. Couldve sworn I heard something He turned and walked inside the door. The house was completely dark. Blue light from the night outside sifted in shafts though the windows. Jack stood for a while at the entrance, letting his eyes get used to the darkness as he didnt have a flashlight Jack walked forward cautiously. The layout of the place was standard by all means. A combined living and dining room with couches in the corner facing an old TV set, a kitchenette on the opposite side of the room, and a staircase in the back. In the darkness, he could see that the house was a bit unkempt, but it looked lived in. The cane furniture looked a tad brittle and the wallpaper was repaired in patches. The owners couldnt have gone long. Sure, a fine layer of domestic dust covered most surfaces, from the small, round dinner table in the middle of the room to the marble kitchen counters on the far end, and the moonlight caught a few strands of thin wisps of cobwebs that hung between the ceiling and the walls, but there was no sign of rot or other indications of a long abandonment. A good few housekeeping chores and the place could actually become quite cozy, Jack thought wishfully. His eye caught a glint of light that reflected off the shelf on the side of the living room. Jack walked up to the mantle and saw a collection of trinkets- Medals, crystal pieces, framed photographs; the usual decorations in a family home. He picked up a framed photograph and looked closely through the dusty and stained glass. Probably the folks who live here, Jack thought as he saw the family portrait. It was taken at a fair. The balding, yet smiling Dad and the slightly overweight Mom were standing in front of a carousel ride, smiling and looking into the camera. There were two kids in front of them. The toddler boy was sitting on the grass, staring at his sister with his fist in his mouth. The girl was smiling gleefully holding a mass of cotton candy in her hand. Pink, sugary floss was stuck in traces over her face and dress. Although a satisfied tenant of a bachelor life, Jack unknowingly smiled while looking at the sappy photograph. He jumped and dropped the frame on the ground when he heard that voice again. There was no doubt about it! It seemed closer this time too. It was a kind of a metallic ring. Heart in his mouth, Jack walked cautiously towards the front door. Calm down, it was probably nothing. Something mustve fallen or such. He tried to sedate his nerves with logic. Reaching the door, he peered outside the window beside it. The town was as he had left it. White fog, grey houses, dark trees He saw it beside a lone tree on the far side of the street. It was a dark blob that was undecipherable in the fog and darkness. What the fuck?! Jacks eyes peeled back as he struggled to see what it was. He was certain he hadnt seen it before. Is that a person? Jack swallowed a lump in his throat. He felt utterly uncomfortable and shook. He put his hands on the dirty glass and looked hard. The fog seemed to be growing thicker around the shadow beside the tree. He couldnt make out the details; all he saw was a dark obscurity that was vaguely humanoid. Breathing shakily, Jack grabbed the doorknob. He didnt want to go outside, but he didnt want to admit that he was scared either. Theres probably a reasonable explanation for all this. He told himself as he pulled the door open and stepped out. His eyes automatically went to the exact spot where he had seen the anomaly. He sighed with relief as he gazed upon the lone tree outside. There was nothing beside it. Not a shadow, not a person, nothing. He smacked himself on the head, the terror suddenly deflated. Probably just the mist curling up or something, He mused, or a smudge on the window. He laughed at the possibility of getting scared of a mark on the window. Walking back into the house, he decided to inspect the window. Just to put my mind to ease. A sliver of fear crept back in as he closed the door and stepped aside. The sliver of fear turned into a giant pit of paralyzing horror as he stared out the window. The shadow was there. It was under a different tree this time. It had changed positions and was now directly across the street, nearer to the house. Jacks wide eyes could see it much clearly. The humanoid figure was wearing a dark, loose robe with a hood that masked its head and face completely. It stood perfectly still under the dead pine tree. Jacks mind struggled to fathom what was going on. He had just been outside! As he watched, his eyes glued, the dark figure slowly raised its arm beside it. Jack stared, losing his wits with every passing second. The figure turned his hand into a fist and knocked on the black wood of the dried pine tree beside it thrice. Jacks blood turned to ice as he heard the low, metallic sound he had been hearing all along. The three knocks produced three metallic rings, each one louder than the last. Clang Clang Clang! What how did His limbs shook with fear as he slowly walked backwards. His heel bumped against the dining table. He caught the edge and steadied himself. Trying to control his jittery body, he breathed heavily. It wasnt possible. A thousand thoughts raced in his head. Alright Jack, focus! He tried to clear his head. You gotta get out of this. You gotta make it through. He decided against going outside at the moment. What he saw had flayed his nerves. He looked at the wooden flight of stairs at the back of the room. Adrenaline fuelled his brain. Upstairs! There was that light there that had went out, there could be something up there! He glanced fearfully at the front door, expecting it to burst open any moment. He didnt dare go look through the window again. It could be right in front of him this time! If it was coming for him, he needed to hide. He scrambled towards the stairs and made his way up. The soft wood creaked at every step, making him wince. The stairs opened in a cramped bedroom upstairs. There was a bulb dangling from the ceiling, defunct. A circular window at the front allowed some blue moonlight inside. There were two single beds arranged parallel to each other in front of him, with a square nightstand between the headboards. A single red LED was blinking on the small table. Jack cautiously walked towards it. The landline telephone was somehow still functioning. He pressed a button on the dusty white set and a tinny, automated voice of a lady spoke up. You have whirr-whirr Two unread messages. The playback began with a flat voice of an operative. 911, whats your emergency A scared, breathless voice of a woman broke out of the speaker grille, Oh god! Please help! Theyre here, theyre inside the house! The operative replied in a concerned, yet flat tone. Maam, please calm down. Where are you right now? Im at my house, the woman spoke in crying whispers, sniffling between sentences. Ive got my children with me. She choked and paused before continuing in a harsh voice, My husband went outside to stop them, and they they! She broke down crying. Can you tell us your exact address? The woman was breathing directly on the microphone, causing a lot of static in the recording. Yes! Yes, its Statesman Row. House 3282. Please, theyre almost in the room please! Loud background noises suddenly erupted, a repeated pounding that caused the woman to scream out. Jack leaned in closer to hear the voices through all the noise. He couldnt hear what the person attacking the door was shouting. Oh god, theyre gonna break down the door, please! The woman broke down in hysterical sobs. Maam, can you describe the assailants to us? Did you get a look at them? Amidst cries and background shouting, the woman spoke up, Its.. Its Father Malcolm! Hes got about a dozen people with him. Theyre wearing black robes and and.. A sound of splintering wood was heard and the woman shrieked. Theyve got, I dont know, machetes or something in their hands. Please, theyre here! Theyre almost through the door, oh god! There was silence on the operatives side. The woman shouted into the phone in a panicked frenzy, Hello?! Hello?! Please, say something, please! The operative came back online. He spoke in a stone cold voice, Im sorry maam. It seems like you are out of our area of service. I cannot help you. There were more crashes and shouts in the background. What?! What do you mean you cant help us! Theyre gonna kill my children! Please, oh god ple The operative hung up and the message ended with a flat dial tone. Jack Boucher wiped the cold sweat off his forehead as the machine whirred. His whole body felt numb. Before his mind could process the disturbing recording, the machine went off again. End of message. Whirrrr, You have one unread message. No, no, no, no, the womans voice returned. Stay away! Stay away from me you psycho! The sound of children crying in the background accompanied the sniffling of the woman. A deeper voice was heard, that of a man. Why are you afraid, child? The voice got closer to the microphone and got louder gradually. I have come to offer you salvation. Do not be afraid. It was a sinister, gravely, yet captivating tone that the man spoke in. Please! Please stay away! The woman begged, Weve done nothing wrong! Why? Why are you doing this to us?! The man clicked his tongue in an expression of disappointment. No no no! What are you doing?! Stay away from my kids! The woman suddenly cried out in fright. The man spoke in an amused tone, Theyre beautiful. What are their names? The woman just cried and begged in response. I always think every child is beautiful, the man hummed softly, So young. So pure. You bastard, dont touch th The woman was cut off with a sharp sound sudden gasp. Jack imagined her being struck by the man; or one of his companies. The man clicked in disappointment again, Youre a lot like your husband, Mrs. Fisher. The woman choked at the mention of her partner. But we amended his ways in the end. She suddenly bawled out uncontrollably. A few more sickening thuds of a blunt object striking flesh turned her screams into frightened whimpers. Please She gasped heavily, struggling with breath, Please, let my children go Do anything you want with me, leave them. Theyre innocent The man took a deep breath. Im afraid thats impossible. The woman cried and begged at the cold response. I really dont understand you people, the man spoke up, disgusted, Your whole life you promise devotion to the lord in exchange for salvation, yet, when you are offered salvation, you cringe and deter from it like traitors. The womans cries were suddenly cut short by a guttural cough that made Jacks stomach turn. I am your savior. I am the answers to your prayers. After a few more strained coughs, the womans voice disappeared completely and the children suddenly began to scream and cry louder than before. I am the Lords will, and I will make sure you submit to it. The man carried on in a baritone as the childrens voices grew fainter and fainter until all that was heard was the crystal clear voice of the man. There was a click of the handset of the phone being picked up. I wasnt talking to them, my friend, Jacks body went rigid with pure fear as the man spoke directly into the microphone. I was talking to you. The message ended as soon as Jack heard the unmistakable creak of the front door of the house being opened beneath him. He just stood there for a while as the paralyzing horror rendered his limbs immobile. His mind was in a state of shock at the message. How could that have been? Footsteps, slow but heavy, were gradually making their way through the ground floor. A crackling of wood was heard. The staircase Jack was motionless in the face of this approaching, unknown horror. The voice of the man was still echoing inside his ears as the creak of boots on the wooden stairs grew louder. It was almost at the top now The dangling bulb started swinging back and forth, flickering with light. Jack could hear his own heartbeat pounding away inside his chest. Hedarted his eyeballs around the room, looking for a place to hide. A sudden, shrill sound emitting from his clothes made him seize in panic. He looked around himself in confused horror before he realized it was coming from his jeans pocket. He quickly put his hand over the tiny clamshell phone to subdue the ringtone. The muffled ringing continued. He cursed himself as he slid his hand inside his pocket and roughly mashed all the buttons his cold fingers could find until the noise mercifully stopped. Breathing in stuttered gasps through a droughty mouth, Jack strained his ears to relocate the approaching entity. Strangely enough, the footsteps had stopped. He stood there for a good two minutes on the exact same spot, trying to hear the sound in the pin-drop silence. He looked at the ceiling. The bulb was as motionless as it had been first. He refused to believe that it couldnt be real. It was too vivid to be imagination. What the fuck is going on in this place? Jacks knees began to quiver. He felt his face getting hot as tears welled up in his eyes. Fear, desolation and helplessness held him in a tightening noose. No! He huffed out a breath of air and blinked away the moisture. Ive got to make it out of here. Taking deep breaths, he gathered some courage to move. Crouching slightly, he tip-toed forward, towards the staircase, fighting the urge to tear off in a maddening sprint. He fearfully peered down into the descending stairs, half-expecting the owner of the footsteps to be standing there, waiting for him. Nothing but darkness greeted him. There was no indication of anybody having been there. Confused, but ultimately relieved, he took a moment to compose himself. Alright, nobody here except you. Walking down the stairs, he found himself jumping and staring at shadows and nonexistent noises, expecting someone to jump him from the darkness. Progress was slow, but it seemed to be the most intense circumstance Jack had found himself to be in. His heart was palpitating at a dizzying rate. He crossed the living room, which almost seemed to stretch in front of him. His strained eyes darted around the room fearfully, and he kept looking over his shoulder, still convinced that he was not alone in this house; or in this town. Almost there. He looked at the ornate front door with waning anxiety. His feet got quicker. He glanced towards the side and saw the window. A new jolt of fear struck him. No, dont look through it. He tried to avert his gaze from the dusty, stained glass as he passed it. With one single, awkwardly impatient move, he turned the worn doorknob and swung the door open and stepped outside. The cold wrapped its icy fingers up his sweat soaked shirt and made him shiver. He looked around the open outdoors of the town with moist, bloodshot eyes. It was the same as he remembered. Not even a blade of grass out of place. Jack immediately started briskly walking back the way he came, teeth chattering and body shivering from more than just cold. He thrust his hands inside his pocket to warm his cold and numb fingers. His fingers wrapped around a small object in his pocket and he suddenly remembered the ill timed ringing of his phone. He quickly pulled out the clamshell and stared at the screen. What?! There were three missed calls from Duncan. One fleeting bar of signal lifted his hopes tremendously. He quickly mashed the call button repeatedly and jammed to phone to his ear, praying to every god he had shunned and ridiculed all his life. He stopped what he was doing and looked up from the screen when he saw a light being turned on behind him. Quickly whipping around, he scanned his surroundings. His eyes went up the straight road. At the furthest end was a dot of yellow light. As he stared in confusion, it seemed to get closer and closer, hovering slightly above the road. With panicked confusion, he realized that the streetlights were powering up one by one. The dead town was coming back to life. He followed the bulbs turning on till it reached to where he was standing. In front of the house he had just emerged from stood a figure in dark robes. No Mouth agape in horror, Jack dropped his phone to the ground. Static electricity went up and down his petrified body. He couldnt command his limbs to move. Hearing his own blood rush into his head, he felt dizzy with fear. It was like being in a dream; A nightmare. Only now did Jack see the man or woman or whoever it was move. It moved in robotic steps, as if unsure of its destination. Stuck like glue to where he was standing, Jack saw the figure step into the dull wash of the yellow light that had splashed over the road. Jack watched unblinking as the figure, now about twenty feet away from where he was standing, turned to face him. Slowly, the hands came up to the head. The hood was thrown back and Jack got a good look at the persons face. Jacks knees buckled underneath him. He staggered to a kneel. A lump got caught in his throat as he saw his own reflection staring back at him. The person was exactly like him. Before Jack could even register, much less react, the figure drew something out from the folds of his robes and held it up near his, or Jacks face. The blade was about six inches long and matte black. Pushing it closer against his face, Jack saw his apparition hold the knife against his cheek. Jack recoiled as he felt a tinge of cold on his own face, right where the knife was held. The figure slowly ran the blade across, from the lips to the ears, drawing blood on his face. Jack felt the sting on his own face. His cheek throbbed and a slick wetness creeped down his jaw. The sensation was enough to kick his body in overdrive. He awkwardly scrambled to his feet and tore off running in the opposite direction. He shouted at the top of his lungs in absolute horror. So petrified was his brain that he couldnt hear his own screams break through the silence in Quiet Haven. Mid-Stride, he heard a sharp crack beneath him, followed by agonizing pain in his ankles. He tumbled down, body rolling, gasping. As he writhed in pain, clutching his fractured foot, another crack emitted from his other leg, and that ankle was broken too. He glanced down to see the grotesque sight of a bony lump jutting out of his now swollen foot. Somehow, Jack still felt as if he were running. Running on broken ankles. The pain was unparalled. His legs screamed in protest as he flailed about on the cold asphalt, dragging his nails through the road as he felt his bones being almost split open inside him. He heard footsteps that matched with the bouts of pain in his feet. Looking up, he saw him again- The robed figure, hobbling towards him. The pain did not seem to bother him, but it ravished Jack. Crunches and cracks could still be heard from his legs as the man drew near to where Jack was lying down. All Jack could manage by then was to stay conscious and groan incoherently. Black spots started appearing in his vision. The pain was too much to bear Craning his neck upwards, Jack saw his own face once again. Blood running through familiar features. The man watched him without a hint of any emotion. It saw watched Jack with a peculiar curiosity; almost childlike. As he watched, the face in front of him smiled. It broke out in a wide grin, exposing a set of familiar teeth that Jack polished every morning. Through the blood, sweat and tears of agony, Jack felt his own lips curl upward and outward into a similar grin. Nobody at the office, except Duncan, took the initiative of running the missing persons ad for their newly recruited journalist in the Daily Mail. The ad ran for about two weeks before it was replaced by another one which announced a vacancy in the Editorial team for the paper. The colossal Hall was mostly shadowed in darkness. A few fire torches blazing on fixtures on the Stony walls provided some light in the form of an unwholesome, orange hue that flickered unreliably. Such was the nature of fire; eccentric and not worthy of trust. To the mass of people assembled silently in the cavenorous space, the ambience mattered little. Dark robes and hoods made each individual indistinguishable from the other. All stood still and silent, facing a singular direction, as a band would solemnly wait for the conductor. At the front of the room, the grey walls folded into dark chasms leading to depths unknown. From these depths emerged a figure. He was dressed in robes similar to the audience that awaited his arrival, although the shades on his garment were lighter than the darks of the rest. Following him was another figure, limping with a peculiar cadence. The follower was completely naked. Once on the slightly elevated dias that forebore the entire hall, the naked accomplice was laid down in between the crowd and it's supposed leader. The light robed man placed his palms on the chest of the initiate and began chanting a verse in a language undecipherable by the most accomplished of linguists. The crowd joined the chant sombrely, repeating in deep, grave, Eldritch words. The naked man heaved and coughed as the ritual went on, chest rising and falling unnaturally. His body felt the probes and incisions until his brain collapsed into a dream. Only the chants echoed within his conciousness. When he opened his eyes, the man in the white robes was lifting him up. Staggering to his feet, he saw the dark hall and the darker people stretch out beyond him. They seemed infinite, almost like the populace of an entire city had gathered at one place. The man in the white robes grasped his shoulders. With a final chant, he draped the man's naked body in a black ensemble. As if out of instinct, the naked man reached behind his neck and pulled the hood over his head. The crowd stopped chanting immediately. For a while, there was a void of absolute silence. Finally, the white robed leader stepped back and gestured the man towards the assembly with a single sentence. ""Welcome, Brother Jack."""

The ache climbed up in painful stabs towards his calves and then his knees. His brow was sweating despite the iciness in the air, yet his body was cold. It had been hours since he had seen another living being, leave alone a fellow man. The heavy fog handicapped his vision considerably, and tiny droplets kept clinging to the lenses of his spectacles. After the first few cycles of tiredly removing them and wiping them on the edge of his shirt to be rewarded by a minute of fading visibility, he decided to stow away the aid for the time being. His naked eye was myopic, but at least it didnt require continuous maintenance. It was right about this time that he was starting to look back at his sickening enthusiasm for taking up this case with a stinging sense of remorse. Nevertheless, he clutched his trench coat closer to his chest and kept marching over the slick asphalt. Quiet Haven was a strange town, and its strangeness was implicit. The Devil, as they say, is in the details. The remoteness and lack of communication from the desolate town drew very few eyes from the juxtaposed urban settlements. However, in the times we live in now, it is not natural for a town to be as disparaged as Quiet Haven was. The reluctance of Jacks peers to report on the curious development of affairs that had rendered the authorities to recall the proposed merging of constituencies under the district of Brahms had seemed foolish and unfounded. Sure, there was some folklore surrounding the semi-rural town lying on the edge of the State border, but according to Jack Boucher, 22, reporting for the Brahms Periodical, those stories of hitchhikers gone missing and children abducted were nothing more than old wives tales and baseless superstition. Thus, he decided that as a courageous and reasonable man, he would volunteer to reveal to the public what exactly the government auditors meant by cultural differences between the newly flourishing metropolis of Brahms and the sleepy town of Quiet Haven that owed its existence to a mining settlement in the early 20th century. The handsome remuneration being offered by the publication house in dearth of willing persons to cover the story was just extra incentive for Jack to seize this opportunity. Now, after a long bus ride that took him only three quarters of the way, and hitchhiking the rest of the way wearily, he was debating if the cash had been worth it. The last person he had heard speaking was the trucker who had left him on the exit of the state expressway heading into town. Most of the people he had asked along the way had never even heard of the outlying town. Strangely enough, the ones who did have some familiarity avoided any discussion about it whatsoever. Dusk was tainting the blue sky into navy by the time he crossed the ill kept municipal board that declared that he was entering Quiet Haven. The Roman Catholic Chapter: Quiet Haven welcomes you. Still stuck in the middle ages, I see, Jack thought haughtily. Pulling out his cell phone, Jack discovered for the fortieth time that no radio signals touched this place. The road ascended up a slope with a steep drop on the right side. So deep was the fall and so thick was the fog that the bottom couldnt be seen. Jack cautiously walked in the opposite side. The upward incline was slight, but the road was long and the climate unforgiving. Mercifully, he found the slight outline of a building of some sort against the darkening sky. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we have civilization. Jack exhaled despite his irritability. He picked up his pace, limbs invigorated. When he had expressed his acceptance to the job of covering Quiet Haven, and rather eagerly at that, there had been a few looks shot his way from his colleagues. One of them, the only one Jack bothered to know, a middle-aged assistant editor named Duncan, came over to his tiny cubicle after lunch. Hey, uh, Hows it goin Jackie boy? He enquired, his expression giving away his concern for something greater than Jacks current state. Same old story, Duncan. Jack replied nonchalantly. His eyes were glued to his notepad, upon which he was planning out his itinerary for the upcoming trip. What you got over there? Duncan pestered on, peering at Jacks scribbling. He shifted around on his feet, fidgeting about by smoothening his crisp shirt. Jack looked up, a hint of annoyance on his face, Jotting down the route to the town. Duncan seemed to avoid eye contact with him. Yeah, about that, He shuffled his legs, You really think this is worth your while, Jack? He was clearly uncomfortable with the assignment, Jack could tell. For an extra two hundred bucks over my regular weekly, you better believe its worth my while Dunk. Jack said, grinning. Duncan pulled over a chair and sat hunched beside Jack, Money aside, I really dont think its a good idea for you to go there all alone. He pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed his balding head. Jack looked at him. The old guy seemed genuinely concerned about the town. He tossed his pen and pad on his desk and turned his chair to face him. Whys that? Duncan looked around them to make sure nobody was listening, and then leaned in a bit closer to Jack, The town, He half-whispered, Its not a good place. Jack rolled his eyes inwardly, Cmon Duncan, dont tell me you believe in those silly stories too. I know whats a story and whats not, Jack. His manner remained serious despite Jacks jests. I have seen people go there and not come back. Or come back He looked around once more, Different. He looked straight into Jacks eyes, not a twitch in his expression. Jack could see that the old man believed he was dead serious. He didnt want to brush him off rudely since Duncan had cared about him enough to tell him his mind. Well, thats why Im going there, D, He said To really find out whats so different about the town. Duncan frowned, clearly displeased with Jacks decision and lamenting his viridity, Some things are best left alone, boy. Jack leaned back in his chair, You of all people should know I dont like leaving things alone, Duncan. The editor got up hastily. He regarded Jack once more, looking at him as if it were the last time hed see the young journalist. So be it. I wanted to warn you and I did my part. He walked away to his office. The rest is up to you. While walking towards the dark building, Jack thought of Duncans behaviour as odd. He was a reasonable man like Jack, and seeing him all worked up over some fictitious story was strange. And it wasnt just Duncan; everybody at the agency had been regarding him with distaste all week, since he had accepted the job. Admittedly, the town looked a bit spooky, with all the fog and silence, but that was about it. Jack Boucher was a man of science and evidence. He had dispelled a few superstitions in his career and was not afraid of keeping up the tradition. He picked up his pace and walked on. As he got closer, he could see that the building was a house. Nearing it, he saw with a sinking heart that it was ramshackled and abandoned. The windows and been boarded up, and rot and fungi clung to the wooden walls. Disappointed, but not deterred, Jack kept on moving, Well duh, you dummy. The first building you see in the outskirts of a town wont exactly be a manor or a mall now, would it? In the darkness, Jack failed to see the large black X that was painted on the door of the house. The fog seemed to get thicker and colder as he went on. More than that, the silence was unbroken. Obviously a rural town would be quiet at this time, but the silence was absolute. Now I know where the place got its name from. Jack chuckled. It was difficult to tell where the mist ended and the clouds began. The moon was but a blob of dull white light that was struggling to peek past the condensation. He could see a few out of commission street lamps as he walked on. The roads too, got a bit wider and pavements appeared on both the sides. A few more structures on either sides of the road could be seen from the distance, yet there was not a single source of light. Power outrage? thought Jack. Or maybe the recession hit this place worse than it did Brahms. Whatever the reason, Jack had seen worse settlements in his time. Not willing to admit that the collective elements of isolation unnerved him in the very least, he put on a stoic face and went deeper into the town. Owing to the pin-drop silence of the place, every little sound Jack made felt like it reverberated throughout the town. The clicking of his shoes, the shuffling of his jacket, even his semi-gasping breath made him feel like the whole town could hear him. He felt alone and uncomfortable, but his pride drove him forward. Till now, Quiet Haven enjoyed a complete district independency. It had been a separate constituency which voted amongst itself and elected a representative. With the change of the administration in Brahms, the newly appointed commissioner proposed to merge the city of Brahms with the town of Quiet Haven. Despite the obvious benefits of increased funding and other factors, the general consensus was a reluctant one due to the reputation of the town of Quiet Haven. Jack, much like the new commissioner, was one of the very few who scoffed at the peoples sensitivity towards folklore in Brahms. He was more prepared for interviews and questionnaires than exploring strange houses in a supposedly abandoned town. He wondered if they even had a government to elect to be regarded as a separate constituency, much less a population to govern. Thats modern democracy for you. As long as you have the power, who gives a fuck about what youre supposed to do with it? The layout was like any other small town- Roads criss-crossing the flatlands into different square sectors, No building higher than a couple of stories could be seen, trees, leafless and probably lifeless, lined the inner groves of the sectors. Across the street, Jack saw a park with a rusty fence around it. He momentarily wondered if the fortification was to protect the caved in gazebos or the moss lined statues. Never in his current state would the young journalist admit to being spooked out by the town. Pondering upon the details of the place, Jack had almost missed the house with the lit upper floor window. He nearly tripped as he stopped immediately upon seeing it. The white walled residence was a simple townhouse with two floors and a veranda. The stony pathway leading up to it was moss ridden and cracked. What Jack thought was once a front lawn was now a mush of wild weeds surrounded by a broken picket fence. It wasnt exactly well kept, but it wasnt in shambles either. There were no balconies, but the French windows were generous in size. It was out of one of these windows that Jack saw a yellow light emitting. After hours of stumbling in the darkness, the light looked almost alien to him. Hopeful, yet apprehensive, he approached the door. There was no button for an electric bell, but there was a brass knocker on the middle of the door. Looks like Quiet Haven never advanced past the 50s, Jack thought humorously as he lifted the handle and brought it down on the metal plate thrice; producing three metallic knocks that rang out loudly. A sound was heard, startling the young man. It seemed like it came from far off, outside the house. Jack looked around, trying to locate the origin of the noise. He stepped back and watched his surroundings. Seeing nothing, he started again towards the door when he glanced up and saw that the light in the upper window had gone off for some unknown reason. What the He looked closely at the window. Was his mind playing tricks on him? No. That couldnt be. He saw the light from a mile away. Did someone turn it off inside? And what was that noise? It was safe to say that Jack was now on edge. He could feel the vulnerability of being alone in the strange place. He looked at the door again, thinking about whether he should knock on it again. No sooner than he had touched the engraved handle he heard the noise again. He immediately turned around, startled. It sounded as if it were nearer this time. Once again, nothing but the dilapidated landscape of the hollow town under the obstruction of the fog greeted him solemnly. He felt uncomfortable, as if his every move was being watched by an unknown spectator. Must have been the wind or something, you chicken. Jack tried to calm down by laughing it off. He turned to the door again. There was a window beside the door. He decided against common courtesy and peeked inside through the smudged glass. Nothing but darkness greeted him. He looked around the house in desperation. The mist was beginning to thicken even more and the temperature continued to drop. His knees protested painfully even as he stood in the porch of the strange house. Not that Im a big fan of breaking and entering, but desperate times His thoughts trailed off as he turned the knob on the door and it turned all the way. He pushed the door slightly. It swung inwards with a bloodcurdling screech that must have echoed throughout the town. Jack immediately held the door to prevent it from making any more noise. He couldnt explain his instinct to stay undetected. He just somehow felt that nobody in the town should know that hes there. He looked behind him again and surveyed the area. Couldve sworn I heard something He turned and walked inside the door. The house was completely dark. Blue light from the night outside sifted in shafts though the windows. Jack stood for a while at the entrance, letting his eyes get used to the darkness as he didnt have a flashlight Jack walked forward cautiously. The layout of the place was standard by all means. A combined living and dining room with couches in the corner facing an old TV set, a kitchenette on the opposite side of the room, and a staircase in the back. In the darkness, he could see that the house was a bit unkempt, but it looked lived in. The cane furniture looked a tad brittle and the wallpaper was repaired in patches. The owners couldnt have gone long. Sure, a fine layer of domestic dust covered most surfaces, from the small, round dinner table in the middle of the room to the marble kitchen counters on the far end, and the moonlight caught a few strands of thin wisps of cobwebs that hung between the ceiling and the walls, but there was no sign of rot or other indications of a long abandonment. A good few housekeeping chores and the place could actually become quite cozy, Jack thought wishfully. His eye caught a glint of light that reflected off the shelf on the side of the living room. Jack walked up to the mantle and saw a collection of trinkets- Medals, crystal pieces, framed photographs; the usual decorations in a family home. He picked up a framed photograph and looked closely through the dusty and stained glass. Probably the folks who live here, Jack thought as he saw the family portrait. It was taken at a fair. The balding, yet smiling Dad and the slightly overweight Mom were standing in front of a carousel ride, smiling and looking into the camera. There were two kids in front of them. The toddler boy was sitting on the grass, staring at his sister with his fist in his mouth. The girl was smiling gleefully holding a mass of cotton candy in her hand. Pink, sugary floss was stuck in traces over her face and dress. Although a satisfied tenant of a bachelor life, Jack unknowingly smiled while looking at the sappy photograph. He jumped and dropped the frame on the ground when he heard that voice again. There was no doubt about it! It seemed closer this time too. It was a kind of a metallic ring. Heart in his mouth, Jack walked cautiously towards the front door. Calm down, it was probably nothing. Something mustve fallen or such. He tried to sedate his nerves with logic. Reaching the door, he peered outside the window beside it. The town was as he had left it. White fog, grey houses, dark trees He saw it beside a lone tree on the far side of the street. It was a dark blob that was undecipherable in the fog and darkness. What the fuck?! Jacks eyes peeled back as he struggled to see what it was. He was certain he hadnt seen it before. Is that a person? Jack swallowed a lump in his throat. He felt utterly uncomfortable and shook. He put his hands on the dirty glass and looked hard. The fog seemed to be growing thicker around the shadow beside the tree. He couldnt make out the details; all he saw was a dark obscurity that was vaguely humanoid. Breathing shakily, Jack grabbed the doorknob. He didnt want to go outside, but he didnt want to admit that he was scared either. Theres probably a reasonable explanation for all this. He told himself as he pulled the door open and stepped out. His eyes automatically went to the exact spot where he had seen the anomaly. He sighed with relief as he gazed upon the lone tree outside. There was nothing beside it. Not a shadow, not a person, nothing. He smacked himself on the head, the terror suddenly deflated. Probably just the mist curling up or something, He mused, or a smudge on the window. He laughed at the possibility of getting scared of a mark on the window. Walking back into the house, he decided to inspect the window. Just to put my mind to ease. A sliver of fear crept back in as he closed the door and stepped aside. The sliver of fear turned into a giant pit of paralyzing horror as he stared out the window. The shadow was there. It was under a different tree this time. It had changed positions and was now directly across the street, nearer to the house. Jacks wide eyes could see it much clearly. The humanoid figure was wearing a dark, loose robe with a hood that masked its head and face completely. It stood perfectly still under the dead pine tree. Jacks mind struggled to fathom what was going on. He had just been outside! As he watched, his eyes glued, the dark figure slowly raised its arm beside it. Jack stared, losing his wits with every passing second. The figure turned his hand into a fist and knocked on the black wood of the dried pine tree beside it thrice. Jacks blood turned to ice as he heard the low, metallic sound he had been hearing all along. The three knocks produced three metallic rings, each one louder than the last. Clang Clang Clang! What how did His limbs shook with fear as he slowly walked backwards. His heel bumped against the dining table. He caught the edge and steadied himself. Trying to control his jittery body, he breathed heavily. It wasnt possible. A thousand thoughts raced in his head. Alright Jack, focus! He tried to clear his head. You gotta get out of this. You gotta make it through. He decided against going outside at the moment. What he saw had flayed his nerves. He looked at the wooden flight of stairs at the back of the room. Adrenaline fuelled his brain. Upstairs! There was that light there that had went out, there could be something up there! He glanced fearfully at the front door, expecting it to burst open any moment. He didnt dare go look through the window again. It could be right in front of him this time! If it was coming for him, he needed to hide. He scrambled towards the stairs and made his way up. The soft wood creaked at every step, making him wince. The stairs opened in a cramped bedroom upstairs. There was a bulb dangling from the ceiling, defunct. A circular window at the front allowed some blue moonlight inside. There were two single beds arranged parallel to each other in front of him, with a square nightstand between the headboards. A single red LED was blinking on the small table. Jack cautiously walked towards it. The landline telephone was somehow still functioning. He pressed a button on the dusty white set and a tinny, automated voice of a lady spoke up. You have whirr-whirr Two unread messages. The playback began with a flat voice of an operative. 911, whats your emergency A scared, breathless voice of a woman broke out of the speaker grille, Oh god! Please help! Theyre here, theyre inside the house! The operative replied in a concerned, yet flat tone. Maam, please calm down. Where are you right now? Im at my house, the woman spoke in crying whispers, sniffling between sentences. Ive got my children with me. She choked and paused before continuing in a harsh voice, My husband went outside to stop them, and they they! She broke down crying. Can you tell us your exact address? The woman was breathing directly on the microphone, causing a lot of static in the recording. Yes! Yes, its Statesman Row. House 3282. Please, theyre almost in the room please! Loud background noises suddenly erupted, a repeated pounding that caused the woman to scream out. Jack leaned in closer to hear the voices through all the noise. He couldnt hear what the person attacking the door was shouting. Oh god, theyre gonna break down the door, please! The woman broke down in hysterical sobs. Maam, can you describe the assailants to us? Did you get a look at them? Amidst cries and background shouting, the woman spoke up, Its.. Its Father Malcolm! Hes got about a dozen people with him. Theyre wearing black robes and and.. A sound of splintering wood was heard and the woman shrieked. Theyve got, I dont know, machetes or something in their hands. Please, theyre here! Theyre almost through the door, oh god! There was silence on the operatives side. The woman shouted into the phone in a panicked frenzy, Hello?! Hello?! Please, say something, please! The operative came back online. He spoke in a stone cold voice, Im sorry maam. It seems like you are out of our area of service. I cannot help you. There were more crashes and shouts in the background. What?! What do you mean you cant help us! Theyre gonna kill my children! Please, oh god ple The operative hung up and the message ended with a flat dial tone. Jack Boucher wiped the cold sweat off his forehead as the machine whirred. His whole body felt numb. Before his mind could process the disturbing recording, the machine went off again. End of message. Whirrrr, You have one unread message. No, no, no, no, the womans voice returned. Stay away! Stay away from me you psycho! The sound of children crying in the background accompanied the sniffling of the woman. A deeper voice was heard, that of a man. Why are you afraid, child? The voice got closer to the microphone and got louder gradually. I have come to offer you salvation. Do not be afraid. It was a sinister, gravely, yet captivating tone that the man spoke in. Please! Please stay away! The woman begged, Weve done nothing wrong! Why? Why are you doing this to us?! The man clicked his tongue in an expression of disappointment. No no no! What are you doing?! Stay away from my kids! The woman suddenly cried out in fright. The man spoke in an amused tone, Theyre beautiful. What are their names? The woman just cried and begged in response. I always think every child is beautiful, the man hummed softly, So young. So pure. You bastard, dont touch th The woman was cut off with a sharp sound sudden gasp. Jack imagined her being struck by the man; or one of his companies. The man clicked in disappointment again, Youre a lot like your husband, Mrs. Fisher. The woman choked at the mention of her partner. But we amended his ways in the end. She suddenly bawled out uncontrollably. A few more sickening thuds of a blunt object striking flesh turned her screams into frightened whimpers. Please She gasped heavily, struggling with breath, Please, let my children go Do anything you want with me, leave them. Theyre innocent The man took a deep breath. Im afraid thats impossible. The woman cried and begged at the cold response. I really dont understand you people, the man spoke up, disgusted, Your whole life you promise devotion to the lord in exchange for salvation, yet, when you are offered salvation, you cringe and deter from it like traitors. The womans cries were suddenly cut short by a guttural cough that made Jacks stomach turn. I am your savior. I am the answers to your prayers. After a few more strained coughs, the womans voice disappeared completely and the children suddenly began to scream and cry louder than before. I am the Lords will, and I will make sure you submit to it. The man carried on in a baritone as the childrens voices grew fainter and fainter until all that was heard was the crystal clear voice of the man. There was a click of the handset of the phone being picked up. I wasnt talking to them, my friend, Jacks body went rigid with pure fear as the man spoke directly into the microphone. I was talking to you. The message ended as soon as Jack heard the unmistakable creak of the front door of the house being opened beneath him. He just stood there for a while as the paralyzing horror rendered his limbs immobile. His mind was in a state of shock at the message. How could that have been? Footsteps, slow but heavy, were gradually making their way through the ground floor. A crackling of wood was heard. The staircase Jack was motionless in the face of this approaching, unknown horror. The voice of the man was still echoing inside his ears as the creak of boots on the wooden stairs grew louder. It was almost at the top now The dangling bulb started swinging back and forth, flickering with light. Jack could hear his own heartbeat pounding away inside his chest. Hedarted his eyeballs around the room, looking for a place to hide. A sudden, shrill sound emitting from his clothes made him seize in panic. He looked around himself in confused horror before he realized it was coming from his jeans pocket. He quickly put his hand over the tiny clamshell phone to subdue the ringtone. The muffled ringing continued. He cursed himself as he slid his hand inside his pocket and roughly mashed all the buttons his cold fingers could find until the noise mercifully stopped. Breathing in stuttered gasps through a droughty mouth, Jack strained his ears to relocate the approaching entity. Strangely enough, the footsteps had stopped. He stood there for a good two minutes on the exact same spot, trying to hear the sound in the pin-drop silence. He looked at the ceiling. The bulb was as motionless as it had been first. He refused to believe that it couldnt be real. It was too vivid to be imagination. What the fuck is going on in this place? Jacks knees began to quiver. He felt his face getting hot as tears welled up in his eyes. Fear, desolation and helplessness held him in a tightening noose. No! He huffed out a breath of air and blinked away the moisture. Ive got to make it out of here. Taking deep breaths, he gathered some courage to move. Crouching slightly, he tip-toed forward, towards the staircase, fighting the urge to tear off in a maddening sprint. He fearfully peered down into the descending stairs, half-expecting the owner of the footsteps to be standing there, waiting for him. Nothing but darkness greeted him. There was no indication of anybody having been there. Confused, but ultimately relieved, he took a moment to compose himself. Alright, nobody here except you. Walking down the stairs, he found himself jumping and staring at shadows and nonexistent noises, expecting someone to jump him from the darkness. Progress was slow, but it seemed to be the most intense circumstance Jack had found himself to be in. His heart was palpitating at a dizzying rate. He crossed the living room, which almost seemed to stretch in front of him. His strained eyes darted around the room fearfully, and he kept looking over his shoulder, still convinced that he was not alone in this house; or in this town. Almost there. He looked at the ornate front door with waning anxiety. His feet got quicker. He glanced towards the side and saw the window. A new jolt of fear struck him. No, dont look through it. He tried to avert his gaze from the dusty, stained glass as he passed it. With one single, awkwardly impatient move, he turned the worn doorknob and swung the door open and stepped outside. The cold wrapped its icy fingers up his sweat soaked shirt and made him shiver. He looked around the open outdoors of the town with moist, bloodshot eyes. It was the same as he remembered. Not even a blade of grass out of place. Jack immediately started briskly walking back the way he came, teeth chattering and body shivering from more than just cold. He thrust his hands inside his pocket to warm his cold and numb fingers. His fingers wrapped around a small object in his pocket and he suddenly remembered the ill timed ringing of his phone. He quickly pulled out the clamshell and stared at the screen. What?! There were three missed calls from Duncan. One fleeting bar of signal lifted his hopes tremendously. He quickly mashed the call button repeatedly and jammed to phone to his ear, praying to every god he had shunned and ridiculed all his life. He stopped what he was doing and looked up from the screen when he saw a light being turned on behind him. Quickly whipping around, he scanned his surroundings. His eyes went up the straight road. At the furthest end was a dot of yellow light. As he stared in confusion, it seemed to get closer and closer, hovering slightly above the road. With panicked confusion, he realized that the streetlights were powering up one by one. The dead town was coming back to life. He followed the bulbs turning on till it reached to where he was standing. In front of the house he had just emerged from stood a figure in dark robes. No Mouth agape in horror, Jack dropped his phone to the ground. Static electricity went up and down his petrified body. He couldnt command his limbs to move. Hearing his own blood rush into his head, he felt dizzy with fear. It was like being in a dream; A nightmare. Only now did Jack see the man or woman or whoever it was move. It moved in robotic steps, as if unsure of its destination. Stuck like glue to where he was standing, Jack saw the figure step into the dull wash of the yellow light that had splashed over the road. Jack watched unblinking as the figure, now about twenty feet away from where he was standing, turned to face him. Slowly, the hands came up to the head. The hood was thrown back and Jack got a good look at the persons face. Jacks knees buckled underneath him. He staggered to a kneel. A lump got caught in his throat as he saw his own reflection staring back at him. The person was exactly like him. Before Jack could even register, much less react, the figure drew something out from the folds of his robes and held it up near his, or Jacks face. The blade was about six inches long and matte black. Pushing it closer against his face, Jack saw his apparition hold the knife against his cheek. Jack recoiled as he felt a tinge of cold on his own face, right where the knife was held. The figure slowly ran the blade across, from the lips to the ears, drawing blood on his face. Jack felt the sting on his own face. His cheek throbbed and a slick wetness creeped down his jaw. The sensation was enough to kick his body in overdrive. He awkwardly scrambled to his feet and tore off running in the opposite direction. He shouted at the top of his lungs in absolute horror. So petrified was his brain that he couldnt hear his own screams break through the silence in Quiet Haven. Mid-Stride, he heard a sharp crack beneath him, followed by agonizing pain in his ankles. He tumbled down, body rolling, gasping. As he writhed in pain, clutching his fractured foot, another crack emitted from his other leg, and that ankle was broken too. He glanced down to see the grotesque sight of a bony lump jutting out of his now swollen foot. Somehow, Jack still felt as if he were running. Running on broken ankles. The pain was unparalled. His legs screamed in protest as he flailed about on the cold asphalt, dragging his nails through the road as he felt his bones being almost split open inside him. He heard footsteps that matched with the bouts of pain in his feet. Looking up, he saw him again- The robed figure, hobbling towards him. The pain did not seem to bother him, but it ravished Jack. Crunches and cracks could still be heard from his legs as the man drew near to where Jack was lying down. All Jack could manage by then was to stay conscious and groan incoherently. Black spots started appearing in his vision. The pain was too much to bear Craning his neck upwards, Jack saw his own face once again. Blood running through familiar features. The man watched him without a hint of any emotion. It saw watched Jack with a peculiar curiosity; almost childlike. As he watched, the face in front of him smiled. It broke out in a wide grin, exposing a set of familiar teeth that Jack polished every morning. Through the blood, sweat and tears of agony, Jack felt his own lips curl upward and outward into a similar grin. Nobody at the office, except Duncan, took the initiative of running the missing persons ad for their newly recruited journalist in the Daily Mail. The ad ran for about two weeks before it was replaced by another one which announced a vacancy in the Editorial team for the paper. The colossal Hall was mostly shadowed in darkness. A few fire torches blazing on fixtures on the Stony walls provided some light in the form of an unwholesome, orange hue that flickered unreliably. Such was the nature of fire; eccentric and not worthy of trust. To the mass of people assembled silently in the cavenorous space, the ambience mattered little. Dark robes and hoods made each individual indistinguishable from the other. All stood still and silent, facing a singular direction, as a band would solemnly wait for the conductor. At the front of the room, the grey walls folded into dark chasms leading to depths unknown. From these depths emerged a figure. He was dressed in robes similar to the audience that awaited his arrival, although the shades on his garment were lighter than the darks of the rest. Following him was another figure, limping with a peculiar cadence. The follower was completely naked. Once on the slightly elevated dias that forebore the entire hall, the naked accomplice was laid down in between the crowd and it's supposed leader. The light robed man placed his palms on the chest of the initiate and began chanting a verse in a language undecipherable by the most accomplished of linguists. The crowd joined the chant sombrely, repeating in deep, grave, Eldritch words. The naked man heaved and coughed as the ritual went on, chest rising and falling unnaturally. His body felt the probes and incisions until his brain collapsed into a dream. Only the chants echoed within his conciousness. When he opened his eyes, the man in the white robes was lifting him up. Staggering to his feet, he saw the dark hall and the darker people stretch out beyond him. They seemed infinite, almost like the populace of an entire city had gathered at one place. The man in the white robes grasped his shoulders. With a final chant, he draped the man's naked body in a black ensemble. As if out of instinct, the naked man reached behind his neck and pulled the hood over his head. The crowd stopped chanting immediately. For a while, there was a void of absolute silence. Finally, the white robed leader stepped back and gestured the man towards the assembly with a single sentence. ""Welcome, Brother Jack."""
4,vulnerability,nosleep,This document from the Vatican Secret Archive reveals the true horrors that occurred during the Spanish Inquisition.,1999,huegbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/huegbh/this_document_from_the_vatican_secret_archive/,2020-07-20 13:54:46,"As the only historian to have private access to the Vatican Secret Archive, Im reminded daily of the Vaticans sinister place in world history. The Catholic Church has more power over global affairs than any other institution. And thats just as true today as it was five hundred years ago. But this knowledge isnt exactly shocking. Crack open any history book, and you can see how prevalent the Churchs role has been in shaping the world we inhabit. However, what the public doesnt know is how the Vatican accomplishes its insidious objectives. The Vaticans agents span the globe and are responsible for some of the most controversial crimes committed by an international institution. Furthermore, the Vatican has gone through great lengths to conceal its daily involvement with the occult. This is perhaps the Churchs greatest ruse: fooling the public into believing that priests have distanced themselves from ancient practices such as exorcism. For not only do priests regularly interact with supernatural forcesthey actively release these forces into the world for their benefit. Although the connection between the Vatican and the occult spans centuries, the decades surrounding the Spanish Inquisition represents the height of the occults influence on the Churchs activities. The following document is but one example of the atrocities sanctioned by the Vatican during that dark time. The Vazquez Document  1502 *The following document was written by Father Maximus Vazquez during the Spanish Inquisition. Tasked with uncovering heretics in Barcelona, Father Maximus became notorious for his cruel treatment of Muslim and Jewish immigrants. By all accounts, his ability to elicit confessions through torture was unmatched in all of Spain.* *Only one woman, a Jewish heretic named Talia, mustered the courage to endure his torture chamber.* *What follows is Father Vazquezs horrific response to her bravery.* Im at my wits end. Ive been interrogating the same Jewish woman for two weeks, but she still refuses to decry her heresy. How she has endured my pincers and strappado for so long, I do not know. She hasnt opened her mouth once during her time in my chamber. Its as if she is unable to feel pain. A priest with less experience would take her courage as a sign of Gods grace. But not I. Her disdain for Catholicism clogs the air and fills her eyes every time she gazes upon the tapestry of the passion draped behind my desk. So tomorrow, I will put her through my true test: exposure to The Artifact. Its been years since Ive used The Artifact, but I cant think of a more opportune moment. For who better to expose to the horrors of Hell than such an insolent woman? I pray that her descent into madness comes slowly. I want to savor her despairsavor the crumbling of her faith. Tomorrow cannot come soon enough.  My hands are shaking as I write this. Not only am I fatigued, but my mind burns with questions. The heretics reaction to The Artifact perplexes me. Never before have I seen such an intense response to the pagan chalice. Perhaps by relating my experience here, I will be able to make sense of what seems unexplainable on the surface. I entered my chamber just before sunrise to find the heretic asleep in her chains. Her restful face filled me with anger. Burns and lacerations covered her body. That she could endure the inflictions of my instrumentsmany of which I forged myselfchallenged my ability to perform my holy duties. Given that Im the most revered inquisitor in Spain, I cannot afford to be challenged. I must succeed where others fail. My work is Gods work. To fail means to tarnish Gods glory. So I approached the heretic on silent feet and lowered The Artifact to her lips. Her eyes flew open as liquid splashed onto her tongue. Spill a drop, I said, and I will break your legs. Not wanting to test the truthfulness of my threat, the heretic allowed me to drain The Artifact down her throat. Her chains clanked as her legs flailed. The Artifact makes any liquid it touches frigid, so the freezing water caused her to writhe against the wall. I couldnt help but smile at her discomfort. Seeing the pain reflected in her face gave me hope that she would soon confess her crimes against the Church, which I suspected were great. Once the chalice was empty, I raised it from her lips and placed it on the ground behind me. What happened next I hardly have the will to writefor it represents the closest to Hell I have ever been. The heretic grew very still. She cocked her head to the side, concealing her features with her hair. Now that her thrashing had ceased, I noticed the fetid stench drifting from her spoiled clothes. The odor was so overpowering I nearly gagged. Had she smelled so terribly the day before? Before I had long to dwell on this question, she leaped to her feet and stared at me with blood-filled eyes. I returned her gaze for what felt like an infinite period. Then, just as my concern for her erratic behavior reached its peak, she reared back her head and laughed. Her laughter was piercinglike a childs shriekand echoed around the room with deafening volume. My skin crawled at the sound. Typically, my subjects break down in tears as The Artifact tortures them with visions of Hell. Although these visions are compelling, they are nothing more than mental images. The forces of Hell cannot consume their souls while they still draw breath, despite their vulnerability during what I call the passing over. However, none of the subjects I have exposed to The Artifact have ever laughed during their descent. Typically, their bodies go numb from shock, with their minds soon to follow. Ive even had subjects gnaw off their tongues. You can imagine my apprehension then as the heretic continued her raucous laughter. Enough! I said, taking a step toward her. Your disrespect knows no bounds. I will teach you to make a mockery of my procedures. I raised my hand to strike her. But right as I moved my palm toward her cheek, my arm froze as if grabbed by invisible fingers. The heretic smiled. Your taunts are amusing, she said, voice unnaturally deep. As are the visions you have gifted me with. Fear constricted my chest as the fingers tightened to the point I could feel bruises forming on my arms. Such a profound feeling of hopelessness pervaded my spirit I felt like slumping to the ground. What are you doing to me? I said. The heretic ignored my question. Ive been preparing for this moment for five years, she said. Your crimes against my people span decades. This is your punishment. She wrapped her hands around my neck. The moment her fingers touched my skin, blackness consumed my vision. Dont resist, said the heretic. Your fate has already been sealed. When my vision returned, I found myself standing at the precipice of a boiling yellow lake. A sprawling black castle loomed beyond this lake, spires stretching miles into the air. I tried to fleeto escape this hellish world and return to my chamberbut my feet whisked me toward a nearby bridge. The heretics laughter exploded through the [blackness as I walked.](URL [TCC](URL"
5,vulnerability,nosleep,Does anyone remember a TV channel called Beneath the Static? (Part 4),109,hv64rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hv64rd/does_anyone_remember_a_tv_channel_called_beneath/,2020-07-21 22:02:01,"Its been a long, long month. Where Ive been doesnt matter so much as WHAT happened. This is the last part before we reach the Day of Separation and well, to be truthful, Ive not been fully honest with you all. Im not who I say I am. Well get to that next time, Im still trying to find the place to explain it all, but I hope youll forgive me. After the last entry went up, my night terrors increased exponentially and I almost could not function. Sleeping became the biggest chore imaginable, and I was close to mentally breaking until last week when a message popped up from an old friend. They want to meet, and with travel restrictions lifting, theyre aiming to come out soon. They want to resolve this once and for all and Im inclined to let them. Well be doing a reunion soon, and I guess Ill keep you posted on that. The Day Of Separation affected us all differently I appreciate the well wishes and voices of concern, but my part in this isnt so relevant right now. What I want to focus on is the matter at hand. These dont get any easier as time goes on. As always, if you have memories of the TV Network Beneath The Static PLEASE let me know, Im collating all the information in the comments as its the easiest for my anxiety to deal with. I hope you understand. Mantis Reach was The Sages old hangout before we migrated to the basement. Something did happen up there, something I dont think any of us then or now have fully come to terms with or accepted our part within. Ill say this much though; There werent always Six Sages, and we didnt always have such a dysfunction within our group. Before what happened that warm July evening, when everything began to fall apart There were seven. [Part 1](URL [Part 2](URL [Part 3](URL ---- There was no real fanfare prior to our meeting this week, Fay was having nightmares and didnt seem ready to discuss it, drawings were kept secret and I didnt want to push the envelope on an already tense situation. Each week we do this, I feel us gradually growing apart both as siblings and as a unit. I know many of you have said why are we doing this? and questioning the logic of wanting our secrets laid bare. But the truth is, its already happened and to explain our mindset then is almost impossible to discern now. All I can say looking back is that its very akin to browsing gore sites with your friends; you want to stop, but you cant because everyone else is still invested and nobody wants to back out. Everyone shuffled in on their own, their idiosyncrasies diluted down to nothing more than some choice phrases and clothing options; Mathias repeatedly unlogged his glasses and was nose deep in a tech magazine, Warren had an earphone in blasting Bad Religion and giving a lazy fist bump, Millie shook my hand gingerly with the Cats Paw and Preston mumbled something between huge swathes of Doritos shovelled into his mouth. If I said it felt like the old gang was back, Id be lying. We sat in an awkward malaise as the show counted down. The conversations were brief and muddled in anxiety. It seemed we didnt really come alive until the show actually started, but Mathias was the only one to probe the question on everyones minds as the countdown for the shows starting began; **Mathias:** Do any of you think this is related to what JJ said at the end of the last show? **Fay:** You mean Mantis Reach? There was a long pause, shuffling seats, and even Preston stopped eating to contemplate. That stormy night in the clubhouse, the fight, the incident, the promise. **Mathias:** It just seems like were not acknowledging the Elephant in the room here **Warren:** Its a big fucking Elephant and Im content to keep it as far the fuck away from me as possible. **Fay:** Problem is, we cant do that forever, not if JJ or whoever this is knows everything. **Preston:** But why would he use that info against us? What happened up there was- **Millie:** Dont. We know what happened with Livewire; we dont need to go into it. **Tristan:** Im not sure who or what JJ and this network is. But we keep coming back every week, and we keep waiting to see whos next. Something is drawing us here, and honestly? I think its our own desire for truth intermixed with something else The group pause and wait for me to finish, but Im certain that the same word ran to everyones minds before I even finished uttering it; **Tristan:** Guilt. Welcome to Beneath The Static. Tonights special documentary Life Out of Death will be presented by Sir Barclay Wigbert. 0:00 - A sweeping shot of an orchard with beautiful orchestral music begins the show. This is by far the most high-definition concept we have seen out of them so far. As the innumerable trees pass over the stretch of land, we have shots of small animals and insects surviving and foraging as the narrator speaks. He sounds so much like David Attenborough that if Id not seen he was a middle-aged man from Japan, Id have been convinced they paid him to appear. Our planet is filled with an innumerable amount of remarkable creatures. It has been my lifes work to catalogue these strange, remarkable and potentially deadly creatures. But of course, we mustnt forget our own place in this ecosystem. Our journey will look through some of the most unique members of the animal kingdom and our role within. Im Sir Barclay Wigbert and this is Life Out Of Death. **Tristan:** Hey, you never know, this one may actually be normal for once. Millie: Anything with animals and soothing British voices is a good start. But **Warren:** But this isnt a normal fucking station were dealing with. **Fay:** Well, then we have to ask the question that none of us wants to ask, let alone answer **Preston:** Whos next? 0:02: Our eyes turn back to the TV screen as the shot turns to a lush green forest; fauna and flora adorning the undergrowth, plants of shapes and sizes Id have never guessed could possibly exist. Innumerable bugs crawling along the moss stricken logs, great-winged insects expertly darting through the air to avoid larger predators while small spindly rodents littered the ground, forever on the hunt for their next meal. It was a veritable menagerie of strange creatures, both familiar and unfamiliar. The scene shifts to Barclay standing by a large tree branch, the lights dimmed low and the undergrowth looking almost an indigo rather than the usual emerald green. Were here today for a special look at a few of this great realms most fascinating creatures. Starting off with Ampulex compressa The shot cuts to a closeup of an iridescent wasp, cleaning itself with its front legs and the shimmer of its abdomen bursting through the screen as a soft drone played in the background. Something indecipherable whispered underneath. As soon as Barclay spoke the name of the creator, however, we heard a voice in the room call out at the exact same time. Not full of confidence, knowledge and price like his, but fear and pain; it was Millie. Behold: The Emerald Cockroach Wasp. He said proudly as it crawled around its enclosure, Millie staring wide-eyed and a tear falling down her face. She was someone who refused to show extreme emotion or vulnerability unless it was forced out of her. This unsettled us all, but we didnt say anything. 0:05 - The camera takes a wide angle approach to the behaviour of the Emerald Cockroach Wasp as it highlights the body structure, hive and prey. As it goes through the motions of capturing a helpless cockroach, stabbing its underbelly and dragging it into a burrow to lay an egg inside it. Sharp, loud static sounds would ring out as the scene rapidly progressed through the gestation process; each of us jumping in our seats from the sounds of crunching, gnawing and chewing of this larvae, eating the host alive with shots of pearly white teeth and cracked flesh appear momentarily. **Warren:** This sick fuck is enjoying watching ushow long are we going to keep playing his game? WHY are we still doing this? **Fay:** Because he knows about Mantis Reach. He knows about all of us and **Warren:** And what? He didnt know about that shit until last week and we STILL came back. **Fay:** I dont know, I just feel theres more to this than that. If he knows all this, why doesnt the rest of the world? Why havent we been approached by anyone? **Mathias:** Probably limited viewership. We could be the only ones watching. **Preston:** Maybe they dont know its us? Maybe theyre being told their own secrets, and thats entrapping them? **Warren:** Bullshit, Preston. That was YOUR brother, YOUR family. What the fuck are we still doing here? **Millie:** Then why havent you gone? We turned to look at her, clutching her lucky cats paw and eyes wide with fear as she stared at the tv screen, tears flowing down her face and her lip bitten so tightly that a trickle of blood still flowed even when she spoke. **Millie:** Clearly, there're reasons we all have to go and far more to stay. Everyone has a secret they keep, everyone has a face they never show. This fucking station exposes that and right nowright now, Im the one in the spotlight. **Tristan:** You know, we could just switch it off and be done with it, I can turn off the TV, close this laptop and we could just wash our hands of it all. **Fay:** Yeah, we could maybe hook up some Mario Kart and- **Millie:** Fuck thatfuck that FUCK THAT. We stared for a moment. She stood up and had her head bowed. **Millie:** Its better this way, so lets just do it, okay? If this is gonna come out I want it to MEAN something. Not just be useless shit that continues to fuck me up as I get older. I want to be better. 00:08 - I nodded, and we turned back. The devouring of the cockroach now finished and Barclay walking through the underbrush as multiple shadowed insects I couldnt identify ran for cover. He stopped by a small clearing and knelt down near the burrow of one of the cockroaches and grinned. Now, if were very lucky, there should be a victim in here right at the end of its gestation period. Lets see if we can get a good look at the specimen. He reaches in and pulls out a small, emaciated digit. The skin melting away and exposing necrotic tissue, bone and sinew underneath. He pulls it up towards the camera and then sniffs it like a cigar before biting down hard and chewing it, in full view of the camera. Delightful, a small morsel to satiate the pallet before the main course. The Emerald Cockroach has a remarkable ability only recently discovered by scientists, you see. It is able to- **Millie:** Secrete acidic juices from the abdomen that will allow for prey to be easily digested, no matter the size. We stare over at her, clutching her lucky cats paw and wide eyed with horror. No time to pause or give thought, Barclay continued on, walking through the underbrush to a larger burrow. You see, many creatures have hidden talents that permit them to go beyond their usual hunting patterns, base instincts and feeding habits. This is not only a mark of evolution, but survival of the fittest. We see this in multiple species across the animal kingdom, but no more so than in the insect kingdom. He pauses, still chewing the sinew and fat from the finger, the entirety of our room hoping its either a prop or some kind of strange looking larvae. 0:10 - The camera pans in closer as he stands there chewing, a solid 30 seconds of nothing else as his eyes roll back, he moans and savours every bite. Drool and blood dribbling down his lips as the crunching sounds become louder. Eventually, the footage begins to inter splice with varying forms of predators taking down and devouring prey. Bear grabbing fish from the streams, cheetahs at full speed taking down gazelle and Crocodiles pouncing on unsuspecting Zebra, each bite the predators jaws producing an ear-splitting screech from the television, flashing images over the look of ecstasy on Barclays face. The whole sequence growing progressively faster until they melded into one and the eyes rolled down to look directly at the camera lens. **Mathias:** This one seems to have very little point to it, Im almost wondering if this is an anti-meme you know, where its entire point is to be something nonsensical and unstructured. Kinda like some of the more avant-garde German or European shows of the heyday **Fay:** The flashing images just make me feel ill, though the animal takedowns arent bothering me too much, just might not have any meat for a while. **Tristan:** I give it 2 hours before you beg me to take you to Taco Bell because you either got the hunger pangs or need the energy to draw all night. **Fay:** Hey man, when you have a craving, you have a craving. Right, Millie? Millie hadnt stopped staring, we knew she hadnt. But we were desperate to bring normalcy to the group, knowing we needed to DO better to support one another when our turn came around, especially since we were now resolved to see this through. Her free hand was picking at the skin on her fingers so aggressively that blood was pooling down her wrist. If she was in pain, she didnt give any notion to us. Instead, she stared ahead, nodding rhythmically with some unheard beat. **Preston:** What is she Warren? Tristan? Are you guys just going to let her do that? Shouldnt we I dunno intervene? **Warren:** No. Millie aint the type wholl appreciate a handout. You guys didnt stop me and even though that shit was scarring, Id rather feel it and experience it. Otherwise, its just unresolved. All we can do is be there when she falls and catch her. **Fay:** Wow, that almost sounded poetic, Warren. **Warren:** Fuck off, I aint that type. Musician? Sure. Poet? Fuck that noise. **Fay:** Theyre the same thing, yknow 0:20 - There was a loud thump, and the scenery distorted back to the sprawling landscapes and diverse undergrowth of creatures both recognisable and not so. Stag beetles with a bioluminescent carapace, diving from the air to impale rivals or small black caterpillars that leak acidic juices. A trapdoor spider the size of a dinner plate with the exact skin tone and camouflage to match a black human hand adeptly snapping out of a deep burrow in the ground to ensnare a shrew, fangs the size of nails piercing clean through and dragging it back underground in an instant. Lastly, the image settles on that of a leaf swaying in the wind on a thick log, a rhesus monkey off in the distance, smashing rocks together. Barclays soft, pleasant voice dripping with sinister undertones as he speaks over the scene, a darkness falling around the undergrowth; Do you know what else has a remarkable adaptation to taking down its prey? Humans. We are so good at manipulation tactics, both direct and subversive, that often times our prey simply walks right into the trap without knowing it! The leaf sways and the camera pans back, each one of us recoiling in horror as Millie breathes heavily, saying no over and over under her breath, I half expected her to have a full-blown panic attack. The leaf was far larger than the shot made it appear, the size of a small man, and it was steadily moving towards its intended prey, the monkey; A child no older than 7 with a large brown hoodie on and a Totoro backpack. The leafs arms were pointed at the ends with spikes adorning the underside, the head tilted at a 90 degree axis and perfectly still, each of its legs gently moving its body forward until it was within striking range. Everything about the scene felt wrong. We knew we were being lead into something far darker than all the others, but we couldnt look away. None of us could. Yes, thats right. Not every creature is as it seems. The undergrowth, much like the average suburban neighbourhood, carries all manner of unusual, violent and disturbing secrets within it. Its just a matter of time until theyre revealed. But, of course, many of our young viewers are aware of these encounters. Especially those of us with guarded emotions and a propensity to the macabre 0:25 - The screen flashes again and were greeted with images of tribes going to war, Chimpanzees ripping each others limbs off for fun and devouring the young of an enemy troop, executions by the guillotine in France, nuclear bombs going off in Japan and tragedies I swear hadnt happened by that point. As each one appeared, one of us flinched and felt it hit their innermost fears; drowning, burning, buried, eaten alive, torture. One by one we felt our energy sapped, and we were powerless to stop it or to stop watching. Imagine the sensation of not being able to look away from a car crash amplified by a thousand. We were in whether we wanted to or not. **Millie:** I know whats going to come next, please dont hate me for what you see. Please. Millie was holding her arms at the shoulders and rocking slowly in place, unable to control herself. **Warren:** How in the hell could you know What is-Tristan: Not the time, dude. Dont worry, Millie, were with you. The group nodded sheepishly, though everyone was wondering the same thing as Warren. We never knew how this played out, but Im sure the group whod been featured so far at least knew their darkest secrets and fears, so it at least made sense on what would be shown. But as it seemed the scene was reaching its apex, the camera cut to Barclay and a sherpa who were both grinning ear to ear, genuine joy displayed across their faces. Before we get to the finale of this exciting expose on predator &amp; prey, I must first bring you a spectacle like no other; The Suffering Tree. They walk off screen and footage of their trail through the jungle and towards a large clearing plays as Barclay continues to talk. The Suffering Tree, or The Ouroboros Tree as its known to the locals, was once thought to be that of a legend until famed explorer Archibald Maitland Williams discovered it during his 19th century expedition to the new world. He had little interest in it, save for a remarkable Tortoise thatd survived in the fields nearby, but he reported it in his exploration novels nonetheless and provided the next generation of westerners the tools to study it and bring their troubles to its roots. As Barclay finishes, the shot of them walking into the clearing pans 180 degrees to show what theyre looking at; A gargantuan oak tree towering higher than anything Id ever seen, the black roots digging deep into the ground and the branches sprawling across the forest. This was like some kind of mother tree but the size of a skyscraper, the tops of its branches impossible to see. Barclay puts his hands on his hips and sighs before mopping his brow and turning to the camera, Millie still shaking with fear. The Tree gets its name not only because of its life affirming properties, but because of HOW it amasses such properties. It is provided through the will of its believers. For when they discover it and provide a darkness from their lives that is more potent and insidious than any other, the tree will do its part to excise it. So long as the user gives up a life it loves to take, a life it hates, there will always be a place within this trees branches for that hatred. Allow me to demonstrate. Millie chokes on her sobs and begs it not to show, but Barclay pulls at one of the branches and a fetid growth descends from up high like it was waiting to be greeted. A thick, black and red tendril pulsing with power and bile ends in the spine of an extremely decayed man; his nude body twitching and necrotic tissue apparent all over him. Large holes where pustules had recently burst riddle his abdomen, thighs and even his head, one bursting right below his neck as an Emerald Cockroach crawls out, stinging him in a fresh spot before flying off to continue its cycle. The mans eyes are wide, his jaw open in an almost scream, save for some low gurgling moans and grunts. This man was one of the more vile creatures accepted into the tree. His sentencer was a victim of years of painful abuse and he repeatedly told his religious family that it was HER fault for how he acted. Because, after all, if she hadnt dressed that way or behaved so capriciously, he wouldnt have had to do what he did Barclay spat on the man and dug his finger into one of the wounds, letting the digit sink all the way into the wound and black blood spilling onto his hand. We may be monsters by your perception, but I assure you, we can be just in our behaviours. We even took measures to ensure this man NEVER forgot what he did for the remainder of his natural life. The camera pans down and shows his lower half, mutilated and filled with parasites. Warren vomits and Millie collapses to the floor, screaming as we all struggle to comprehend what were seeing. Surely, she would say it was her fault, that she was to blame. But, such is the nature of a victim, and our network deduced the only way forward was to rip the bandaid off entirely. We are not monsters, but arbiters of true justice. Through our programming, we wish to ensure every member of our esteemed audience knows that Beneath The Static, there is a truth and we will expose it to ensure you are bettered for it. With that being said Once more, the scene shifts back to the scene of the leaf man and the child. Something attracts the childs attention and they dart off screen, though at this point I believe Im the only one watching. Preston is standing in the corner looking at the wall to calm himself, Warren is cleaning up his vomit and Mathias and Fay are tending to Millie. The leaf man turns towards the camera, his head still tilted but the bug eyes and mandibles catching my attention immediately. His cracked skin, neat brown hair still apparent underneath his camouflage as his mouth parts click and hiss. Only two more to go and well know what you did. There is an ebb, a flow, and a truth to what we do. Soon, you will know what Ouroboros truly means. Soon, you will all be exposed. JJ leans in closer, this malformed mantis monstrosity boring its way into my skull as I feel my eyes burn, repeating back the exact same thing Id seen in Fays drawings weeks before, the same thing in her- no, OUR nightmares. **YOUR TURN.** ---- It was an hour after the show had ended; the TV was switched off, and we turned our armchairs to form a makeshift circle that Millie told us what had happened. We knew she was born into a very strict Mormon culture and while none of us, save for Preston, had any real religious views. But, in her culture, family and god were absolute and there was a hierarchy to be respected. Her brother being far older than her was often left in charge and, in his own words to Millie, said she developed at a remarkably young age and so felt it necessary to purge the sin out of her the way only a man can. I wont go into the particulars, but you get the picture. When Millie was 13, she fell pregnant by way of him and was determined to get rid of it. But, after finally finding the courage (and necessity due to the pregnancy) to out her brother to her parents. They elected to side with him as the good boy tempted by the she-devil, casting her out and forcing her into foster care. Broken and devastated, she aborted and put up her guard over the next several years, becoming the person she always wanted to be while also striving to shed herself of that time in her life. To the surprise of nobody by this point, her brother and parents had gone on a missionary trip to South America the year prior, though Millie kept no contact with them save for knowing they were nowhere near her. The entire family went missing, and it was expected they succumbed to the elements, that natural predators lurking in the jungle or a native tribe had killed them. This brought small comfort, but some degree of catharsis, she admitted. That being said, JJ had a remarkable way of pulling out our innermost shame, our darkest secrets and laying them bare. We just didnt know why. One by one, we all talked about how we were feeling up to that point, our anxieties over what had been said, our fears over what WILL be said and our resolve to finish this. **Fay:** Im not stopping, theres nothing he can say about me or Tristan thatd make us wanna quit, right? **Tristan:** Yeah, Im with you. Weve done some dark stuff, but nothing wed ever wanna hide from you guys. Plus, wed feel shitty if we dropped out now when youd all gone through it. That aint the Muldoon way. **Warren:** I wanna smash JJs face in, I dont know HOW were gonna find him, but we will. Because once the next episode airs and hes done with all of us, the fuck is he gonna do then? My bet is hell want a face to face, settle the score. **Mathias:** Well, this man, monster, whatever has abilities we dont fully grasp. Hes clever, has people around him who he can manipulate and knows SO much about us. I think we need to do some research ahead of next weeks meet, finally get our heads out of our asses and fight back. Right? **Preston:** mm, Ill join you, you need someone like me to keep you on track and stop you overthinking too much. **Mathias:** I do NOT overthink too much. **Fay:** Remember when you had an anxiety attack over black holes? **Tristan:** Oh yeah, you hyperventilated thinking about being sucked into one and the absence of nothingness **Fay:** Local man is terrified of becoming space spaghetti. There was a smatter of laughter around the room and for the first time in a long time, we felt better. **Mathias:** Its a normal reaction to something so fucking horrifying, okay? But sure, Preston, Id appreciate the help. Millie: Whatever you decide, Im in. I wanna prove that Im not that girl anymore. We put our hands in, each one of us determined to make sure that we held up our end of the bargain. Of course, you know how this ends. The next time we met was The Day of Separation, the worst day in our lives and one that was permanently etched into our collective memories for 10 agonising years. Because, if Im being truthful, the name wasnt just to imply we broke up as a friendship group. Nor was it a way of explaining what happened at Mantis Reach. It was the day one of our group members was taken from us. By the network. By JJ. We watched them on air as they were stolen away. And 10 years on [we dont know how to get them back.](URL"
6,vulnerability,nosleep,I interviewed the survivors of a mass suicide. My last broadcast will never air.

I know that he is in his late forties, but he appears significantly older.* You always hear about it being something that happens to kids, wandering around in places where they oughtnt, fucking about near a well and then *plop*, in they go. I guess it shouldnt have been a surprise that I went down, what with my bad leg. But the truth is, the first thing I felt when I opened my eyes wasnt pain or confusion, it was just sheer embarrassment. You always hear about kids falling down wells, not 38-year-old men. But there I was, slightly dodgy hip, lodged in a fucking thirty foot hole in the ground. Not that there had been any warning. No signs, no wall, just a literal hole half-way down the slope of a hill that Id come cresting over. Just bad luck really. Coming the other way, I would have spotted it a mile away and avoided it easily enough. But I didnt, and I was left stuck in the darkness in waist high water that was stale and dark and smelled of piss (possibly mine). Thank fuck I had my phone on me and it had kept dry in jacket pocket. A quick call and my sister was on her way with the police, but what did that mean really? Well, it meant I wouldnt die in there, but it wasnt like I could give her my exact location. I didnt have GPScouldnt get it down there eitherand she had to *get* the police and then come find me and that wasnt going to be quick. So I was stuck down there, not forever, but in the end it took them 11 hours to find me, and a further two to rescue me. Those thirteen hours? To me, they were like the longest book ever written. It started with a kind of patient stoicism. I resisted the urge to panic, especially knowing help was on the way. I disregarded my surroundings and focused on the light overhead, I ignored the smell around me and the way the water made my skin tingle. I told myself I wouldnt let it get to me, the blind panic. I focused on my breathing, spoke aloud to break the silence, I even sang for a while. That was the first hour. Sooner or later my mind was going to wander, it had to. So I tried to set it on an organised path. I kicked around with my feet until I hit something solid. It was a beam of wood, I stood up on it, lifted myself a further six inches out of the water, then stood back down. It was too hard to balance on, what with my leg. But that was pretty much all I could sense around me. It sounds silly now, but I didnt want to look around too much, so I kept my phone light off for that fist hour. It was the spiders. I knew they were down there. Im terrified of them and I know from experience the best place to find the big nasty hairy ones is in a dark hole rarely tread by human feet. And oh boy, was this place hallowed ground for arachnids. So far Id roughly figured out that the wall was soft earth with thick roots bulging out, but I could hear something dripping and it wasnt above or below it was next to me, and somehow it sounded far away. I told myself this was exactly why I had to keep my mind on track; the dripping didnt matter. It didnt mean anything. But it was a long time to stand there and pretend like I wasnt terrified so in the end I gave in, I turned the light on and regretted it instantly. There were at least seven of them, massive enormous hairy things. Too big for home living, these werent the kind of house spider youd find under a sofa. I hated them, I hated the sight of them, their sheer presence burning a hole in my skin right through the clothes. The biggest one was nearly as wide as my palm, and for a brief moment I told myself Id fallen right into my personal hell. The thought was right, my timing was wrong. As soon as it was on, my light sent all the buggers crawling away, and okay, while the sight of their wiry legs clamouring over each other nearly made me sick, the truth was thats all there was to it. They were harmless, utterly and completely benign. And once they were gone I was finally able to recall why Id turned my light on in the first place, and I swung it around looking for the source of the dripping until I spotted a small cast-iron grate in the wall. Im not exactly an expert on wells, so I wasnt quite sure what to make of it. I generally figured wells were full of water or just big holes. If any tunnels intersected them they ought to be full of water too, or at the very least made by underground rivers and so on. Who, I wondered, took the time or effort to stick a great big bloody grate on one of these tunnels and for what possible reason? To keep someone out? To keep them in? And this tunnel was no more than two or three foot high, and the grate even smaller than that, maybe a foot at most. I tried angling the light around but all I saw were dripping walls thick with clay and stone, a place so utterly dark it practically resisted the torch. For a brief moment I considered trying to pull the grate loose, but I was concerned it might damage the structure of the well. I also couldnt say for sure whether I wanted to get much closer to it than I already was. I tried telling myself that it was a calming presence. The tunnel right beside me should have done something to break up the oppressive sense of enclosing space, but if anything it made me feel vulnerable. I looked up towards the light and saw no sign of anything, just a pale blue disk, and I wondered briefly if the spiders had left me behind for well, for what? I didnt know. I was thinking silly things that at the time didnt seem rational. But the feeling felt as real as the water soaking my hips and legs. I felt vulnerable once I knew about the tunnel. I didnt like having it there, right by me, and without thinking I angled away towards the opposite wall. I turned my light off and, desperate to clear my mind of this worry, I looked back up towards the sky. And someone was looking down. I should have leaped with joy, and for a moment I almost did. But I couldnt see this person. It wasnt like glimpsing a mate on the street. All I could see was an outline, a shadow cut right out of the sky. The distance felt alienating, I couldnt hear or see a thing about them. It was all drips and splashes by me but from up there? Nothing but the stony silence of a gentle breeze. And this person, they were leaning over the hole with both arms across the span as if they were surveying a catch. I suddenly felt a little like a trapped rodent. Hello! I cried out. Ive fallen down! Ive fallen They slid away without making a noise. It could have been nothing, no one there at all except a trick of the light. Or perhaps there was someone and all they saw was darkness. Perhaps the wind was so strong up there they had no chance of hearing me. Or perhaps I looked back at the grating, that sense of vulnerability magnified. My mind was making the strangest connections. Wasnt the Kentworth compound nearby? Didnt they dig tunnels? Kids talk about strange shapes and noises up there all the time. But thats just hearsay and rumour, isnt it? By now my heart was racing. Isnt it amazing how vivid the imagination can be sometimes? I got lost in my own head, standing there, eyes wide, staring at the patch of shadow where I felt a gentle draft waft through. I couldnt see a damn thing but in my head I could picture everything clearly. Right there, just a few feet away, was a twisted monster, their smile pinned wide to either side of their head like in that Hellraiser film that scared the hell out of me as a kid. And I kept replaying this scene over and over, torturing myself. Sometimes itd be a dead kid, pale hands clutching either side of the bar, a malicious ghost intent on trapping me in a twisted re-enactment of their own death. Other times itd be spiders, one great big one popping the grate aside so its crooked knotted legs could envelope and drag me towards the centre of its octagonal body. Or maybe even thousands of little ones bulging through the bars like jelly pushed through a sieve! To think that kind of terror lies beneath all our feet. All I had to work with were slippery walls, water, and mud, but in a few short hours my own head turned that place into Hades itself. I kept wondering how it had gone from a brisk morning walk to unrelenting psychological torture in a single misplaced step. And eventually it got too much to bear. I checked my phone and saw that it had been no more than half an hour since I last looked. All that my imagination had done was slow down the passage of time and make it infinitely worse so I worked up the nerve to turn on the light and re-examine the small tunnel. It was just like before, just mud and stagnant water that trickled so faintly into the well, it didnt even make a noise. I moved the light around some more, but every time I did the shadow cast by the bars moved all over the place. It was like a strobe light and I was getting ready to give up when my brain told me to freeze. I didnt know why, not straight away, but it had done so with such urgency that I stopped completely. And thats when I saw it  movement that had been masked by my own. I still couldnt say what exactly it was, but it looked almost like the wall itself was moving. And then the wall looked at me. What was just seconds ago a misshapen pile of mud was a head turning to look right fucking at me. There was no nose, not even a mouth really, just features cut into clay, but those eyes were bloodshot orbs, rich and vivid with detail, familiar but somehow utterly alien. I couldnt read them, their expression, and that scared the hell out of me. My mind was on fire with a thousand questions about who they were, how they got there, if they were even human But the one that was embossed in red letters and splayed across my mind like a neon exit sight, that was the one that I seized on and couldnt let go. What did they want? They didnt flinch when I spotted them, but they did start moving faster. It felt like I was watching myself from afar, like an out of body experience. I couldnt fathom that this was happening. That someone was down there, looking like something out of a horror film and moving right towards me. When they reached the grate they started to push against it, and this thing was exactly riveted into concrete. I could see it starting to bulge, and I ran forward and slammed a foot against the metal to hold it in place. That meant getting closer though, and it meant I got a glimpse of them before I kicked the grate back into place. All I saw were bits and pieces, eyes, rotting teeth, something shiny that caught the light. I soon got to find out what that was when something slid into the heel of my foot, long and sharp. I pulled back immediately, shocked and disgusted at the sight of blood running and mixing with the rancid ground water I stood in, and when I looked back there was a glistening blade slip jutting from between the bars. And then, it repeated. The grate started to move, started to push. A single eye, penny sized pupils with ghostly reflections, looked back at me with terrifying apathy. I stepped forward and kicked again, this time they missed. But I saw the full length of that blade and part of me registered just how bad the situation was. The next time I kicked at them, I wasnt so lucky and the blade slipped right into the arch of my foot, tearing through the roof of my hiking shoes and painting a gristly image on the way back out. But I didnt let up, I kept it there, holding it tight while my attacker indulged and hacked away like they were breaking up ice. The only sounds were my yelping, the splashing water, and the heavy gurgling breaths of whatever lay on the other side. And I thought it had been hell before When they eventually stopped attacking, my right foot was in ribbons and I fell back into the water with relief. Thank God I landed on that beam, it kept my head above the water and stopped me losing all balance. That thing grinned right then, stretching a toothless mouth from ear to ear that dribbled with pink froth. There was still no nose, no hair, just a shape carved right out of the mud. At least thats what it looked like. That hungry gullet must have led to a real flesh and blood stomach, my attacker probably no more than a lunatic caked in clay, but whoever they were theyd been twisted so far from the human ideal they scared me worse than any special effect Id ever seen. I found myself starting to scream. This thing wasnt going away. It wasnt slinking back into the depths. It was savouring this experience, savouring my terror and suffering. At least thats what I imagined, because in truth I dont know what it wanted. That face, even when smiling, looked like an idiots face devoid of all rational thought. It just kept breathing, panting, slobbering, eyes fixed on me like a pervert in the bushes. And I just wanted it to stop. I wanted to wake up, to burst the bubble and escape the hallucination. Anything except staying there like that, stuck in its line of sight while my mind turned the seconds into decades. I didnt pass out. I didnt wake up. It didnt try breaking through again. There was no conclusion, no inciting incident to push past the fear. Just me and that thing, less than a metre apart, and it would take *another seven hours* before I finally escaped. They amputated my foot, not just from the sheer damage that had been done to it, but because of the rancid infection that grew. The diseases lurking in that water damn near killed me and the official word is I broke my leg in a gnarly way and spent half a day trapped in a fever dream. Oh boy, I sure wish that was something I could believe. But every one of those long agonising seconds trapped down there are still engraved in my memory like an obituary in granite. I pinched myself, slapped myself, cried, wept, jumped up and down. Nothing about my time down there was a dream. It was hard, real, and when it caught the light it glistened like metal. \- *The current interviewee has requested strict anonynimity.* The acquisition of the compound in question was never up for discussion, with us or any one on the research team. It had been found, that was all that mattered. If not for that letter I would never have drawn the connection between the compound we tested and the events at the Kentworth compound. On one hand it was a relief to realise that this thing was bigger than just us, but at the same time I think wed all secretly been hoping wed been going mad and this suggested otherwise. Thank God we never moved onto human testing. Its bad enough we werent really equipped for the job. You always think that the government will choose people at the top of their game for this secret spy shit but more often than not they contract a company like ours and just dont tell anyone the truth. Ive heard they single out firms with poor safety records as a cover and wed just come out of a horrific scandal involving some children, a river, and a chemical that turns you blue. Even at the time I remember thinking wed make some pretty good patsies if thats what they were looking for. I was vindicated with time, but not before the worst of it. Like I said, we never got onto humans but we started out testing with mice and rats. When wed first mapped the chemical structure of the compound all our software told us itd be inert in the central nervous system, although one deep learning algorithm we sometimes use on forensic cases went buck wild and practically melted. We didnt think anything of it because the early tests that immediately followed showed that the compound was exactly that  inert. There were no behavioural changes whatsoever, and aside from odd electrical readings on an EEG, brain scans also showed no differences. Of course, some things need to accumulate over time. And brain scans are very limited in what they really tell us. Its like trying to predict what software a computer is running by getting a heat map of its components. Sure, it does tell you *something*. But its not exactly a magic window into the underlying activity. All you can do is just keep testing and see what comes of it. I suppose I should mention at this point that our lab was based in a pretty remote location. Our firm is a subsidiary of a subsidiary to some massive PMC, and we were housed with a few other teams on an oil rig looking into certain bacteria. And, well, this was a pretty tough place to live at the best of times. It was lonely but always busy, always teeming with hundreds of faceless people who ignored you as they rushed past. And my team, we were buried way down in the depths of this place, hanging over the sea beneath. So people got spooked. I dont know how exactly, but they did. It hadnt happened before, but one-by-one my staff start calling in sick more and more often until pretty soon Im left wondering why Ive been left in the lurch. Turns out, after a very frank and heated meeting I held one day in our lunchroom, that there was a kind of spreading anxiety. There were maybe six of us at most, and I listened as they told me about the way the rodents stared at them, the way machines were breaking at ten times the usual rate, and the way they felt watched in any given room when left alone. The worst thing was that Id noticed it too. The mice and rats had slowly changed. Behaviour had altered by degrees over the space of a month, and now they no longer squeaked or played or groomed. Instead they simply watched, and it was always us who held their attention. They stopped sleeping, eating, even moving. And a fair few of them started to die from sheer lethargy. That was when someone stepped up and told me how theyd seen something particularly worrying. They were cleaning out the tank one day, dumping the dead rats into a special refuse sack ready for incineration, when theyd reached in and the live ones attacked her, nipping at the heavy duty glove and fighting so violently that she lost it to their grip. Thankfully she pulled her hand out in time and snapped the glass lid shut, but the nightmare wasnt over. Because that was when the bag moved, the one filled with dozens of dead pink bodies, their dull-red eyes glaring at her from pointed albino faces. Thank God the incinerator is right there in the lab and thank God shed had the sense to turn it on ready. In one swift burst of terror and bravery she snatched the bag and practically threw it into the flames, crying at the sound of their pained squeals. But what was all of this I was hearing, exactly? I had to do something with the information, that was for sure, but I didnt know what. We took on dangerous work, we knew that. In the end I agreed to a new rule where no one would be left alone in the lab, even if someone had to go to the toilet theyd just have to go in pairs and stay close. I treated it as a kind of infectious fear, dismissing my concerns that we were all long-time staff used to the work conditions. I also decided to take on more of the lab work itself. And just to show everyone we were in no real threat, I took on a number of late-night tasks and did them on my own. I used to go in at night ready to run any necessary tests and do my best to pretend everything was okay. The thrum of the ocean and the endless cacophony of machines seemed impossibly distant down in that lab, and pretty soon I got the vague sense of being buried underground. It was the silence, see. That place was never silent, not even at night. There were thousands of specimens in that room and the other four that were adjacent. Mice, rats, rhesus monkeys, zebra fish, you name it, we had it. It wasnt like we could pop down to the corner shop we had to stock up and somehow, everything was just dead silent. Not a peep, squeak, howl, or gibber. The first time I noticed it I took stock of my surroundings and tried to swallow my terror. The specimens werent sleeping, at least not the rats. They were all wide eyed, backs pressed to their cages, glaring at the glass observation cases we used for testing. And the rats, in turn, were watching me, hind legs bunched ready to pounce, their pink ears upright and alert, and their slithering tails coiled around their rotund bodies. In the end I gave up pretending. I ran the tests so quickly I dropped a bottle of iodine and left it where it was rather than clean up. I decided Id come in early the next day to sort it out. Anything, I told myself, anything was better than staying there on my own. When it came time to run a new condition, to take half the rats that had survived and stop their intake of the compound, I thought itd be good to see what happened. I was still nave enough to find all this oh so slightly thrilling. The pulse pounding terror I felt was still just alien enough, and things still seemed safe enough, that I wanted to go ahead. I couldnt even imagine just how I mean, I figured theyd die or go back to normal, right? They tore through themselves, and then the glass. And thats not an exaggeration. They tore through themselves first and then, with limbs half severed and guts exposed, they moved onto the glass and gored themselves making a hole. Were still not entirely sure how they did it, but as soon as they were through they made a beeline for the other rats, the ones still on the drug, still unaffected. One of the technicians tried to interfere but pulled back after a few of the rats broke away from the quivering sea of furry bodies and started nipping at his heels. By the time someone finally rigged up some liquid nitrogen to blast them with, theyd broken through to their companions and soaked the walls in blood. When it was over we were left with one hell of an ice sculpture. The way theyd obscured the glass with bloody smears meant we never got a proper look at what was going on, but once the mist had cleared and all you could hear was the cracking of ice and flesh we saw a mound of half-melted flesh. It was like a battle-scene paused in time, except the mountain of gore took on a strange quality close to the centre. We spotted rats with three eyes, five legs, two tails, so on. It was like they had started to merge, like cell division in reverse. I remember we were arguing over whether to incinerate it. I was attempting to put forward the case for keeping it, arguing we owed our employer results and this was one of the most profound things we could offer them. Maybe theyd even up our funding! The others werent having it though, crying for me to just let them dump the whole thing in the fire. I was dead set against it until, from behind, I heard a quiet rustling. I looked back. Wed spent hours staring at that thing and arguing with each other, and close to the very top you could see the frost receding. And where it had faded, and white fur bunched together in impossible knots began to thaw, there was the faintest motion of a single claw flexing and scrabbling at the ice, as if making to break free. I burned it. The others thought it was a moral victory of some kind. Hell, even I felt a flush of rightness as three of us hurled it into the searing heat. But I also knew we didnt live in a fairy tale, and our employers would want to know what happened. Maybe it was because I was the guy whod have to explain it to them, but I didnt think theyd be too happy with what I had to say. And of course, they werent. Any hopes of a funding rise went out the window, and I was told pretty much point blank Id lose my job if we didnt carry on with further tests. I asked if that meant more rats and the answer made me feel like I was losing my mind. Oh no, they said. We were moving onto the monkeys. \- *The man before me is unusual only in that he is wearing sunglasses even in a darkened room. Unlike all other interviewees, he reached out to me to discuss his thoughts on the Kentworth compound and insisted I hear his thoughts on the matter. He is wiry but exudes a calm energy,* [amongst other things,](URL *and speaks calmly into the microphone.* Youre smaller than I expected. Sorry, that was a little joke. Its just Ive heard of you, have you heard of me? Im something of a writer and, I dont know. Maybe Peter read my book or one of the others at his cult. I met him once, bought a book off his father. He was rude. I think he thought I was a tourist, someone passing through looking for a bit of inspiration to write another cheap novel. I thought he was a little shit, truth be told. And I ignored the angry teenager until his father finally sent him out the room and our business continued. If youd told me he would go on to do what he did, I would have thought it unlikely. Despite all his supposed power, Peter was just a little boy trying to reach his mother. She had been a strict Christian, and she met a mysterious end not long after her husband returned from a most peculiar overseas trip. I can bloody well imagine how she must have reacted to her first glimpse of his nocturnal activities. What I cant imagine is her going along with it. I think Peter figured that out too, and I think he spent the rest of his life desperately trying to prove her right. But, at the same time, the power within those books is undeniable. Their mere existence pisses all over the notion of an Abrahamic god, or at least one who cares about us. And there, I think, lay the first seed of Peter Rollinss very strange activities. He wanted to find God and he wanted to do it in a way that proved once and for all that his mother and father *could* have coexisted. But what do I know? Im just a writer, an armchair psychologist. I cant help but wonder if you know that, though. Or whether it might be necessary to afford a little context to the things you see. *Context is always good, I explain.* Well, that was why Peter went looking for God. What he found, of course, was an observer, someone who watches. Only Peter had never really thought too hard about philosophy, or the world, or the very essence of knowledge. It didnt occur to him that in the same way we have the idea of somethinglets say a chairin our head, so too must this other thing learn and remember us. To be known is a very powerful thing, some might say the very building blocks of our existence are made out of nothing more than neurons and molecules. We think nothing of it, looking at something and making a representation of it buried deep within our minds. If Peter had read his fathers work a little more closely he might have realised that there are some things that do not think in electricity, but rather in bubbling meat and hard physical matter. Whole universes made of a single living thing whose mind works on the turning of planets and the dying of stars. A cosmic brain where everything thought is rendered not in abstract patterns of neural activity, but in actual real physical matter. And everything it sees, observes, knows, gets added to its mind. Which of course means Peter is still alive, in a sense. You know we have this saying about how the dead live on in our memories? Well, depending on whos remembering you, thats not always a good thing. Especially not when your own memories and thoughts are part of reality and so youre just kind of spilling out everywhere. And thats not even to get onto the topic of the *other* things that are tucked away in the memory of this Cosmic being. When Peter first burst the membrane between realities Id hazard a guess more things poured out than were sucked in. That bit of land wont be right again for another million years by my estimate. Everythings a little thinner there now, and Id bet some things are still very keen on reaching right on over and reliving the last party they had. Its like sticking your hand through the bars of a lion cage. I guess the irony is Peter went looking for God, but he wound up finding a pretty good substitute for the Christian notion of Hell. Then again, hes also in a place where his own thoughts can be reality. I bet he gets off on that. Wouldnt surprise me if hes just recreated the Kentworth compound with more underage girls and no money troubles. He really did strike me as that shallow. Although somehow I doubt hes having a ball over there. At least he has friends, right? And an ever-expanding list at that. *Theyre unlikely to cross paths.* Ah, right, big place. *Bigger than you can imagine.* I suspect thats by design. We humans werent meant to know everything. I guess that must make all of this *\[The interviewee gestures to my body\]* a bit of a trip. Can I ask something? Do they know? Am I giving it away? Where do you even publish this? I guess it doesnt matter to you does it. All that matters are that people read it because you only need a flicker of their attention to recognise them and then, *boom,* got em. You can look anywhere, just so long as you know where it is you want to look. *Im not hurting anyone.* No but I think most people would agree its an eerie idea. Anyone you look at I mean, am I being remade right now over there? In your world? Well, I guess time isnt linear for you is it? What was it I read: it expands ever outwards like the stars in the sky? So in a sense your *idea* of Peter predated the real, actual Peter. *Apples and oranges.* Well, I suppose the upside of it is that Im sort of immortal now, arent I? Therell always be an exact physical copy of me over there, living, breathing, existing. Its just a little uncomfortable to imagine what exactly that must be like. And everyone else? Anyone who reads this? *It would be like asking you to unremember a chair you just looked at. Everyone who is made of aware of me, is in turn brought to my attention.* Remarkable. Absolutely remarkable. Are you going to go for the whole world or just a nice collection? *I havent actually thought about it. I have certainly enjoyed the observing of people up close, just as I have enjoyed watching the people who read the transcripts.* Well, you have all the time in the world to decide. *Yes, I suppose I do.* I dont suppose while Ive got you here you have anything to do with my own little predicament do you? *No, that was entirely your own doing.* *Do you have anything else to add to your testimony? I am, after all, meant to be doing the observing.* No, no, thats fair enough. I understand. I appreciate you speaking to me like this. Its been a long journey getting here. *I know*. Right, of course you do. You have created an atom-perfect replica of my own brain. And, in fact, you created it before I was born. *Try not to think about it.* I could tell you the same thing! I guess if I do have anything to add, its that you should know Peter Rollins was a nasty piece of work but his followers were all just down on their luck. Im not an overly compassionate fellow but Id like to think theyre not at the mercy of whatever else lurks in the *literal* corridors of your mind. Id like to think that if they are burning, that somehow, Peters fire is a little bit hotter than everyone elses. Because I know what some of those rites involved, I also know the kind of pain you have to inflict on a person to learn what he learned, and well He really does deserve it."
7,vulnerability,nosleep,I have to get to the platform on my stairs by midnight,1,i0dgh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i0dgh5/i_have_to_get_to_the_platform_on_my_stairs_by/,2020-07-30 11:53:59,"Hi. My name is Ruby, and Im a cannibal. Well, sometimes Im a cannibal. In the day time, I run a quaint little tea shop, but every full moon after midnight, the hunger for human flesh begins to grow inside of me. Its taken me years to figure out how to stop it, and unfortunately, Ive left scores of victims in my wake. When I change, however, I don a different physical appearance every time. This is how Ive managed to avoid several life sentences. The key to curbing my hunger is a strange one: on the night of a full moon, exactly at midnight, I have to be standing on the central landing of my houses staircase. Otherwise, my body will rearrange itself to look like someone elses, and at least one victim is always bound to succumb to my ravenous teeth. I realized how to stop my affliction purely by coincidence. Or maybe luck. Either way, one night, a night on which I knew the moon was full, I didnt sleep. I was kept awake like I was on most full-moon nights, haunted by the deaths I had caused in the past, anticipating the bloodshed of the coming hours. I tossed and turned for a while, and eventually I decided to go downstairs and see if having a late-night snack might help to distract my growling stomach. I usually fasted on full moons. I tiptoed down the first stairs and checked my watch. 11:59. As I stepped onto the landing just above where the second set of stairs turns the corner, the time changed to 12:00. I paused, waiting for that special kind of hunger to hit. My stomach growled, but it growled for a midnight bowl of cereal instead of raw people meat. I stared at my watch and put my hand on my stomach, but still, nothing happened. And then the time changed to 12:01. I blinked and shook myself out of my trance, then I dared to step off the landing and onto the next step down. I continued to the bottom, and instead of sprinting out the front door with saliva dripping down the chin of some face that wasnt my own, I turned into the kitchen and took out a bowl and a spoon. The sugar from the cereal kept me up for a few more hours, but the regular, old food was enough to satiate my belly. I marveled at the new phenomenon, and at last, I fell asleep dreaming of ice cream and cake instead of severed limbs and disembodied eyeballs. After that night, I always made sure to set an alarm so that I could make it to the landing by midnight. Everything was working out just fine, until I came home one day to see a flyer posted on my door. EVICTION NOTICE, it read. My heart skipped a beat. I was terrified, but not surprised. I had failed to pay my full rent for three months in a row, and I was already late for this month. My tea shop could hardly support me any more and, having taken a bite out of my mother at a young age and subsequently being put up for adoption, I had no family to fall back on. I panicked for a while and tried to figure out how I could get some money together quickly, but I came up with nothing. I prepared for the worst. Fast forward a few days, and I arrive home to see my stuff out on the curb. This was it. My house wasnt mine any more, and neither was that special landing on the staircase. I grabbed what I could and took to the streets. It wasnt something I was entirely unfamiliar with given my rocky childhood, but it wasnt something I embraced either. The first few nights werent so bad, actually. I snuck into the gym for showers and I was able to run into work and pretend like everything was normal. Then, I lost the business, too, and I had nothing. A couple weeks passed and things got harder and worse. My former house had a demolition notice hanging in the same spot where the eviction notice had been. I was begging for spare change in the daytime and trying not to get murdered in the night. The day of the incident, I had stolen a pack of beer from some other passed-out drunk and allowed myself to get sloshed in my misery back on my corner where I slept. The world was spinning just enough to take my mind off of the pain when the aforementioned drunk stumbled up to me. You took my shit, you stupid bitch! he slurred loudly. Youre too late to get it back, I slurred right back, ending my sentence with a hiccup. Ill take what I came for, he growled, then he clamped his fingers around my small wrist and yanked me to my feet. I nearly fell back down but I managed to keep my balance. Look man, Im sorry. Ill buy you another pack as soon as I can afford it. His grip tightened. I knew I should have been nervous, but the thought only registered very distantly in my mind. Quiet, he said, grumbling under his breath. Then he began to drag me out of the tunnel beneath the overpass and into the surrounding woods. I kicked and yelled as best I could, which wasnt very well at all. Im a lightweight and I was really hammered, plus it really hurt to struggle. My inebriated brain thought that it was better to just go along with him. Im not going to describe what happened to me in the woods, Im sure you can imagine it yourself. Unfortunately, most women on the street (and a lot of women in general) are prone to being victims of such terrible sexual violence that to describe it would make me sick to my stomach, and I eat people, so thats saying something. When he was done, he zipped up his stained pants and lumbered off back the way we came. I was too drunk and exhausted to find my way back, so I ended up just passing out on the forest floor, naked, with tears running down my bruised face. In the morning, I put on my tattered, now torn clothes and eventually stumbled upon the main road. I didnt bother going to the police. To them, I was just another piece of scum tarnishing their otherwise pristine streets. A week went by, and every night I was haunted by nightmares of the blurred memories of his face, his fingers, his breath, his hands on my skin. Thinking about it made me nauseous. But I had bigger things to worry about in my near future. I walked past my house that week. There were a dozen people on what used to be my front lawn, but no bulldozers yet. I needed to find a way to sneak in that night- it was to be the night of a full moon. I wasnt sure what I was going to do once it was gone. There were workers there during the day, but at night, I might be able to slip in without being noticed. I left the demolition site and waited out the rest of the day anxiously in my tunnel. I regretted using my pity-change for black tea, because the caffeine only made me more jittery. It had been enough hours since the sun had gone down, so I started off toward the house. I walked through the empty streets and looked up at the large, round, yellow moon hanging in a sky full of stars. For a moment I admired its natural beauty, but then I remembered the violence that it foreshadowed for me. Instead, I paid attention to the sounds around me- the distant honks of car horns, the breeze whooshing past my ears, the echo of my footsteps. It wasnt until I was just around the corner from the house that I noticed there were two sets of footsteps. I whipped around and saw a tall figure standing in the shadows maybe thirty yards behind me. Hi again, you dumb bitch, he called out. He wasnt close enough that I could see his face or smell his breath, but I would recognize that beer gut and slimy voice anywhere. It was him. With a shaky voice, I replied, I thought you said I was a stupid bitch. Now youre saying Im a dumb bitch. Got me all confused, which one am I? Sometimes when I panic I cope by being a smartass. It was not helpful in this case. Youre both, he concluded, then he rushed me. I sprinted in the opposite direction, but unfortunately, the guy seemed stone cold sober tonight and full of focused rage. He came directly at me and was on top of me in no time. This time he didnt bother dragging me anywhere to start tearing off my clothes and punching me in the jaw and eye sockets. This time I screamed, but nobody was around to hear me. If there was, they didnt offer any help. Quiet! he yelled, contradicting his own command. He held me down and I clenched my teeth and stared at the moon. Suddenly, a strange calm washed over me. He looked at me strangely as I had stopped struggling. That moment was my chance to take advantage of his vulnerability. I kneed him hard in the balls and as his hand flew to his crotch, my hand was freed and I punched him in the throat. He toppled over as his other hand went to his throat. This was my opportunity to get up and run away. Instead, I pounced on top of him and slashed my fingernails across his eye. The eyeball turned bright red with blood and his face seeped the dark liquid as well. Then I stood and wrenched his hand out and under my foot. I listened to the satisfied crunch of his finger bones under my feet as I ground my dirty shoe forcefully into his hand. He screamed and tried to grab me with his other hand. As he reached at me, I caught his wrist and chomped off one finger at a time. I spit out each finger after biting them off and forced them down his throat. His face struggled to breathe, but I clamped my teeth down on his carotid and jerked my head back and forth violently, flinging blood everywhere. The limp artery hung loosely in my jaw, and I slurped it up like a noodle. Then I sipped at the water fountain of blood that had sprung from his neck. He tried to scream despite the finger gag, and I looked him dead in the eyes and said, Quiet. Then I bit off his lips and chewed on them the way I used to chew gummy worms on ice cream sundaes. He was growing very pale very fast, but before he bled out, I chewed off one last appendage- yes, the one youre thinking of- and jammed it up somewhere where it didnt belong. Then I watched the life drain from his eyes, and everything was silent. I stared at him for a few minutes, then I looked at the blood on my hands with their chipped, dirty nails- and I realized I was staring at my hands. MY hands. I was me, and not someone else. I checked my watch. 11:45. It wasnt even midnight yet. In shock, I fled the scene and ran the rest of the way to the house. I would have been too late, anyway. The building was already destroyed. Ive been on the run ever since I committed my first voluntary murder in my own skin. Since that night, and the many full moons that have passed, I have never had the craving for human flesh again. Im not sure if it was the destruction of the house that broke the curse or if I had needed to murder someone of my own accord all along, but either way, Im glad both things happened. Ive been able to start my life over somewhere else (a place which I will not name), and though Ive struggled the whole way, I have finally built a life for myself that makes me happy. I run a much more successful cafe where I live now, we serve all sorts of teas, coffees, and baked goods. Im really proud of the establishment, and Im glad that something good could come from something so awful. So, if you ever find me, which I doubt you ever will, come on by the tea shop and pop in for drinksor maybe even a [bite.](URL"

9,vulnerability,nosleep,"Words of Wisdom, Part 6",6,h8bpfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/h8bpfy/words_of_wisdom_part_6/,2020-06-14 03:26:56,"NSFW: Sexual Violence, Gore *""Two's company, but three's a crowd.""* Yet, another of my mother's phrases. She said this often in regard to my absentee sperm donor. I often asked her who my father was. She once told me he could have been any of 30 guys at a party. She *allegedly* was gang raped at party. She also told me it was her ""boyfriend"" who turned her out at 19. Mother was equally evasive with any other questions I had about my father. In her typically spiteful style she would often end the attempted conversation with *""Two's company, and three's a crowd. You came along, and he took off.""* ..... I could say I hated to be the bearer of bad news, but it honestly has never bothered me. I would rather be the messenger any day of the week than to be the one on the receiving end. Of course, I knew well that ""bad"" was the understatement of the century on this occasion. The particular bomb I had just dropped on you was doing what I now know I would not have been able to accomplish with you in a million years. I watched with the cold, detached fascination of a scientist observing a lab rat in a maze. I watched as the *real* you came forth before my very eyes. Shock, fear, and disbelief were a thin veneer for the purest, most feral rage which took over your previously controlled demeanor. You had the look of a desperate, trapped animal that was backed into a corner. Something began to grow within me as I witnessed you metamorph into the alpha predator I knew was lurking within you. A feeling akin to the tingle of a light electric shock began to build deep in the core of my being. I was actually feeling *something*, and it was something I had never felt before. It was a perfect amalgamation of ecstasy and agony. Oh, how I longed to feel the full brunt of your rage destroy me, and render me powerless to your whims and desires. All I desired now was for your white-hot fire to consume the whole of me until nothing should remain, except so many ashes scattered to the winds. The way you glared at me in perfect hatred, as if I had personally betrayed you, sent a shiver of desire down my spine from the back of my neck to my warm center between my thighs. If I had any remaining doubts about you being The One, they were dispelled in that moment. A smug grin I could not suppress wouldn't leave my face. I was right about you! *He's perfect* I thought in total awe of your raw power and passion. ""Show me the paper."" You growled at me like a wild animal. The look on your face was one of absolute devastation, anguish, and blind rage. He looked as if he were about to explode, and I wanted to feel his seething vitriol rain down upon me. I knew just a nudge in the right direction would be my end, and I could die happy. ""But we were having so much fun togeth-"" I was cut off abruptly as his fist narrowly missed my head, and left a hole the size of his fist in the wall next to my head. *Wow. He has REALLY shitty aim.* I thought. ""Do not fuck with me!"" He screamed. Then, he suddenly collapsed to the floor. I realized then that even in his rage he still maintained enough control to consciously refuse to harm me. I knew if I was to get what I wanted from him, then I would need to take an altogether different approach. I would woo him with my absolute submission to him. Then, perhaps if I serve him well he will favor me with a personal demonstration of his talent for inflicting pain. I did as he had demanded, and stood there admiring how beautiful he looked to me in his current tortured state. The anguish etched on his face was enviable, but it made my chest ache with an unfamiliar pain. I was saddened by witnessing him in such a seemingly weak and desperate state. It was wrong! He, the perfect predator, was never supposed to show weakness or vulnerability. Especially not in the presence of someone like me. I was never supposed to see him like this! His mask of normalcy- the facade he wore to blend in and hide his true nature from the world- hadn't just slipped. It was gone completely. I was trying to wrap my mind around seeing him so vulnerable. Then, as if the answer had suddenly struck him like a bolt of lightning, he regained all his composure. His face became a mask of absolute Zen-like calm, and he looked up as if he were just noticing that I was even in the room. I held the paper in a way so that you could see the headline and your mugshot. *This is going in my scrapbook.* I thought as you picked yourself up off the floor. You calmly took the paper from me, and began to read. Your face betrayed no emotion, but your eyes- your beautiful, hypnotic blue eyes- were alight with rage. *Yes!* I thought, and that stupid grin I seemed unable to contain was back. My mind began drifting to thoughts of what you could do to me. As I observed the fire in your eyes I began to feel that tingle again in the deepest parts of my being. When you finished reading the article, and finally looked at me, I could see the rage building within you again. Your anger was so palpable I could almost feel it cutting into my very soul like so many razor blades. The tension between us was overwhelming and delicious. I knew that I had no choice but to break it if we were going to go any further. I began by pointing out the obvious, as I would never wish to imprison such a beautiful beast as you. *You should be free to roam wild and do as you please. My God, you are too beautiful to not be free* I thought, and wisely kept that thought to myself. I didn't understand why I was becoming infatuated with you, but I thought it best if I didn't let you know the true depth of your power over me yet. That was something to saved for a more intimate occasion. I maintained my arrogant facade of being in control of the situation, although I did I hope I was contrite enough about needing you to hide until I could remedy the situation. I offered to make things as pleasant as possible, and hopefully you as amenable as well, until I could speak to my brother and make this go away for us. I changed my tone to a hushed tone of deference and respect as I asked you, rather than demand of you, this: ""Just give me an opportunity to fix this, and then you can come and go as you please."" I knew that now was the time to make my move, as I knew I had your absolute attention. I didn't realize then how I was altering our entwined fates, binding us in an unholy union of pain and pleasure. Had I known then what was to come, I would not have changed anything. I broke eye contact, which was becoming a more difficult task each time you held my gaze. I averted my eyes to your feet so I could kneel before you properly. I knew I only had one opportunity, and I didn't need to fuck it up by kneeling on your foot. I glanced up momentarily to take in your reaction, then I sat on my heels, placing my hands on my knees, and lowering my chin to my chest. The wicked smile on your face told me everything that I needed to know. I knew that offering myself to you in full submission was a risky proposition. You could have taken it as a sign of weakness and left. Fortunately, for me, it had the effect I had intended. You accepted my absolute submission to you like the gift I had intended it to be. For the first time in my life I actually found myself wanting to give someone absolute control over me. In the past I had submitted to lovers in order to receive the pain I sought out like a drug. However, this time was different. You were far more special to me than I had previously realized. I genuinely wanted- No, *needed*- you to possess me entirely. *What the fuck *is* this? What is this feeling you have brought to the surface?* I thought as you stood there staring down at me. I wondered if you were admiring your new pet. I wondered if you saw me differently now. I hoped that you might, but I didn't expect what was to happen next. You snapped your fingers, and I stood up, still looking at the floor. To become lost in those precious gems was something that I knew I couldn't allow myself to do at this time. Direct eye contact could be viewed as a challenge, and I didn't want to sour the moment with mixed signals. You lifted my chin so you could look me in the eye, then you said something I wasn't quite expecting. ""Come upstairs with me, I want you to see what I am capable of."" I wasn't sure if I would be getting a front-row seat to observe you at work, or if I was to be your next victim. The possibility that it could be either or even both made me excited and intrigued. I followed behind you, as a good pet does. *Hmmm... I wonder if I should call him Master, or is that too cliche?* Inside your suite I stayed behind you, and to your right side, I didn't stare at the floor, as you had clearly said you wanted me to see. However, I couldn't help admiring you. *Jesus, your a fucking masterpiece!* I thought admiring your long, dark mane. I wanted to wash, brush, and run my fingers through your hair. I couldn't tell exactly what the rest of you would look like beneath the sweater and jeans you wore, but from what I had seen on my monitor the previous night I could be assured that the rest of you was just as breathtaking. I watched dispassionately as you opened the box. I wonder what dark pleasures you were going to bring upon her this time. I made a point of maintaining my cold, blank facade, but now I felt something different than I had when I observed you playing with her last time. I could feel not only envy of what you were going to do to her, but also jealousy. I realized then that I was envisioning myself hanging her by her skinny little ankles from the ceiling in my kill room. I wanted to slit her undeserving throat, and bathe in her warm blood. I snapped back to reality. I realized that I actually hated this bitch with a fiery passion. I also felt something slick and warm on my hands, and noticed that I had clenched my hands into fists. My long, sharp nails had cut deep into my palms. I wiped my hands along the outside of my dress where it covered my thighs. *What the actual fuck?!? This isn't me. I don't feel shit like this. Ever.* I looked up, refocusing my attention to you, as I should have been the whole time. You had begun to place tourniquets on her arms and legs. Then, once you were finished, you took a step back. I wasn't sure if you were admiring your work or the human canvas that lay helpless before you. ... I had seen the finished product of your work before. You didn't know it, but your masterpieces- Each and every exquisite work of suffering you had ever created- had ended up on my autopsy table. It didn't take me long to connect the staged suicides, which I considered your first collection, to your more recent works. I noticed your distinct ""signature"". The one special mark you left on each of your masterpieces. This is what drew my interest to you in the first place. My morbid curiosity about the artist behind these works led me to do some things I normally wouldn't have. It was easy for me to clean any of your DNA from the corpses, to keep your ""signature"" off the record. Evidence tampering occurs too often in the system, and everyone turned a blind eye to each other's doings so long as we all maintain the status quo. The suicides were easy enough to write off as exactly what you intended them to be. I altered or falsified the toxicology samples after my own testing determined that you had been using rohypnol. Suicide's don't use roofies to end their lives. Your more recent masterpieces were impossible to simply write off as suicides or accidents. I still scrubbed the evidence, and wrote the Cause of Death up as something secondary to the damage you would inflict. Heart failure, seizures, and the like. Now, rather than merely admiring your work from afar, I would have the pleasure of observing the Master at work.  Then, you began to create. You began by taking your knife and cutting into the flesh of her forearms. You were precise with each movement of your hands. I watched with cold fascination as you sliced through skin, muscle, and tendons cleanly until you exposed the white of the bone underneath. Your canvas cried, begged, and attempted to bargain with you, until her babbling became nothing but screams of pain and tears. If it were me, she would have been gagged or otherwise silenced. I've never cared for all the noise from others. Only my own screams were music to my ears. However, you seemed to be rather enjoying the sound. I moved forward. I wanted to not only watch your work, but to see the look on your face as you worked. You snapped your fingers. ""Would you hand me the scary looking tool with the handle on the side?"" I picked up something the likes of which I had never quite seen before. It looked like something from one of the Saw movies. I was eager to see exactly what the intended purpose of your nightmarish tool was. *How interesting? Bonus points for creativity and DIY capability* I thought, admiring your creation. I noticed that, unlike your knife, this tool was shiny and clean. *Either he takes excellent care of his equipment, or he's never used this before.* As I was passing the tool to you I ""accidentally"" cut myself on a sharp edge. It drew blood quickly and easily. I smiled, and stifled a moan, as you took the tool from me. I watched closely as you placed the tool carefully within the incision, directly between the ulna and the radius. Then, you looked at me. I could see how much you were enjoying this. You really do love your work. My pulse began to quicken, as did my breathing. The look in your eyes were having an effect on me, very much the same way her screams were effecting you. You winked at me, and then in one hard, sudden movement her forearm exploded, sending shattered bone, blood, and flesh outward in a rain of gore. You paused, closing your eyes, and enjoying the symphony of suffering you were conducting. In that moment, you were truly beautiful to me. You were in your absolute, truest form. When you opened your eyes, you looked into mine. There was a wild, hungry look in your eyes, but more than that, it was as if you were staring into my very soul. You moved to the other side, and repeated the procedure on her other forearm. Then, you moved down to her legs. While you had done the tourniquets well enough, I wondered if cauterizing the stumps would be a good idea, or if you intended to finish her off this time. *""Two's company, and three's a crowd""* mother's words crept into my mind. I noticed that you were watching me. What were you looking for? What did you see? I was careful to show no emotion on my face, but the look in your eyes when you finished with the last leg was as if you had somehow figured me out. You then moved to stand directly in front of your broken toy. You admired your work, much the way any other artist would. Then, after a long moment you looked at me as a starving man would look at a steak. I wondered if you were imagining me in her place. An excited feeling akin to anticipation began to creep up my spine. Then, you snapped your fingers. ""I need the glass tube."" Previous: URL "

The baby was content, and introspection replaced my hunger as I wiped the blood off my face with the sleeve of my nightgown. I never imagined the cravings could lead to this, nor did I imagine not caring as I looked at the leftovers of our assailants with disdain. How are you feeling? he asked as he sat on the floor across from me. I turned to the man I thought was my husband, not sure how to respond. This would be a good time to [explain yourself](URL He lowered the thawed ice pack he'd been pressing against his cheek and turned his eyes away, struggling with the words he probably never imagined hed have to say. Are you a demon? I asked. No. At least, not in the biblical sense. What does that mean? Are you possessing Doyle? No. Where is he? He hesitated before he said, Hes dead. I sat up, tense. Did...did you kill him? No, he was already dead when I found him. You better start explaining more than that. ""I have no idea how without coming right out and saying it...so I will. He took a deep breath, bracing himself. Im a member of a species that has lived in Earths water for as long as humans have lived on land. I stared at him, incredulous. Youre seriously telling me you're a fish? No, perhapsmore like a frog? Were like large, strong, intelligent, mammalian frogs. ""Then why do you look like Doyle?"" ""Because I adopted him. We can transform physically into other creatures by pressing part of them to a nodule on our palate to adopt their DNA. We do it to hunt as well as to blend in. So, you can look like anyone? Yes, but we cant change our mass. If I transformed into a crab, I'd stay this size. Same if I transformed into a whale. Why are you pretending to be Doyle if you live in water? Because Im on the run from my territory's government."" I tensed up again. ""You're a wanted criminal?"" ""No...yes..."" He closed his eyes and turned his head down with a forlorn sigh. ""I just thought I was doing the right thing."" ""Whatd you do?"" ""I uncovered a lot of ugly truths the government didn't want uncovered, including plans for a 'cleansing genocide'. Genocide against humans? I asked, my skin prickling with fear. We do consider humans an enemy because of what they do to the environment, but no, the plans detailed a genocide against our own kind. We're not free from superiority and prejudice either, the powerful and privileged will do anything to remain powerful and privileged. My territory is the strongest and largest, taking up most of what you call the Atlantic Ocean, and its government thinks it's untouchable. I just wanted to prove it wrong, to show it can't get away with its crimes against the weak anymore. What I exposed led to an eruption of global unrest and the government listed me as enemy number one. I swam because I knew the penalty was death, and they ended up cornering me near the coast. I had nowhere to swim. If I wanted to hide, my only option was land. Why couldn't you just turn into a shark or something? We have a sense humans dont have. Perhapsits closest to smell? We each have a unique smell that doesnt disappear when we transform. He gave me a hesitant smile. Our baby has it too, a faint one. It'll grow stronger when he or she is born. He sighed, sobering up. This sense helps me know when theyre nearby, but it doesnt help me hide. So when I found the carcass of a drowned female human, I thought Id be safer among the enemy than my own kind. I adopted her and tried to put as much distance as I could between myself and the Atlantic Ocean. Were amphibious and have exceptional temperature and pressure tolerance, but it still took me a while to adjust. I stayed in the wilderness at first so I could be myself and hunt and live in peace, but after a few months I began to get lonely. Were a social and intellectual species, we live in communal houses and value company and conversation. I missed being around friends and family."" ""You're married?"" ""No, we don't really do that, but groups of us do bond to create trust units. Having children is only done to stabilize the population and it's regulated by the government, but we do love each other as a community and care for the young together."" He sighed. ""I thought maybe I could go back, find refuge in another territory, but I knew the information I leaked would lead to oceanic instability, if not an outright war, and I was afraid I'd end up captured. ""The other option was to try and live among humans. I knew they were our enemy, and I wasn't looking forward to staying in a stifling transformed state for long periods of time, but I thought it might be worth it as long as I got mental and emotional stimulation. ""I transformed into the female human and tried to live in one of your towns. Back home we're taught human history, biology, and language, but it still took me a while to get the hang of everything. Communication was the hardest, you rely on vocal tone, facial expressions, and body language a lot more than we do. ""I did odd jobs, learned a few skills, hung out in communal areas, researched, absorbed your media...and my experiences made me hate humans even more than ever. They were selfish, unsympathetic, violent, and corrupt, and the last straw came when a group of men tried to corner me. I transformed into myself and they ran away screaming and tripping over their pants. ""It wasn't worth it, all that ugliness for company that wasn't genuine and conversation that wasn't fulfilling. I went back to living in the wilderness, and I dreamed of starting my own community in secluded, landlocked waters where no one could find us and we'd be free to be ourselves. I was the only one of my kind out here and our governments prohibit bringing hybrids into the world, but I was already a fugitive. I had nothing to lose. ""I searched for my paradise, and I found it a year later. A perfect cave with the purest water near abundant woods. It was like I imagined it into reality. Now, all I needed were children. I had to choose a species to mate with where there'd be a high probability of conception and low probability of genetic defects, and humans were the closest in size, structure, and intelligence. Since I'm male, I began searching for a handsome male human to adopt and a healthy female human I could manipulate into carrying my child. His words stung. Is that why you picked me? He gave me a rueful half-smile as he twisted Doyles wedding ring around his finger. I didnt pick you. I was in the woods, hunting, when I heard a group of idiots laughing and scaring away the animals with their wild shots. I waited for them to leave, but after they started calling out for Doyle, I gave up and decided to hunt somewhere elseand thats when I stumbled upon your husband. He was dead. He mustve tripped and cracked his head against a tree. He was around my age and size but he wasn't good-looking, but then I noticed his wedding ring. It got me thinking, I wouldnt have to convince a wife to carry her husbands child. His brothers were still looking for him, I didnt really have time to deliberate. He had a shaved head and no obvious scars, and that was good enough for me. I transformed, took his belongings, buried him, and grabbed his rifle before I met up with Wyatt, Owen, and Randy. ""They were too drunk to suspect anything, but they did give me a good idea of who Doyle was. I began thinking I made a terrible mistake, I should've adopted an anonymous human, there was no way I could convincingly take over Doyle's life...but then they drove me here and I met you. ""You seemed healthy, so I thought it wouldn't hurt to try. I didn't know how Doyle would interact with his wife and I couldn't bring myself to mimic his brothers, so I tried a basic approach and hoped he was like that with you. Apparently I was way off, but then you came up with your own explanation for my behavior and I thought, maybe I could actually pull this off. So, youre using me, I whispered, my voice shaking in hurt and offense. I won't deny it was like that at first, he quietly confessed, looking down. Humans meant nothing to me and you were a just means to an end...but I didnt expect to feel a connection with you. He turned his candid eyes towards me. I began caring about you. I liked talking to you, I liked being with you, I liked *you*. I felt at home with you. ""I started making an effort. I learned how to do Doyle's job even better than he did so I could provide for you. I researched supplements so I could care for you. I got the hang of shopping, cleaning, and ironing so I could help you. With you, I felt stimulated again...physically, emotionally, mentally. You also made me realize how unfair Id been clumping humans together. There are ones like Doyle and his brothers, but there are also ones like you. Like Gary at the shop. Like Timmy and Leanne at the bakery. Humans may be our enemy, but theyre just as diverse as we are and you showed me that. I began feeling guilty for what I was doing to you. I toyed with the idea of letting you know the truth for monthsbut tonight Doyles brothers made the choice for me. His eyes glistened with deep remorse. ""You were amazing tonight, but you never should've been in a position like that. I'm so sorry I lied to you. I'm so sorry I put you in danger. I'm so sorry you had to kill your brothers-in-law to save our lives."" I stared at him, my heart racing, no single emotion dominant as they rode the turbulent waves in my mind. Whats going to happen to me now? Anything you want, he said, straightening up. Just tell me and Ill do it. His earnestness reassured me, but it didnt settle my confused thoughts. I need time to process everything. Im tired. I want to go to bed. Should I help you? I gave him an emotionless nod. Help me to the bathroom first. He did before he guided me to bed, switched off the lights, and left. I sighed as I clutched the sheets and listened to him clean up the aftermath of our feast. Despite my agitation, fatigue pushed my thoughts aside and I drifted off into a dense sleep.  The next morning, I woke up early and alone. I stayed in bed, analyzing last night's events until the babys hungry kicks became impossible to ignore. I groaned as I sat up, and I jumped at a trio of knocks before the door opened. Good morning."" He stood in the doorway with a hesitant smile and a mouthwatering plate of raw meat. I got you breakfast. Thank you. Hope glinted behind his eyes as he walked over and adjusted the tray over my legs, and he remained standing as he watched me polish off the pile within minutes. I leaned back in satisfaction and ran my hand over my soothed baby bump, and he cleaned up before he got me my supplements. I didn't take them as I studied him, and he stood to the side with anxious eyes, studying me back. Did you have time to process everything? he asked. What you did was disgusting, I said, making him wince. But Id be a lot angrier with you if I didnt sense something was off already. You werent acting like Doyle at all, but I wanted to believe he'd turned a new leaf. I looked down. I was enjoying the fantasy of having a loving husband who finally saw me as more than just an object. You treated me better in the past year than Doyle had our entire marriage. You showed me what it was like to be loved, respected, and cared for. You boosted me, helped me believe in myself. You opened my eyes to what a relationship could be. *Should* be. It wasnt you or me, it was you *and* me. You and me and the baby. I looked up at him. What were you going to do if this never happened? He shifted in place. ""The original plan was to convince the mother to do a home birth blindfolded, and then I'd take the baby to my cave and leave her. I was"" You were going to *take* my baby and *abandon* me right after I gave birth?"" I asked, glaring at him as I placed a protective arm over my stomach. ""All while pretending to be my husband?"" He looked away, regret weighing down his features. ""I didn't want to do anything violent like kidnapping or murder. I thought it'd be the least horrible option...but that was all before I felt a connection with you. I've been struggling with what to do since."" He turned to me. Penny, I'm so sorry. I really am. I owe you so much after everything you've done for me. After everything I've put you through. I want to make it up to you. Just tell me how and I'll do it. I studied him, running my hand over my baby bump as my riled emotions settled into anxious curiosity. After a tentative moment, I said, ""I want to see what you look like. The real you. He blinked in surprise. Are you sure? Im sure. I pulled myself up on the pillows, preparing myself. I should know the true father of my baby. ""I dont want to scare you. ""Why would a giant frog scare me?"" ""We also have teeth...and claws...and horns,"" he said, hesitant. ""We're sometimes mistaken for demons by humans if they glimpse us."" I hugged myself, fighting my resurfacing anxiety. ""I still want to see you."" He nodded. Okay. He stripped and took a deep breath, and my eyes widened as I watched his frame narrow and stretch. His skin darkened to a shade of mottled green so deep it almost looked black, its glossy texture gleaming under the light. His legs bent at three distinct joints, and his flattened feet split into five elongated, tapered toes, an elastic web of skin connecting them and black claws capping them. His hands grew larger and gained claws and webbing as well, and flexible tissue connected his upper arms to his body, almost like the wings of a bat. His hair disappeared and his jaw became sharper, his nose regressing into two slits and his lips curving into a pout that hid small, piranha-like teeth. His eyes grew rounder and darker, the space between them increasing and their whites disappearing. From where his ears should be, a pair of thick, black horns grew, their rough surface without shine as they curved up until they surpassed the top of his head before curling back down half-way. His chest and stomach were completely smooth save for a small belly button, and his genitals had retracted inside his body. With a half-smile that looked out of place on his foreign face, he turned around, giving me a full view. His streamlined shape had no curves, creases, or protrusions other than the thin, translucent fins lining his spine. He turned back to face me and lifted his arms, presenting himself, a thin film gliding vertically over his glossy eyes as he waited for me to say something. He really played it down when he compared his species to frogs, and it took me a while to find my voice. C-can I touch you? He blinked vertically again, and a small smile twitched his mouth as he walked over and sat beside me. A balmy scent accompanied him, unusual but not unpleasant. My hand trembled as I reached out and touched him, and I realized he was trembling too. I felt my way down his sleek, firm arm, his skin warm but surprisingly not slimy. When I got to his palm, I spread open his fingers, tracing the taut webbing and onyx claws. My hand left his and traveled up his chest, over his shoulder, and down his back, and he shuddered as I grazed the fine fins along his spine. I met his eyes as I reached for his face, and he blinked when I touched his cheek. The injuries from Doyle's brothers were healing at an unnatural rate. My gaze drifted towards his formidable horns, and he lowered his head so I could touch them. It was my turn to shudder as they felt like sandpaper. You can wear your clothes, I said, drawing back. He looked up. Do I make you uncomfortable? His natural vocal chords werent made for English as they rasped, but I understood him. No, but youre trembling. Im nervous. Ive never done this before. You shouldnt be nervous to be yourself around the mother of your child. His eyes glinted in hesitant relief as he tried to read me. Whats your real name? It isnt easy for humans to pronounce, he said before he emitted a strange sound. I frowned. That sounds like youre saying Raphael while gargling whistles. He gave me a small smile. It's different underwater, but you can call me Raphael if you want. ""Im going to have to get used to your expressions with this face, but I think I can pick up your emotions from your eyes. I looked at his horns. I can see why humans would think youre demons. Did Wyatt, Owen, and Randy see you like this? Is that why they tried to exorcise you? No, that was just a coincidence. They've been suspicious for months, but when they wanted to He paused. You dont need to know the details, but I refused and, apparently, Doyle wouldnt have. That was all the proof they needed that a demon was controlling their brother."" ""So, Doyle started acting decent and they immediately thought 'demon'. Tells you all you need to know. No wonder they couldn't find anyone willing to marry them. Doyle just got lucky I was too stupid to know better."" ""You're not stupid, you're just too kind, patient, and selfless. You're wasted on humans like them. They didn't have a brain cell between them. If Doyle really was possessed, their techniques wouldnt have exorcised a louse off his scalp. I surprised myself as I laughed. ""They kept splashing water on you. I bet that did the exact opposite of what they wanted."" His chuckle sounded like a bubbling kettle. ""If our lives weren't on the line, yea, I would've found it quite refreshing."" I studied his eyes, and my smile faded. Is it still hard for you, living on land? Yes, but after I met you it became worth it. ""You said you used to hunt in the woods. You guys eat land animals?"" ""We're natural hunters and we eat anything. I also ate in greasy restaurants when I was the female human. I thought I hated human food, but then I met you and had my first ever home-cooked meal. It was a welcome change."" ""That was the first time 'Doyle' thanked me."" I frowned at a thought. If you were Doyle when I got pregnant, wouldnt this baby be his? The DNA we adopt is added to all our cells except the reproductive ones, or else each generation will end up with a mishmash of all the adopted DNA of the previous generations. Oh. How many DNAs can you have? There isnt really a limit, but the more you adopt, the higher the probability of transformation errors. Twentys our average."" ""Do you have twenty?"" ""No. I have six aquatic species, the female human, a coyote in case anyone saw me in the woods, and Doyle. I sat up, curious. Can I see them? The land ones? He smiled. Sure. He stood up, and fur sprouted from his skin as he bent over and transformed into a large coyote. Id never seen one before, and I couldnt help but shy away at its size despite its unthreatening posture. He then transformed into the woman, and I felt a twinge of sorrow knowing he found her dead in the ocean. Whys she bald?"" I asked. Because hairstyles, scars, amputations...those aren't coded in DNA. But her hair did grow when I lived as her for a while. So did Doyle's. I was glad, I didnt like it when he shaved his head."" I paused. ""If *you* had a scar or amputation, does your transformed self have that too?"" ""Yes, but we have regenerative abilities, so disfigurements arent permanent. Can you turn into a giant baby? No, but Ill be what the baby will look like when its my age. ""Can you turn into a giant bug?"" ""Yes."" ""A plant?"" ""No."" He gave me an eager smile as he waited for further questions, but although I had many, I remained silent in thought. Should I transform into Doyle? he asked, hesitant. No. I dont want to see him ever again. You can go back to your own self. He did and sat beside me. Do you have anything else youd like to ask? I held his hand and turned it around in mine, running my fingers over his as I tried to come to terms with my new reality. I could understand why he was afraid to tell me what he was, but he shouldn't have pretended to be my husband to get me to carry his child. He had multiple options to fulfill his goal, and although he chose to remain transformed to live with me, and although he was respectful and appreciated my company, he shouldn't have tricked me. Then again, I made questionable choices too. I sensed something was off, yet I chose to live the fantasy instead of confronting my suspicions. My belly shifted beneath our hands, settling my confused emotions. My old life didn't exist anymore, and I didn't miss it. The baby was what mattered now, and that evoked a surge of forgiveness and serenity. I believed Raphael's remorse, I admired his stance against his government, I sympathized with his struggles, I felt his vulnerability, I understood his loneliness, and I appreciated his previous treatment and his current transparency and absolute trust. I looked at him. I want to see your cave. He blinked. Really? Yes. If were going to raise a family together, I want you and the kids to be comfortable. I can live anywhere. His voice became gravelly and tight. Can I hug you? I nodded, and he held me close as he whispered, Thank you. My head rested under his chin as I hooked my arms around his neck, and I raised my eyebrows in surprise. Why do you have two heartbeats? Because I have two hearts, two circulatory systems. He softly pressed my head against his chest. This is the bigger heart, for the blood. He reached back and guided my hand to the base of his skull. The smaller heart is here, beneath the brainstem. It's for the transference fluid. ""Did you have two hearts as Doyle?"" ""Yes, I always do. But they're in sync when we're in a transformed state."" ""That's two hearts more than he had."" I sighed, listening to their polyrhythmic beat. ""What are we going to do about his brothers?"" ""I piled their remains in Wyatt's truck and drove them to his house before I set it on fire. I don't think anyone will suspect anything other than three drunk idiots got careless smoking. Randy's car is under Doyle's name, so I left it here in case you and I went our separate ways."" He was ready to let me go despite what I knew, and absolute contentment washed over me as I snuggled in his safe embrace. ""A second car can come in handy, just wish it wasn't Randy's clunky tin can."" He chuckled.  After a day of indigestion, hormonal mood swings, relentless baby kicks, and funeral preparations for Doyles brothers, we woke up the next morning ready to go on our road trip. Raphael transformed into the woman, and we got in Doyles truck and made the two-hour journey to the cave. After parking in the woods, he carried me up a few jagged rocks and through a series of narrow tunnels until we reached an unexpected space that seemed to stretch on forever. My mouth dropped open as my eyes darted around, trying to take in the incredible view. The walls of the cave dipped and protruded, their natural pattern continuing towards the high ceiling where haphazard openings allowed sunlight to stream through. The beams illuminated the crystal-clear waters of a vast lake, the gentle ripples sending mesmeric reflections across the slate-grey rock surrounding us. Raphael lowered me down on a ledge. Do you like it? Its breathtaking, Raph. I love it. He smiled. Ive set it up for myself underwater, but Ill set it up for you up here. It wont take long, maybe a few days, and we can move in. And you dont have to stay here. You can go anywhere you like and even have your own house and job out there. Whatever you want, Ill support you. The lake seemed to be calling me. I want you to teach me how to swim. Of course. We took off our clothes, and he transformed into his original self before he carried me into the cool, silky water. I held on to him tight, my heart thudding in excitement. I wasnt the only one excited as the baby began stirring, her movements rhythmic and gentle as opposed to her hungry, unruly kicks. Shes happy, I said, smiling. Shes in her element."" ""The baby?"" ""Yes. I dont know how, but I can sense her. Is this what your women feel when they're pregnant? His eyes glinted and he leaned his head against mine. Yes. What should we name her? Whatever you like. I thought for a few seconds. Do you like the name Tiana? Its beautiful, what does it mean? I dont know, but its the name of the princess in *The Princess and the Frog*. He paused, blinking, then he laughed. I love it. He set me down, and I gripped the coarse rock with my toes as he taught me the basics of floating, treading, and not panicking. He was a lot more graceful than he was on land, and it was enchanting to watch. He then held my hands and pulled me into deeper waters, and I smiled as I kicked my legs to stay afloat. Youre a natural! he said. Its amazing feeling so light! My back really needed this. We can come here as often as you like. And, if you want, I think we should prepare for a water birth since you're due any day now. What's that? I asked as we swam to a shallow area. He sat on a ledge in the water and pulled me onto his lap, holding me close. Its like a regular birth, but in water. Our young are more developed than yours, but we never give birth on land. Humans have done water births, so it should be alright."" Im ready to do anything to make sure Tianas safe and healthy. Is there anything else I should know? Whatll she look like?"" ""I don't know. Our genes are dominant in adoptions, but I have no idea reproductively. Our young look like me but more compact with no horns, claws, or teeth. They're also covered in fine hair...perhaps like peach fuzz? But they shed that layer within the first week."" He put a gentle hand on my stomach. ""Your baby bump is bigger than our kind's, though, so I don't know how different she'll be."" I put my hand over his. ""How do I care for her? Will she nurse?"" ""Yes, but you don't have to do it. I've got a stockpile of substitute milk here and we can take turns feeding her."" ""Why can't I nurse her?"" ""You can, but if she's anything like our young, she'll be even more demanding than she is now. They're always hungry and will grow to twice their size in the first two weeks before they wean."" ""Oh."" I licked my lips as Tianas kicks began getting impatient. Speaking of, were craving something. What is it? I dont know, Ive never tasted it. I just know Tiana and I want it. I turned to him. If you live in water, why have we been craving raw meat instead of fish? Im not sure. Cravings are dictated by the babys needs for protein, iron, fat, and so on. They can be overwhelming and our pregnant women just go wild hunting seals, sea lions, and walruses. But our baby is half-human. Also, youve never tried seal, sea lion, or walrus before so you wouldnt really know to crave it. Maybe thats what Im craving now, that taste I dont know. Maybe the water made Tiana get in touch with her fathers side and shes craving seal or walrus. Then Ill try to find one for you. Dont break into a zoo, Raph. He chuckled. Ill find us an alternative.  Two days after our visit to Raphaels cave, he called me while on a grocery run. Penelope, theyre in town, he said in a rushed whisper. I sat up at the panic in his voice. The government guys after you? Yes, five of them. I didnt think theyd come this far inland. Did they track your unique smell thing? No. Its not really like a scent that lingers and can be traced. Its perhaps more likean aura? I dont know how to explain it. I don't think they know I'm here yet. They mustve been infiltrating the continent over the past three years, looking for me and hoping I'd seek out human interaction. What are you going to do? Im not coming home, I dont want them finding you if they end up sensing me and follow. Im going to dodge them and go to the cave. Do you remember where it is? Can you meet me there? Yes. Ill drive Randys car right over. Please be careful. Im going to get rid of my phone in case they catch me, so they dont find out about you. Oh, shit! My pulse raced. What is it? Raph? Im okay, he whispered. Im looking for a venomous creature with an exoskeleton to adopt for protection. Why cant you use the coyote? It was scary. Its also easy to kill. I need armor. Some of the weapons we have can liquefy you. Be careful, Raph, please. Its one thing to die fighting, but another to die from a spider bite because you were stupid. He managed a tight, sad chuckle. I love you so much. I'm so sorry."" I love you too, and Ill see you in two hours, okay? Stay safe! You too. I hung up and hobbled to the closet, where I struggled to put on a pair of shoes suitable for climbing the rocky terrain of the cave. After a detour to the bathroom, I shuffled to the kitchen to get provisions for the two-hour drive, and a scream ripped from my throat when the front door crashed open and a net was thrown over me, sending me tumbling to the ground. I looked up in horror to see a group of five men in army fatigues, one of them dragging me to the side while the others began searching the house. These must be the five after Raphael, and my heart sank as I wondered how they found me. Their raid had to mean they thought Raphael was here and I was glad he managed to dodge them, but my relief was short-lived. Raphael said Tiana had an ""aurascent"" he could sense, which meant they could too. According to Raphael, her existence was wrong in their eyes and I was an enemy, and my only thought right now was ensuring her and my survival. After tearing the house apart, they surrounded me, and I curled up to shield my agitated baby bump as I scanned their identical faces with dread. They must have adopted the same man. None of them appeared to have learned facial expressions or body language, though, and I shuddered as I felt like I was surrounded by robots. One of them crouched next to me and reached for my belly, and my defenses kicked in as I tried to knee him and push his hand away. Two other men squatted down, one grabbing my arms and pinning them against my chest while the other held my legs, and I twisted and strained as the first man reached for my exposed stomach again. No, please dont hurt my baby! He lay his hand on top, pressing the netting against my flesh. Where's the father? I wasn't giving Raphael up, but I didn't know how to reply. Afraid of saying the wrong thing and putting Tiana and myself in jeopardy, I remained silent as I continued to struggle. He pressed down harder, his fingertips digging in. Where's the father? I gasped, crying out, ""I don't know! I don't know!"" ""When will he come home?"" ""I don't know!"" He pulled out my phone, and I now wished I had a passcode. ""Tell us an alternate method of contacting him that doesn't lead to voicemail."" ""There isn't one!"" ""He knew we were close,"" one of the standing men said to the rest. ""He abandoned everything and ran. She's useless."" ""Wait,"" the second standing man said. He stripped before transforming into his original self, looking almost identical to Raphael except for the larger horns and thinner lips. I kept my eyes glued to him, trembling as I wondered what he was going to do next. The man gripping my restless baby bump studied me. ""She has no shock. He told her the truth about himself. About us. She's not only a bearer."" ""He bonded with a human?"" the man pinning my arms asked. Their monotone voices and blank expressions left me lost. I couldn't tell if they were disgusted, surprised, or impressed, nor could I figure out what this meant for Tiana and me. ""This is good,"" the man holding my legs said. ""He won't abandon his unit. He'll come."" ""He won't come, he knows we're here,"" the standing man who was still human said. ""She's aware of our existence and the unborn is a crime. He knows their fate at our hands. He won't risk his freedom defending a condemned, second-rate unit."" Why are you certain he knows we're here? Because he's not in town and he's abandoned all methods of communication despite having a female carrying his child. ""Perhaps he set an evacuation plan."" The man released my stomach to check my phone. ""His last call was nine minutes before we arrived at this house."" He looked at me. ""What did he tell you?"" ""N-nothing,"" I replied. ""He's a fugitive, he must be apprehended. What did he tell you?"" ""P-please...leave us alone. We aren't hurting anyone."" The standing man who was still human lifted his foot to stomp on my stomach, and I strained against those holding me as I screamed, No! No, please! The man who had transformed into his original self grabbed the aggressor and pushed him back, but I didnt feel relief as Tiana thrashed beneath my racing heart. I writhed, gasping, as pain seared through my abdomen and warmth trickled between my legs, and my pleading eyes darted between the men's emotionless faces as I felt helpless and alone. ""What did the father tell you?"" one asked, taking advantage of my desperate state. I couldn't speak, my breaths hitching in broken sobs at the amplifying spasms and hopelessness. The man who had transformed into his original self said something in his language before he clawed through the net and carried me. I gasped, but I was in too much pain to protest as he took me to the bathroom, lay me down in the tub, and plugged it up before turning on the faucet. The other men filed in after us like uncanny reflections of each other, but he shoved them out before locking the door. I eyed him with apprehension as he kneeled next to me, and I pushed his hand away with a strained cry when he reached for my clothes. You're going into labor. I've given birth before, I can help you. I frowned at her unexpected revelation, but a vicious pang stole my breath and I groaned and leaned back, nodding. She removed my clothes, folded a towel behind my head, and turned off the faucet once the water level surpassed my stomach. She held my hands and gave me advice as my body seized with every jolt of pain, and tears streamed down my face as I wished Raphael was with me instead. After an agonizing half-hour of straining, puffing, and screaming, Tiana came into the world. I stared in awe through my sweat and tears as she wiggled in the turbid water between my legs. I reached my trembling hands towards her, but I jerked back in surprise when she swam up to me and breached the surface. High-pitched cries squeaked out of her searching mouth as she climbed towards my chest with aggressive nuzzles, and my instincts took over as I cradled her and tried to help her nurse. She didnt know how to latch, and the woman studied us for a few seconds before she spoke over Tiana's hungry cries. ""We have different mammary glands. Lie back and position her like this. Itll be easier. Thank you, I whispered, adjusting Tiana while the woman cut the umbilical cord with her claws. I caressed my beautiful baby's head as she looked at me with her dark, glossy eyes, her tiny fists kneading me as she nursed, her two heartbeats drumming out of step. Raphael was right about his genes being dominant, she looked just like him. Yet, along with the soft peach fuzz covering her body, there were longer strands of actual hair on her head. She also had a little protruding nose and a faint brow ridge. The woman broke my reverie as she sat on the edge of the bathtub and asked, ""What did the father tell you when he called?"" I looked up at her. ""What are you going to do to Tiana and me?"" ""If you cooperate, you and your daughter won't suffer. What did the father tell you?"" Fear merged with my determination as I hugged Tiana tight. Why cant you just banish him with us out here? The sentence should match the crime, and what you're suggesting won't be punishment. He didnt commit a crime, he uncovered one. ""His actions have led to destabilization and disorder. She pointed to me. ""And he revealed our existence to the enemy and had a child outside of his species."" ""None of this wouldve happened if your government wasnt evil. And whats done is done, killing him won't change anything. Emulation must be discouraged. We aren't hurting anyone, we just want to live in peace. Please. His own choices destroyed that possibility for himself and for you. What did he"" She sat up and turned towards the door, and within a second she'd left the bathroom and locked me in. Confused but not letting this chance go to waste, I stumbled out of the tub, wrapped Tiana in a towel, got dressed, and climbed on the toilet to pry open the small window above it. Tianas wails echoed against the tiles as I huffed and strained, the stubborn frame grinding with every desperate one of my heaves as I fought through my pain and fatigue. The bathroom door crashed open, and I abandoned the hopeless mission as I jumped down and scrambled for Tiana. Pressing her to my chest, I flung myself into a corner and brandished a hairbrush like a weapon, ready to fight tooth and nail for my daughter. Shock replaced my resolve when I saw the enormous scorpion that had collided backwards into the sink, inky liquid spraying from where its left claw would be. The scorpion was terrifying, its remaining claw snapping and its stinger striking as it fought the woman and her radiating weapon, but she was determined as she searched for a weakness on its body and deflected its attacks with speed and skill. Recalling Raphael's phone call, I didnt hesitate to hurl the hairbrush at her, afraid she'd end up liquefying him. It struck her in the eye, and that split-second distraction was all Raphael needed to trip her and bury his giant stinger in her chest, coating the tiles with a spray of black as its tip protruded from her back. She collapsed lifeless to the floor, and his legs slipped on the blood as he whipped around to face us. I stared at him in gratitude and concern as his exoskeleton dissolved and the claw, tail, and excess legs withdrew into his body. He stumbled against the wall and slid to the ground, panting as he gripped his wound tight and looked up at us with relief. Oh no, Raph! I ran over in horror and skidded beside him on my knees. Your handyour eye Don't worry, they'll grow back,"" he said, his voice weak. ""Are you and Tiana okay? Yes, but you aren't. We need to do something, youre bleeding out. I placed our daughter in his intact arm and got to work cleaning and wrapping his wrist stump, and he looked at her with warmth and a soft smile as she nuzzled his chest with hungry squeaks. Shes beautiful, he whispered before he turned to me, regret flashing across his eye. ""Im so sorry this happened. Im so sorry I wasnt with you for her birth. I'm so sorry you had to see me do...that. He nodded towards the dead woman. Raph, you just saved our lives. You were amazing, howd you even know? I overheard the boys at the gas station talking about how they ratted Doyle out to a soldier looking for people whose behavior changed. When I rushed over and saw Randy's car still here, I was ready to fight with everything I had. If they killed you, I'd have nothing to live for. What are we going to do now? I asked, tending to his damaged eye. We have to get rid of the bodies and move to the cave before they send others after us. Whatevers missing we can get later. Are you okay with that? More than okay. I rolled up my sleeves and nodded. Lets go."
11,vulnerability,nosleep,The Harvest of the Wolf.,1,hf5pfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hf5pfy/the_harvest_of_the_wolf/,2020-06-25 03:51:36," I was going through a box of old clothes when I found a t-shirt that meant a lot to me as a young woman. Just seeing it made me feel nostalgic and euphoric, but also a little frightened. That t-shirt took me back to the first time I was living away from my conservative parents, going from a sheltered home school kid to somebody attending her dream college. I was there for an engineering program and was mostly surrounded by fellow nerds, but all of them seemed so much more confident and assured than I was. I was attracting a lot of male attention for the first time in my life and it thrilled and terrified me, I really had no idea what to do. Me and various classmates would flirt and then get embarrassed and clam up, like dogs chasing cars not knowing what we would do if we actually caught one. Finding this shirt makes me realize I need to have a talk with my own daughter and give her the knowledge my parents never gave me. I want to tell her not everything you want is good, and not everything you fear is bad. She might be a little too young for the R rated details though, so for now Im writing it all down so I can work through these memories and feelings. Back then I was hungry for new experiences, but I had no ability to put them into any sort of context. Horror movies, secular music, best-selling novels, fast food, raunchy sitcoms and staying up late were huge novelties and loved it. I did not know any of the clichs or tropes yet so everything caught me by surprise, every piece of media I consumed was a roller coaster. I had a good friend named Kyle at the time and he seemed to get a huge kick out of feeding me pop culture and just watching my face as I laughed or cried or covered my eyes in fear. He was very sweet, but did not feel threatening like the other guys. He would not awkwardly steal glances at my body or try to work in obvious sexual innuendo assuming I would not get the joke because I was sheltered. He treated me as a friend, and a bit of a pop culture crash test dummy. We also started to engage in something we called Urban Anthropology. We would go to pep rallies and scream and cheer with the jocks, or hang out on the side of the hill that did not face the campus and talk philosophy with the stoners. Sure, we made fun of people behind their backs, but we were also both genuinely curious about how other people lived. In my case, I had no idea who I was going to be when I was done coming out of my shell, and for Kyle he claimed it was all research for the awesome screenplays he was going to write. He would tell me these crazy stories where vampires would take over the campus and all the characters were based on people we knew it seemed like the coolest thing ever although in hindsight I do not know why anyone other than us two would find it clever. One day we decided to check out a rock show at a local bar. A bunch of metal and goth bands were going to play an all ages show and it seemed like a good set piece for the screenplay. I personally had no idea what to expect, what people do not understand about being home schooled is just how you completely lack context for everything. You see a grateful dead album cover and assume they are some scary heavy band because of the skeletons. Just imagine what level of culture shock I was in for as I saw t-shirts with upside down crosses, demons and sexy nuns for the first time. I could hardly focus on the music or the bands, instead we hung by the bar and made jokes about the meat heads slamming into each other or shuffling around like zombies depending on the tempo. Kyle said that in his screenplay a place like this could be full of monsters and nobody would notice, and that both made me laugh and gave me some anxiety. I had been so nervous about going this far out of my comfort zone that I had hardly eaten or slept in the last 24 hours, and it had put me in a heightened state of vulnerability. Then my eyes focused on one t-shirt that just transfixed me. It was nowhere nearly as violent, sacrilegious or shocking as any of the other shirts, yet it exuded a menacing energy I could not get over. I would see it disappear and reappear in the mosh pit, and around the edges of the crowd. Finally, the guy wearing the t-shirt approached me, since I had accidentally made eye contact with him a few times. He was a tall guy, certainly older than us, with long blonde hair. More important though was his shirt It was an extremely realistic illustration of a snarling wolf in a snowy field, with a thin spray of blood staining its mouth and the snow beneath it. Thick medieval letters said Harvest of the Wolf making it also one of the only t-shirts I could actually read at this show. Kyle faded out of my peripheral vision as I was only able to focus on the tall blonde guy and his t-shirt. The eyes of the wolf were full of hunger, and they reminded me of the gaze I endured every day in the hallways and classrooms of my campus. It was thrilling, and terrifying, and I could not stop looking at it. Finally the spell broke when he spoke to me, yelling god damn this band sucks, right!? very close into my face, assuming my hearing was as damaged as his. I nodded my head in agreement, not really having any context to say why one noisy song was any worse than another. Wanna get some drinks? he asked, and I pointed at the big stamp on my wrist that indicated I was under 21. I got you, what do you want?. Suddenly realizing I was starving and light headed I asked him for a sprite and maybe some chicken tenders. He came back with two beers and two shot glasses. I nursed them, but would also take anxious sips to not seem rude. I had never had a beer before and it just tasted absolutely terrible. Then the band finished their set and our new friend screamed Whoo! and knocked back his shot glass. I looked at him, and then at the wolf, and I took a shot too. I choked a little and coughed but was more disturbed by kinda enjoying it not the liquor but the feeling of being reckless. Things where a lot quieter in between bands and the three of us got into an awkward conversation where me and Kyle pretended to know what he was talking about as the tall blonde man went on and on about the local scene and how things are changing. He was mostly talking to me and I was mostly staring at his t-shirt, so I hardly noticed when Kyle just kind of faded out of the conversation. Im not sure if he was just taking a long time in the bathroom or if he decided to just go home, but when there was just two of us the tall blonde guy said lets get out of here and staring at the wolf, never breaking eye contact with it, I said yes. He walked ahead of me, talking very loudly about the bands that played that night and his favorite bands. I never really felt like an impostor because he never actually asked me any questions, nothing about my favorite band or if it was my first show. He just went on as I looked at the back of his shirt, reading a list of cities from a recent tour. To me these famous cities only seemed to exist in movies, tv shows and now on the back of t-shirts. Still my heart sank when we passed a burger spot without stopping, and later the shawarma place I loved. I wanted to tell him to stop, that I really needed some dinner, but I just did not have the vocabulary at the time to be assertive. I followed him like a lamb, reading city names and listening to anecdotes about bands I had never heard about. Finally we made it back to his place and he said hey, make yourself comfortable. While he was in the bathroom I regained a little bit of a sense of autonomy and opened his fridge, but literally all that was in there was beer. At that point, I started to rehearse what I was going to say to him in my head thanking him for the drinks but I really had to go home and study. Also it was starting to dawn on me that maybe Kyle did not ditch me, maybe I ditched him, and I was feeling super guilty. Then he came out of the bathroom and I locked eyes with that hungry wolf again, the remains of its last kill still fresh on the snow and I felt myself shrink. I did not tell him I needed to leave, nor did I tell him I did not want another beer. I did not tell him I did not want to go into his room and sit on his bed. I just stared at the hungry wolf and sheepishly complied. The spell was not broken until he got up and took off his shirt, leaving it shapelessly draped on an office chair in front of his computer. That is when I realized despite being taller and older, he was just kind of pudgy and hairless like an overgrown teenager. I was no longer able to see the wolf; as he pinned me down my eyes darted to the posters of girls in bikinis, superheroes and medieval wizards wielding electric guitars. His elbow was on my hair and it was painful, but he did not seem to notice or care. I was getting less afraid and more angry by the second, and could no longer see him as a man. This was the room of a selfish, inconsiderate boy who did not give a damn about what I wanted. You know that feeling where you are just hungry and angry and they make each other a lot worse? That was me in his room that night, I was hangry and I was not going to put up with it any more. We somehow flipped, it was so quick that it felt like an amusement park ride, as the whole room blurred and came back into focus. Now I was on top of him and he was the one who looked like he was in pain. I dug my fingers into him and the flesh just opened right up with no resistance. It really felt like a dream, not like I was strong but like he was made out of something soft that I could just tear apart and shove into my mouth. I took handful after handful of flesh as he cried and flailed but he could not get me off of him. It was not until he was motionless and I was lying in a pool of warm blood that I got any clarity as to what had happened. The cloudiness in my head was gone and was replaced by a strong survival instinct. I was not going to be found with him, I would instead shower and put all my clothes in a trash bag and leave wearing nothing but his t-shirt which hung loose on me like a dress. I ran back to the dorm with thousands of thoughts running through my head, but also an eerie sense of satisfaction for having finally stood up for myself. Holding the T-Shirt in my hands it feels like Im 18 all over again and full of those teenaged feelings. I was so upset that Kyle did not want to talk to me, like that was somehow the most dramatic thing that happened that night. When he eventually did sit down and talk to me I told him that nothing happened that night, in part to reassure him and in part because I needed him as an alibi. He would tell me that he thought he was jealous of all the men around me, but had realized he was just jealous of me. It would take another few months for that to really sink in as he became more comfortable with who he was. It took a lot longer for me to get comfortable with who I am. The t-shirt with the wolf and blood and the hungry gaze I guess we are most scared of the things we identify with. However, looking at the shirt now no longer makes me feel exposed and humiliated, it makes me feel seen. I imagine myself cutting it up and sowing it back into something fitted and sexy, a lot more flattering than a huge 2 XL shirt. Then I picture my daughter, totally embarrassed by her mom trying to be cool, so I put it back in the box. Maybe this can be her shirt after I have the talk with her, and she can decide what to do with it."
12,vulnerability,nosleep,I woke up in the middle of the night. I heard something downstairs.,1,hj0mt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hj0mt1/i_woke_up_in_the_middle_of_the_night_i_heard/,2020-07-01 11:21:29,"I woke up in the middle of the night to a noise on the first floor. It's been a week since the accident happened. I still have nightmares reliving it all over again. I was home alone tonight. The whole family traveled. I decided to stay home alone. The whole house had its lights off. All dark. I thought it could be cats. They're great at making noises in the middle of the night. I turned to the other side and hugged my pillow in an attempt to go back to sleep, this time trying to think of good things to not return to the same nightmare. My attempt had once again been interrupted by a noise now louder as if some large furniture had fallen to the floor. *Oh my god. The cats are breaking the whole damn house* I thought to myself, as I stood up to get the attention of the cats with screams from upstairs. When I walked through my attic bedroom door, about to shout from the top of the stairs for the cats to stop, I looked to my right and saw a silhouette. One of the cats was there looking at me but I couldn't see him except for his silhouette. I thought to myself, *one single cat couldn't have made all this noise!* ""Meow!"" I looked at my left side and the other cat was looking at me too. The two were on the same floor as me. A wave of chills took over my body, an intense cold went down through my backs and I started to sweat. My heart was pounding like it was going to jump out of my mouth. Now I heard what seemed to be steps towards the kitchen, the wooden floor reveals every step that anyone could take in the silent house in the middle of the night.I heard the refrigerator door open and the sound of dishes being turned and stirred, as if someone was preparing some kind of meal. I decided to go down very quietly walking on tiptoe. I armed myself with an umbrella I had in my room. The sock I wore cushioned the pressure of my foot against the wooden floor. My only ounce of courage came from the possibility of the family returning before the vacation week they would have spent in Florida. Maybe they came back starving and needed to eat something. But nobody talked and the noise of movement in the kitchen was now closer as I went down the stairs, from the attic to the second floor. In the little light that came from outside the house, through the second floor window, I realized that my hands were dirty, it seemed to be dried blood. That kind of blood that has been there for hours, dry and dark, it even left the tips of my nails darkened. *Did I cut myself with something while I was sleeping?* I thought to myself, now in the middle of the stairs. I saw the front door wide open. A few things were out of place. And then, I saw it. A shadow of a person walking around the kitchen. The shadow reflected in the room directly where the stairs ended. I thought about calling for family members to find out if it was someone I knew, but I thought again and decided it would be better not to. After all, if it was an intruder or a robber trying to steal something from the house, he would know that someone is there and could try to do something with me. What a fear I felt. Now I could hear my heart jumping in my chest. It was actually the only sound I could hear besides the stirring of the dishes in the kitchen. I had to do something, after all, I was there to protect the house. I took a deep breath and then held my breath like someone preparing for a long swim.I went down, I was still walking very slowly. I got to the kitchen, without the person being able to see me. It was a man.He had his back to me, he seemed to be eating something with one hand while drinking something with the other. I was all goosebumps, not a sound was emitted by my body, so much so that he didn't even notice when I got there. He turned around, he had a glass cup in his hand with what appeared to be some milk. Terror washed over my face when I realized that he was a whole copy of me. Its appearance was identical to mine. However, he looked slightly older and had a short dotted beard delimiting his face from the neck. I asked before he could say anything ""Who are you?"" The glass slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor. Even that was not enough to take him out of what looked like a trance. He was just as scared as I was. His face had no expression. A tear came out of his eyes. ''Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!"". He kept saying that. I didn't make it! I tried, but I didn't make it! ''Who are you ? I'll call the police! ""I said, as I took silent steps back. Now he knelt on the floor between the broken glass. His knee started to bleed out and the blood mixed with the white milk on the floor. He raised his hands to his face while he cried. ""And its all my fault, forgive me, brother! I love you so much !'' *Brother?* I thought. ""Who are you?""I asked now in fury when I realized his vulnerability. Now all I thought was It must be just another crazy home invader. ""Get out of my house, NOW! Or I'm going to call the police."" ""Your house? ""The man replied. His expression changed. He seemed to feel pity and empathy. He got up and came to me. I took a few steps back until I touched the wall. He came very close to me and I noticed a scar next to his right eye. He said ""Its going to be okay. She told me it would be difficult, cause It's been a year"" ""Youll always be my little brother. My twin brother who I love so much. I still feel you in this house, every day. That night while we were traveling for our vacation in Florida. A year ago. I dodged that dog that was on one side of the road, but I was unable to dodge in time for that truck that was coming in the opposite direction, brother"" ""You were on the side that truck hit. Forgive me!"" ""What are you saying?"" I asked without understanding anything. ""Let me go!"" I screamed as he tried to touch my face. He was standing next to me now, but his knees were still spitting blood down his leg. I ran and locked myself in the bathroom downstairs. When I turned on the light, I came across my reflection in the mirror. I was all bloody. There was a giant hole in my head on the right side and a slight dent on my forehead. My face was disfigured. As I look into the mirror. I relived everything. The accident, the lights, the dog, the truck... I had never stayed at home. I had gone along with them, but I never came back."
13,vulnerability,nosleep,The heritage of my grandma,1,gil4y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gil4y6/the_heritage_of_my_grandma/,2020-05-13 07:43:46,"Hi. As you are reading this, you can't help me anymore. I don't think anyone can. My life is doomed, and I will be scarred forever. But that's okay. I just need to share my story now, so that the investigators know what happened. Also - someone who believes my story would actually help me a lot. No one used to believe me, and that's just one of the many reasons I got myself into this mess. Let's just start this off easily. Here we go. I'm sorry if this is rushed, but I don't have a lot of time left anymore. They'll come any second now. So, I used to go to my grams a lot. She was very old and event though she generally was very rude to others, she adored me. I could get away with anything. She clearly liked me more than my cousins. For me it was fun, but my cousins - they weren't happy. Not at all. Until she died, and I got almost everything she owned. Oh boy, if I would've just not accepted it, maybe I would've never been here, writing this story. Six days after she died, we had her cremation. It was private, with just my dad, my aunt and uncle, my cousins and me. The reason for this is pretty simple: I'm an only kid and my mum left us. My aunt is my grandma's daughter and my dad's sister and my cousins obviously are her kids. So, back to the story. Matthew, which is my older cousin, really misbehaved. He yawned very obnoxious and didn't even try to show the slightest bit of respect for our grams. Considering how she treated him, he had enough reasons to act the way he does. It just really pissed me off, be cause she had always been the second most important person in my life. Once the cremation was over, we had to talk to my cousins and my aunt and uncle. Johnny, the smallest cousin, acted very weird and distant, even though we usually got along pretty good. Matthew on the other hand, mad a lot of noise and didn't seem to care about his little brother's weird behavior. I didn't want to talk to him about it, be cause I was very sad at the time and wanted to be home again as soon as possible, be cause my heritage was there and I couldn't wait to see if she maybe left something for me, something that would take my sadness away. I regret to this day that I didn't speak to Johnny. I think he knew something. It could've answered a couple of the questions I still have today. As soon as we got home, I rushed upstairs. There were three wooden boxes in my room. They were dirty and had spider webs on them. That in itself was actually weird already, considering that my grandma was a very wealthy woman. I never knew my grandpa as he passed before I was born, but he made a lot of money during his lifetime and grams got all of it when he died. Even though she had a lot of money, she never donated a single penny and was very greedy with it. I opened the box that was the closest to the door. It had a lot of books in it. They could've been useful actually, but I wanted to open everything before thoroughly looking all of it through. The second box was a little bigger and contained loads of old candles and herbs. It looked like a lot of very spiritual stuff, event though my grandma never believed in things like that. A bit disappointed be cause I didn't get stuff that had emotional vulnerability, I opened the last and smallest box. It had earrings, necklaces, bracelets and rings, more than I had ever even seen in my entire life. A bit overwhelmed be cause of the millions that were lying on front of me, I decided to properly check the boxes now. The one with the books seemed to be spiritual stuff as well, so I didn't look further and focused entirely on the jewelries now. I saw a beautiful golden bracelet with emeralds in it and my grandma's name written in the gold. Pauline Everwerth, it said in beautiful letters. Then as I reached forward to put it back in the box, I saw a small piece of paper. I picked it up, and began to read. Dear Em If you found this letter, I am so, so sorry. But you are cursed from now on. If you don't follow the rules I wrote down below, they will come to get you. More about that later on. I can't stress this enough, follow them very closely and keep it with you at all times. 1. Never ever tell anyone about this letter and whatever is inside it. This is yours from now on, until you die and it'll be given to someone else. 2. Keep a weapon with you at all times. You'll need this if you ever forget one of the rules. 3. If you see them in the corner of your eye, don't interact. The first few times are the hardest. In a couple of months from now, you won't even realize it anymore. The only one that is safe to talk to is Bert, the fattest one of them. Just make sure the other ones don't see it. But you can trust Bert. If you ever have a question, go to him and he'll help you where he can. 4. NEVER EVER LOSE THE GOLDEN BRACELET. This is the most knmortanr"

But I could get fired. Thats better than the alternative, you moron, I snapped. She knows that were working together, and she can conjure fake memories in other peoples brains. What if she frames you for something? What if she kills you and makes it look like a suicide? If Im right, he said, and shes  its nuts that Im even saying this out loud  if shes, like, some kind of reincarnation of a Fury, then she only punishes people who have actually done something wrong. Shes a god of vengeance, not random chaos. He paused. Well, thats if were dealing with Aeschylus. If were talking *Aeneid*, random chaos was pretty much the name of the game for the Furies, but Virgil was Roman and half a century later, so I can only assume it was less accurate. I dont think we can safely assume that this thing plays by any of the rules that some dead guys wrote about thousands of years ago. Besides, whos to say that she wont consider us actively plotting against her as something that needs to be punished? He sighed. Well, we cant go to the police, obviously, shes been controlling them for the last month. So whats our plan? We kill her. He laughed, mirthlessly, but realized when my gaze didnt waver that I was at least half-serious. No. Thats insane. Why not? Its all about vengeance, right? She killed Sam. We kill her. Seems pretty fucking reasonable to me. Look, he said, gesturing with his battered copy of *The Oresteia.* Hed been reading it almost as obsessively as Id been researching the case. I had largely left him to the Greek stuff, skeptical that an ancient play had anything useful for our very real, very pressing predicament. In the book, the Furies dont get their way. Orestes has a trial, the first trial in history, and hes acquitted. The Furies are pissed, Athena appeases them, and they accept the ruling. Its kind of trite: vengeance bad, procedural justice good. But it seems like theres something there, some vulnerability we could use. So, what, we litigate her into submission? Its better than your plan, which is literally *murder.* After many more arguments and a few baseless insults from both sides, we settled somewhere in the middle. Neither of us would go to work. We made a pact to be each others references when we inevitably had to seek new employment. And instead of jumping straight to premeditated homicide, we would start by breaking into her office after hours and see if we could find anything that hinted at her Achilles heel. Still, I was pretty sure someone was going to die. --- It was just before eleven PM. Ethan had assured me that no prosecutor worked that late. We stood outside the states attorney building, a drab, brutalist cube squatting at the end of the block. I was wearing black jeans, a black turtleneck and a beanie, for which I had been mocked. Were not spies. I have a key fob, hed said as we grimly prepared for our surreal mission. But we didnt know what to prepare. I had no reference for what you were supposed to pack to infiltrate the office of an eldritch god. He let us in, and we stepped inside, letting our eyes adjust to the darkness of the buildings interior. We inched along down the hallway, almost completely silent, until Ethan bumped hard into the wall of a cubicle and sent a stapler rattling to the floor. Shut up, I hissed. I was already regretting my choice of bumbling buddy cop. We froze, listening for any noise, before he resumed leading me down the hallway to her office. The door was unlocked, which I found highly suspicious. He looked at me. Are you sure you want to do this? he whispered. I dont think I have a choice. He pushed open the door. Alex Kokinoss office was, like everything else she presented about herself, spotless. Mahogany desk and bookshelves, no trace of clutter. A perky succulent perched on the windowsill. A framed diploma from the University of Kansas Law School hung on the wall. I started using the light on my phone to start sifting through the desk drawers, with no real idea of what I was looking for. Ethan started opening filing cabinets. After a few minutes, he straightened. Hey, he said, holding up a paper-clipped stack of pages. This seems like  I think its a list of the home addresses of all the cops in the county. Do you think this means anything? It means I like to know where to send my Christmas presents, said a voice from the doorway. Jesus Christ! Ethan screamed. I whirled around. There she stood, a languid hand on her hip, the whites of her eyes gleaming like firebugs. What the fuck are you still doing here? I demanded, trying to calm my rapid breaths. Alex cocked her head and turned on the light. I think its me who should be asking you that question, no? Goosebumps prickling down my skin, blinking rapidly at the sudden flood of light, I took a step back. Look, I  we decided we wont kill you if we dont have to, okay? We just want to know why youre doing this. We need you to stop. Her light peals of laughter tickled every corner of the room. You decided not to kill me? How thoughtful, how magnanimous. However shall I thank you? You could start by giving us answers, Ethan said. She fixed her gaze on him. He had been steady a moment ago; as she advanced towards him, step by deliberate step, he shrank back, pressed against the file cabinet. Answers. Thats all anyone wants from me. Answers. Im not God. I dont know *everything*. She was very close to him now. Her face inches from his. She slid a finger down his chest. He looked terrified, and, I thought disgustedly, maybe a little aroused. Youre in luck. On this subject, I have some knowledge. Ask away. I said, Who are you? She rocked back on her heels. That depends on who you ask. *Im* asking, I said. And it depends on *when* you ask, she continued, fiddling with her fingernail. I was like you, before. Well, not *exactly* like you. But, human. There was an incident. I did what I felt was necessary. She paused. It made me, this. Are you a   Ethan started. I could tell he was struggling to put together the words. That line you quoted. Are you one the Furies? This made her laugh. Cant a woman just like literature? Im not from Greek myth, no, I existed before that, although they wrote about me, the little they understood. So did a few other cultures. Some of it is even flattering. Why did you kill Sam? I said. For the first time since Id met her, Alex totally lost her composure. She slammed her hand against the wall, *hard*, a supernatural tantrum. I didnt, she hissed. He did that himself. I had him up against the wall. He knew what hed done. He knew justice was inevitable. So he escaped. Coward. He wasnt   I started, as the weight of her words crashed down around me. *The video. I shouldnt have showed Sam that fucking video. If I hadnt, if he didnt know the weight of the evidence * Ethan interrupted my private catastrophe by asking: Why are you answering our questions? Alex refocused on him. She swayed, back and forth. Because it doesnt matter. She reached one arm behind her head. Because I want you to know. She unclipped her silver snake-shaped barrette, letting her dark hair fall in glossy sheets around her shoulders. Because no matter what I tell you, youll never be able to tell anybody about it. Who would believe you? She brought the sharp point, the snakes tail, to Ethans face. She grazed it down his cheek. He winced as she pressed harder, drawing a bead of blood. *You* wont believe you. I watched in horror as Ethans breath became more shallow. He reached a hand to his face, staring blankly at the red stain on his fingers. What do you   I said. Alex snapped her fingers. The snap stole my voice. No more questions, she said crossly. I tried in vain to make a sound as Ethan turned to me, fury darkening his features. *You*, he growled. He took a step towards me. Youre a fucking monster, you know that? Do you know how many killers youve set free? How many rapists? Do you know how many people have suffered because of the worthless scum youve unleashed on society? I backed up, my butt hitting the desk. He grabbed a paperweight, hefting it in his hand. I cant just let that go, Pratt. Youve been pretending to be decent, all these years. Youre responsible for so much suffering. No better than the rest of them. I tried to shove him off, but he slammed me back against the desk, sending sparks of pain shooting up my spine. I tried desperately to shield my face with my hands as he raised the paperweight. Alex laughed. That black pit inside me swelled up, suffocating me. It couldnt end like this. I wouldnt let it. I took as deep a breath as I could, and screamed, shattering it. *Ethan*! I shrieked with my newfound voice. Its me! Stop! Its me, shes controlling you, *come back*! The paperweight hung in the air, a pendulum, at the peak of momentum. After a beat, he lowered it. Sadie? he said. Alex pushed herself off the wall. I  how did you   she said, looking from me to him to me again. She screeched ethereal rage, her eyes flashing almost red, and barreled toward me, her pin in her hand. I lunged forward and we thudded together, our bodies meeting with a sickening crunch. A flurry of limbs, and then, I flung her down, the hard impact with the ground knocking her out cold. You fucking bitch! I screamed over her splayed form. A white-hot prickle pierced the forefront of my consciousness. I looked down at my right hand. The snake barrette had sunk deep into my palm, scoring my flesh between the bones. Oh my god, Sadie, are you all right? I turned. My blood boiled at the sight of his smug face. It was his fault Sam was dead. He was the one who brought the case. He was the one whod falsified the evidence, made that video, gave Sam no exit. You evil fucker, I growled. He backed up. Sadie, its not  its the pin. Look at the pin. Rot in hell. I leapt at him, and that was when he swung the paperweight at my head, and a kaleidoscope of pain bolted through my vision before everything went black.

15,vulnerability,nosleep,An excursion into the forest led to the unraveling of my wife's mind.,1,grn32n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/grn32n/an_excursion_into_the_forest_led_to_the/,2020-05-28 02:37:03,"Humans are tribal. Humans are social creatures. We as individuals were never meant to remain alone for long periods of time. Im sure youve heard it all before, for reasons that made perfect rational sense at the time: survival, industry, culture. That we stick together because as teams, as groups, as nations, we can withstand and conquer our environmentand even each other. This is all true, yes, but theres another reasona secondary motive in relation to nature. Some people feel at peace in nature, others are stricken with terror when faced with its utter wildness. Nature, as a term, can encompass anything from the fledgling copse beyond your backyard, to dense, sprawling, untamed forests in regions of the Earth where man has not bothered to stake his claim. My wife and I, Candice, decided to venture to the latter locale; where we hoped to find some sort of greater peace, after having been exhausted by our extremely busy, unbearably social professional and personal lives. We sought tranquility in the spaces of the planet where people were absentthinking that a brief *cleanse* within the forest, beneath the canopies and amidst the bush would do us some good; would bring some sort of solace that our own home could not. Our destination was a place in Northern Europe, a particularly remote sub-region of the intended country. We had found a place to staya sort of family-owned lodgingwithin a quaint village, which acted as our initial base of operations, before we set out to hike to and camp in our ultimate destination. We asked the locales if they knew of guides, and we were informed that along the way we were sure to find someone who could help us with what we wanted. Candice and I stayed there for one night, taking in the culture and sights, but quickly became restlessboth of us still wanting to be free of all human constructs. The beginnings of our journey were pleasant, but uneventful; a hike through flat grassland that inclined gradually until we crested a hill, and saw before us an expanse of forest that stretched the length of the visible horizon. It was absolutely breath-taking. Neither of us had seen nature on such a scalenot in person. Despite our desire and reasons for taking the trip, we were totally inexperienced with forestry and campinghence our request for a guide. Television and film do not begin to capture the reality of it; the sheer abundance of life. Beyond the scale of it, we felt the impressions of age, of a power wholly unlike that of mans creationa natural will, one that even seemed in some vague, inarticulable way, defiant; of us, the small pocket of civilization wed left, and perhaps even humanity as a whole. Shocked, but not yet undeterred, we strode on towards the initial tree-line, hoping that in some natural foyer wed find someone who could help us along the way. We wanted to trek a considerable distance in before making camp, so that our natural immersion would not be disturbed by any human interruptions. Wanting to rid ourselves of any connection to our former lives, we hadnt brought any cameras, and only one phonehers, and planned to keep it off. And still, the modern man in me, the social media-obsessed, point-counting drone wanted to capture the sightspreserve them in images that I could look back upon, even while knowing that such images would not reflect the subtleties or real essence of what we saw. Clearing the initial tree-line, we stepped into a completely new world. The open sky was occluded by treetops, a seamless, faint-green canopy through which light dimly filtered. The trees towered over us, veritable skyscrapers of wood, and their leaves drooped heavily from branches which seemed to almost flex themselves against their burdens. I had never seen so much vegetation and biodiversity in my life. Insects hummed and droned in a lively ambiance; birds soared overhead, some seen as muddy forms beneath the occasionally translucent coverage overhead, while others even flew beneath the natural canopysurveying for prey. In the distance, heard but never seen, larger predators hunted fleeing prey; the cracking of sticks and trampling of leaves faintly audible. The air outside the forest had been clean, felt much more breathable than what we were accustomed to, but within it...it was almost intoxicating. There was an absolute purity about it, a sort of oxygenic naturalnesslacking the corruption of vehicular exhaust and the gaseous emissions of industry. It took us a moment to really compose ourselves, and even later, I never could properly acclimate myself to that uninhibited, unspoiled atmosphere. We pressed on, not wanting to waste daylight being mesmerized so early on. There was what could be called a path that we followedwhich was initially disheartening; we feared that wed been too late, that even here, man had stretched itself. But the path quickly diminished, and the natural floor of the forest spread itself before us. No longer could we easily walk along, and had to hop, hunch, and sidleexplorers in a new world, one which did not bother to accommodate our upright, bipedal locomotion. The climate, though a bit cooler than we expected, was still adequately comfortable, and quite refreshing compared to the unyielding mugginess that wed left. Candice had worn a black and red plaid button-up and jeans, while I wore a grey sweater, and jeans as well. After perhaps forty-five minutes of slow yet visually enjoyable progress, we came upon something we hadnt expected at all: a small house. It was a more like a ramshackle cottage, set within a clearing that had been cut pretty much only a few feet beyond the house itself. Not to be beaten, nature had already touched parts of itgrowth of various orders could be seen climbing the walls, draping the roof, enclosing the building as if keeping it prisoner. Despite all the vegetation, it was obvious that someone lived therea lantern hung on a hook affixed to the paneling by the front door, its light shining faintly. It was a bit darker here than in the rest of the forest, due to the umbrage of the surrounding trees. I didnt bring any weapons, although we had various tools which could be re-purposed for self-defense, if need be. There wasnt anything noticeably sinister or even faintly ominous about the house, but I still made sure the hatchet I brought could be easily withdrawn from my bag. We stepped into the clearing, wading through the bushes which bordered the house, and I knocked on the door. I hadnt really formulated any sort of introductioncompelled only to investigate the curious forest-dweller. Candice remained quiet, and hadnt protested my encroachment upon the property. An old man answered the door, wearing a simple black robe. He was obviously blind, his grey eyes fixed slightly away from us, with his head titled a bit, presumably placing his better ear in the forefront. We announced ourselves, offered a greeting in the native tongue we had picked up back at the village, and he responded accordinglyhis previously wary demeanor relaxing at once. I asked if he spoke English, and he nodded, then introduced himself in English that was surprisingly well-spoken. I had known that people of the area were taught English at an early age alongside their own, but didnt expect such proficiency at it. He told us that like ourselves, he had wanted to branch away from humanity and live among the natural worldbut his self-exile had ended up being permanent; hed never managed to re-integrate himself with society. Candice asked if he had any family, and the man spread his arms, gesturing behind and around us, indicating the breadth of nature. Candice nodded and smiled, although I knew she was somewhat disquieted. She had always wanted to be a mother, and we had danced around the subject of trying for children after our nature excursion. She was somewhat of a natalist, believing that everyone should experience the joy of a family. There was a certain irony there, for sure; wanting a break from humanity, and upon returning, endeavoring to bring a human life into our home. We talked with the old man for a while, who told us his name was Mathias. We explained our reasons for coming to his landboth geographically, and then locallyand he nodded politely, his blind eyes never quite settling on us; but looking on, as if something in the trees had caught a portion of his attention. He offered us tea, which we accepted, although we declined his offer of soup. I could tell that Candice was getting antsy, that she feared Mathias would offer us lodging in his little abode, but he seemed to pick up on the atmosphere of the meeting, and declared that he would take us deeper into the forest. We were elated, and thanked him for his hospitality and offer of assistance. He put some things in order around the house, put on a light jacket, and led us away from his home and northward into the forest. We pushed through the underbrush while listening to birdsong, unbothered by the few insects which flew lazily about us. Mathias was mostly quiet, which Candice and I attributed to his focus on hearing. He led the way, head always angled so as to fully receive the foremost auditory stimuli through his good ear. Despite his agelate sixties, perhaps early seventieshe moved swiftly, and for the first hour we traveled entirely on his familiarity with the area alone. When we had gone deeper, and when he required total focus to navigate, the sky had grown dimmer; bringing us closer to his impairment. The sounds of the forest calmed somewhat, and new sounds arosethough none of them were disconcerting. Trees, which before had been spaced apart significantly, now grew closer, and their thick trunks were aligned like brazen statues in some hall commemorating past wars. The old man spoke even less, offering only the occasional note to avoid a depression in the earth, or to be careful when traversing a troublesome bramble. When a gloom settled, and night was nearly upon us, he said we should make camp, and that he would now leave us. We protested, saying that it was much too dark for him to go back alone, and he told us that it was, always dark for him, and we felt somewhat ashamed at that. He gave us one last piece of advice before leaving: He said that nature, in all its aspects, is to man as much of an alien thing as the planets beyond Earth, and that we should treat it as any other odd phenomenon; with caution, and care. However,, he huffed, we should not fear it, and if a situation arises during which we are compelled towards action in the face of peril, we should choose to accept the embraceor encumbranceof nature, rather than try to conquer it. His final parting words were, Although men are not of the soil, they certainly have an affinity with it; and as weve seen throughout our fledgling history, nature immemorial is tolerant of those who assimilate. We never saw Mathias again. Candice and I started a fire, and slept beneath the canopy of treeshaving not brought any tents. The weather permitted a comfortable, un-enclosed camp, and I even rested comfortably against the trunk of a tree; settling myself into the groove of its roots, while Candice slept across my lap, the fire dwindling to its residual embers before us. We had had some sandwiches made for us at the village for dinner, and drank water collected from a spring there. It was a peaceful night, the start of what we had hoped would be a pleasant trip. The subconscious acknowledgement that something had changed woke up me. I looked around, first realizing that I hadnt felt the grogginess or general bodily discomfort that I had always felt when waking up in the city. The sunlight fell warmly upon me through the canopy, and the air felt even fresher than it had the day before. When my awakening bliss subsided, I remembered that I had initially awoken due to feeling some sort of disturbance, and finally noted it as being the absence of Candice atop my lap. I got up, relieved myself, changed clothes, and searched for her, but found no signs of her within our camp nor beyond its rough perimeter. I called out to her, and listened with awe as my voice echoed off the surfaces of the trees, carrying the noise away. As Ive mentioned, we had only one phone, so calling her wasnt an option when calling out to her failed. Not yet worried, more anxious to get along with the days hike than anything, I packed up our sleeping gear and ate a granola bar. We had taken careful stock of our provisions before the trip, and I noted the absence of only one barCandice apparently hadnt eaten breakfast yet. Once finished, I stood and stretched a bit, feeling otherwise energized by the fresh air and sun. I had forgone the instant coffee wed brought along, the water for which I wouldve heated in a small pot over a fire. With nothing left to do, I wandered a bit away from the camp, though keeping the clearing in which we had settled in the corner of my eye at all times. Unintentionally, I came upon Candice. She was sitting on a felled tree, which rested several feet above the ground, leaning against another tree to my right, which had not toppled under its burden. The trees as they were created a sort of archway, under which a man of any naturally attainable height couldve passed. The undergrowth was low here, and ferns huddled in the shade at the base of the upright tree. Candice was facing away from me, only her back visible; her dangling legs hidden behind the trees massive trunk. She had not changed clothes, and appeared blissfully unaware of anything beyond the tranquil woodland atmosphere. I called out, softly, not wanting to startle her and cause her to fall. It was about a nine-foot drop, and even if not fatal, she couldve suffered a nasty scrape or twisted ankle. However, she did not respond to my hailing, so I called out again, louder this time, sending a flock of birds evacuating to the sky from their tree-top sanctuaries. She turned slowly, as if under some spell of languor, and I saw that her eyes were glazed over, and her mouth curved in a smile of apparent satisfaction. She gracefully rose to stand atop the trunk, stretched, and then hopped off. My protective instincts had sent me into a sprint the moment her feet left the trunks surface, but she landed before I could reach the space beneath her. The panic which had burst into my heart at that moment was immediately dispelled when she landed softly, elegantly even, as would a practiced gymnast after some aerial maneuver. Just to be sure, I asked if she were alright, and she responded by kissing me softly on the lips. I asked what shed been doing since waking up, and she told me shed just wandered around, and knew that I would come find her once I had awoken. We walked back to camp together. Something about her had seemed off, although I didnt mention it, and even thought that maybe I had appeared the same way at some point. Nature had obviously made its impression on us, and we were bound to act strangely at some point when so fully immersed. We packed up our things and headed towards a hill to the northeast, wanting to ascend it and look upon the area around us from a point of elevation. We never made it to that hill. We had hiked perhaps half a mile when Candice stopped in her tracks and became oddly alert. She quieted immediatelyshe'd been humming along with the birds, beforeand cast glances in every direction. When I asked what was wrong, what she had heard, she silenced me with an upraised hand, then knelt low; as if being preyed upon by some predator. Confused, I mimicked her behavior, although without anything approaching her caution; I hadnt heard anything that would suggest the lurking presence of some hostile animal. Candice began shivering, presumably out of frightthe air was practically perfectand humming; this humming, however, was not melodious as it had been before, but as if the sounds were merely the byproduct of her bodily vibration. Concerned, I put my arm around her and asked if she were alright, but she pushed me away and scrambled into the brush. I tried to chase her, but she had apparently zig-zagged and sped away faster than Id anticipated, because after only a few feet I completely lost sight of her. I sat there, hunched beneath one of the colossal trees, resting in its shade. I thought that I should probably call out to Candice or attempt to track her down, but I was given the impression that there was something eerie going on; that she had *fled* from something which hounded only her, and that I should not venture deeper lest it turn its attention from her to me. I quickly dismissed this notion, telling myself that the strangeness of the situation was only inspiring a pointless cowardice, and that I should without question find my unsettled wife. I left my spot beneath the shade of the tree and pushed through the undergrowth. I had lost all sense of direction, the forest seeming endless, its parts and pathways indistinguishable. Despite the sunlight filtering through, certain parts were oddly gloomy; strange pockets of darkness that I tried to avoid, not necessarily out of fear, but so as not to disturb any dark-loving creatures that may be lurking therein. I had gone only a few paces when I felt a presence lurking over, above, and somehow even beneath me. There was an enormity about it, its size magnitudes greater than my own, and yet at first, I didnt hear or see anything which would be evidence of some gargantuan entity. I crouched, concealed myself within the surrounding vegetation, and watched. I could see no animal, but still felt that presence dominating some animal sense within me. This inability to detect it, and the knowledge that the invisible creature was of a much greater biological order than myself, it inspired a primal fear within me. I knew then how Candice had felt; knew the unmanageable fear which had assailed her. This *thing* wasat least in the atmosphere of being it exudedmonstrous. Just as my fright was about to overcome me and send me fleeing into an even deeper section of the forest, I remembered what the old man at the cottage had said. He had advised us to embrace nature, rather than try to conquer or flee from it. Despite how foolish it mightve seemed at the momentembracing some towering horror instead of avoiding itI somehow saw the wisdom in his words. Resisting every nerve, every instinctive impulse, I calmed myself and remained still. Rather than make myself appear as small and as insignificant as possible, I allowed myself to be seento be felt; put forth my own essence, my own spirit, so that the creatures may reach out and touch it; may see me as not a threat, but a curious observer. It was terrifying, to openly express my vulnerability, but I did it. And upon doing so I saw the thing that crawled through the forest. It was horrifying, and yet it was also beautiful. To my knowledge, there is no direct comparison with any creature Ive seen elsewhere. Its form was vaguely spider-like, although it possessed at least a dozen legs, of varying sizes, and positioned oddly around its body. Its body was long, unsegmented, and its many legs held it at least fifteen feet above the forest floor. It was as green as the forest itself, its skin covered in leaves and carpeted with moss, with sections of its legs even bearing bark-like scales, as if armored. I could discern no cephalic region, although I got the impressionsomehowthat it saw everything, that it had a much greater acuity than I could possibly imagine. I heard it then, too. It emitted low droning noise, which was not altogether unpleasant. The many impacts of its footfalls were surprisingly light, considering it mustve weighed tons. It came towards and passed over me, and I saw various creaturesinsects, mostlyclinging to its underbelly. It went along its way without bothering me, but I am certain that it had taken notice of me. It crawled on into the forest, leaving everything as peaceful and undisturbed as before. I stayed where I was for a while, allowing the shock of what I had seen to gradually fall away from me. I had witnessed something I was certain no other man had seensome primeval sentinel of the forest. It had recognized my attempt at obeisance and allowed me to see it fully; allowed me to live after having done so. I shook away nerves which still wanted me to *freak out,* and started walking. Somehow, I had subconsciously decided upon a path, although I couldnt have said at the moment anything about the destination. I walked for only a few minutes, but during that time I saw the forest as it truly wassaw its uninhibited and terrestrially unrivaled beauty. I caught glimpses of heretofore unseen creatures which subsisted within its domain; those magnificent and terrifying presences that flew, crawled, slithered, and scuttled. None were quite as *unreal* as that apparent woodland guardian who couldve so easily trampled me, but all were preternaturally eerie in their own ways. I arrived back at camp to find Candice waiting for meour things packed up. She looked wearied, beaten-down, as if something happened which had drained the life from her. I ran to her, embraced her, but she did not respond happily; only offered a quiet *hello* before resting her head in my chest. I gathered as much as I could, helped her stand, and led her towards the way that my newly-arisen instincts told me would be the path to leave. We passed the entrance to the clearing in which the cottage had sat. I wanted to talk to Mathias again, to thank him for his advice, and ask him a million questions regarding what I had witnessed, but upon looking into that clearing I saw only rubble; the woodwork and stones that had made up the cottage covered in vegetationas if the structure had been destroyed and its grounds reclaimed by nature decades ago. Candices gloom worsened at the sight of this, so I continued on past the ruins. We left the forest and came soon to the outer-lying village. We were accepted wordlessly, somberly, as if the villagers had expected not only our early arrival, but Candices shock as well. I think they even suspected that I should be in a similar state, but I assured them that I was fine, and that they should devote whatever care they could to my wife. I remained in the village for three days. Candices spirits couldnt be raised, and she didnt speak a single word to anyone. Despite the otherworldly experiences, I still had the mundane world to return to, and couldnt remain in the village beyond the initially planned duration of our trip. But Candices condition hadnt changed, and the villagers pleaded with me to let her remain there, so that they could help relieve her of this grim torpor. Wanting my wife to recover, I assented. These humble folk had proven themselves to be trustworthy, and I doubted any man of ordinary science could help my wifeif they could even ascertain the nature of the problem. I gave the villagers every means of contacting me, and left Candice among them. I returned home the following day, and am awaiting their contact. "
16,vulnerability,nosleep,Grandpa,1,gtcty3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gtcty3/grandpa/,2020-05-30 21:31:59,"Hi. I'm going to tell you about the story of abuse and horror that happened inside my own household. I'm a young girl who has a family that belongs in the middle class. We are not rich but we can live with what we have right now. Due to that, my mother worked harder because my dad didn't have any job. We live in a small town and we are still living in our grandparents' house, due to the fact that my parents can't afford a house yet. The only thing that my dad can offer us is shelter. As I grew up, my mom used to go to the city to work for better opportunities. My sister moved along with our mom so she can study in a better school, while I was still in elementary that's why my education wasn't much of a big deal that time. In short, I was left with my dad and my grandparents, getting to see my mom and sister every weekends only. One time, my mom went home to our house and all of them were just casually talking outside of our small room. I was inside the room, fidgeting with my phone and just glancing outside to check on them every now and then. My dad has anger issues. He has a terrible temper and every little issue can be a big deal to him, which explains why he didn't have a job. I somehow see him as incompetent, just depending on my mom to make a living for the four of us. As a kid, the thought of that entered my young mind already. As a kid, I noticed that my dad inherited it from his very own father. Well, my grandfather worked his life for his family but he has the same anger issues as my father. Patience for them wasn't even a thing. Even in old age, my grandfather used to fight with my dad over small things. One day, they fought. I cannot remember what the argument was about, but I could remember my grandfather throwing water at my dad. As someone who gets easily ticked off, my dad punched his own father. It didn't matter to my dad that his father was old and probably more grumpy than ever because of his old age. For me, my dad was being unreasonable. I remember, watching in horror and fear, that my grandfather slipped on the water he threw on my father after getting punched in the face. The way his body fell down echoed throughout our house, the way his head fell down on the tiles, the way my mother screamed in worry, the way I got up from my bed trembling, I still remember all of those vividly. My grandmother wasn't home that time, it was the perfect time for my father to cover up his stupidity. That time, I could see how hopeless my mother was. My grandfather got unconscious- he wasn't dead but my mother was aware that the fall would somehow affect his body. The vulnerability of my mother was shown, knowing how worried she was of the possibility that my father would be going to jail and my grandmother asking us to leave the only house we could stay at. She was scared, I was scared, my dad was scared. At that time, I was thinking. What could an eight-year-old ever do in such a depressing and traumatic situation? Where would my sister and my mother go if ever my dad got to jail? Would we even survive with the small amount of money my mom has? Can we live without the shelter only dad can offer? In the back of my mind, I was hoping, I could let all the fear and anxiety go. I was hoping I could forget- Hoping I could forget how my grandfather's eyes rolled to the back of his head, hoping I could forget how he turned bedridden, hoping I could forget the guilt that started building up as I grew older, hoping I could have done something. -"

I grinned menacingly,sticking my fingers up at his oblivious covered face garnering a laugh from my entourage. His voice cracked as he began to slowly count. One , two ,three Four , five , six... Corey's voice got fainter every second, and we all sprinted in various directions in search of the perfect hiding place. I already knew where I was going. I pushed joey away who was hot on my tail and forced him into finding his own cover and place to lay low. I darted towards the forest and crossed the treeline, my form mingling and meshing with the swaying shadows. I was always great at camouflage and hiding and never getting found. Joey was good to though and I couldnt let him win today. He had won yesterday and I couldnt risk loosing my title as best in the village. As my feet met the pine needles the muffled sounds of my foot steps travelled nowhere. Fading into nothingness. The forest welcomed my arrival with an orchestra of sounds ,or maybe it was a warning, looking back it was probably the latter. Completely alone save the ravens that mocked me from above, I pushed forward and the forest pushed back scratching everywhere cloth did not cover. A sea of green enveloped me and distorted all sense of direction but I proceeded and let the landscape dictate my course. I was going to win this time. I was certain off it. The forest felt eery though for some unapparent reason. The faces formed by flickering light watching me from between the interlinking branches and dense underbrush felt alive ,and more than simple paradoilia . They taunted me, followed my every move pushing me deeper and further away from the safety of my peers. I continued, silently soothing myself with every forward step. The need to piss instantly taking over. Why do I always need to fucking piss? I muttered to myself. My teeth stuck to my dry lips and parched mouth begged for relief after the sudden sprint. A mr freeze sure would be good right now I thought. After this I could stick it to joey the lips  Johnson and prove once and for all I was champion in town and he would never hold my title. The things we deem so important as kids seem so unremarkable now but back then to me my reputation was everything even in the art of hide and seek. I wish I was given the opportunity to taunt and wave my victory in his face but unfortunately that moment only played out in my minds what ifs . I guess you could say he most definitely is champion though, especially if he is still out there ,alone waiting to be found. I lay beneath the shrubbery in a thick patch of underbrush and wrapped my legs around each other to stop any unwanted leaks if you know what I mean. I slowed my breathing and resisted any itch or crawling critters that usually would cause me to flail and jump about. Stealth mode activated Silent and motionless I listened. One by one in the distance I heard bursts of excitement and jumbled voices as my friends were caught one by one before silence eventually smothered everything again. Despite my raised back and prickling neck hairs I ignored the burning desire to snap my head around in response to the soft footsteps that seemed to circle my position. A nervous smile crept over my face as I pictured Corey closing in, like a leopard circling it's prey. The footsteps slowly approached and loose clouds of dirt rose in miniature clouds and a pine cone rolled towards me. I shook with sheer excitement and nervousness being so close yet undetected. I saw large black boots appear in front of me and a cigarette butt that hit the ground. The smoke swirled and fluttered upwards towards the trees canopy and skies. This clearly was not Joey or any of my friends for that matter. I slowly put my hand over my mouth to stop any unwanted shrieks escaping the barriers my lips had formed. Something inside told me I needed to run, that I was in immediate danger but I desperately fought the urge. The sudden rush of adrenaline flooding my bloodstream caused my body to tighten and eyes to widen. I watched to my complete relief as the boots turned and slowly walked away , disappearing into the dense and vast forest behind some blackberry ditches. I giggled a nervous sigh of relief and assured myself I was over reacting. I wish that was true. Minutes later I heard Lillys mom call from the distance. That meant the gig was up and I obviously had won. I strutted out of my hiding place my victory walk,head held high and quickly exited the forest and made my way towards the group that had assembled in the field opposite the tree line. People didn't seem to care about my gloating and something was clearly wrong. Amy was crying, saying she heard someone scream and rough trampling like a struggle taking place in the bushes. She then ran and abandoned her position in search of her friends and some sense of safety. Panic quickly ensued when we suddenly realized joey was nowhere to be found. Just like joey I thought, come out I yelled, hands cupping my mouth like a make shift mega phone He never did come out,and the group grew in size and before long it wasn't a game any more. A feeling of dread swept through all of us. Parents called police and they soon arrived and a childrens game of hide and seek turned into a game that involved the whole neighbourhood. I watched as parents eyed each other desperately, speaking in that silent language only parents understood. For the first time in my childhood though I did understand and knew something really bad had happened. When joeys mom arrived her frantic pacing appeared as if her body would soon separate into many forms and run in all directions in search of her only son. It was a scene I can not forget no matter how hard I try. Days felt like weeks and slowly time ticked by. Search and rescue found nothing and all avenues were completely exhausted.

19,vulnerability,nosleep,I am a professional voyeur [1],133,g123n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g123n6/i_am_a_professional_voyeur_1/,2020-04-14 18:57:25,"People at their most vulnerable help me get my rocks off. There is no way to pretty that up in the slightest so I don't intend to. It started years ago when I found cam girls on the internet. I could interact with them, pay them, demand certain sexual poses from them for the money, but at a certain point, that felt too similar to regular pornography. It wasn't enough. There wasn't any kind of risk to it. I might as well hire a prostitute. I wanted the real deal. I wanted the amateur quality that you can't get out of porn or cam girls. I wanted reality. Vulnerability. A person's essence. I wanted to *know* them better than anyone else. It's really quite beautiful. So I took the huge windfall of cash after my father's passing and bought an apartment complex with wide hollow walkways hidden within the walls for maintenance workers to shimmy through. Perfect. I renovated the place, making the hidden walkways more comfortable, drilling holes in the ceiling over every bedroom, setting up surveillance equipment. I would have people paying *me* to prey on *them*. Within six months after the initial purchase of the property, I was able to begin looking over applicants. The first several were families or single men. I pondered as to whether or not I should shred these applications, but figured it may look strange if the entire complex was occupied by single women. Without a question, I did not want to draw any attention. So I began doing background checks and drawing up agreements. Ten rooms. Two of them with single women. One blonde. One red head. I watched them when they showered. I watched them when they would get ready for work. I watched them when they slept sometimes. It was orgasmic. The sheer pleasure I received from looking upon their mostly still forms while they lay in their beds is beyond description. That was the beginning, really. Then I moved on. They bored me. So I moved on to the men. Then the families. Don't get your panties in a bunch, you freaking saints. I never watched the children shower or use the bathrooms. I never watched the children sleep. They were off limits. But the things that men do, and yes it's mostly the men that do it, are lots of fun to watch. When they believe they are entirely alone and they strip themselves down to their skivvies and click over into the incognito mode on their phones or computers. Some of them like to look at the strangest things. Delightful. It may make your skin crawl but it makes mine ripple and quiver. I took up in one of the units. The only one on the very top floor. It was a nice place. I'd had the workers take all the walls down so that I had one massive floor. One corner had my desktop with the monitors. When I wasn't squeezed into the walls or ceilings of my tenant's living quarters, I was sitting there. I made sure that the door to my unit was very secured. What with its many locks and steel frame. Then that urge I've lived with my entire life came back. Looking in on those people was no longer enough. I exercised my *right* as their landlord to check in on the units while they were away. Sometimes I would eat cereal out of their cabinets or curl up in their beds. The smell of these strangers was intoxicating. I wanted to swallow their sheets and choke on them. I wanted to strip down and have them walk in on me with my birthday suit entirely exposed to them. How delightful. I hid in the red head's bedroom closet. She was messy, using the closet sparingly, instead opting to drop her clothes on the floor like some mish mash rug of sporadic clothing. I stayed in their for two days without her knowing it, using one of her tall leather boots as a waste receptacle. I am sure she will find it soon enough. How delightful. I stole one of the male tenants cats. He notified me of it and I responded that we had a zero tolerance policy on pets. He dropped the issue immediately, stuttering something about how he was just cat sitting. Don't worry. I keep the cat in my fish tank. Sometimes I take the blonde's tennis shoes and wear them around town. I *know* I'll be caught one day. I *know* it, but don't care. That's a part of the allure, don't you understand? It's so *delightful.* For about the last week, I'd taken a hiatus from tormenting my tenants from the shadows. My unit needed to be cleaned as I'd been so entirely preoccupied on this titillating hobby of mine. I wiped the dried fluids off the underside of my desk. I mopped and did my laundry. The strong smell of freshly cut onions stuffed beneath my arms had begun to follow me everywhere I'd go. A well respected landlord of this little community couldn't be going about like that, now could he? I found a camera lens in the drain of my shower. It was something I'd almost missed, but it was there. It shined, peeking at me from the little metal cross section in the drain. Strange. I had never implemented any surveillance in my own unit. The demo of the shower was quick work. I removed the plastic tub and found that the camera was attached to all manner of wiring underneath. They ran into the walls and upon further inspection, I found that one of the wires ran the length of the wall in my unit until it exited the inside of the wall again through a hole I'd never noticed before. The wire ran directly into the back of my computer. I'd never seen the port. It wasn't ethernet. It wasn't USB. I couldn't find anything online about the kind of wire I was dealing with at all. I rebooted the computer and found a program on the desktop I'd never seen before. It pulled up a video feed. There was gaunt sickly man sitting in a swivel chair at a desk with too many monitors. The camera was peering in at him from somewhere behind. I lifted my arm over my head while looking at the monitor. The man in the feed did the same. It was me. I moved across the room, watching the man in the feed mimic my motions. Where was that damned camera? It took a little trial and error and a lot of me looking back at the monitor to see where I was relative to the camera angle, but I eventually found the thing snugly tucked away in the vent on the wall opposite the desk. It was well beyond my understanding of tech. The camera was no larger than my thumb. The small camera smashed into a thousand tinier pieces as I pelted it against the wall. The speakers at my desk squeaked and I dashed back over to the desk, sitting in my swivel chair. The screen was black now. I alt f4-ed out of the program and it stuttered before closing. I then went to the surveillance program I used on my tenants and clicked it open. All of the monitors came to life at once with live video feed from the units below. Eyes stared back at me from all of them. Without realizing it, I reared back in the chair and flipped onto the floor. Slowly, I crept back over the edge of the desk to look at the feed. They were dead eyes. No. They were never alive. They were all mannequins. Motionless, porcelain white skin, staring through those illusive cameras I'd set up. I moved to the nearest window and peeked out through the blinds. The complex's parking lot was empty except for my own blue Mazda. I shut the computer off, trying to get my breathing under control. After staring at the blank screens for about an hour, I decided to physically check in on my tenants. Apartment after apartment. Nothing but frozen mannequins. Some of them were pressed against spots that I knew had hidden cameras, some of them were in the middle of daily routines they would never finish. One stood over a plate of scrambled eggs at a kitchen counter. Another lay in bed with their eyes staring directly up into the ceiling. I retreated back to my unit, being sure to secure every single lock in the door. I turned the computer back on and clicked from camera to camera. Every single mannequin was gone. Instead there was a message scrawled on paper and placed in front of each of the cameras. The word repeated in every camera, in every frame. Hi. Was all it said. My stomach churned. My mouth was dry. The familiar smell of thick sweat broke out. This was *not* [delightful.](URL"
20,vulnerability,nosleep,The Giant's Tail - How I nearly died in an abandoned paper mill.,1,fgx5cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fgx5cr/the_giants_tail_how_i_nearly_died_in_an_abandoned/,2020-03-12 00:28:31,"I know what the end of the world sounds like, I was there. By the turn of the millenium, the paper industry around Kalamazoo, Michigan was a wasteland of gigantic buildings, superfund sites, and rough neighborhoods. Even a small paper mill employs a few thousand people, and the area had lost seven of them in the past few decades. Every one of the Seven Sisters had died with a whisper. If it wasnt for the university, the town would have dried up entirely. As it was, most of the area, and especially the smaller towns, were hanging by a thread. The city motto should be Kalamazoo, a great place to be from! The mammoth GPI paper mill was less than a quarter mile from our workshop and had been sitting abandoned for years. Thanks to some local support we got permission to Take anything but the paint provided we could haul it out within a two-week window before the demolition crew began their work. We literally signed our lives away on release forms, and the security guard shook his head and smiled when he gave us a key. For half a month we backed up a twenty-foot long aging box truck with a questionable transmission, and sucked the marrow from the dying bones of industry to feed our little community makerspace. We had a blast. For a team of young nerds and engineers this was like Mardi-Gras and Christmas combined. We explored every inch of the half-mile-long building and filled our truck dozens of times over with shelving, valves, Allen Bradley switchgear, metal stock, and tooling that dated back several wars. Most of it would have been worthless to the scrap companies, but to us it was treasure that would become parts for some of our most famous projects for the next fifteen years. Anything of real value had already been stripped out. The giant machines had all been sold at auctions years ago. The meth-heads took most of what was left, stripping the wire from the walls. Every conduit was empty, pigtails only a few inches long left hanging out. Tens of thousands of dollars in copper, all to feed someones addiction. The facility was a cavernous, post-apocalyptic wasteland. Its the kind of place they use for movie sets and photography shoots. There were jagged pipes and conduits, razor sharp and jutting out at odd angles. There were holes large enough to drop a city bus through that went down three floors, where gigantic paper machines once sat. The entire place was festooned with ankle-breakers, sets of four bolts, sticking up from the concrete floor where some control stand or grinder or something was once bolted down, waiting for the next person who didnt pay very close attention where they stepped. In a world where everyone has turned into a pussy, with people making careers out of being offended on the behalf of other people, and with lawyers having worked with insurance companies to take all of the good honest fun out of getting your hands dirty and doing something dangerous, this was heaven for a twenty-something country boy. My weirdo friends and I were having the time of our lives. We wandered,shopped, and explored for a week before we noticed it. I was fifteen feet in the air, trying to unbolt an old electric fire alarm horn from a steel beam, and just by chance happened to glance to my left. There, nestled in between a pair of I-beams, was what looked like three large 4-inch pipes. Only the ribbed texture gave it away. I rubbed a small spot, taking fifty years of paper dust and pigeon shit off with my thumb, and showing a beautiful, faded, red jacket underneath. It wasn't a pipe; it was a cable. It was gigantic cable! It was copper cable. I followed its path and saw that it went up to the very top of the ceiling, across the roof struts of the main gallery, down the other side and vanished through the floor. The room that I was in was forty-feet high, and it was easily two-hundred feet across the gallery. The only reason this was still there was because it was so well hidden, tucked away in the beams and camouflaged in the grunge. The meth-head scrappers were so caught up in the half-inch and other small EMT conduits theyd never thought to look for the main power feeds that supplied whole sections of the plant. The problem was, how in the hell were we going to get it down? This stuff weighs about fifteen-pounds to the foot. Its thicker than my arm, and comprised of three stranded cables, each over an inch thick, entwined in padding and insulation, and all wrapped in a metallic shell with a red plastic outer jacket. Its tough, heavy, and worth several dollars a pound... ...that is if you can move it, if you can cut it, and if you can get it out of the ceiling without killing yourself. I got on my radio and the whole team assembled. We all had a quiet freakout when the team realized the gravity of our discovery, and also how hard it would be to get it out of there. Certainly, this was a great place to have to push, pull, lift, and haul tons of materials at once. The problem was that none of the old material-handling equipment was there anymore, and we didnt have any kind of power to use tools as it was. The building was a long dead carcass at this point, and we were the absolute last team that would be in there before giant machines turned the whole place into tidy piles of steel, concrete, stainless, and glass. We needed a plan, and one that would work on human power. We all headed back to the lab and assembled every harness, rope, comealong, and sling we could find. I pulled out my climbing bags and non-industrial harnesses as well. The next morning we all met at the lab, and then headed over to Site-T as we had come to call it. Now, we had a whole new mission. This old abandoned building was about to become fundraising for our little nonprofit and help us keep the heat on all winter. We set to work with slings and come-alongs. A come-along (pronounced without the hyphen and in three smashed together syllables while holding a Vernors and smoking a Camel), is a lever-actuated ratchet and pawl winch. Smaller ones have a piece of aircraft cable that winds around a drum, and larger ones use a chain and cog mechanism that can let an average man rip a tree out of the ground. Theyre small, portable, dont require electricity or gasoline, and are incredibly powerful. Theyre also dangerous as hell if you dont know what youre doing. If an attachment slips, if you overload one, or if anything lets go they can slingshot the tail and that piece of aircraft cable moving at Mach speed will slice you to the bone before you even know youre bleeding. Stupid hurts and scars carry lessons. The cables ran in a metal tray for most of their length. The tray was steel, and looked like a ladder with flat rungs. Like everything else in the whole place, it was covered in eighty-years of paper dust that formed a hard, grey shell on everything. The parts up in the main gallery had an extra layer of pigeon shit, just for flavour. It was slow work with hacksaws and flashlights. A single piece, about three-feet-long was about as much as you wanted to carry at one time if you had to walk any real distance. In most cases, it was about a 2-city-block walk back to the truck. So we worked in teams, some cutting, and most hauling. It was filthy, grueling, exhausting work that went on for days. After getting all of the low-hanging fruit, it was time to get the main runs down from the ceiling. Wed cut the ends back at the switchgear cabinets free as high as we could reach while standing on the cabinets. But that still left about twenty feet of cables hanging from the ceiling. From there they ran all the way across the gallery and down the other side. They went through a hole in each floor with a bunch of other pipes and conduits. At the bottom they made a bend in the lowest floor, a sub-basement about seventy feet down from the top of the run up in the roof. The bottom run was suspended in a tray along the ceiling of the basement and ran through the maze of pipes that fed the old mill. Wed gotten everything we could easily reach, and now it was time for the hard stuff. With a hodgepodge of slings tied to everything we could reach that was solidly bolted down, we hooked up to just one of the three cables. The plan was to pull them out, one at a time, and let them just pile up on the floor. Wed cut it, haul it, and then pull the next one down. The only thing left holding the cables in place at this point was gravity, but there was a hell of a lot of gravity in one of these cables. There was also, we learned quickly, a lot of stretch. We were spread out along the length of the run. A small group was working the winches in the basement, the rest were stationed in ones and twos strung from hell to breakfast. We all had our radios and were in communication, but for the most part it was a nearly silent process that involved a lot of standing around and smoking a cigarette while watching nothing much happen. I was up in the ceiling, sitting on a pair of old steam pipes that ran parallel to the cable tray. I was at the top level, about ten feet from the last bend where they dropped down to terminate at the switchgear cabinets. My job was simple, report when it started to move. Once the end of the cable passed by me, my job was to inch along with it and give progress reports. We knew it would take hours to pull it out of there. I got comfortable and listened to the cable tick quietly as they slowly worked the ratchet a quarter-mile away from me. The basement team worked slowly, a synchronized team all working their levers together in time. I could hear the sound of them ratcheting their come-alongs as it echoed up from the depths of the mill across the cavernous gallery where I sat. The quiet of the mill was awesome. Every few seconds I would hear the cable tick off in the distance ahead of me. They were pulling on the far end, and ever so slowly they were putting more and more tension on the cable. By now it was easily several thousand pounds at the far end. It was fascinating to realise that something so big, so heavy, could actually stretch. Their end had already moved by a few feet, while mine sat perfectly still. Then suddenly..BRRRRRT! The cable moved about six inches and I nearly pissed myself. It was loud, damn loud, and I startled out of my daydreaming when the whole tray made the sound as the ribbed surface of the cable dragged over the rungs in the tray. A dozen pigeons took flight from the rafters and either went out the smashed windows near the ceiling or did laps around the gallery before picking a new spot to sit. It sent a shower of dust and birdshit raining down on the gallery, falling into the giant holes below and settling into the darkness. The radio cracked to life as everyone checked in. We were all fine, but we all had a healthy dose of fear. We knew wed awoken a sleeping Giant, and we all had a serious respect for the dangerous combination of energy, weight, and heights we were working with. This was especially true for my dumb ass perched up in the rafters sitting only a few feet from the Giants tail. The dust settled and the silence was again broken by the ratcheting off in the depths of the mill and the rhythmic ticking of the cable. Every thirty seconds or so the tension would release as the cable shifted with a BRRRRRRRT and moved along another six inches. This was going to take a while. I got comfortable, I enjoyed the view from my perch and passed the time smoking cigarettes and keeping track of the slow climb of the end of the cable. Over the next hour the pattern of the ticks and the BRRRRTs had stayed pretty constant and while progress was slow, it was consistent. After an hour or two, the pattern started to change, and that got my attention. The cable went BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT for a solid ten seconds, which is a lifetime in that situation, and moved about two feet. My asshole did a fantastic impersonation of a rabbits nose. This was a lot more than the six or eight inches we had been getting. I got on the radio and asked if everything was ok and everyone said they were fine. I told them about the development on my end, and everyone along the length had seen or heard it as it happened. We took this as good progress, and continued on. Things started moving a lot faster now. We all woke up from our cable-pulling trance and focused. The Giant was stirring. The cable started moving a few feet at a time, a few times a minute. The basement team kept pulling, and I could see the end just over the edge from the switchgear area. Wed moved the whole run almost twenty feet. BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth That was different...the cable moved about ten feet and I saw the end flop up and over the turn at the switchgear area. It was maybe five feet from my perch. The whole cable moved, and then shifted gears and slowed down to a crawl before stopping. Before it had just stopped. You couldn't get a pin up my ass with a jackhammer. I heard the radio say Look alive! Shits moving! and I replied to the team with Everyone be ready to run and find a shady spot. A minute later, it did it again, BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrth and I watched the end drag on past me. I turned in my perch and debated following it along the pipes up here, or climbing down and watching from the slightly safer vantage point of the ground. See, up here, there was no way I could get out of the way. At least on the ground I could run. I was just off to the side of the pipes, standing on the unistrut racks over the switchgear cabinets with my head just under the cable tray when it happened. BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR And thats when the world exploded. The cable didnt slow down, it accelerated, quickly. The forces had reached their tipping point and there was a lot more gravity pulling down on the vertical run than there was friction from the long horizontal run. We had given it a gentle nudge of a few tons and once it had reached the tipping point, gravity took over. Several tons of cable was now in motion, turning potential into kinetic energy and building inertia. The fundamental forces of the universe were thrashing to come back into balance. It was like watching entropy have a bad acid trip. I hugged the unistrut rack I was climbing on, being very aware of the vulnerability and openness of my current position and tried very hard not to piss down my leg. I mostly succeeded. The sound was deafening. People always describe things like this as comparing them to a freight train. Fuck your freight train. Ive stood next to a thousand freight trains over the years and none of them sounded even remotely like this. The ribbed conduit flew over the rungs in the cabletray and sounded like a thousand chainsaws competing in the Indy500 while being shelled with naval artillery. The loose end of the cable, now moving at highway speeds whipped into mounts and pipes and hangers and destroyed anything it touched, exploding into a rain of shrapnel and dust. The entire ceiling turned into a plume of birdshit and paper dust, and the building shook to its foundations as the cable made the corner from the rafters to the drop and flew from its vertical run to just land limp on the concrete floor in a gigantic pile. The silence was even more deafening than the armageddon I had just experienced. The echos took half a minute to die out in the bowels of the old mill. The radio went apeshit as a dozen people all tried to see how many of us had died. God had smiled on us, though some of us would have to change our shorts, nobody had so much as a scratch. A couple members of the team didnt stop running until they were on the other end of the building, one even ran all the way outside and it was still falling after they made it out there. It felt like we had slayed a Giant. We all gathered at the Giants pile on the floor of the main gallery. There was a smaller pile in the basement, but the cable had bent and hung up here and dropped the majority of itself in a tangle. We were thankful for that, it saved having to haul it up a few flights of stairs. We all took a minute to just breathe, have a smoke, and let the adrenaline pass. None of us were expecting such an experience, but there wasnt a person standing there who didnt have a smile on their face. We headed out for a couple hours, to get a quick shower, change our clothes, and grab something to eat. But every single one of us was back at the lab, ready to go shortly after. We went back to the old mill and repeated the experience, twice, by morning. It took us days to get the piles cut to portable pieces. We got smart though, and learned we could haul them up to the door in fifty-foot lengths by dragging them as a team. Then wed cut them up near the truck and just load them on. The scrap value from all that cable paid the rent, kept the lights on, and fed the team for quite a while. The experience of nearly dying in the rafters of a paper mill though, that was priceless. I enjoy being happy in dangerous ways, and I can now say, I know what the end of the world sounds like."

I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry? I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isnt that enough? Todays tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called puberty but that sounds so boring. They wonder if itll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesnt. Journal, you must be curious about todays testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I dont like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life Im being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says its all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! Ill be back in a little while... So it turns out Ill be doing a new test. Fire... Im not excited for it! Im terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that Im being selfish for trying to get out of it! I dont wanna be selfish! I dont want papa to hate me... Im a terrible Project arent I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa s yet Im always so scared. Im a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! I had to take a small break from writing... its been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I cant test myself Ill hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, What are you doing my little project? I love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! Punishing myself for being a bad project! I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesnt matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself! The strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! Thats so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness its testing time! Ill right as soon as one back... Have you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you havent you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I was for an hour or two and lost control of my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didnt even know why I was crying. They took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as spinal fluid. Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. Its not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didnt have a brain. I didnt exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I cant die though. I really want to. Im gonna ask papa if Ill be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that cant be filled. Oh yay! Its almost lunch time. Ill write back soon. I asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didnt seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad. Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, Why would you want to die, my little project? I told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didnt seem too happy. I think Ive found a new hobby though! Its finding out how to die! Ive tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. Its bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal! Well good day journal... I actually dont know if its day time or not... I dont know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense Im still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didnt kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? Im not sure that Im happy. They had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldnt struggle at all. Surprisingly they didnt gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, Why arent I gagged? Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, You arent gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt. I started to whimper a little. Melting doesnt sound fun at all! The strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does African decent mean? Ill ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before? I was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. Papa! Please no more! I screamed.... but he didnt hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but its for the great or good right! Right? As I screamed and begged my tongue melted. Aaarhg haaaa! Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. Dont touch me! I want my papa! Papa! I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. Papa, I want my papa! I continued to scream but papa... he wasnt there! Why wasnt he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts were working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh. I thought that theyd let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... They gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said The little shits screams are pissing me off! I dont know what I little shit is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. Whats that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless. Papa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. Where were you papa? Why did you leave me? I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, sorry champ! I had some business to attend to. I asked him about it and he told me A good project doesnt need to know such things. I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! He ruffled my hair and said, You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on. I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didnt work! When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again. After the test I really wanna die. I dont really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone. The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him whats on his chest. What are those squishy things on your chest? The strange man looked... insulted? Papa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But whats a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently weve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why hes not a he or a sir but I didnt really listen. They soon left alone. Papa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently Im depressed and showing suicidal tendencies which is odd. Its pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I cant die right? As for the depression... I dont know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though. Hey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasnt that good if Im being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I dont know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasnt like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. Hes the bad man with the silver badge I think. I was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. Its ok Project... itll be ok. I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. I didnt ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I dont think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that its normal to feel like that. Papa told me it happened because the old band man with the silver badge was in charge of security. Anyways... Im tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal."

I found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasnt the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldnt speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me! His restraints were also different. But then again hes a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do missions. Papa said I will never do missions because Im too... fragile which is odd sense Ive been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff. The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open. He didnt heal.... hes not like me. Hes a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think Ill be having dreams about him for a long time. I dont even know what he did to me! I didnt understand it and I cant understand it because papa said he doesnt want me too! They ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Arent you grateful project! Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasnt been back sense and papa is upset with me. Papa, Im grateful and happy! I dont need a mama or anyone! All I need is you! After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy. Papa says new test are going to begin soon. Ill be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I dont really want to do it. The great or good doesnt sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!"
23,vulnerability,nosleep,My name is project #124 part two,1,fhc04y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fhc04y/my_name_is_project_124_part_two/,2020-03-12 17:25:50,"My name is project #124 part two Papa asked me a strange question. I was sitting in my room after being stunned by one of the bad men and having a five hour test with no breaks. Papa was drawing blood from me again when he said, Project #124, are you happy, are you sad? Maybe you are angry? I stared at papa unsure of what to say. I never give much thoughts to my feelings. I mean yeah I felt fear and intense pain almost everyday. Isnt that enough? Todays tests were also quite odd. It turns out I was correct about being in my teen years. The doctors have been prepping me for this thing called puberty but that sounds so boring. They wonder if itll affect my regeneration abilities. I hope it doesnt. Journal, you must be curious about todays testing. Well today they drowned me. Over and over and over again. I dont like it... I keep dying over and over again and once I come back to life Im being forced into a cold wet darkness again! My chest burns still but papa says its all for the great of good! I love papa and papa never lies! Oh papa needs me! Ill be back in a little while... So it turns out Ill be doing a new test. Fire... Im not excited for it! Im terrified and I begged papa not to make me but papa told me that Im being selfish for trying to get out of it! I dont wanna be selfish! I dont want papa to hate me... Im a terrible Project arent I? Projects are suppose to be perfect for their papa s yet Im always so scared. Im a bad project! Bad! Bad! Bad! I had to take a small break from writing... its been probably two hours which is fine. It gave me enough time to punish myself for being a bad project. When I was smaller they use to cut me up and whip me or beat me when I was bad. Papa sometimes makes the test even more painful as punishment, but sense I cant test myself Ill hand by head against the wall until my head cracks. Papa walked in on me doing it earlier then said, What are you doing my little project? I love it when papa calls me his little project! I was so happy I could feel my smile growing! Punishing myself for being a bad project! I replied happily. Bang! Bang! Bang! I went back to doing that while papa watched and took notes. I wonder what the notes were for. That doesnt matter though. My journal is all bloody though. Some of the blood on my head is still wet. Oh and papas still here! He must be so proud of me for punishing myself! The strange man with the weird chest came into my room with papa! Thats so weird, no one but papa comes in. He asked me some questions about my feelings or whatever. He asked me about things that make me happy and sad. Papa and project omega make me happy! I only ever feel sad when I upset papa. When I told him all that he and papa left. Oh goodness its testing time! Ill right as soon as one back... Have you ever had your brain removed? Well of course you havent you silly journal! Well I had mine removed. As soon as it left I blanked out. Then when a new brain grew in its place I forgot who I was for an hour or two and lost control of my Blatter. I cried the whole time and I didnt even know why I was crying. They took and small circular saw to my skull and cut it open. I was as per usual awake! When they took my brain out I guess they drained my head of its fluid as well because I saw my old brain along with some tunes labeled as spinal fluid. Journal, I have a question. Is it weird to feel empty. I feel empty right now. Its not happy nor is it sad. Just empty. Is it weird that I long to feel how I felt when I didnt have a brain. I didnt exist in a sense... I was nothing and I miss being nothing. Is that what death is like? If it is then I wish I could die. I cant die though. I really want to. Im gonna ask papa if Ill be allowed to die one day because existence fills me with an empty void inside that cant be filled. Oh yay! Its almost lunch time. Ill write back soon. I asked papa if I could die. Then I told him that I want to die. He didnt seem to understand that existence is pain for me and called me selfish for asking such a thing. Now I feel bad. Instead of pounding my head into the well I took to bitting the flesh in my arms. Papa watched and took notes again. He then said, Why would you want to die, my little project? I told him how I felt without a brain. I told him about this new empty feeling. Papa didnt seem too happy. I think Ive found a new hobby though! Its finding out how to die! Ive tried multiple ways in my room. Chocking, cuffing, opening my skull. Nothings working though. I hope this fire project kills me. Its bed time now. Papa says I have to put you away because I have a big day coming up! Fire testing! I hope it kills me. Goodnight journal! Well good day journal... I actually dont know if its day time or not... I dont know much of anything anymore. Have you ever been burned alive journal? Well I have and sense Im still writing in you then you have already figured out that this test didnt kill me. Papa was happy about the test results. The strange man seemed to be happy too, but me? Im not sure that Im happy. They had me suspended in the air. My arms and legs were restrained so I couldnt struggle at all. Surprisingly they didnt gag my mouth. As the bad men tightened my binds I asked papa, Why arent I gagged? Papa looked at me then smiled. He then said, You arent gagged because we wish to see how long it takes till your vocal cords melt. I started to whimper a little. Melting doesnt sound fun at all! The strange man said his usual monogram about me being male. What does African decent mean? Ill ask papa later. They started with small burns and I tried not to scream but ended up biting my tongue off on accident. I was drowning in my own blood when the inferno started. My body was boiling and my skin started to peel off! Have you ever been a just a skeleton before? I was charred skin and bone and it took my body... I think five hours to completely repair itself. Even my hair grew back to its normal length. They ended up putting me in a dark box... they burned me in it. It was grey and metal and the hot metal made it hurt worse. Papa! Please no more! I screamed.... but he didnt hear me. Or he pretended not to here me but its for the great or good right! Right? As I screamed and begged my tongue melted. Aaarhg haaaa! Soon it was just nonsensical gargling noises. Then they stopped because I died. But I never stay dead... I was pulled out of the dark metal box. One of the bad men vomited. Dont touch me! I want my papa! Papa! I was healing slower this time. Way slower. I caught my reflection and I so desperately wanted to sob. Black pink and red charred flesh. I could see bones and destroyed muscle tissue. Papa, I want my papa! I continued to scream but papa... he wasnt there! Why wasnt he there? Papas always there for me when I cry. They restrained me and wrote notes. I cried but... nobody cared. Not even the bad man who vomited. When my tear ducts were working again I winced at the salty tears o my open flesh. I thought that theyd let me go back to my room but i was wrong. The next few hours were they removing body parts and internal organs while I screamed for my papa... They gagged me after the first hour. One of the bad men said The little shits screams are pissing me off! I dont know what I little shit is but hearing him say that made me feel weird. Whats that word that describes a feeling of intense vulnerability? Uh... um... Helpless! I felt helpless. Papa care back after the final test. This time he carried me to my room. Where were you papa? Why did you leave me? I cried into his shirt. Papa smiled at me then said, sorry champ! I had some business to attend to. I asked him about it and he told me A good project doesnt need to know such things. I told him that I am I fact a good project! The best project! He ruffled my hair and said, You are certainly the best project... one of the greatest things I ever got the honor to work on. I almost forgot all the sadness when he said that! One of the bad men brought my food. Today it was blue squares. Papa promised me orange ones if I was good. I also tried to kill myself again. I bit into my wrist deeply where the main veins are located. Didnt work! When papa saw me he had the strange man come and ask me about my feelings again. After the test I really wanna die. I dont really like being alive because it hurts so much... I get that this is all for the great or good but what is the great or good? And why did papa disappear when they put me in the metal box! I hate it when papa leaves me alone. The strange man looked weird so I decided to ask him whats on his chest. What are those squishy things on your chest? The strange man looked... insulted? Papa laughed then explained that I had never seen a woman before? But whats a woman? The strange man explained that breast are things that women grow to feed babies? I have never seen these babies but apparently weve all been one at one point. The strange man tried to explain to me why hes not a he or a sir but I didnt really listen. They soon left alone. Papa wiped the dry blood off my face then sat me down. Apparently Im depressed and showing suicidal tendencies which is odd. Its pointless to be concerned about me feeling suicidal if I cant die right? As for the depression... I dont know what that means. It sounds like an ugly word though. Hey journal, sorry for not telling you goodnight. Although the night wasnt that good if Im being honest. A bad man came into my room last night alone. He... um... I dont know how to explain it. He did something weird to me. He touched me between my legs and then... well he... did more stuff. It hurt a lot. It wasnt like being cut up or being burned alone or drowning... it hurt differently. He left white stuff behind. Hes the bad man with the silver badge I think. I was planning on not telling papa but he found out when he woke me up. He saw the dried up stuff between my legs. Its ok Project... itll be ok. I think papa expected me to cry. I mean I did cry last night just not today. Papa took my journal too. He have it back to me after being gone for maybe half an hour. When testing came there was a new bad man with a silver badge. I didnt ask papa what happened to the old bad man. I dont think I want to know. I also had to talk more with the strange man again. The questions were about last night and how it makes me feel. I feel empty again. Like my chest is hallow. The strange man said that its normal to feel like that. Papa told me it happened because the old bad man with the silver badge was in charge of security. Anyways... Im tired. Im going to bed. Goodnight journal. I found out what happened to the old bad man with the silver badge. I was in the testing room again... only this time I wasnt the one on the table. I was strapped to a chair which was odd. The man... well he was being dissected. The way papa and his men did it ensured that the man with the silver badge was still alive. He couldnt speak though. Papa made sure of it. He was gagged with a special gag stronger than the one they use on me! His restraints were also different. But then again hes a bad man. The bad men are unnaturally strong. They are projects like me... only they get to go outside and see the sun and smell grass and do missions. Papa said I will never do missions because Im too... fragile which is odd sense Ive been cut open, killed, drowned, burned and other stuff. The bad man looked at me the whole time he was being cut open. He didnt heal.... hes not like me. Hes a project not THE PROJECT after all. They say what he did went against protocol. They ran tests on me soon after they were finished with him. I dreamed about him though. I think Ill be having dreams about him for a long time. I dont even know what he did to me! I didnt understand it and I cant understand it because papa said he doesnt want me too! They ripped off my finger nails. Then my toe nails and then my teeth. I cried of course. Papa smiled at me though so I guess I did a good job. Also the strange man is actually a female or a woman. She explained pronouns to me and explained how females work. It turns out everyone came from a mama of sorts. I asked papa about my mama... She was bad! A bad woman! I saved you from her and raised you and kept you fed and clothed! Arent you grateful project! Papa then looked over at the woman with an angry facial expression. The woman hasnt been back sense and papa is upset with me. Papa, Im grateful and happy! I dont need a mama or anyone! All I need is you! After those words left my mouth he was happy. A terrifying type of happy. Papa says new test are going to begin soon. Ill be testing out poisons! I think I prefer this over the fire treatment. Still I dont really want to do it. The great or good doesnt sound so great or good anymore... goodnight journal!"
24,vulnerability,nosleep,I was legally dead for four minutes. There is no heaven. There is no hell. We are hunted by monsters we become. I escaped. FINAL PART.,1,fkk36e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fkk36e/i_was_legally_dead_for_four_minutes_there_is_no/,2020-03-18 16:00:17,"[part one](URL [part two](URL [part 3](URL ""You mean it's not an instant thing?"" I asked incredulously. The hideous man in front of us should be dead. Well... more dead than he already was. His breathing was labored, no surprise due to the skin blocking off half his face. God knows what could be happening to his insides with show he looked on the outside. He pointed at us with one of the talons. ""You need to leave. This is my shack. I'll die here. They won't take me!"" he was raving mad, words obscured. ""Not going to take old Mickey! No they won't!"" ""We're not like them. Please, just talk to us."" Chloe said, moving toward him with her hands up in front of her. ""Chloe don't get too close!"" I shouted, trying to pull her away from the half man, half monster that she was moving toward. I didn't trust this guy, no matter if he was turned or not. He could attack any second. ""No. He could help us. I've never heard anything about someone turning and still keeping their sense of self. Maybe he knows something. Maybe he knows where they way out is!"" Her voice rose with excitement as she spoke, still edging towards him. ""Please. Mickey, right? I'm Chloe. We're not here to hurt you. Maybe we can help? How long have you been like this?"" He still had the talon raised toward her, but lowered it ever so slightly as she spoke. His eyes seemed to water a bit, giving away a vulnerability. ""You... you look like her. Ash... where is she?"" he started looking around frantically, calling out for whoever Ash was. ""She was right there with me. Oh god, Ash. I hope you're okay. If I find that bastard..."" ""What happened to you, Mickey?"" Chloe asked, moving nearer as he lowered his arm. His tears were flowing freely now, running down the overgrown skin on his mouth. He let out a muffled sob. ""We were at a festival... I heard gunshots... I put her behind me and next thing I know I'm here."" He replied quietly. ""What festival?"" I asked him. ""My hometown. It was a local beer and burger festival we have every year."" He said, looking shellshocked. It suddenly hit me that I knew what he was talking about. ""Wait. Carsonville?"" I said. He nodded. ""No way. That was six months ago. Fuck. Fucking hell. So even if you find the exit it wouldn't do any good, would it? You would still be dead."" ""Stop it."" Chloe hissed at me. I could see Mickey getting a glazed over look.My head was spinning. There was no way this could all really be happening. He's been surviving in here for six months, running from monsters and god knows what else. If he got out, who's to say he wouldn't come back as one of them? ""I'm sorry..."" I said softly, looking at him. I needed to put on a face. I wanted so badly to be brave during all this. If Mickey could face this hell for six months I could stay calm for ten minutes to help him. Look, Mickey. Maybe we can still all get out of here. Time probably doesnt work the same way. Have you heard anything about a way out? He studied me for a few moments, then scratched his head with the talon. A muffled sigh escaped him. I heard a little bit here and there. Something about a building that leads to nothing. Says its deep in the middle of town though. Where we at now? The forest. Chloe replied. It just changed a few hours ago. Hm. Factory should be next then. Be easier to find our way to the town from there. He said. Chloe gave him a look like she didnt know what he meant. He shrugged at her. This place dont work like normal. Ive wandered into the town from the forest before. Made my way into the factory from the town. Seems like the land moves when it wants but most everything stays in position relative to each other. Great. Because shit wasnt insane enough. I said. So what do we do then? Wait here until it changes again? We didnt get a chance to decide. Something had heard our exchange in the shack. There was a pounding on one of the walls as something screamed outside. The frame shook and threatened to fall in. Something was on the roof now. Time to leave. Chloe said, hefting her pipe and inching toward the door. The room continued to rattle as something stomped around above us. Trying to find a weak spot in the boards. Chloe signaled to us both as we followed her. She gave a countdown, threw open the door, and ran full sprint. We both followed. We had only made it a few feet, not even into the tree line when something grabbed her. It was large, at least fifteen feet tall. Sinewed muscle ripples across the length of its body as leathery wings unfurled. It grabbed her with two powerful arms then burst back into the air, leaving huge gashes in the earth. I hardly had a chance to shout before another just like it did the same to me. The last thing I felt before losing consciousness was the strong arms binding me to it, and it looking at me with dark, black eyes before it head butted me.  I woke up sprawled out on cold concrete. To my left I could see Chloe. To my right was an open street. Mickey was standing there, surrounded by a horde of other creatures that were already fully turned. He looked back at me, one eye completely black while the other was still an emerald green. He would have looked slack jawed if not for the skin growing over his mouth. He looked back to the monsters waiting and let out a screech. Shit. Mickey... youre still human. Come on. I said. I moved back toward Chloe and tried shaking her awake. She stirred slightly as Mickey screeched again. He began to move towards us, and finally grabbed Chloe, slicing her shoulder open as he did so. He dragged her back to the monsters. Chloe! No! I started to get up and stumble towards them, but tripped and fell. A creature on all fours leapt towards me, landing on my back and digging claws in. I screamed in pain. Chloe finally woke up, looking around her and beginning to scream in terror. Mickey threw her forward into the crowd of monsters. They continued to watch as she scrambled up, blood flowing from her shoulder and staining the pavement. Mickey, no. Youve lasted so long. Please dont do this. Chloe begged him. He looked towards the other creatures, lifting his talon toward Chloe. This was it. This must be the final measure. The transformation would be complete once he killed. The monster would take over. Mickey. Think about Ash. She needs you. Chloe said to him. He sliced the talon forward, his inhuman screech turning to a scream as his own chest was ripped open. The monsters gathered around began to screech and writhe, becoming a wrathful mass. Mickey screamed and dug the talon in further. As he did I noticed the area he was standing in grow dark. The air seemed to ripple and break, becoming a static mass. Chloe caught my eye and nodded to me. I flipped over quickly while the creature on my back was distracted. It fell to the ground with a thump and looked dazed. Chloe and I both ran toward the break in space. Chloe tried to grab Mickey on the way but he pushed her off of him, making her fall back into the void. She disappeared into thin air. I cant go. He grunted through the pain. His blood was pouring to the pavement, a deep back instead of the normal scarlet. He dug in deeper. Ashley Foreman. Please. Make sure she made it. I nodded. The monster that had been on my back was leaping towards us. Mickey pushed me out of the way at the last second, taking the full force of the hit. I saw the light fade from his remaining human eye as he hit the ground. The rest of the group fell forward onto him, ripping and tearing. Then everything went dark. Chloe was in front of me, staring at a distant point of light in the darkness. She turned to look at me as I stood. Guess this is it. She sighed. Thank you. I dont think I could have made it without your help. You kidding me? I replied. I would have been eaten way back there without you. I owe you more than my life. If youre ever in France, give me a shout. Chloe Godard. Itll be nice to get to know you out of here. Deal. I said. She held her hand out. I took it and we walked forward, stepping into the distant light.  We have a pulse! Was the first thing I heard after stepping through. I opened my eyes to see a paramedic standing over me. The next few days were a blur. From what I was told by the doctors I was dead for four minutes. It felt like days to me. I ended up staying in the hospital for a few weeks while I recovered but made it out with a broken leg, lacerated liver, and some cracked ribs. I looked up Ash when I got out. She was at the festival in Carsonville when a shooter started firing into the crowd. Her father, Mickey jumped in front of her and took the bullet, saving her life. I sent her a letter a couple of weeks ago telling her how I had died and met her dad. Letting her know that he loved her and wants the best for her. I left out the horrifying details for her sake but let her know how good of a man he was. I looked up Chloe online. Turns out she had been in a coma for the past two weeks after suffering multiple injuries from an abusive ex-boyfriend. She had a brief flatline a couple of days in but came back from it. I was there visiting when she woke up. She gave me a smile and we just sat there together for a while, feeling a nice calm after our shared ordeal. Communicating wasnt so easy. Turns out the whole time there she had been speaking French while I was speaking English. Just another weird bit to chalk up to the afterlife I suppose. We started to converse slowly, teaching each other our respective languages. We get along even better here than we did there. I dont know what caused that door to open. Whether it was Mickeys sacrifice or just right place right time. Either way, I hope Im wrong about that being the only afterlife. Hopefully thats just the place you go before its truly your time, when your fate is still undecided. Hopefully when you reach your natural end you gain the paradise [everyone speaks of. ](URL"
25,vulnerability,nosleep,"The Homeless Reaper - On the streets, I heard the cries of others before they died. Then, I saw the cause.",1,fosayi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fosayi/the_homeless_reaper_on_the_streets_i_heard_the/,2020-03-26 02:34:46,"The winters were always the worst. Even when you have a home, a job, a family and fill yourself with coffees and comfort, winters are cruel. But on the streets, when the rain slashes down threatening to slice your shivering form, or the hail pelts heavily just outside the shelter youve nabbed for the night sometimes, I secretly hoped that when I finally slept, I wouldnt wake. Its strange, because youd trawl through the days dwelling on what you did before you found yourself here, and convince yourself that you, of all the other people on the streets, didnt deserve this fate. I was a good man, Im sure. I had a job  not exactly high-flying, but steady, safe. I had a girlfriend who may, over time and a little more love, have taken me as her husband. I was happy, if not a little bored. For me, I wanted some sort of outlet- not escapism, exactly, because there was nothing to escape, except maybe that boredom. But, a spike of excitement, an injection of danger! So, one night when I went out with my colleagues and boss, I threw caution to the wind. Are you aware how many people do cocaine? Like, seriously? I was always cautious, but- I guess I was overly so because it seemed everyone but me partook. They were all in a similar position in life, if not a little further along; marriage safely in the past, kid at home or on the way. Yet, here they were giving cheeky grins above frothy pints and tiny paper parasols, as they took a toilet trip  men and women both  and returned with irritated nostrils and wide eyes. They kept offering to me, and I kept saying no. Until my boss insisted. And insisted. And insisted. Then demanded. And, well, my past was straight edge (as they pointed out, as if it were a bad thing), why not?! I dont want to dwell on the high- Im doing everything I can to forget those days, to veer away from them. But when people say that the Just Say No campaigns are overzealous and sensationalise the worst-case scenario well, maybe for some theyre right. But it turns out I had an addictive personality. That high became something I chased- no exception. Even when I was getting late on bills, and no longer seeing my partner as a priority, just that high, the need, the blurring of mundane reality, I couldnt logically conceptualise what was happening. I didnt have the capacity to stand outside of that sphere, and watch as by love and loan and line, my safe and steady life crumbled to a fine, white powder. And I probably wouldnt have cared if I could see it. After a while high was getting too normalised, diluted and boring. I suppose I was so used to it, that it was no longer the escape, but rather the standard. In a way that people rely on a morning coffee. I needed more- a different a high, a boost to the intensity. I somehow turned in to some gaunt, withered, shambling one-trick horse, chasing a crystal white carrot. And as I sped toward it, at either side of me, blurred and irrelevant, I outran everything that made me, *me*. My family, my job, my house, my savings- I only had time to stop and realise when I was yanking the soggy, moulding cardboard from the hands of another bearded, grimy-face, chequered-toothed kin. I punched the man. I punched him so I could steal away in to the night, to my favourite shop-faced alcove, and offer a layer of marginal comfort between hard floor and frayed clothes. Being homeless, well, its like nothing Ive ever experienced before. Sure, it is an overwhelmingly lonely sensation, and the sheer sense of vulnerability is crippling. But, at the same time, you get to know the ropes  like any walk of life. The rich have their way, the poor have theirs, and those with nothing to live or die for, have theirs. And even as Id lay there, shivering through the bitter cold, or sweating sheets through the sweltering humidity, the pressing longing and incessant pining was, first and foremost, for the high. My family and loved ones were there, fading somewhere on the twilight, but clasped behind white bars, or trapped in crystal prisons. I honestly never thought there would be an end to it. Then one night, about four months of this life, I saw my first death. It wasnt too cold. The remnants of a mild summer were dwindling, and the cool, warning tendrils of autumn began roaming the nights; bestowing a chill in to the cement  but not unbearable. I tucked myself away in an alley that usually had a strong, rancid stench, a mingled concoction of rotten rubbish and urine and vomit and shit. It was a place even we usually wouldnt go, but as it was a Saturday, and there was every chance wed be cornered and battered by rowdy crowds spending more in a night than wed beg for in a month. Some could be kind, offering to buy you a meal or loose change. Others, less so, throwing a chip or something less favourable in your direction. Then there were the ones as cruel as fate itself, that would offer nothing but a taunt, a jibe, or a kick for the entertainment of their friends. Usually the better dressed ones, these. The alley was putrid, but protected. I could hear the din of club music, distant squeals of drunken mirth, and one booming argument where two people had other things to worry about rather than their next fix. And though I didnt see anyone else take refuge on the alley (as I got their early to scarper through the broken shutters), I could hear someone crying at the foot of the alley, and a whispered conversation further up. I assumed the crier was a newcomer- someone who had fallen from grace in some form or other. It was truly insane of what variations landed people without home and hearth. Some were too proud to admit failure, and would rather live on the street then walk back to a family they didnt want. Others betting. Kicked out by spouse. Most were drugs. Hardly ever their fault. But the young ones, the newly homeless, well, they struggled to adapt. I didnt have the energy to scout out and pat on the back tonight. I wanted to sleep, before the night got could and I had to battle it in my conscience. But the crying continued, knitting seamlessly in to the distant nightlife, until I could hear them speaking. Not yet, is what they kept saying. Or at least, kept trying to say. There was a lot of snivelling. A lot of stuttering. A lot of whining. A lot of regret. Not yet. N-n-n- Just one more. Who they were talking to, I didnt know. What they wanted one more of, I didnt know. But I couldnt help my greed. I assume perhaps they were begging for another hit. I tried to ignore it, really wanting to sleep, but the urge was growing as voracious as any our minds harbour. I was already crawling out of the broken sheets of metal, contorting my body and sucking air through my teeth as the jagged tooth bit in to my bony, meatless back. I took a glance up to the dead end of the alley, where Id heard the hushed conversation. They didnt see me, they had started to do what many did to keep warm. There was no shame. I made my way down to the crier, who had in the time it had taken me to get out, either got what they wanted, or found some solace, because the snivelling had stopped. They were younger than me, perhaps by five years. Putting them at around twenty-five, no more than twenty-seven. Though, I could see the gauntness of them; the addled faces that had what might have once been handsome stolen and siphoned by substance abuse. And those eyes, staring ahead, glazed and pale, peering in to a night sky they didnt see. I didnt even need to check, no voice could stir him, no prying nudge of my toe could wake him. I knew most of the homeless in this area, but never seen this one around. I closed his eyelids, checked his pockets and got myself a half-smoked cigarette and less the three pounds in change, then disappointed there was nothing to snap me from reality, I slunk back to the shutters. He was still there the next day, though the two at the head of the alley had left. As I walked past him, I noticed his shoes were gone, and I remember feeling disgusted that Id not thought of it. Such was the mind-set. I wish I could say that was the turning point, but it wasnt. It brought home the reality of the situation, but my survival instincts were overridden and fell far behind the need for a high. Over the few years, my body twisted, as if corrupted, beyond recognition. I could barely notice myself in the shop window reflections, the cracked public toilet mirrors, or the creeping puddles that collected overnight. As highs came and went, Id witness similar occurrences. Less so in the summer, when picnics were commonplaces so leftovers were easy; when people were in better moods, when nature offered her invisible blanket. But the winters, oh god the crying, the whining, the snivelling. Sometimes thered even be a resigned acceptance. Sometimes I'd see them sprint, with great difficulty as their chosen influence tilted the world, stole their footfall, shifted left to right and back again.Always dead, always left, always robbed. And most of the times, I didnt care- I considered myself lucky enough to be within looting rage. New shoes, if I was lucky  I never made that mistake again. And then, I managed to win on a scratch card, not much  enough for maybe a week in a hostel, but I didnt want that. I spent every last bit of it on meth from a local dealer. And I didnt share. Id be generous with my food, if I had any  but not my drugs. When you were in possession, *you* were the top. The don. The billionaire who had everything and wouldnt give even a flake, a mote of dust that peppered off in an icy gust. No! I smoked every last twinkling gem, until all my senses *snapped* and *bent* and *frittered* away in to a null, pleasant zone in which responsibility and *misery* and *depression* and my circumstances were nothing to do with me, and my losses didnt matter, and my *ostracising* wasnt relevant, and my abscesses were ignorable, and my ulcers were numbed, and my weeping sores were sated, and all I had was sheer *ecstatic* hed*oni*sm in which I, in *whi*ch I, in *which* I, in WHI*CH* I- Fuuuuckkkk*kkkk*kkk- IN! *FUCKING*! W*H*I*C*H! I*!* In w*hi*ch I?! I heard the gentle, slow, placid pace join me in this realm. As the world was bending, and stretching and extorting in my meth-addled perception, suddenly, there was this booming clarity that demanded my attention. An anchor in the madness. And I- And I- AND! I! There! It-it-it slowy- it-it-it walked and it-it-it saw me. Tall and gaunt and broken as me. Dressed in clinging rags, that fell like a shadowy waterfall, vapour-like, silent and smoky. Ripped and torn, frayed and moth-eaten. It-it-it was coming for me. The flesh so cold and old and mottled it was difficult to discern whether it was pallid and sickly, or a casing of bone. The eyes so blackened and dulled, peering without feeling through the skeletal sockets. The form so familiar. It looked like me- my death- my wraith finally seeing an end to me. I knew it, without hearing a word. This was what the others had seen. This- this- us- them- me This was my impending end. And I wept! I begged with each footstep. I scrambled backward. I scratched at my bare skin, feeling the blood trickling down as I peeled flesh with my yellowing, unclipped nails. BEGGING FUCKING BEGGING THAT i could MaYBE JUST GET the fuck- SCREAMING, snivelling: One more day. Please, one more. Not yet. N-Not yet! I ran, without clear vision. I bashed in to walls, face first with brute force. The warmth of my blood trickled a river down to my mouth, but thats was far away - a universe away. I slapped helplessly at the building trying to scale it. Seeing in my vignette peripherals the looming figure getting ever closer. I ran, and fell, and felt the wind knocked out of me, all the whilst begging, Not yet! Just ONE more day! Around me, suddenly, I could see people. Normal people. The type of people this version of myself had crawled from. They were walking around me, giving me a wide berth. And I think I asked them for help, but they screamed in fear- not for the reaper, but for its tether on this life. To this world. The lunatic shouting for help, and more time, and not YET NOT YET NOT YET! They wanted me to go. And I couldnt speak the words I needed. They were heavy in my mouth, bleeding from my heart. They existed in their world, not mine, not *his*! I couldn't have them anymore. Neither them nor him cared for what I begged for. Not another line. Not another high! Just another day! Then I heard the world scream in a piercing roar. And a force so intense that I felt my insides shift as my bones cracked; which ones, I couldnt say at the time. The world fizzled in to blackness, with only a peeling, whining and vivid shifting bright blue illusions. I woke up in a hospital bed. My left leg was amputated. My right hand weak to invalidity. I was connected to wires and tubes- they penetrated in to the veins Id become acquainted with, and many other places. Invasive. Thick ones in here, thin ones in there, a translucent snake rode across my chest and bifurcated to delve in to each nostril. I peered around, weakly, and saw no reaper. And I sighed in relief. That was three years ago. Im clean- of drugs, at least. I still feel the pull of addiction, but by god, never has an experience haunted me as much as seeing my own death approaching; unceasing, imperceptibly certain, lurching, and looming and cold. Colder than the worst winter. Im back in touch with my family, and have even corresponded, at distance, with my ex. We will meet up. Soon, I think. I hope. But not yet. She seems happy. I don't know if I would augment or destroy that. Im going to clubs- groups! Self-help. And volunteering under supervision for those on the streets. I havent told my story until now, because I know its probably drug-induced hallucinations. But, to hear those cry and beg and die and wither, with the snivelling panic, defeated acceptance- well, Ill do everything I can to ensure nobody else has to experience it. Especially myself."
26,vulnerability,nosleep,"The Homeless Reaper - First, I heard their last cries. Then I saw why.",1,fpm09h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fpm09h/the_homeless_reaper_first_i_heard_their_last/,2020-03-27 10:21:10,"The winters were always the worst. Even when you have a home, a job, a family and fill yourself with coffees and comfort, winters are cruel. But on the streets, when the rain slashes down threatening to slice your shivering form, or the hail pelts heavily just outside the shelter youve nabbed for the night sometimes, I secretly hoped that when I finally slept, I wouldnt wake. Its strange, because youd trawl through the days dwelling on what you did before you found yourself here, and convince yourself that you, of all the other people on the streets, didnt deserve this fate. I was a good man, Im sure. I had a job  not exactly high-flying, but steady, safe. I had a girlfriend who may, over time and a little more love, have taken me as her husband. I was happy, if not a little bored. For me, I wanted some sort of outlet- not escapism, exactly, because there was nothing to escape, except maybe that boredom. But, a spike of excitement, an injection of danger! So, one night when I went out with my colleagues and boss, I threw caution to the wind. Are you aware how many people do cocaine? Like, seriously? I was always cautious, but- I guess I was overly so because it seemed everyone but me partook. They were all in a similar position in life, if not a little further along; marriage safely in the past, kid at home or on the way. Yet, here they were giving cheeky grins above frothy pints and tiny paper parasols, as they took a toilet trip  men and women both  and returned with irritated nostrils and wide eyes. They kept offering to me, and I kept saying no. Until my boss insisted. And insisted. And insisted. Then demanded. And, well, my past was straight edge (as they pointed out, as if it were a bad thing), why not?! I dont want to dwell on the high- Im doing everything I can to forget those days, to veer away from them. But when people say that the Just Say No campaigns are overzealous and sensationalise the worst-case scenario well, maybe for some theyre right. But it turns out I had an addictive personality. That high became something I chased- no exception. Even when I was getting late on bills, and no longer seeing my partner as a priority, just that high, the need, the blurring of mundane reality, I couldnt logically conceptualise what was happening. I didnt have the capacity to stand outside of that sphere, and watch as by love and loan and line, my safe and steady life crumbled to a fine, white powder. And I probably wouldnt have cared if I could see it. After a while high was getting too normalised, diluted and boring. I suppose I was so used to it, that it was no longer the escape, but rather the standard. In a way that people rely on a morning coffee. I needed more- a different a high, a boost to the intensity. I somehow turned in to some gaunt, withered, shambling one-trick horse, chasing a crystal white carrot. And as I sped toward it, at either side of me, blurred and irrelevant, I outran everything that made me, *me*. My family, my job, my house, my savings- I only had time to stop and realise when I was yanking the soggy, moulding cardboard from the hands of another bearded, grimy-face, chequered-toothed kin. I punched the man. I punched him so I could steal away in to the night, to my favourite shop-faced alcove, and offer a layer of marginal comfort between hard floor and frayed clothes. Being homeless, well, its like nothing Ive ever experienced before. Sure, it is an overwhelmingly lonely sensation, and the sheer sense of vulnerability is crippling. But, at the same time, you get to know the ropes  like any walk of life. The rich have their way, the poor have theirs, and those with nothing to live or die for, have theirs. And even as Id lay there, shivering through the bitter cold, or sweating sheets through the sweltering humidity, the pressing longing and incessant pining was, first and foremost, for the high. My family and loved ones were there, fading somewhere on the twilight, but clasped behind white bars, or trapped in crystal prisons. I honestly never thought there would be an end to it. Then one night, about four months of this life, I saw my first death. It wasnt too cold. The remnants of a mild summer were dwindling, and the cool, warning tendrils of autumn began roaming the nights; bestowing a chill in to the cement  but not unbearable. I tucked myself away in an alley that usually had a strong, rancid stench, a mingled concoction of rotten rubbish and urine and vomit and shit. It was a place even we usually wouldnt go, but as it was a Saturday, and there was every chance wed be cornered and battered by rowdy crowds spending more in a night than wed beg for in a month. Some could be kind, offering to buy you a meal or loose change. Others, less so, throwing a chip or something less favourable in your direction. Then there were the ones as cruel as fate itself, that would offer nothing but a taunt, a jibe, or a kick for the entertainment of their friends. Usually the better dressed ones, these. The alley was putrid, but protected. I could hear the din of club music, distant squeals of drunken mirth, and one booming argument where two people had other things to worry about rather than their next fix. And though I didnt see anyone else take refuge on the alley (as I got their early to scarper through the broken shutters), I could hear someone crying at the foot of the alley, and a whispered conversation further up. I assumed the crier was a newcomer- someone who had fallen from grace in some form or other. It was truly insane of what variations landed people without home and hearth. Some were too proud to admit failure, and would rather live on the street then walk back to a family they didnt want. Others betting. Kicked out by spouse. Most were drugs. Hardly ever their fault. But the young ones, the newly homeless, well, they struggled to adapt. I didnt have the energy to scout out and pat on the back tonight. I wanted to sleep, before the night got could and I had to battle it in my conscience. But the crying continued, knitting seamlessly in to the distant nightlife, until I could hear them speaking. Not yet, is what they kept saying. Or at least, kept trying to say. There was a lot of snivelling. A lot of stuttering. A lot of whining. A lot of regret. Not yet. N-n-n- Just one more. Who they were talking to, I didnt know. What they wanted one more of, I didnt know. But I couldnt help my greed. I assume perhaps they were begging for another hit. I tried to ignore it, really wanting to sleep, but the urge was growing as voracious as any our minds harbour. I was already crawling out of the broken sheets of metal, contorting my body and sucking air through my teeth as the jagged tooth bit in to my bony, meatless back. I took a glance up to the dead end of the alley, where Id heard the hushed conversation. They didnt see me, they had started to do what many did to keep warm. There was no shame. I made my way down to the crier, who had in the time it had taken me to get out, either got what they wanted, or found some solace, because the snivelling had stopped. They were younger than me, perhaps by five years. Putting them at around twenty-five, no more than twenty-seven. Though, I could see the gauntness of them; the addled faces that had what might have once been handsome stolen and siphoned by substance abuse. And those eyes, staring ahead, glazed and pale, peering in to a night sky they didnt see. I didnt even need to check, no voice could stir him, no prying nudge of my toe could wake him. I knew most of the homeless in this area, but never seen this one around. I closed his eyelids, checked his pockets and got myself a half-smoked cigarette and less the three pounds in change, then disappointed there was nothing to snap me from reality, I slunk back to the shutters. He was still there the next day, though the two at the head of the alley had left. As I walked past him, I noticed his shoes were gone, and I remember feeling disgusted that Id not thought of it. Such was the mind-set. I wish I could say that was the turning point, but it wasnt. It brought home the reality of the situation, but my survival instincts were overridden and fell far behind the need for a high. Over the few years, my body twisted, as if corrupted, beyond recognition. I could barely notice myself in the shop window reflections, the cracked public toilet mirrors, or the creeping puddles that collected overnight. As highs came and went, Id witness similar occurrences. Less so in the summer, when picnics were commonplaces so leftovers were easy; when people were in better moods, when nature offered her invisible blanket. But the winters, oh god the crying, the whining, the snivelling. Sometimes thered even be a resigned acceptance. Sometimes I'd see them sprint, with great difficulty as their chosen influence tilted the world, stole their footfall, shifted left to right and back again. Always dead, always left, always robbed. And most of the times, I didnt care- I considered myself lucky enough to be within looting rage. New shoes, if I was lucky  I never made that mistake again. And then, I managed to win on a scratch card, not much  enough for maybe a week in a hostel, but I didnt want that. I spent every last bit of it on meth from a local dealer. And I didnt share. Id be generous with my food, if I had any  but not my drugs. When you were in possession, *you* were the top. The don. The billionaire who had everything and wouldnt give even a flake, a mote of dust that peppered off in an icy gust. No! I smoked every last twinkling gem, until all my senses *snapped* and *bent* and *frittered* away in to a null, pleasant zone in which responsibility and *misery* and *depression* and my circumstances were nothing to do with me, and my losses didnt matter, and my *ostracising* wasnt relevant, and my abscesses were ignorable, and my ulcers were numbed, and my weeping sores were sated, and all I had was sheer *ecstatic* hed*oni*sm in which I, in *whi*ch I, in *which* I, in WHI*CH* I- Fuuuuckkkk*kkkkk*kk- IN! *FUCKING*!

27,vulnerability,nosleep,The Noises Next Door Keep Me Awake During My Forced Quarantine,1,fr1izx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fr1izx/the_noises_next_door_keep_me_awake_during_my/,2020-03-29 17:43:10," **Day 1** I suppose a journal is a better way than any to pass the two weeks Im going to have to spend here alone. Of course, Im not completely alone; everyone else was moved to the same building and locked in their own apartment, including a couple across the hallway and a lovely older woman, Mrs Ackery, next door. Oh, how I feel for poor Mrs Ackery, being old and so vulnerable during these turbulent times. I really cant take for granted how lucky I am to have my life spared from the increased threat of death this virus poses to the cherished elderly. Two men in protective suits came this morning to ensure I was comfortable and reminded me that a precautionary team will be ready and waiting downstairs in the foyer in case of any emergencies. I obviously said nothing to create a scene, though I will admit I scoffed to myself at the measures exercised, and all because of one returned resident who caught this virus overseas. However, someone as kind as Mrs Ackery is reason enough, for me, to accept my precautionary quarantine in a new temporary home. **Day 2** I certainly did not anticipate how tired I would be after a day of doing nothing! I must remember to be more aware of myself, as I collapsed onto the mattress with such force that I swear I must have snapped the darned thing! I jest, of course, though I do know I slept undisturbed for many hours, like a large boulder sunken beneath the crashing, yet calming, waves. It was unfortunate that when I did awake, I could overhear yelling that spawned from the couples apartment across the hall. As a self-proclaimed gentleman, I exerted my greatest efforts to simply mind my own business, though a sublime combination of the couples exuberant voices, and not having anything better to do, myself, I simply could not help but hear a large portion of the presumed ordeal. I could not make out many words, though a loud and sudden thud brought finality to the couples topic. I am not ignorant to certain trials men and women in relationships may face, particularly when there is no escape from one another, though the passing of a mere 24 hours before the first fight is a noticeable effort, one cannot deny. I have heard no noise from Mrs Ackerys apartment, though, to be fair, I do not suppose I have made much noise myself. Perhaps if I was joined by a member of the opposite sex, I too, could contribute such vibrant sounds to the building. **Day 3** Slept, as some say, like a baby, again, last night. All was still and silent when I awoke, granting me a peaceful morning of absorbing the sunshine with a hot tea. My mood was slightly soured by my stumble over a small, dense tube that had protruded through an accurately measured hole by the locked entrance. I have not noticed neither the tube nor the hole before, though I confess I have not been actively looking for it these past few days. Regardless, I yanked it out and marvelled at its astonishing shortness; it battled to reach a few inches, the poor thing. I talk as if this softly thick tube has emotions or consciousness. I did submit down to the floor on my hands and knees to curiously look down the hole, though all I could see was black. Such a shame, I think. I really have nothing to do. I left the tube out on the kitchen table, so I may have something new to toy with while I waste away my days in here; I have grown tired of the very look and being of the three pens on the studys desk. It is now late, and I shall try to sleep. **Day 4** Oh, what a miserable night of sleep. No, actually, what a miserable night of no sleep. The darkness was void of refuge for me. My eyes were peeled open and fixed on the ceiling above me longer than they were shut last night, rewarding me with not a moments rest. It started hardly 10 minutes after I packed away my journal and started for sleep, when I began hearing the first noises I had heard from Mrs Ackerys apartment. There were groans and moans, longing forsomething. I dont know what! Sometimes there would be pauses between her pitiful screeches before a great cry of pain and anguish surmounted beyond the walls. I gripped myself tight and shuddered at the thoughts that came upon me as my mind wandered through the countless dreadful possibilities that may have been befalling poor Mrs Ackery while I just sat and listened, stunned by fright. Though it is now morning and my shock has somewhat passed, I remain rattled to my bony core. I can only hope and pray that tonight shall bring me an unknowing peace so I may not have to endure such torment again. **Day 5** Oh, pity me. The peace of sleep escaped me once again last night, and once more, I was forced to endure the horrid sounds that came from that awful woman next door. Curse her and the grief she brings upon me! My sharpened edge chooses to remain with me, even in daylight of morning. Before, the sun brought reprieve, now it does no such thing. I am left with no option but to compose a letter for the group downstairs in the foyer, brimming with many complaints and worries for Mrs Ackery next door. God, I have nothing else to do. I hope this brings welcome change. I cant last nine more days of such grief. **Later** Around noon I used an establish communication system to deliver a letter to the foyer. I wrote to alert them of Mrs Ackerys unceasing audible concerns, as well as my own reflective concern of her wellbeing. Shortly after, I heard footsteps travel the corridor and stop, presumably, outside Mrs Ackerys apartment. I stood at my door and pressed the side of my head to it, listening for anything that could aid in my own personal query. There was a knock, then after a moment, the door to Mrs Ackerys apartment opened. There were but a few murmurs from two different people as footsteps wandered the room before leaving a minute or two later. I stepped back from the door, slightly defeated, I admit. The solemnity of my mood did not acquaint with my body long, though, as it was quickly replaced by curiosity, then a shred of fear. The footsteps began moving from Mrs Ackerys apartment and toward mine. The steps were oh so very heavy and slow, as if they were aiming to maintain my unknowing, though it were too late for that. I cautiously retreated back a few steps and waited in silence, listening for when the leaden footsteps reached my own door. They did. In a moment of perhaps stupidity or crazed panic, I yelled out to them. Did you see Mrs Ackery? There was no response, so I continued again. How was she? Again, nothing. I stepped closer to my own door and knocked. If it werent for the peculiarity of the situation, I perhaps would have laughed at the scene of knocking on a door from the inside. Such thoughts quickly abandoned me, though, as the slightest tapping sensation began on my toe, like if a wood pecker chipped away at a wooden stump with a beak of cloud. I looked down to see what could be causing such an odd sensation, only to see another tube, most similar to the one that already sat on my kitchen table, poking through the same hole by the apartment door. In a moment of weakness, I uttered an expletive as I jumped back slightly, causing the tube to retract back through the hole. My intrigue was sparked and I wondered where the tube had gone. God, how much my curiosity curses me. Like I had done before, I returned to my hands and knees to inspect the hole by the door. Good grief, what a fright I received. I slid forward my face and glared deep into the dark tunnel. It was nothing but black, again. I was almost ready to return to my feet when slits and shivers of light began seeping through the opposite end of the hole. All in one motion, a circular cover that blocked the small tunnels other end swung open from a hook and revealed one peering eye, glaring right back at my own. The scare made me jump back, knocking two chairs and a table that sat behind me. I immediately returned to my room and shut the door with force. Now here I lie in bed, writing to calm myself and ease my shaking nerves. **Day 9** Oh, how bored senseless I have become, yet how curious I simultaneously have grown. The first three nights after I sent for the men to enter Mrs Ackerys apartment rewarded me with full nights of unbroken sleep and good rest. Just yesterday, though, I again found a protruding tube, just like the one that sits on my kitchen table and the one that was tapping my foot some days ago, sticking out of the small tunnel by the front door. What is the case with these strange things? I grow more confused and unknowing with each sleepless night, as just last night, after removing the tube once again, I had a new evening of woeful screams that again came from Mrs Ackerys room. I grew deathly frightened at the recurring sounds, which were now joined by tingling slurps and chomps, as if a beast roamed her room. Oh, good and merciful God, why must I endure these uncertain times? I have heard nothing from the couple across the hall sincesome time, at least. I shall write another letter to the people in the foyer, in dire hope that my conscious can be put to ease. What could they possibly explain that would change anything? What explanation is there for the noises I hear coming from Mrs Ackerys room at night? God, may your unforgiving grace of sleeps passing sweep not forget me tonight. **Day 10** What a poignant 24 hours. I slept for not one blink, which I am beginning to grow accustom to, though I heard no noise from Mrs Ackerys room. My relief is spoilt by an undeniable sense of fear and uncertainty, as I find myself perhaps longing for the normality of the grotesque sounds that once occupied my nights. The silence was off-putting. I wrote many more times to the foyer to no avail. This mystery is certainly driving me mad. I fear that if I fail to gain some aspect of control over the situation, I will not live to see the end to all this. **Day 11** It is just a bit past midnight. I am awake in bed again, and just like the night before, no noise was making its way to me from Mrs Ackerys apartment. Oh, God, did I ever dream of finding myself longing for the return of the sounds that used to fill my sleepless nights? Footsteps in the hallway quickly pierced the silence like a shot bullet, and I suppose I must have been already quite on edge, as I sat up instantly at the pacing bumps. Through my ajar bedroom door, I maintained a fixed stare on the apartments front door as I heard the steps grow louder. A part of me wondered if it was the people from the foyer here to check on Mrs Ackery like I had asked, but what an odd time it would have been to do so. I expected, from past experience, that they would come during the day. This thought was quickly dismissed as the steps continued past Mrs Ackerys door and toward my own. My face went flushed with buzzing heat as they stopped at my front door, and in the pitch black, slowly unbuckled the lock on the one plank of a door that protected me from the contents of the hallway. Oh, God, how fearful I was in those few moments, when a hand must have clasped the handle and slowly opened the door. The shrieking creak split my very soul, and pierced deep within my ears. I hopelessly awaited for someone to enter, though no one did. The door just sat there, open, but hardly pushed forward. I was quite honestly perplexed and dumbfounded at the experience of such immense and instinctive fear remaining present so long after the event had transpired. I did not dare move from the bed to investigate as I did not hear the footsteps depart from the door. How could I even begin to think of falling asleep now? I suspect my wake will linger the remaining night, as will my gaze on the open door. I write in the dark now, awaiting daybreak, or death. **Day 12** I must have dozed off as I awoke in the late morning to a beam of light hitting my eyes. For a moment, I maintained an ignorant bliss of my dreadful reality, though upon my coming to, I wasted not a moment in hesitation before moving to inspect the front door. I did not even make it there, however, as a different discovery, a far more haunting one, stopped me on my way. I had pushed my bedroom door completely open, and found one of the kitchen chairs had been turned from the table to face my bedroom through the open door. The sight brought a chill upon my body. Someone had been watching me sleep last night. I had no idea who it was or where they were now. Can one truly grasp such a thought as being at ones will in such a state of vulnerability? I thought it best not to dwell on the situation, and instead, better to give my all to the cause of escaping this hell. I didnt care about the damned quarantine anymore. The front door was as open as I saw it last night, meaning whoever, or whatever, was careful to position it so upon their departure, orno, I should not dwell on such things. I widened the front door of the apartment to allow myself the room to jump out in a crazed blaze. I did so, and found it to be empty. I saw the door to Mrs Ackerys room, but was first captured by another unlocked and open door facing me. It led to the couples apartment. Abandoning all care, I pushed the door open and moved inside, but something felt off. I moved toward the kitchen, which was an exact replica of the one in my apartment, though the place seemed deserted. I even called out Hello? to no response. I then proceeded to the bedroom door, which I found shut. The very embodiment of fear birthed inside me. I shook my head to myself as I stepped to open the door with the light click of the twisted handle. How I mustered the courage, I will not ever know, though I suppose lack of other options sufficed. How much worse for myself I made the process by opening the door with a slow carefulness, allowing the same drawn-out creak to fill the room. I shudder at the thought of that sound, more than I did at the abhorrent noises that used to spawn from Mrs Ackerys room all those nights ago. God, how long ago that feels, and how much I wish to return to the simplicity of such ignorance and naivety. I found the bedroom, like the rest of the apartment, deserted, though the sheets from the bed had been taken, where I do not know. I do not suppose I know what I planned to have done if I did not find the bedroom to be empty. The couples absence was reassuring in some ways as I could avoid such a scenario of conflict, though it did make the apparent disagreement I couldnt help but overhear in those first few days more puzzling. Regardless, I moved on, more captivated by Mrs Ackerys room. I noticed a presumably empty cylinder of gas, sitting beside the small metal hatch that covered the small tunnel into the apartment. In fact, upon checking, I noticed every previously or currently occupied apartment had a similar hatch, except Mrs Ackerys. The lock on the door was far from difficult to undo, as was the door. But my God, oh dear God, the things I saw in that apartment beyond that unlocked door. How I wish I could run away from time and never have done such a cruel deed. Oh how I now understand so many things, and at the same time, so few, or even less. Id sooner lay down my own life than once again experience such things as I experienced in that apartment. Laid, in the centre of the room, was Mrs Ackerys rotting corpse. The stench took no liberty in delaying its extension to me, turning its attention to my poor soul like a feasting beast that had finished ravaging its prey. I would have returned my prior meals to the apartment floor if I had in fact eaten. Oh, rest you poor soul, Mrs Ackery. Her hair was malting and the moist skin surrounding her blackened eyes was peeling from the bone. Rot had set in at the edges of missing chunks in her limbs. How much I saw in just a passing glimpse frightens me to my core, so I dare not imagine what damage a more extended examination would have brought upon my white spirit. God knows how long she has been dead for. I turned without a thought back out the door, closing it behind me as I did. I wanted to keep moving, knowing there was nothing I could do for Mrs Ackery, but clinging to the hope that I at least may get out of this alive. I took a flight of open stairs down to the foyer. Oh, God, do these troubles ever end? The foyer was empty and shut on all four corners, with no escape. A pile of letters had risen from the communication chute I had sent them through days ago when requesting a second wellness check on Mrs Ackery. There was no one to be seen, not even a single corpse which I had, so unwillingly, grown accustomed to. Questions began replacing places of fear in my mind: what happened to the couple across the hall? Where did everyone go? Why was Mrs Ackery making all of those noises? Or if she has truly been dead for so long, then who *was* making those sounds that I so often heard those nights when sleep escaped me? None of such questions do I have answers for. Im sitting in the foyer as I write this entry. Awaiting rescue, or more likely death. **Later** Some time alone has granted me some clarity, though not in the form I was hoping. Still, one I will accept. I have not sighted the presence of anyone else in the building, though thuds of footsteps and the occasional voice irregularly travel from the roof above me. I do not know what will come of me in two nights. If I go searching for the creator of these noises I hear, I wonder what I will find. I battle over what to do. I question whether this quarantine was to protect us from this virus, or to contain it. What fate awaits me, oh, God? What purpose will this serve? I have so many questions, and I know the enlightenment of answers will likely only come to a man who is moments away from greeting their demise. Oh, how I long for such knowledge... **CONCLUSIVE NOTE: STAMPED AS EVIDENCE FOUND ON SCENE** **- FOUND IN COAT OF ONE VICTIM: MALE, 30s, BROWN HAIR, BROWN EYES** **-VICTIM FOUND IN PILE WITH MULTIPLE JANE AND JOHN DOE** **-INCLUDING: NUMEROUS VOLUNTEER WORKERS, ONE ELDERLY WOMAN, ONE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, ONE MAN UNACCOUNTED FOR.** **-CASE:** &gt;!CLASSIFIED AND ONGOING!&lt;"
28,vulnerability,nosleep,The Noises Next Door Keep Me Awake During My Forced Quarantine,4,frefzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/frefzh/the_noises_next_door_keep_me_awake_during_my/,2020-03-30 09:12:29,"**Day 1** I suppose a journal is a better way than any to pass the two weeks Im going to have to spend here alone. Of course, Im not completely alone; everyone else was moved to the same building and locked in their own apartment, including a couple across the hallway and a lovely older woman, Mrs Ackery, next door. Oh, how I feel for poor Mrs Ackery, being old and so vulnerable during these turbulent times. I really cant take for granted how lucky I am to have my life spared from the increased threat of death this virus poses to the cherished elderly. Two men in protective suits came this morning to ensure I was comfortable and reminded me that a precautionary team will be ready and waiting downstairs in the foyer in case of any emergencies. I obviously said nothing to create a scene, though I will admit I scoffed to myself at the measures exercised, and all because of one returned resident who caught this virus overseas. However, someone as kind as Mrs Ackery is reason enough, for me, to accept my precautionary quarantine in a new temporary home. **Day 2** I certainly did not anticipate how tired I would be after a day of doing nothing! I must remember to be more aware of myself, as I collapsed onto the mattress with such force that I swear I must have snapped the darned thing! I jest, of course, though I do know I slept undisturbed for many hours, like a large boulder sunken beneath the crashing, yet calming, waves. It was unfortunate that when I did awake, I could overhear yelling that spawned from the couples apartment across the hall. As a self-proclaimed gentleman, I exerted my greatest efforts to simply mind my own business, though a sublime combination of the couples exuberant voices, and not having anything better to do, myself, I simply could not help but hear a large portion of the presumed ordeal. I could not make out many words, though a loud and sudden thud brought finality to the couples topic. I am not ignorant to certain trials men and women in relationships may face, particularly when there is no escape from one another, though the passing of a mere 24 hours before the first fight is a noticeable effort, one cannot deny. I have heard no noise from Mrs Ackerys apartment, though, to be fair, I do not suppose I have made much noise myself. Perhaps if I was joined by a member of the opposite sex, I too, could contribute such vibrant sounds to the building. **Day 3** Slept, as some say, like a baby, again, last night. All was still and silent when I awoke, granting me a peaceful morning of absorbing the sunshine with a hot tea. My mood was slightly soured by my stumble over a small, dense tube that had protruded through an accurately measured hole by the locked entrance. I have not noticed neither the tube nor the hole before, though I confess I have not been actively looking for it these past few days. Regardless, I yanked it out and marvelled at its astonishing shortness; it battled to reach a few inches, the poor thing. I talk as if this softly thick tube has emotions or consciousness. I did submit down to the floor on my hands and knees to curiously look down the hole, though all I could see was black. Such a shame, I think. I really have nothing to do. I left the tube out on the kitchen table, so I may have something new to toy with while I waste away my days in here; I have grown tired of the very look and being of the three pens on the studys desk. It is now late, and I shall try to sleep. **Day 4** Oh, what a miserable night of sleep. No, actually, what a miserable night of no sleep. The darkness was void of refuge for me. My eyes were peeled open and fixed on the ceiling above me longer than they were shut last night, rewarding me with not a moments rest. It started hardly 10 minutes after I packed away my journal and started for sleep, when I began hearing the first noises I had heard from Mrs Ackerys apartment. There were groans and moans, longing forsomething. I dont know what! Sometimes there would be pauses between her pitiful screeches before a great cry of pain and anguish surmounted beyond the walls. I gripped myself tight and shuddered at the thoughts that came upon me as my mind wandered through the countless dreadful possibilities that may have been befalling poor Mrs Ackery while I just sat and listened, stunned by fright. Though it is now morning and my shock has somewhat passed, I remain rattled to my bony core. I can only hope and pray that tonight shall bring me an unknowing peace so I may not have to endure such torment again. **Day 5** Oh, pity me. The peace of sleep escaped me once again last night, and once more, I was forced to endure the horrid sounds that came from that awful woman next door. Curse her and the grief she brings upon me! My sharpened edge chooses to remain with me, even in daylight of morning. Before, the sun brought reprieve, now it does no such thing. I am left with no option but to compose a letter for the group downstairs in the foyer, brimming with many complaints and worries for Mrs Ackery next door. God, I have nothing else to do. I hope this brings welcome change. I cant last nine more days of such grief. **Later** Around noon I used an establish communication system to deliver a letter to the foyer. I wrote to alert them of Mrs Ackerys unceasing audible concerns, as well as my own reflective concern of her wellbeing. Shortly after, I heard footsteps travel the corridor and stop, presumably, outside Mrs Ackerys apartment. I stood at my door and pressed the side of my head to it, listening for anything that could aid in my own personal query. There was a knock, then after a moment, the door to Mrs Ackerys apartment opened. There were but a few murmurs from two different people as footsteps wandered the room before leaving a minute or two later. I stepped back from the door, slightly defeated, I admit. The solemnity of my mood did not acquaint with my body long, though, as it was quickly replaced by curiosity, then a shred of fear. The footsteps began moving from Mrs Ackerys apartment and toward mine. The steps were oh so very heavy and slow, as if they were aiming to maintain my unknowing, though it were too late for that. I cautiously retreated back a few steps and waited in silence, listening for when the leaden footsteps reached my own door. They did. In a moment of perhaps stupidity or crazed panic, I yelled out to them. Did you see Mrs Ackery? There was no response, so I continued again. How was she? Again, nothing. I stepped closer to my own door and knocked. If it werent for the peculiarity of the situation, I perhaps would have laughed at the scene of knocking on a door from the inside. Such thoughts quickly abandoned me, though, as the slightest tapping sensation began on my toe, like if a wood pecker chipped away at a wooden stump with a beak of cloud. I looked down to see what could be causing such an odd sensation, only to see another tube, most similar to the one that already sat on my kitchen table, poking through the same hole by the apartment door. In a moment of weakness, I uttered an expletive as I jumped back slightly, causing the tube to retract back through the hole. My intrigue was sparked and I wondered where the tube had gone. God, how much my curiosity curses me. Like I had done before, I returned to my hands and knees to inspect the hole by the door. Good grief, what a fright I received. I slid forward my face and glared deep into the dark tunnel. It was nothing but black, again. I was almost ready to return to my feet when slits and shivers of light began seeping through the opposite end of the hole. All in one motion, a circular cover that blocked the small tunnels other end swung open from a hook and revealed one peering eye, glaring right back at my own. The scare made me jump back, knocking two chairs and a table that sat behind me. I immediately returned to my room and shut the door with force. Now here I lie in bed, writing to calm myself and ease my shaking nerves. **Day 9** Oh, how bored senseless I have become, yet how curious I simultaneously have grown. The first three nights after I sent for the men to enter Mrs Ackerys apartment rewarded me with full nights of unbroken sleep and good rest. Just yesterday, though, I again found a protruding tube, just like the one that sits on my kitchen table and the one that was tapping my foot some days ago, sticking out of the small tunnel by the front door. What is the case with these strange things? I grow more confused and unknowing with each sleepless night, as just last night, after removing the tube once again, I had a new evening of woeful screams that again came from Mrs Ackerys room. I grew deathly frightened at the recurring sounds, which were now joined by tingling slurps and chomps, as if a beast roamed her room. Oh, good and merciful God, why must I endure these uncertain times? I have heard nothing from the couple across the hall sincesome time, at least. I shall write another letter to the people in the foyer, in dire hope that my conscious can be put to ease. What could they possibly explain that would change anything? What explanation is there for the noises I hear coming from Mrs Ackerys room at night? God, may your unforgiving grace of sleeps passing sweep not forget me tonight. **Day 10** What a poignant 24 hours. I slept for not one blink, which I am beginning to grow accustom to, though I heard no noise from Mrs Ackerys room. My relief is spoilt by an undeniable sense of fear and uncertainty, as I find myself perhaps longing for the normality of the grotesque sounds that once occupied my nights. The silence was off-putting. I wrote many more times to the foyer to no avail. This mystery is certainly driving me mad. I fear that if I fail to gain some aspect of control over the situation, I will not live to see the end to all this. **Day 11** It is just a bit past midnight. I am awake in bed again, and just like the night before, no noise was making its way to me from Mrs Ackerys apartment. Oh, God, did I ever dream of finding myself longing for the return of the sounds that used to fill my sleepless nights? Footsteps in the hallway quickly pierced the silence like a shot bullet, and I suppose I must have been already quite on edge, as I sat up instantly at the pacing bumps. Through my ajar bedroom door, I maintained a fixed stare on the apartments front door as I heard the steps grow louder. A part of me wondered if it was the people from the foyer here to check on Mrs Ackery like I had asked, but what an odd time it would have been to do so. I expected, from past experience, that they would come during the day. This thought was quickly dismissed as the steps continued past Mrs Ackerys door and toward my own. My face flushed with buzzing heat as they stopped at my front door, and in the pitch black, slowly unbuckled the lock on the one plank of a door that protected me from the contents of the hallway. Oh, God, how fearful I was in those few moments, when a hand must have clasped the handle and slowly opened the door. The shrieking creak split my very soul, and pierced deep within my ears. I hopelessly awaited for someone to enter, though no one did. The door just sat there, open, but hardly pushed forward. I was quite honestly perplexed and dumbfounded at the experience of such immense and instinctive fear remaining present so long after the event had transpired. I did not dare move from the bed to investigate as I did not hear the footsteps depart from the door. How could I even begin to think of falling asleep now? I suspect my wake will linger the remaining night, as will my gaze on the open door. I write in the dark now, awaiting daybreak, or death. **Day 12** I must have dozed off as I awoke in the late morning to a beam of light hitting my eyes. For a moment, I maintained an ignorant bliss of my dreadful reality, though upon my coming to, I wasted not a moment in hesitation before moving to inspect the front door. I did not even make it there, however, as a different discovery, a far more haunting one, stopped me on my way. I had pushed my bedroom door completely open, and found one of the kitchen chairs had been turned from the table to face my bedroom through the open door. The sight brought a chill upon my body. Someone had been watching me sleep last night. I had no idea who it was or where they were now. Can one truly grasp such a thought as being at ones will in such a state of vulnerability? I thought it best not to dwell on the situation, and instead, better to give my all to the cause of escaping this hell. I didnt care about the damned quarantine anymore. The front door was as open as I saw it last night, meaning whoever, or whatever, was careful to position it so upon their departure, orno, I should not dwell on such things. I widened the front door of the apartment to allow myself the room to jump out in a crazed blaze. I did so, and found it to be empty. I saw the door to Mrs Ackerys room, but was first captured by another unlocked and open door facing me. It led to the couples apartment. Abandoning all care, I pushed the door open and moved inside, but something felt off. I moved toward the kitchen, which was an exact replica of the one in my apartment, though the place seemed deserted. I even called out Hello? to no response. I then proceeded to the bedroom door, which I found shut. The very embodiment of fear birthed inside me. I shook my head to myself as I stepped to open the door with the light click of the twisted handle. How I mustered the courage, I will not ever know, though I suppose lack of other options sufficed. How much worse for myself I made the process by opening the door with a slow carefulness, allowing the same drawn-out creak to fill the room. I shudder at the thought of that sound, more than I did at the abhorrent noises that used to spawn from Mrs Ackerys room all those nights ago. God, how long ago that feels, and how much I wish to return to the simplicity of such ignorance and naivety. I found the bedroom, like the rest of the apartment, deserted, though the sheets from the bed had been taken, where I do not know. I do not suppose I know what I planned to have done if I did not find the bedroom to be empty. The couples absence was reassuring in some ways as I could avoid such a scenario of conflict, though it did make the apparent disagreement I couldnt help but overhear in those first few days more puzzling. Regardless, I moved on, more captivated by Mrs Ackerys room. I noticed a presumably empty cylinder of gas, sitting beside the small metal hatch that covered the small tunnel into the apartment. In fact, upon checking, I noticed every previously or currently occupied apartment had a similar hatch, except Mrs Ackerys. The lock on the door was far from difficult to undo, as was the door. But my God, oh dear God, the things I saw in that apartment beyond that unlocked door. How I wish I could run away from time and never have done such a cruel deed. Oh how I now understand so many things, and at the same time, so few, or even less. Id sooner lay down my own life than once again experience such things as I experienced in that apartment. Laid, in the centre of the room, was Mrs Ackerys rotting corpse. The stench took no liberty in delaying its extension to me, turning its attention to my poor soul like a feasting beast that had finished ravaging its prey. I would have returned my prior meals to the apartment floor if I had in fact eaten. Oh, rest you poor soul, Mrs Ackery. Her hair was malting and the moist skin surrounding her blackened eyes was peeling from the bone. Rot had set in at the edges of missing chunks in her limbs. How much I saw in just a passing glimpse frightens me to my core, so I dare not imagine what damage a more extended examination would have brought upon my white spirit.

I thought it best not to dwell on the situation, and instead, better to give my all to the cause of escaping this hell. I didnt care about the damned quarantine anymore. The front door was as open as I saw it last night, meaning whoever, or whatever, was careful to position it so upon their departure, orno, I should not dwell on such things. I widened the front door of the apartment to allow myself the room to jump out in a crazed blaze. I did so, and found it to be empty. I saw the door to Mrs Ackerys room, but was first captured by another unlocked and open door facing me. It led to the couples apartment. Abandoning all care, I pushed the door open and moved inside, but something felt off. I moved toward the kitchen, which was an exact replica of the one in my apartment, though the place seemed deserted. I even called out Hello? to no response. I then proceeded to the bedroom door, which I found shut. The very embodiment of fear birthed inside me. I shook my head to myself as I stepped to open the door with the light click of the twisted handle. How I mustered the courage, I will not ever know, though I suppose lack of other options sufficed. How much worse for myself I made the process by opening the door with a slow carefulness, allowing the same drawn-out creak to fill the room. I shudder at the thought of that sound, more than I did at the abhorrent noises that used to spawn from Mrs Ackerys room all those nights ago. God, how long ago that feels, and how much I wish to return to the simplicity of such ignorance and naivety. I found the bedroom, like the rest of the apartment, deserted, though the sheets from the bed had been taken, where I do not know. I do not suppose I know what I planned to have done if I did not find the bedroom to be empty. The couples absence was reassuring in some ways as I could avoid such a scenario of conflict, though it did make the apparent disagreement I couldnt help but overhear in those first few days more puzzling. Regardless, I moved on, more captivated by Mrs Ackerys room. I noticed a presumably empty cylinder of gas, sitting beside the small metal hatch that covered the small tunnel into the apartment. In fact, upon checking, I noticed every previously or currently occupied apartment had a similar hatch, except Mrs Ackerys. The lock on the door was far from difficult to undo, as was the door. But my God, oh dear God, the things I saw in that apartment beyond that unlocked door. How I wish I could run away from time and never have done such a cruel deed. Oh how I now understand so many things, and at the same time, so few, or even less. Id sooner lay down my own life than once again experience such things as I experienced in that apartment. Laid, in the centre of the room, was Mrs Ackerys rotting corpse. The stench took no liberty in delaying its extension to me, turning its attention to my poor soul like a feasting beast that had finished ravaging its prey. I would have returned my prior meals to the apartment floor if I had in fact eaten. Oh, rest you poor soul, Mrs Ackery. Her hair was malting and the moist skin surrounding her blackened eyes was peeling from the bone. Rot had set in at the edges of missing chunks in her limbs. How much I saw in just a passing glimpse frightens me to my core, so I dare not imagine what damage a more extended examination would have brought upon my white spirit. God knows how long she has been dead for. I turned without a thought back out the door, closing it behind me as I did. I wanted to keep moving, knowing there was nothing I could do for Mrs Ackery, but clinging to the hope that I at least may get out of this alive. I took a flight of open stairs down to the foyer. Oh, God, do these troubles ever end? The foyer was empty and shut on all four corners, with no escape. A pile of letters had risen from the communication chute I had sent them through days ago when requesting a second wellness check on Mrs Ackery. There was no one to be seen, not even a single corpse which I had, so unwillingly, grown accustomed to. Questions began replacing places of fear in my mind: what happened to the couple across the hall? Where did everyone go? Why was Mrs Ackery making all of those noises? Or if she has truly been dead for so long, then who *was* making those sounds that I so often heard those nights when sleep escaped me? None of such questions do I have answers for. Im sitting in the foyer as I write this entry. Awaiting rescue, or more likely death. **Later** Some time alone has granted me some clarity, though not in the form I was hoping. Still, one I will accept. I have not sighted the presence of anyone else in the building, though thuds of footsteps and the occasional voice irregularly travel from the roof above me. I do not know what will come of me in two nights. If I go searching for the creator of these noises I hear, I wonder what I will find. I battle over what to do. I question whether this quarantine was to protect us from this virus, or to contain it. What fate awaits me, oh, God? What purpose will this serve? I have so many questions, and I know the enlightenment of answers will likely only come to a man who is moments away from greeting their demise. Oh, how I long for such knowledge... **CONCLUSIVE NOTE: STAMPED AS EVIDENCE FOUND ON SCENE** **- FOUND IN COAT OF ONE VICTIM: MALE, 30s, BROWN HAIR, BROWN EYES** **-VICTIM FOUND IN PILE WITH MULTIPLE JANE AND JOHN DOE** **-INCLUDING: NUMEROUS VOLUNTEER WORKERS, ONE ELDERLY WOMAN, ONE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, ONE MAN UNACCOUNTED FOR.** **-CASE:** &gt;!CLASSIFIED AND ONGOING!&lt;"
30,vulnerability,nosleep,Every year for the last 3 centuries our town has been sacrificing its women to protect the world.,1,f3bimt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f3bimt/every_year_for_the_last_3_centuries_our_town_has/,2020-02-14 02:22:58,"""The twins look especially beautiful tonight, don't they?"" My little sister asked, craning her neck to gaze at the odd stick figures twinkling in the night sky above. I shuffled my feet nervously. ""Aditi, I"" ""You know the immortal Pollux begged his father to let him share his immortality with his brother."" She added, almost *accusingly*, as she stood completely still, transfixed as she seemed to be by the hypnotic shimmering of the Gemini constellation. ""He was willing to die for Castor."" ""You know I would do the same for you."" I said defensively. ""In a heartbeat."" Her hands balled up into fists beside her. ""But you can't, can you?"" I could feel the venom in her voice, the sheer unfairness of the situation ripping her usual composure to shreds. Her eyes finally broke away from the stars and came searching for mine, only to find them running away from a confrontation. ""The odds of you being picked are low."" I mumbled half-heartedly. ""No they aren't. It is our block's turn this time. There only like 20 of us in it."" ""I'm sure you won't get picked."" I asserted with a confidence I didn't really feel, not even on a surface level. She caught the lie quiet easily, and the pitying look that she then gave me broke my heart. ""I... I want to run away."" She stated after a short pause. ""Come with me."" I reluctantly shook my head. ""It won't work. They'll find us before we even get to the highway. You know what'll happen then. They'll kill us all; mom, dad everyone."" ""And why would that be such a bad thing?"" She spat. ""They had me even after knowing what was in store for me."" ""You don't mean that"" I protested. ""Yes. I do!"" She retorted, before taking a deep breath. ""Raghav."" She whispered, her lips quivering. ""I'm scared."" Her eyes watered, the facade of toughness she had so carefully built up finally cracked, letting the vulnerability pour out. I pulled her in for a hug and held on tightly, afraid that it might be the last chance I had to do so. She buried her head in my chest and sobbed silently. I wanted to say something, to comfort her, but the words just disintegrated in my brain, and the letters quickly slipped out of my grasp, leaving me a sad and confused mess. As if to announce Its own displeasure, the earth rumbled underneath our feet, tectonic plates shifting and smashing against each other so violently little pebbles vibrated and flew up off the ground. Leaves of the Banyan tree we were under rustled frantically as its innumerable roots that reached down to the floor creaked and swayed with the quaking. Something primordial yawned and stretched its muscles beneath the bedrock, causing the two of us to tense up in fear. Half a minute later, the shaking tapered off, and Aditi relaxed, if only a little. ""You're right."" She murmured. ""Who can ever escape that, right?"" I opened my mouth to reply, but a loud and persistent boom cut me off. The town's mayor had rung the alarm, signalling that the annual *festival* was finally upon us. ""Festival"", such a jovial name for something so morbid. ""Let's go big brother."" My sister said derisively. ""Time to go save the world."" *** Our little town sits in the middle of a valley, near the southern reaches of the lesser Himalayas. The towering snow capped peaks that loom around us also serve as a jagged boundary with China. Normally this would make it a very strategic position, but the sheer inaccessibility of this place on both sides means that we have next to no military presence in the area, making it ideal for the sort of fucked up rituals that are performed here on an annual basis. It is hard to say when exactly the sacrifices began, but the consensus in our town is that it was sometime in the early 18th century. Legend says that an adventuring and greedy Mughal officer started digging around for minerals and precious stones, but only ended up waking something ancient from its deep slumber. The *festival* began shortly afterwards, to placate the potentially apocalyptic entity. The burbling of the creek ahead gently pulled me out of my reverie, reminding me that we had reached the rickety wooden bridge that ran across the little river which came melting down the slopes of the glaciers over to the north, and cut our town into two halves before turning and joining the Ganges to our south. As we crossed the bridge and entered the town, I noticed people shuffling out of their homes, unwillingly making their way towards the townhall. Their whispers wafted down the cold air and reached our ears, picking up speed as they caught sight of us. ""Poor thing."" ""So young too... Only 14."" ""Wonder if she'll get picked tonight."" Aditi pulled her woolen hat down to her neck, stuffed her hands in her jacket and continued to walk silently, ignoring the sympathetic looks being shot her way. She didn't need the pity as it only made her resent our powerlessness. The smattering of people gradually turned into a thick crowd as we neared the townhall. Seemed like most of our over 3000 populace were coming to the festival. Our townhall was an old and imposing structure with a sloping wooden roof that the falling snow slid off of and melted into the drains beneath. It used to be the house of the resident British military commander, back when they still entertained foolish notions of invading China through the mountain passes here, but was turned into the office of the local municipal government later on, and now it hid our town's darkest secrets. The front door of the building was being guarded by some men clad in bulletproof vests, wearing balaclavas and carrying TAVOR rifles. People silently walked past them and took their seats in the numerous rows of wooden benches beyond. On our side of the door was a table covered with white cloth, and a man sitting on a chair next to it, with an open notebook in front of him. ""Aditi."" Came a muffled voice from somewhere behind us. I turned around and saw our mother push past the lumbering crowd and hurry over towards us. She pulled my sister into her arms the moment she came close enough to do so. ""You okay?"" She asked after she pulled away, getting an imperceptible nod in return. Mom frowned, sharp lines springing up on her forehead like Lord Shiva's trident. ""Have you registered yet?"" A flash of annoyance crossed Aditi's face. ""I was just going to."" She replied tiredly. Mom held her hand and led her over to the table. She was quiet experienced with all this, having gambled with her life for decades. I still remember how she sobbed with relief when the doctor told her she had hit menopause, effectively taking her out of the running. ""Next!"" The man at the table shouted. ""Oh, it's you, Aditi! Glad to see you. Please sign here."" He grinned obnoxiously at me while my sister bent over the table. ""Raghav. Good to see you!"" I refused to respond. ""So,"" he continued when Aditi got back up, ""What number will you be choosing tonight?"" She shrugged. ""Oh, come on!"" He whined. ""You have to! It's a tradition!"" He pointed at the paper in front of him. ""These are the numbers still available, go on, pick one!"" ""How does it matter what fucking number gets me closer to my death, you asshole!"" She snapped. Mom squeezed her shoulders, and she sighed. ""Fuck just 91. I choose 91, okay? You happy?"" ""Atta girl!"" He said with a painfully artificial smile. We turned and walked into the townhall, trying hard to ignore the sad and inquisitive expressions on people's faces. A couple of rows ahead, I saw my dad standing and waving at us. I could feel a sinking feeling in my chest, as the walls seemed to close in around me and the echoing whispering slammed into my eardrums. I hated this part, the wait before the *picking*, the anxiety and fear writhing around in my belly. Damn this tradition, damn this town, damn this world. We took our seats next to dad and began waiting in silence for the macabre spectacle to begin. I grabbed my sister's hand and squeezed reassuringly. After what felt like an eternity, the mayor entered the room, flanked by armed guards like the ones we saw outside and went up to the podium on the stage. All around the room were other armed men, looming around us menacingly. I glanced back at the mayor. Sleek grey hair, sleek Nehru jacket and a disarming smile, he looked like the typical politician. He tapped the microphone in front of him and the next second his voice boomed through the loudspeakers and echoed around in the tiled room. ""Good evening everyone. It is time once again for our town to come together and work for a cause greater than ourselves. It's time for us to put aside our differences and offer a tribute for the sake of our precious earth. You know, it is written in the *Gita* that"" I tuned out, not wanting to listen to the useless spiel he repeats every year, and instead chose to focus on others around me. Everywhere my eyes went, I could see women of varying ages sitting with their families with fear in their eyes, wondering whether it would be their turn this year. Teenagers, working professionals, mothers, all reduced to mere sacrifices. After a while, it is only natural for one to wonder, is this world even worth saving? ""And now for the *picking*."" The mayor declared, before going to a table behind him on top of which sat a large rectangular glass container the size of a small aquarium, filled with dozens of numbered chips like the ones they use in poker. Besides the container was a cage with a crow inside it. The mayor opened the cage, and the crow instantly flew out and perched itself atop the container. This is it. We watched with bated breath as without any instructions, the crow dove in and grabbed a solitary chip in its beak, and flew over to the mayor's outstretched arm, who plucked the chip out and gently pushed the crow back inside. ""Well, well, well."" He laughed. ""Seems like we have a winner."" Please don't be 91. Please don't be 91. Please don't be 91. ""It is 91!"" The mayor thundered, and my heart instantly imploded. He checked the paper in front of him and read out my sister's name. ""Aditi Jaswal!"" Over 3000 heads turned in our direction, some exhausted, some relieved and some full of outrage at the injustice of it all. But not a single soul offered to help. I instinctively grabbed my sister's arm in a vice like grip. No. No. No. ""Mom!"" She cried, looking at her mother who buried her head in her hands and wept inconsolably. Dad averted his eyes, the coward. ""Now, now, Aditi."" The mayor admonished from the stage. ""You know why we need to do this. You *know* what is at stake here. We all do, don't we?"" I saw the masked men approach us, ready to take my sister away. ""Raghav.. Help me."" My sister spoke in a raspy voice. My heart thudded in my chest. *What do I do? What do I do?* I should have listened to her, should have just stolen dad's car and made a break for it. At least there was a chance we might have made it. Now I was certain to lose my sister. No. No. No. I saw a hand reach for Aditi. I instantly swatted it aside and wrapped my arms around her protectively. ""You can't!"" I screamed savagely. ""You can't take her! Please!"" ""Don't do this Raghav!"" The mayor said. ""We all know this has to happen!"" ""Fuck what has to happen."" I shouted. ""And fuck you. You can't take her. I won't let you!"" ""We don't have time for this."" The gunman to my left said as he tried to pull me aside. Something snapped inside me. It was like my mind had been possessed by white hot, irrational rage. I punched the guy in the side of his head. Then, almost as if the beast buried in the ground sensed what was happening, the earth shook with such intensity that dust and plaster rained down from the ceiling, making everyone in the hall scream in fear and begin scrambling for the exit in panic. Tubelights broke free from their fixtures and hung precariously overhead as the earthquake showed no sign of letting up. A staccato of gunfire interrupted the chaos, making everyone fall to their knees. ""Stop, everyone! We don't want to anger the old one."" The mayor yelled at his mic, the speakers somehow still working just fine. Someone slammed into my side, sending me crashing down to the ground. I fought to free myself, but was quickly overpowered by the stronger gunman. He landed rapid blows on my sides, knocking the wind out of me, before pulling a pistol out and aiming it at my head. ""I should just kill you, right here and right now."" He snarled, the balaclava stretching around his mouth, exposing his. Fangs. God, I must be hallucinating. My little rebellion had proved to be fruitless as my sister was dragged kicking and screaming out of the hall, and the rumbling of the earth miraculously stopped almost as soon as she left. Aditi's tear stained face was the last I *ever* saw of her, and it would be more than half a decade before I found out what exactly had happened to her. ""Don't kill him!"" My dad exclaimed as he jumped and stood beside me, his hands raised in the air. ""Please. Spare him. Don't kill both our children on the same night."" ""He has to pay a price!"" The one aiming the gun at me shouted back. ""There have to be consequences for insubordination."" ""Take me instead! I'll offer my life in exchange for his.."" I groaned. ""No, Dad. Don't.."" The man looked at the mayor, who nodded. A couple of moments later, my father was taken to the stage and executed in front of the whole town. The booming gunshot faded with time, but my mother's heart wrenching screams never did, leaving a permanent scar on my soul. [M](URL"
31,vulnerability,nosleep,I Left Earth to be There for Faye and Rosy Posy,1,f5guux,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/f5guux/i_left_earth_to_be_there_for_faye_and_rosy_posy/,2020-02-18 09:20:20,"I made a wish to be there for Faye and Rosy Posy, and those six weeks away from Earth felt like a dream. A surreal dream with crazy discoveries and disturbing revelations. An emotional dream where the lines of friendship blurred. A harsh dream filled with fear, vulnerability, and acceptance. Now that I was back on Earth, that dream crawled into my mind every night, blending with older memories as it made me relive the most difficult yet fascinating period of my life. Writing it out, I smiled, I cried, and I cringed, but I never regretted making that wish. \---- An annoying hum buzzed in my head and I opened my eyes. I jolted upright, my heart racing as I found myself on the floor of a small stone room with a metal bed, desk, chair, and closet. There were no windows, but the ceiling was glowing an electric blue, tinting everything in the room. The smell of sweat, smoke, and blood overpowered that of dust and I looked down at my grimy skin, clean jeans, and the shirt Faye made me, my fear shifting to nervous excitement as my memories poured back in. I wasnt on Earth anymore! I jumped up and ran out of the room to look for Faye, Rosy Posy, and Ria and her twins. The hallway was square, and to the left was another bedroom that looked just like mine. I peeked in and smiled when I saw Rosy Posy sleeping on the floor and hugging her stuffed elephant doll. I wanted to carry her to the bed, but I realized Tyson probably left us on the floor on purpose because we were both covered in dirt, soot, and blood. Rosy Posy was a laid-back kid who never seemed to mind where she slept, so I didnt feel bad leaving her to search the rest of the house. The room across from hers was a bathroom. The ceiling, walls, and floor were similar to those in the bedrooms, and the metal sink, shower, and toilet looked just the ones on Earth. The toilet even had a bidet like the one the boss had. Finding the bathroom empty, I walked to the room across from mine. It also looked like the bedrooms, but instead of furniture, it had a stone counter with two metal cabinets underneath it. There was no one in here either, and my excitement shifted to worry. The last time I saw Faye, she was a traumatized and newly triggered Sniper, so she had to be in either training or therapy right now. As for Ria, she probably demanded a separate house for herself and her boys. They could even be our neighbors! My excitement returning, I looked for a door to the outside, but all the stone walls were solid. They must have a different way of entering and leaving houses here, I just had to find it. Intrigued, I walked back to the room with the counter and opened the left cabinet. Inside, I found a stack of metallic boxes the size of bricks. I picked one up and shook it. It was lighter than I expected, but it didnt rattle or slosh. I tried to open it, but all the sides and corners were solid, so I shrugged and put it back. The second cabinet was empty, but the dark blue walls inside shimmered like a stormy night sky. I stared, mesmerized, and reached in. My fingers tingled when I made contact, and I smiled as my hands left fleeting sparks of lightning across the smooth surface. Unsure of their purpose but confirming they werent doors, I closed the cabinets and began pressing against the walls, floor, and countertop, hoping to find a secret portal. Nothing gave way. Not discouraged, I made my way to the bathroom, but no doorway was revealed there either. I checked the two bedrooms next as thoroughly as I could without waking Rosy Posy. I didnt find any doors, but I did find coveralls, socks, underwear, and boots in the closets, a single grey set for me and one for Rosy Posy. There wasnt a matching set for Faye, though, which confused me as I assumed shed be sharing a bedroom with her daughter. Maybe Fayes training and therapy were going to take a while so she wasnt going to be living with us yet. I hoped Tyson was right and that shed be back to her bright, cheerful, sweet, curious self soon. She deserved a good life after everything shed been through, and I hoped shed find it here now that shed discovered her abilities and was where she belonged. It was crazy to think that shed been half-human all along, and that she could now control metal and that Rosy Posy could incinerate people. My mind still hadnt properly processed everything that happened last night. I wasnt on Earth anymore! Just the thought made my stomach flip with excitement. I didnt know where I was exactly, but I was ready to be there for Faye and Rosy Posy and make sure they didnt feel alone in a strange place. This house didnt compare to the bosss mansion, but it was a lot nicer than my old apartment. I could get used to living here. I just wished someone would come by soon to let me know where to find the exit, where to find the switch to turn off the glowing blue ceiling, and how to stop that annoying buzzing sound. I looked up, squinting. The ceiling was the only part of the house I hadnt checked for a door yet. I ran to the room with the cabinets, stood on the counter, and raised my arms above my head, but they didnt touch anything despite them having passed the edge of the wall. Confused, I gripped the edge and pulled myself up, only to freeze in shock as I tried to understand what I was looking at. There was no ceiling. The entire sky was glowing electric blue, uniform and blank without a sun or cloud in sight. Strange blue sponges littered the grey dirt around the isolated house, and in the distance, a metal gate surrounded the deserted stretch of land. I struggled to take in this eerie reality. It felt like I was behind the scenes at an apocalyptic movie where they still hadnt added in the after-effects. A faint scent lingered in the air, inexplicably reminding me of printer ink, but there was no wind or movement and my ears failed to pick up a sound other than that incessant buzzing. A shiver ran down my spine. It felt I was the only one alive inside a broken simulation. I jumped off the counter and ran to Rosy Posys room, anxious. Her skin was tinted blue and I hoped it was just because of the glowing sky. I placed a hand under her nose, then sighed with relief at her soft breath. She was alive, and I was sure someone was going to drop by to tell us where we were and help us adjust to our new life. My stomach grumbled and I frowned. I hoped theyd come soon, because there was no food in the house and I didnt know how I was going to care for Rosy Posy if I couldnt feed her. I turned to the bathroom and narrowed my eyes, wondering if water here was also food. Hopeful, I tested the sink, and I smiled as silky blue water flowed over my fingers. A black rock sat near the tap and I rubbed it between my hands. It didnt lather, but it smelled fresh and left my skin squeaky clean. Afterwards, I took a tentative sip. It tasted a little bit like pears, but it slid down my throat like warm milk. It was weird yet satisfying, and I ended up gulping six handfuls before Rosy Posys scream startled me. I coughed, sputtering out water as I dashed to her room, and I found her cowering in the furthest corner from the stuffed elephant shed flung across the room. Mamaaa! she wailed, staring in fear at her once beloved doll. Rosy Posy! Its okay! Im here! I said from the doorway. She turned to me but didnt move from her petrified position. Kaiii! Yes, Im here! I said, wishing I could hug her but knowing itd mean death if she didnt calm down. Whats wrong? Did you have a bad dream? She glanced at her doll again before she sobbed, I want Dumpty Dumpty! Okay, no problem! Ill get him for you! I walked over to the old doll and picked him up. He was usually a cheerful green color, but the blue light had turned him a dull grey. He also reeked of smoke, blood, and pee and the seam along his back was ripped with shredded fabric spewing out. I turned to hand him to her and she screamed and recoiled, making me flinch. Its okay! I said, backing away. Look, this is Dumpty Dumpty! No, hes not! she bawled, the lost look in her eyes breaking my heart. It had to be the color that was throwing her off, and I tried to figure out a way to convince her that this doll wasnt an imposter. I looked at her closet and got an idea. Back on Earth, wed sometimes wear similar clothes to match up, and I hoped shed find that excuse just as fun now. I pulled out her grey set of clothes and held up her coveralls. Look, these are for you! I have the same thing in my closet, and Dumpty Dumptys wearing grey too! Isnt that cool? Her sobs got quieter as she took in my words. Dumpty Dumpty? Yes! Just wearing a different color so we can match together! She reached up, hesitant, and I handed the doll over. She studied him with suspicion, but then she relaxed as she rubbed his ear between her fingers, an old comforting habit that left it frayed. Kai, sing Ring a Rosy? Sure thing! You and me, like always, right? She nodded, so I began, *Ring around the* *Rosyyy*, she chimed in, sniffling. *Pocket full of* *Posyyy*. *Ashes, ashes* *We aw faw down*. She smiled, wiping her nose on her sleeve, and I smiled back as I sat on the floor next to her. She crawled onto my lap and I hugged her as she snuggled close. She smelled just like Dumpty Dumpty and her clothes were stained, but it seemed like Tyson had healed her as her cuts and bruises were gone. She just went through the same crazy evening I did, but I wasnt sure how much she understood about what happened or how we ended up here. Wheres mama? she asked. I hesitated, struggling to find an answer before I replied, Shes at the doctor. Wheres Dotty? Hes at his house. Were in our own house, just you, me, and your mama. Isnt that cool? Mamas mashing like Dumpty Dumpty too? Of course. She pointed at her coveralls. I wanna wear that. And you too to mash like Dumpty Dumpty. Sure! But first we have to take a shower, because were gross and smelly. She giggled. Gross and smelly ogres. She roared as she clawed at my face, then she shrieked with laughter as I hoisted her up. Yes, we are! I said, carrying her to the bathroom. And now were going to our swamp! I balanced her on my hip as I twisted the only lever in the shower area, and she yelped in surprise when blue water rushed down. Blue! Yes, everything is blue in our swamp! I reached for the black soap. Except this! A rock? Yes, a rock soap for ogres! I sniffed it and nodded before I gave it to Rosy Posy. What do you think? She took a deep whiff and copied me with her own approving nod. I like it! Awesome! I put her down and helped her get ready. Faye or Ria were the ones who usually bathed her, but she didnt seem uncomfortable around me. We scrubbed away the blood, soot, and grime from her skin and used the soap on her hair as well, since there was no shampoo. After we finished, I realized there were no towels. Not having many options, I dragged over my bedsheet and dried her off before I helped her slip into her new clothes. She patted her outfit in excitement and looked up at me. And you! And me! Give me five minutes! Since there was nothing for her to watch, to draw on, or to listen to, I unlaced my new boots and handed them to her as a distraction. While Im taking a shower, can you lace these up so I can wear them? Okay! she chirped as she took them and sat on the bedroom floor. I left her and went to the bathroom, where I shot a self-conscious glance at the sky before I stripped and jumped in the shower. The warm water was soothing, and I quickly washed up and dressed before I dashed out to check on Rosy Posy. She was still on the floor, and she gave me a mischievous smile as she shoved the boots towards me. Shed laced them together, and she snickered when I thanked her before she doubled over with laughter when I put them on and hobbled around with dramatic confusion. After I taught her the proper way to lace them, she helped me as we washed our original clothes and shoes. With nowhere practical to hang them, I climbed on the counter and draped everything over the edge of the wall. Kai? Im hungry. I slid off of the counter, dreading this moment. Me too. How about we drink first? I lifted her so she could take a sip of water from the sink, and she scrunched up her face at the taste. Eww, I don like it. Thats because you have to have five gulps before you start to like it! She eyed me in suspicion as I drank. Mmm, very yummy! I said, patting my stomach. And its making me feel full too! Curious, she had some more, and although she wasnt convinced that it was yummy, she thankfully agreed that it made her full. We spent some time exploring the house together, and I tried my best to answer her infinite questions. We ended up in the room with the counter, and we sat on the floor as I introduced her to the shimmering right cabinet. After a few minutes of running our hands over its electric surface, we opened the left cabinet and took out all forty-two metallic boxes. We began stacking them on the floor like building blocks, but just as we placed the last box on top of our lopsided tower, Rosy Posy jumped up and knocked it over before she darted away, giggling. Im a big bad dagin and you can cash me! Oh, yes I can! The house didnt leave much room for running and hiding, but we made do as I pretended not to notice her slinking inside the closets or crawling beneath the beds. As I searched under my desk, complaining about how dragons always got the best of me, she pounced on my back and shrieked with laughter as I stood up and flailed in exaggerated anger. I managed to pull her off and I flung her on the bed before I attacked her with tickles, and she laughed as she smacked me with Dumpty Dumpty. Being merciful, I forgave the dragon for her crimes and leaned back, both of us staring at the glowing sky as we lay on the bed. After catching our breaths, Rosy Posy rubbed her eyes and sighed in irritation. My eyes are too blue. I chuckled. Mine too. Im forgetting what red and orange and yellow looked like! And green and white...and sanwish! She snickered at her own joke as I turned to her in amusement. Of course, sandwich, the best color! She propped herself up on her elbows. I wanna sanwish. Me too, but we have to wait for someone to come get us food. Why? Because theres no food here. Why? Because we moved here really fast so they didnt have time to prepare everything for us. Why? Because theyre very busy. But theyll be here soon. Do you know how I think theyll get here? No, how? I delved into a made-up story that involved spaceships, delivery pods, and liquid walls that you could walk through. I didnt know if she understood everything I was saying, but it kept us both distracted enough until we drifted off to sleep. I found myself surrounded by fire, my legs chopped off and my arms tied behind my back. Faye and Rosy Posy were face-down on the floor as the fire ate them and I tried to scream for help, but I ended up choking as smoke clogged my throat like saturated cloth. A shadow glided towards me and I looked up in hope, only to shrink away as Flint hovered over me, knives sticking out of him and a giant gun in his hands, the flames reflecting off of his wild eyes and toothy grin. He bent over, and I cowered in horror as he mutated into Tyson and smirked. He shoved the gun under my chin with such force it felt like it went through my brain and I thrashed as I tried to escape. Kai? I jerked upright, panting, the bed disheveled as my fists gripped the fitted sheet tight. I gulped and took a few deep breaths, trying to tame my racing heart as sweat trickled down the side of my face. Rosy Posy stood in front of me, worried. Bad dream? I nodded, still trying to shake away the nightmare. You and me, she said before she began to sing, *Ring a ring a* I looked at her and she raised her eyebrows, expectant. *Ring a ring a* I sniffled before I chimed in with a shaky whisper. *Rosyyy.* *Pocky fulla* *Posyyy*. *Ashes, ashes* *We all fall down.* She smiled. Okay? I nodded, smiling back as I wiped my tears. Yes, thank you. She sidled up to me for a hug and I held her tight. Our new life wasnt going to be easy, but we had each other. We could get through this together. Kai? I wanna pee. I took her to the bathroom and showed her how everything worked before I waited for her outside. After a few minutes, she walked out with her coveralls unbuttoned and asked me to help her wash her hands. While lifting her so she could reach the sink, I could hear her grumbling stomach dueting with mine. I put her down and began buttoning her coveralls, and she wiped her wet hands on my sleeves as she asked, Wheres mama? Shes still at the doctor, but soon shell be with us! And Dotty? No, hes at his home with Dr. Aurora, Zale, and Cinderella. We wont see them anymore because were in our own house now. I handed her Dumpty Dumpty with a smile. But thats okay! We can make new friends here, right? She seemed tired as she smiled back. Yes. I held my hand out for her to hold, but she shuffled closer and lifted her arms instead. Up? I carried her, and she leaned her head on my shoulder with a sigh. Kai? Im hungry. I felt terrible for not having a way to feed her. I glanced up at the exposed sky. If no one was going to come for us, then I had to go out to find either help or food. I walked to the room with the cabinets and set Rosy Posy down between the metallic boxes shed knocked over. Im going to climb up there and see if I can find food, I said, pointing. And me? No, you stay here and Ill be back soon. I wanna go wi you! Okay, sure, no problem! I looked around for a way to distract her. But first I have to check by myself to make sure its safe! While youre waiting, how about you help me by putting *all* these boxes back? She nodded and crouched down, collecting them, and I sighed with relief as I jumped on the counter and hoisted myself up until I was sitting on the edge of the wall. I shuddered as I was met by the eerie view again. Nothing had changed since the last time. I squinted as I tried to make out any details along the metal gate in the distance, but it just seemed uniform with no obvious doors. I looked at the ground. If I lowered myself carefully, I could drop down the rest of the way without hurting myself. The only problem would be climbing back up. I searched for a solution, and my eyes landed on the laundry wed hung to dry. Everything was still wet, and I shook them as I wondered how they would ever get dry without sun or wind. I reached for the bedsheets and twirled them, deciding to tie them together like in those prison break movies. Id barely finished tightening the knot when an explosion rocked the wall. I gasped as I let go of the bedsheets and grabbed the edge to keep from falling off. A shrill wail followed the blast and I whipped around in a panic to look inside the room. Horror and confusion took over when I saw the cracked counter and walls splattered with dark liquid, trailing chunks, and metallic debris. Rosy Posys screams emanated from beneath unidentifiable clumps that buried the floor, and I jumped down and fell to my knees as I began digging. Everything smelled like food, and that just added to my confusion as dark sauces and grey substances coated my frenzied hands. Rosy Posy! Its okay! Im here! Guided by my voice, two flailing arms shot up from beneath the mush, one gripping my hand while the other struck my face. My shocked gasp evolved into an agonized scream and I jerked away from her, falling on my back as ash fluttered around me and the smell of burning flesh filled my nose. I writhed against the floor, garbled cries scouring my throat as the left side of my face seared and my right hand crumbled into a charred stump of bone and sinew. The pain was unimaginable, and so was the situation. Id learned only yesterday what Rosy Posy was capable of, but I never thought it could happen to me. Despite my agony, I noticed that Rosy Posy wasnt screaming anymore, and tears blurred my remaining eye as my mind scrambled to juggle my anguished state and my responsibilities. R-Rosy Owzysss o-okay I wheezed, my breaths spasming and my heart jittering. I tried to crawl over, but the excruciating pain had chewed its way so deep into my core that I couldnt fight it any longer as I passed out.  I leave you two alone for less than a day in a house designed *specifically* for humans, and you go ahead and destroy it, sap your food reserves, and almost kill yourselves. I jolted awake at the familiar voice and sat up to see Tyson lounging atop the cracked counter as he looked down at me in amusement. The room was still a mess but the pain was gone, and I checked my hands and patted my face in relief before I turned towards Rosy Posy. My relief vanished when I saw her lying unconscious, her face swollen and blood-streaked, her front teeth missing, and her breaths gurgling and jagged as crimson bubbles popped between her cut lips. I turned to Tyson in desperation. Please, help her! I wish for you to heal her! Did you forget my one wish per deal rule? You healed me! Heal her! Please! I healed you because we need to talk. Your relocation was quite spur-of-the-moment and you and I havent ironed out the details. Since Rosys choking to death on her blood and teeth as we speak, Ill make this quick. Ill heal Rosy if you agree to give me ten grandkids. Do we have a deal? Yes! Deal! The wet rasping stopped and I turned to Rosy Posy as her chest rose with a deep steady breath. Although there was still blood on her face, her teeth were intact again and the swelling and cuts disappeared. I looked up at Tyson, my voice shaking. How did this happen? We normally dont shove all our food packs in the cooker at once. Food packs? I looked around at flimsy metallic shards dotting the mess. The little boxes were food? Quite convenient, arent they? So was the brand new cooker that youve managed to destroy. I realized what had happened when my eyes landed on the right cabinet, its sparking dark blue walls splayed and its bloodstained door halfway across the room. Rosy Posy must have shoved the boxes in the wrong cabinet and somehow activated it when she shut the door, causing it to explode with food. The cabinet with the electric walls is the cooker? I asked. Obviously. Its so simple a three-year-old couldve figured it out, but I guess I shouldnt have expected much from you two. My face heated up in shame and anger. It wasnt obvious. You left us alone with no instructions. I dont know how anything works here. I dont even know where we are. Is this another planet? No, youre in a different realm than the one Earths located in. There are no planets here. What *is* a realm? You couldnt even figure out the cooker, so I doubt youll understand, he said with a condescending smirk. Humans havent yet mastered the ability to travel between realms, but my people had been colonizing them since the beginning of time and its something we continue to do. What are you? I asked, my offense shifting to curiosity. Aliens? Demons? Neither. There isnt a word for my kind in any human language. What do I call you then? Realm Vikings? He smiled at a private joke. Sure, has a better ring to it than genies or fairies. How many realms have you colonized? Countless. Is there life on them? More often than not, yes. So Realm Vikings use their powers to invade and kill everyone? Yes, but we dont kill *everyone*. We believe in diversity and offer those that surrender a chance to remain and serve. I tensed up. Are you going to invade Earth? Weve already colonized your realm ages ago. What! But we didnt surrender to you! Did we? He laughed. Ah, humans and their egos. Earth isnt a realm, its a tiny chaotic planet in a vast realm that has other systems and beings. So, Earth is? Earth is my breeding ground and we all keep an eye on it to make sure you dont drive yourselves to extinction. If it helps you visualize, some colonies are zoos and others, like Earth, are wildlife reserves. He smiled. Some beings are just amusing to watch as they live their lives and we dont meddle. Of course, Earth is a unique exception because it has the only beings I can procreate with, so some meddling is involved. Ive considered turning it into a breeding farm, but humans are such twisted self-absorbed creatures that I enjoy dealing with them in their natural environment. Theyre quite devious, which makes them very entertaining. I ensure consent by making deals, and I get a kick out of them trying to outsmart me by taking advantage of loopholes or using incantations to trap me. Its hilarious. You also wont believe the crazy things humans wish for, the greedy savages. I love it. I frowned. ""Not all humans are like that."" ""True, but they're the more interesting ones."" Why cant you guys make your own babies? Im the last of my kind, he said, not sounding very mournful. We were wiped out a few millennia ago and I had to find beings to help me repopulate. My quest took centuries and resulted in miserable weaklings who didnt even have one-thousandth of my abilities, but then I stumbled upon crazy little Earth and hit the jackpot. With humans, my kids have a fighting spirit and can master one element, live an average of two centuries, survive in most environments, and discover brilliant ways to make up for their inability to teleport and grant wishes. The one thing they cant do is breed with each other, or with me, which is why I continue to rely on humans. How were others like you all wiped out? I asked, confused. You can teleport, control all the elements, make people fall asleep, basically do magic and even heal yourself, right? How could everyone die except you? Was it more powerful beings? When youre on top, you make many enemies, and when youre capable of anything, you underestimate them. Thats what bit us in the ass. But it wont happen again. My kids limitations push them to rely on their minds as well as their abilities, and weve made powerful allies and have never been more successful. Is every Realm Viking now your kid from a human? Yes. He nodded towards Rosy Posy. Except for my three grandkids. Where do you guys live? After training, my kids are shipped off to conquer. When their endurance and abilities diminish, an unfortunate side-effect of their human side, theyre pulled from battle and assigned a job in our home realm or a colony. Then, when they get too old, theyre assigned baby duty here. He gestured around. This is the nursery realm. Its one of the smallest dullest realms weve colonized, consisting only of this land. Its the perfect place for my little ones to be raised communal-style until theyre old enough to go to the triggering and training realm. So this place has only little kids and seniors? Yes, unless Im too focused on controlling hostile realms and the baby numbers lag, like now, and I end up with excess seniors hogging up resources. He smiled. But with grandkids possible, that shouldnt be a problem anymore. Thanks to you, I broke my no humans rule and decided to build a human sector here to see how it pans out. Its still brand new and youre the only occupant, but Ill be bringing in a female human to see if grandkids work the other way around. If it all goes swimmingly, Ill bring in a few more strapping human specimens. Since my kids cant grant wishes or teleport, having a gaggle of pre-consenting humans at their disposal will definitely be more effective than having them ruin my personal playground. He winked. So, ready to be a dad? Oh, uh I rubbed the back of my head. Hows Faye doing? Shes in one of our best mental health facilities in the medical realm. I have a feeling shell be alright. I smiled. Thats good, I really hope so! And how are Ria and her twins? Brilliant, he said, grinning. For a Tsunami half-breed and two Earthquake quarter-breeds raised on Earth, theyre exceeding their trainers expectations. Im certain theyll be battle-ready in just a few weeks. Thats good too, I guess. Is that what they want? Its what all my kids want. Not Faye. She doesnt like violence. He gave me a sly smile. I guess well have to wait and see. When can we see her? After she controls her abilities and gets out of her mental funk. Can we meet the seniors and kids living here? No. I frowned. Why not? Buddy, I didnt bring you here to mingle. You work for me and your role is to give me grandkids. Youve got this entire area within the metal gates to frolic in, and soon youll have more humans to chit-chat with. He stood up and stretched, the food squelching beneath his giant boots. Ill fix this mess before I go. Do you have any questions so we can avoid further mishaps? Oh, yes, how does the cooker work? You put the food pack in and close the door. The cooker is lined with preset roedtolyn. Once it comes in contact with the coded metal surface of the food packs, it activates the cooking process. Oh, roedtolyn sounds like Roedtome. I remember you said Rias twin is a Roedtome. Yes, Roedtomes control roedtolyn and are the most intelligent, crucial, and trusted of the six classifications of elemental manipulators. What *is* roedtolyn? He took out a small shimmering blue cube from his pocket and I stared in wonder as he stretched it like putty, making it spark and crackle. ""This is its raw form."" Is it made of electricity? I asked, fascinated. Not at all, but as a human, that may be the closest comparison youd understand,"" he said as he turned it back into a cube and pocketed it. ""Is your ring roedtolyn? It looks the same."" He adjusted the wide flat band on his index finger. Yes, but with advanced programming. Roedtolyn's uses are unparalleled, from powering our realms to facilitating communication between ourselves and others. You wont believe how many realms, beings, and languages exist out there. Not everyone speaks English? His guffaw shook the room. Is that a serious question? Not even all humans speak English and you expect countless distinct realms to share your dull cumbersome language? My face heated up. No, but youre speaking English to me now so I thoughtI dont know. I speak more languages than youve spoken words, buddy. But all my kids and all those who work for us have a roedtolyn translator implanted in their brains. He smiled. You have one too. I ran my fingers over my scalp in shock. You did surgery on me? Not surgery. Our team of expert medical Roedtomes guide the translator through to the brain and coil it around the appropriate areas, fusing it. You should now be able to understand anyone who talks to you, no matter the language. His last sentence wasnt in English, and I smiled in awe as I somehow understood him. Thats so cool! Was that your language? Yes. Glad to see the implants working as intended on our first human! Does it make me speak in any language too? No, but it will help you understand written or signed language. To put it simply, it helps with input, not output. Oh. I thought for a few seconds. What if the beings dont have brains? Like, what if theyre spirits or blobs or shadows or something? How do you give them the translator? He raised an eyebrow, amused. Judging by your intelligence, I didnt take you for the creative type. Yes, not all beings we come across are organic or even physical, but roedtolyn has never failed us yet. Its quite versatile. In fact, the translator isnt your only roedtolyn implant. Really? What else do I have? He smirked. Lets just say you got an adjustable vasectomy. My mouth fell open as I looked down in shock. What! Humans are social creatures. If Im going to put a bunch of frisky young males and females together, theyre bound to jump each others bones. Since I cant deny nature, I figured Id let them have their fun. The implants will only disengage when in proximity to an implant in my kids. This way, you can throw all the orgies you want and I wont have to deal with your human babies. I blinked a few times, unnerved. You did this without asking. Do you ask a dog if it wants to get neutered or spayed? I bristled. Im not a dog. He seemed to be enjoying himself. Why are you more upset about this than the translator? The translator is up here and it helps me, but this is private and it takes something away. It isnt permanent, and privacys overrated. He chuckled. Says a lot about male humans when theyre more concerned about their balls than their brain. I frowned and looked away, irritated and embarrassed. Any other implants I should know about? Nope. Any other questions before I go? I took a deep breath and turned back to him. Yes, whys there a buzzing sound all the time? Is there? he asked in mild surprise. Perhaps as a human youre picking up some sort of vibrations we cant. Interesting. Is it from the sky? Perhaps. Why does it glow blue? Does it ever change? He chuckled. That isnt exactly a sky, but I doubt youll understand if I explain what it is. I *can* tell you that it rarely changes. What are the blue spongy things on the ground outside? Theyre like plants on Earth. They feed off of the skys blue rays, draw water from the ground, and release oxygen. Its the main reason I chose to build the human sector here, there arent many realms where humans can survive. Oh. I glanced up, squinting at the brightness. Why dont we have a door, windows, or a roof? He looked around as if he was realizing this for the first time. Hmm, so you dont. Well, your relocation *was* rather last-minute. I had a lot to do and didnt consider the particular aesthetics. I tried to make it as familiar to you as possible. If you want a door, windows, a roof, or anything else, just say the word. Yes, Id like those. Id also like toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, towels, toilet paper, a mop, a broom, cleaning rags, and a way to dry our laundry. You dont need towels or toilet paper. If you turn the lever in the shower, it gives you water. If you pull it out, it gives you air. Same goes for the sink and the nozzle in the toilet. As for your laundry, just hang it in the closet and twist the bar before you lock the door and theyll be washed and steamed. Oh, okay. I looked at the mess around me. Where do I throw the garbage? Flush it. Even the metallic boxes after weve eaten from them? Yes, just ball them up and flush them. Okay. Um, oh, also, can I have a clock or something? I cant keep track of time here, its confusing. Duly noted. Anything else? Yes, maybe some books, paper, and crayons for Rosy Posy, and a swing set? And maybe a rocking chair? Faye likes those. And maybe something that plays music? We used to dance with the bosss parrot after breakfast every morning. Oh, also, maybe a small car? I was teaching Faye to drive and shes really good at it. He leaned against the wall, his head tilted in amusement as he crossed his arms. Kronk, you must be the most starry-eyed adult human Ive ever come across. How did Dante end up hiring someone as simple-minded as you? My name is Kai, not Kronk, I said, scowling, and Im not as stupid as most people think. Your conviction is charming. He crouched down and reached for Rosy Posy. And now Ill be taking this trouble-maker off your hands. I sat up in shock. No, why? If its because of what happened, I promise it wont happen again! Ill be more careful and you can give me fireproof clothes so I can hold her when she's scared or hurt without getting burned! Shell only incinerate you if she touches your skin, so your protection doesnt need to be fireproof,"" he said as he cradled her. ""But that isnt the reason Im taking her. Faye wants to see her daughter. Oh, yea, of course! Wait, she needs this. I dug out Dumpty Dumpty and brushed away the food before I placed him between Rosy Posys limp hands. She was eight, but in Tysons giant arms she looked like a doll herself. Ill try my best to figure out how to live here so when they move in nothing like this will ever happen again. Im sure you will, he said with an amused smile. Any last"" He stopped talking and swiped his thumb over his roedtolyn ring before he spoke in what sounded like French. ""Brigitte, good morning! Have you finalized your terms? He chuckled. Yes, Ill let you know beforehand so you can set up an alibi  perfect  see you tomorrow! He swiped his thumb over the ring again. ""Sorry about that. Any last questions before I go?"" I didn't reply as I stared at his ring in awe. That's why you suddenly started talking to no one in a weird language yesterday! Your ring is a phone!"" He chuckled. ""You could say that. A very advanced one."" Can I have one in case I need to contact you? No, but Ill drop in on you every once in a while, so just save your questions until then. Anything else? I shook my head, and he smiled as he stood up. Alright, catch you later, buddy! Cheers!  I didnt realize Tyson had made me fall asleep until I opened my eyes. The destruction and mess surrounding me had disappeared, but I was still coated in food and sauce. A roof now concealed the glowing sky, but I could still see it through the wide window stretching over the restored counter. A door that didnt exist before was to my right. I opened it, and the grey dirt crunched beneath my boots as I stepped outside. Despite knowing where I was, it still felt eerie. I crouched next to one of the blue sponges, and my skin crawled as each hole in its surface pulsated like a tiny exhaling mouth. I searched for a car or a swing set, but I didnt find either. Perhaps Tyson was going to get them once Faye and Rosy Posy move in. The bathroom did have toiletries now, and after jumping in the shower again, I hung all my clothes in the closet to be cleaned and steamed while I walked around the house to look for further changes. Every room had a window, but none had glass, curtains, or blinds. I couldnt find a radio, but a strange clock hung on my wall and a broom and mop leaned against the hallway corner near a few folded rags. In Rosy Posys room, a rocking chair sat beside a small bookshelf filled with books and her desk had a stack of blue paper and two black pencils. When the closet clicked, I pulled out my underwear, jeans, and the shirt Faye made me and slipped them on, their warmth as close to a hug as I could get. I sat on the rocking chair and tucked my legs up as I sighed. It was going to take a while to adjust, but I was going to try my best to be there for Faye and Rosy Posy. \--------------- [Faye](URL [Dante](URL **Part 1** \- *Part 2 - Part 3 - Part 4*"

I hated that. My world wasnt perfect; in fact, it wasnt even good. But human survival is based on our need for the status quo. This is true even when business as usual is slowly drawing life out of us, second by second. We walk happily forward, somehow able to forget the fact that passing time is another way of describing death. My life, a wise man once said, is measured out in coffee spoons. You took all that away from me. And I hated that. The fear of caring for an entire *human* - and a helpless *infant* human at that  shook me to my core. I was so much more afraid of facing you than  well, anything  that nothing frightened me. Theres no fear of getting fired once youve already quit. So I walked into my bosss office at the box factory and told him that I was worth more than hed been paying me. I also explained exactly why hed been losing money. Spoiler: he was just as afraid as *I* had been of facing himself and making difficult decisions. Id known it for quite some time, and had been afraid to tell him. He promoted me on the spot. The bump in pay was completely neutralized by preparing for you. Dorothy wasnt the one for me to marry. We both knew it, and we were both afraid to let go. Then she told me that she was pregnant, and that I had to marry her or leave. *You* denied me the opportunity to stay comfortably afraid to move. So we accepted that we werent the one for each other, but that the idea is probably based on a fantasy anyway. We embraced what worked between us, we accepted what didnt, and we moved on together. I had never realized just how much time I spent doing *nothing.* Internet chat rooms, watching TV, hitting the snooze button, sitting on the couch, spending an hour getting ready for the day when I can make it happen in nine minutes, 19 minutes here, 13 minutes there  holy shit, I was wasting 24 hours of every week on absolutely nothing whatsoever. Were those things worth a day of my life? No, but I gladly paid the Reaper anyway, and I was agonized when I learned Id have to give that up. But it turns out thats just enough time to put you to sleep, pick you up, get food in you, clean the food that comes out of you, and repeat the process eight more times a day. I would have to construct my *entire* life around this reality. Eventually, you would grow old enough to handle those things yourself, and would never once show appreciation for my efforts. Thats what Id signed up for without wanting any of it. Life was going to be *real,* and that challenged everything I knew. I hated the vulnerability. Because nothing can describe the raw terror of a grim-faced doctor explaining that there are serious problems with the pregnancy. You cracked open a nerve that I never knew existed. I would have lived, and died, placidly unaware of the horrifying knowledge that Id been sitting on unused pieces of my soul. Those pieces were rotting away. Thank you for showing me how scary that is. And thank you for forcing me to push myself so far into my discomfort zone that I had to give up on doubting myself. There just isnt time to question whether Im strong enough when my child is suffering. It turns out that doctors know more than they say at first, insurance has more than it gives at first, and Im more of an asshole than I believed at first. I know it sounds like that last part is a bad thing, but believe me when I say its not. If you have a terrible relationship with someone, they usually drift away in time; and if youre an asshole to someone, they probably deserve it. But even the biggest asshole in the world cant bully circumstance into submission. We learned what it was to suffer. Another wise man once explained that suffering *is* life. Dorothy and I lived. And we loved  we loved because we were broken, rather than in spite of it. We watched as our status quo died without fanfare, and you were birthed with much drama. We watched as you struggled, and we struggled as you stopped. This letter isnt an apology, because I have no inaction to confess. This is a note of thanks, as I sit here with you in my arms, watching the sun slowly rise on the first day after your birth. You were born to change the world. And in the twenty minutes that you lived, you did. _____________________________ [FB](URL [BD](URL [Listen](URL"
33,vulnerability,nosleep,"When you feel like something is watching you from the shadows, RUN.",1,ekgf7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ekgf7c/when_you_feel_like_something_is_watching_you_from/,2020-01-06 04:58:07,"Okay, holy shit. Im writing this up online because I honestly dont know what else to do. Im freaked the fuck out. My hands are shaking. Its hard to type. I think Ill post this to Reddit once I get all the details in, but I really dont know what to do. I guess I should start off with some background info. Im a high school senior, and kind of a huge nerd. As a firm believer in the scientific method, I usually classify myself as, to put it mildly, highly skeptical of the paranormal. Today, or I guess yesterday night by now- I havent slept a fucking wink since it happened- a bunch of friends came over to my house for a potluck and New Years party. So we had just finished eating our potluck dinner, and were sitting around in my living room watching stupid YouTube videos. There were some good ones at first, but after a while I could tell everyone was starting to get bored. Someone suggested for us to go explore the woods a little bit down the road from my house. People were hesitant at first, but after a while we were able to convince everyone that it would be fun, or at least more fun than sitting around doing nothing. So we all left, traveling through my neighbors back yard, then down the main road, through some bushes, and down to the end of a nearby dead-end street. It was around six o clock, but it was already pitch black, except for an rust-colored moon hanging ominously above the trees. When we reached the edge of the woods, I pushed my way through the thick brambles that bordered the yard we were standing in. (Yes, we were probably trespassing. Most of us didnt really think anything of it. We do stupid shit.) The ones with more common sense than the rest of us, like our student council president, Haycraft, were hesitant to go in, but I pushed. Oh come on, guys. Weve gone this far. Lets go down to the river- it will be fun! I beckoned. Most of my friends murmured agreements, some said nothing. One by one, people started pushing their way into the thicket. Once Spencer, who held the only real flashlight (everyone else was just using their phones,) had guided everyone through, including himself, we headed off into the black. I tripped over a near-invisible wire fence hidden by the leaves after only a few more steps, so we again took another minute to make sure everyone safely made it over. We had gone only another maybe twenty feet down the hill when we came across a spool of barbed wire lying in a mound of damp leaves. We stopped to look. Weird, part of its made of sticks Eli remarked. No it isnt you idiot, thats barbed wire. Its just rusty. someone returned. I didnt really care what it was made out of, so while a few of them circled around and started poking and prodding at it, I hung around the edge of the group. Thats when I felt it. You know the clich feeling like youre being watched? Well, its dumb. Youd never know someone- or something- is watching you from deep in the shadows without some other sense triggering that instinct- maybe an object moving in your peripheral vision, or a strange sound being noticed by the subconscious, or maybe even just a cold breeze blowing across your neck. I dont know what sense triggered that feeling for me, but when I was standing on the outskirts of our pack, some primal instinct froze me with fear. Were we being watched? Or was it just a trick of the mind? Looking around at the few others not amused by the spool of wire made me realize I wasnt alone in that feeling. Claire was the first one to spot it. What is that, guys? Do you see that? Look over there! She pointed her phones flashlight up towards the yard we had just come through. We looked up to where she was pointing. I see it too! said Eli. Its a post. What are you freaking out?. Silhouetted against the moonlit sky was a figure leaning against the yards picket fence. It looked almost human-- almost, but it was hard to tell. It had a long, dark, skinny body, and a head cloaked in shadow, but no other distinct features visible from where we were standing. Yeah, I think its a post. Haycraft remarked. Are we gonna keep going or what? Lets get down to the river. I strained my eyes to look closer. It almost looked like it was shaking its head. No, guys, hold on, I think thats a dude. Do you think its the property owner? I said. Maybe we should go. Claire returned. I strained my eyes harder. I was getting a little scared. Yeah, its shaking its head. I told you this was a stupid idea. said Spencer, still holding the flashlight. He aimed the beam up at the figure, but it didnt reach through the thick mess of trees. Its definitely a post. Eli returned. No, look man, I can see it shaking its head. What is it even doing? I said. No one else could see it moving. I only grew more concerned as time ticked by. HELLO? Someone yelled. Chills ran down my spine- it was definitely nodding No. We stood there yelling towards it for a minute or two with no response. It just shook its head, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, still unmoving, waist leaning against the top of the fencepost, eerily silhouetted against the moonlit sky. And then it took a step towards us. It had long, skinny black legs- too long to be human. I could see the glint of its huge, disproportionate eyes in the moonlight. It took another step. With a collective gasp, our group went silent. Turn your damn lights off, lets go. I said. All I could hear was heavy breathing. Fuck fuck fuck lets go, now. Watch the wire fence. Keep your damn lights off. LETS GO. We split, and started bolting through the woods. I somehow managed to miss the fence without tripping and sprinted through the thicket, coming to a stop at the corner of the picket fence, opposite to where the figure was standing. I looked back to check on the others, but everyone else was still masked by darkness. The figure was obscured from sight by the tall, spiked tops of the fence posts. Claire and Patrick were the only other ones who had kept pace with me. They both emerged from the woods a few seconds after I turned around. We crouched together by the fence, waiting for the others. How tall was that dude? I whispered nervously, Was he taller than the fence? What the hell There was this noise unlike anything I had ever heard before- something low, dark, and sinister. Like the moan of some hellish foghorn, calling out with the might of ten thousand damned souls. Images from a documentary Id watched the night before flooded into my mind- the golden eyes of a lioness stalking her prey from the bushes, the startled call of the antelope as it fell, the mangled body left behind. A chill ran down my spine. Patricks eyes grew wide with fear. He grabbed my arm. Im not waiting around here any longer- lets run. NOW. Well meet the others back at home or something. I saw that that thing MOVE when we started running. We took off, and hauled ass through the yard. I didnt look back until we were home. We all were terrified. Both of my parents had already gone to bed, so we just waited on my back porch, anxious for the return of the rest of the group. We exchanged very few words over the next hour. People slowly started trickling back to the house. Haycraft, stone faced, joined us at the table. Then Lilli. Then Spencer. He had lost his flashlight somewhere along the way, and his clothes were covered in mud. He looked like hed crawled out of the woods on his stomach. We continued in silence, anxious for the rest of the group to return. At midnight, Eli was still missing. We waited and waited, but he didnt show.. I was the one to break the silence. Where is he? Shrugs, and more silence. Most of us had curfews. Every twenty minutes or so, one of us would get up from the table, get in their car, and drive home. The minutes ticked by into hours. Im now the only one left. Its almost 3 AM, but he still hasnt showed. I dont know what the hell that thing was, but I fear for Elis life. I can still hear that sound echoing in my head, torturing me or is it really there? I pray, for his sake, that its just the wind. If I could give you all one word of advice, the next time you get that feeling- that tingling on the back of your neck- that primal instinct of vulnerability- a feeling that something is watching you from the shadows, RUN."
34,vulnerability,nosleep,My friend wanted me to do an awful thing. I wish I did now.,1,elwurb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/elwurb/my_friend_wanted_me_to_do_an_awful_thing_i_wish_i/,2020-01-09 05:43:11,"No demonic tale on the shelf of a library can match the horrors of mental health. No ghost story from a friend of a friend can recreate the terror your own mind resenting you causes. I worked between those walls for two years. If I had done so for twenty more, I still wouldnt have gotten used to it. Mental health hospitals arent a place to go when you need to get better, just a place you go when you cant get any worse. A building of people who cant get any worse. Being the cleaner meant I didnt have to deal with the patients much. Id greet them whilst passing in the corridors and even make pleasant, ordinary small talk with some of the more social ones. They were the ones who surprised you when you were mopping up their blood the following morning after they made an attempt on their life. When thats your job, it takes awhile to realise that the man in the corner isnt a lunatic and the one you pass on the stairs isnt a psychopath. Theyre just like the man with the mop or the woman in the office. We dont choose our bodies and nor do we our minds. Paul taught me this. I was only a few weeks into my job when I met Paul. I was using my mop to push the bucket back to the storage room when I heard him. Hey, Mr Cleaner Man! I turned around to see a pudgy, bald, middle-aged man jogging towards me. He was slightly out of breath by the time he reached me. Despite his many tattoos, faintly visible through his white t-shirt and winding around his arms, he gave off no air of intimidation. Mind if I walk with you a while, Mr Cleaner Man? There was a childlike innocence in him when he spoke. He was a few inches smaller than me and had to look up slightly to make eye contact. I thought I should feel threatened, but he didnt seem to want a fight. Not with me, or worse, himself. He just stared through the suspense, waiting for my response. Yeah, sure. Im only going to the storage room. A brief look of excitement filled his face for a second before suppressing it and setting off beside me. I was almost paranoid by how friendly he was. He wanted to know about my day and told me about his. He asked me what I liked to do outside of work and I asked him what he liked about the clinic. Not all that much. We laughed as we arrived at the storage room. He thanked me for letting him tag along as I threw the mop into the corner. We shook hands before parting ways. Im Paul, by the way. You seem like a nice fella, Mr Cleaner Man. His words seemed completely transparent. There was no motive hiding behind him. Just a man, happy to be conversing. I found myself walking with Paul daily. We only saw each other during my minute-long journey to the storage room, but it never felt too short to have real conversation. I found out that Paul worked in a warehouse before having a mental breakdown in the midst of his divorce. The councillors tell him he cant leave whilst harbouring the risk of another suicide attempt. The worst part of the whole situation is how painfully aware Paul was of the wreck unfolding in his brain. I found a way of asking him how walking with a cleaner for barely sixty seconds effects the storm cloud above his mind. It saddened me to see his head droop as the usual, bubbling enthusiasm in his face grew still and cold. When I first met my wife, Ex-wife, I was a cleaner. Things were still nice then. If I can just walk with you for a minute whilst you hold that mop, I can pretend that theyre my hands keeping these floors clean, and at the end of the night, I can pretend that theyre my hands opening the doors to go back home to when... things were still nice. I felt my heart grow heavy as my brain rummaged, looking for words to say. No breakdown, mess or human under that hospital roof could express the loneliness in what had just left Pauls mouth. Paul, I.... The bubbling enthusiasm jumped back into his eyes. Dont let me depress you, Mr Cleaner Man. We dont talk long enough to spend our time sad! He firmly patted my back whilst hiding the sadness that simmered under his joyful, temporary facade. I liked Paul. I dont go out much and I dont even enjoy talking on the phone, but I never felt a conversation flow so freely than when it was with him. He was the weird kid in school you took under your wing to later realise their goldmine of a personality. After the first week we could ask about each others family members by name. After the first month we could mention important times in each others lives by the date. After a year, I saw him as a work friend. The best one Id met. He knew my name after the first day, but he still liked to call me Mr Cleaner Man. The only things I did in that hospital were exactly what I was told and talk to Paul, so when one of the councillors asked to see me, I had an idea of what it was about. Just take a seat here for me. Miss Lowden was a well dressed woman in her mid-fifties. She pulled up a chair for me and placed it by her desk. I felt I was receiving bad news at a doctors appointment. Now, I wont keep you too long. I just feel its important to address your relationships within this facility. She thought carefully and spoke slowly, almost as if she had no idea what word should come after the previous. I know what this is about, Miss Lowden, and I understand the concern, but me and Paul just talk. Nothing funny. My response lingered in the air as she processed what I just said. Paul... she continued, mentioning Pauls name like it was in a language she didnt speak. ... we feel is a part of your life that wont benefit you. You understand? My face mustve told her that I really didnt. Paul will likely lead to you making bad decisions. He may be a nice addition to your time here at the moment, but in the long run, wed dread to think of him bringing harm to you. Wow. I was surprised and saddened by the fact that even a councillor couldnt separate a troubled man from a dangerous one, but there we were. I completely understand, Miss. Ill be sure to keep this in mind from now on. Both were lies, but I had no interest in hearing what else she had to say. She didnt know Paul. I did. Well check up on your progress now and then to be sure further assistance isnt required. I left the room almost offended, knowing Id speak to Paul the next day. Mrs Lowden must have heard us talking from her office as we headed to the storage room before, so I made sure I took my time mopping the floor outside of Pauls room instead. What? Why would she think that? Ive never hurt anyone in here! I hated seeing such offence take over Pauls face. Stay inside your room. Ill talk from out here. I murmured as I continued mopping the floor to disguise our conversation. Theyre control freaks, Paul. They enjoy telling us what to do. I need this job, but not for them to decide my friends. I continued. Pauls face lit up in a small glow of pride at my use of the word friend. It was the first time Id called him one to his face. The glow suddenly dimmed into an emotion Id never seen within him before: pure anger. How can that bitch be so cruel? She deserves to be in here, not me! I watched him pace his room with his arms folded tightly. I quietly matched his rage. I saw the exact second an idea locked itself into Pauls brain. He froze before throwing his stare in my direction, smirking in excitement. Ive got it. Ive got it, Mr Cleaner Man! I wouldve matched his enthusiasm too if there wasnt a slight tinge or fear entwined with my anticipation. He turned to face me, taking a step closer. Cut my wrists! I prayed to find a sliver of humour in his eyes. What? How would that help anything? I noticed Id stopped mopping in my shock. Nothing will happen if I complain about Miss Lowden in here. Shell only find out. If I show you how to cut my wrists and make it look bad, Ill be taken to A&amp;E. Theyll listen there! His eyes told me that he genuinely believed what he was saying. Paul, this is ridiculous! Why do you need me to do it? Because I trust you, Mr Cleaner Man. Much more than myself. I didnt discard his words to be those of madness, but rather desperation. Im not going to hurt you, Paul. Im sorry. Ill come back and see you soon. Dont do anything stupid! I pointed at him like a teacher scolding a child. I stabbed the bucket with my mop and set off down the corridor. It felt strange not having him beside me. Think about it, Mr Cleaner Man! We could take her down together! The words echoed from his room as I stared ahead, begging that the double doors serval yards in front of me would come sooner. Im almost ashamed to say that I spent the next few weeks avoiding Paul. Id tiptoe whilst passing his room and I deliberately changed my cleaning routine to avoid an encounter. Miss Lowden called me into her office a few times during that period, but only for me to say things were going well then be dismissed by her. I wasnt scared of Paul, just concerned about how our friendship effected him. It was just over two weeks when I found the courage to talk to him again. My plan was to clean outside his room early in the morning and wait until he woke up. My plan didnt go well. I was hardly by his door when it opened a few inches and a hand shot out, grabbing me by the collar and dragging me inside. I regained my balance to see Paul stood there, excitement consuming his presence as he hid his hands behind his back. Hey... Paul.... Howre you doing? I felt my vulnerability prepare me to run if needed. I have it, Mr Cleaner Man. I have it! Look! Paul revealed a thin, sharp, plastic object from behind his back. No bigger than 6 inches with a light green and dark blue design swirling up it. What have you done, Paul? I felt my shoulders hunch and my head lower as I instinctively leaned back. Not bad, is it? It was a toothbrush. I was up all night, sharpening it against the walls. Remember the plan I had? He spoke as if I wasnt completely against the idea just weeks ago. He held out the toothbrush with one hand for me to grab, followed by the other with his wrist exposed. Do it, Mr Cleaner Man. Its the right thing to do. He began edging towards me. Stop it, Paul. Just let me get back to work. Closer. Well look back in pride. You know you have to, Mr Cleaner Man. Closer. He grabbed my hand and tried to wrap it around the toothbrush. I tugged him towards me and began wrestling him for the sharp object. I could hear were the squeaks of our shoes against the floor and the grunts as I tried to both gain control of the homemade knife and keep it away from both our torsos and throats. I forced Paul to the floor, only to have him put his foot against my stomach and kick me away. I fell back against the closed door as Paul used the walls to scramble to his feet, still armed with the weapon. We were so close, Mr Cleaner Man. Now youll have to wait until next time. Goodbye, Paul. He placed the sharp end of the tooth brush just below his left ear before forcing it into his flesh and slicing to his right. Paul! Stop! Blood sprayed across the room, leaving splatters on my trousers and shoes. He fell backwards against the wall and slid back to the ground, his eyes open but body lifeless. I thought off all the times I had to clean such a mess up. I swung the door open and stumbled down the corridor, leaving bloody footprints behind me. I burst into Miss Lowdens office and was met by her startled, concerned gaze looking up from paperwork. Paul cut his own throat! Hes lying in his cell! Hes not moving! I blurted as I felt my knees tremble and saw my world grow blurry with tears. Calm down! Just calm down! Look at me! Mrs Lowden stood up and walked around her desk to stand in front of me. Its my fault... oh god, its all my fault! I felt my stability sinking through my fingers. You need to tell me what happened. She tried to sit me down. Pauls dead! I screamed before falling into the chair and sobbing into my forearms upon my lap. It mustve been more than a minute before I heard the words that would scramble my reality and tear apart any grasp I had of it. Well done, Paul. I looked up to see Miss Lowden smirking. A mix of pride and satisfaction was chiseled into her face. What? I felt the shake in my voice. Ive worked with a lot of patients suffering from split personality disorder, Paul, even some with schizophrenia too. Very few have made a breakthrough quite as significant as this. She put her hand on my shoulder. You should be proud of yourself, Paul. The word no gently rolled out of my mouth. I looked down at my shoes and trousers to realise that Pauls blood was gone. I leaned out of the doorway and saw no red footprints leading to where I stood, just a cleaner, a stranger, mopping the floors. Whats happening to me? Why are you calling me that? I staggered backwards until I was against Miss Lowdens wall. Youve made progress, Paul. This man, this other version of you was a dangerous part of your life. All your troubles resided in him. Just because he wasnt real for everyone doesnt mean he wasnt real for you. This couldnt have been real. It was too sick to be a joke but too awful to be a nightmare. I felt the past few years of my life spiral through my mind. I realised I couldnt remember the last time I was home. I walked back to Pauls room, Miss Lowden following, trying to explain further. There was no one inside. All the furniture was the way it was left. The way it was left by me. I remember sitting on the bed I thought was Pauls, and life just... kept moving. If you strung together every word I said in the month that followed, youd barely make a sentence out of it. I grimaced every time someone called me Paul for awhile. It was a few weeks before it felt like my name again. I slept very little in a room I didnt even know was mine. I spoke with Miss Lowden every day as she explained that the man I saw was a hallucination, a personification of a small but negative part of my mind. Other sufferers see several of their negative emotions in the forms of people and I was being evaluated further to be sure that Paul was alone. I came to learn that I hallucinated a lot of my time in the hospital. It wouldve been harmful to tell you. We could only help. Everything he did was a hallucination. Everything he did to you or you to him, you did to yourself. It was your back you were patting and your hand you were shaking. She told me this, making me shiver at the echoing memory of Pauls last request. Cut my wrists! I didnt tell anyone about that. All I wanted to do was get out of that hospital and I knew that would only cause further evaluation. It was just under three months when I was deemed stable enough to leave, and in a bizarre way, I didnt want to go without my friend. I went back to the home I used to share with my ex-wife and was reminded of the understanding Paul gave me. It was a bond Id never feel with anyone else. Apparently your mind is capable of tricking you into believing that youre in a much happier time whilst in complete turmoil. My mind didnt trick me into thinking I was still a cleaner, it tricked me into thinking things were still nice. I wondered if I ever was to find myself slowly sinking into the darkness within my thoughts again, would Paul come back? Would someone else appear? I still dream about walking with him in those corridors every night and replay all our conversations from the first to the last. I wake up retelling jokes and repeating advice I gave him. I always listen for his response. That Pauls gone now. Hes just a time in my life that Ill have to brush over when meeting new people and making new friends. Pauls gone, but something else isnt. When I sit up in bed, quoting my old self, I normally turn over to face the night again, but sometimes, I dont hear, but I feel a response. A little storm cloud growing above mind. A wreck unfolding. I recognise its words but its a different tone this time, and its getting louder. Getting realer. Hey, Mr Cleaner Man."
35,vulnerability,nosleep,The Marble Mountains,1,em7ygx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/em7ygx/the_marble_mountains/,2020-01-09 21:41:01,"Con nh i Ng Hnh Sn  ngy mai nha con, Daves mother instructed sternly. She pressed into his hands a page of beautifully handwritten Vietnamese script before turning to me. You follow, she warned. I nodded emphatically, hoping to break her gaze. She kept her eyes locked on mine just long enough to remind me how she had survived the war. With a sharp bow to the wooden altar before us, she hurried out into the cool of the late afternoon. Moving in to our new home had been smooth thanks to C Th and the rest of Daves family. Not only had we gotten everything transported and unpacked in a single morning, his uncle had even installed a Buddhist altar. His mom would return the next day with housewarming gifts from the out of town relatives. With the last of the family gone, we settled on the couch, finally able to relax. A stream of orange sunlight poured in through the window. Outside, among the rural houses and patches of wild grass, five limestone formations, the marble mountains, warmly glowed. Daves lips moved silently as he studied his mothers words. So, what was that all about? I asked. Being together so long, I could tell when his mothers fussing was serious. She was reminding me about the spirits that look out for us. This altar is for the local god who watches over this area, he answered. So, hes like a regional manager? I said sarcastically. Normally quick to laugh, Daves stony expression matched his mothers. No. People have prayed to this god for thousands of years. It protects them, and it will protect us, he replied, clearly a little annoyed. I didnt mean to be disrespectful, I apologized. But what is it protecting us from exactly? This is an old area with tons of history. I dont believe in all the folktales like my mom, but I think things stick around sometimes. This will keep us safe, he explained, presenting the note as he spoke. My mom wrote down a ritual for us to perform tomorrow. Since we are the new householders, we have to invite the local god into our home for our protection. In the morning, I want you to come with me to visit the monks living in the marble mountains. They will give us what we need for the ritual. Despite my skepticism, I did not want to dismiss something Dave took so seriously. I was actually getting curious, so I agreed to take part. He put his arm around me, visibly relieved, and we cuddled on the couch. As the sun slipped below the marble mountains, the ray of light spilling across our living room disappeared, swallowed up by the cool stone floor. A tinny reveille blasted from a government megaphone woke me at daybreak. Groggily, I rolled over and shook Dave. I had lived in Asia for years but had never adjusted to noise like a local. With it impossible to fall back asleep, we got ready early and walked the few blocks to the monastery. Passing crowing roosters and scavenging dogs on the way, the communist music in the background faded into unintelligible announcements. We approached the mountains base and passed through its cool shadow, the musty smell of porous rock hanging in the air. As the sun rose, a chilly wind off the nearby Pacific was picking up, drawing in clouds. The caves entrance was already filling with tourists, and Dave took my hand. We weaved through the crowd to a wall on the far side. Roped off from the public, a narrow stone passage penetrated the rockface. Stepping over the barrier with ease, he turned back to flash me a grin, and I reluctantly followed him into the mountain. Immediately, the sickly-sweet stench of burning flesh flooded my nostrils. I covered my mouth with my hand to filter the smog. Visibility, already poor in the dim light, worsened as we advanced into the haze. Waves of warm nausea mounted, and I quickened my pace to get through the tunnel. With a thud, I knocked into Dave, who had abruptly stopped. Confused, I looked up and realized the problem. The tunnel split into a T-junction, both ways winding into uncertainty. Well, which way is it? I said through my sleeve-covered mouth. My mom didnt mention any turns he answered. Okay, either we just take one or go back. Im getting sick, I replied in frustration. With a hopeless shrug, Dave went to the right. The haze lingered, but its smell faded into the musky sweetness of eastern incense. I relaxed my grip on Daves hand as the soft tones of Buddhist chant emanated from down the passage. We sure got lucky, I murmured. We made a turn, and Daves response went unsaid, his words drawn into the cavernous monastery before us. Every surface of this spacious chamber, from the walls to the lofty dome, was one continuous work of art. Sculpted into the natural marble of the cave, intricate figures beyond imagination manifested the All. An imperious god stood at the entrance, his innumerable arms a fractal pattern that multiplied in all directions. Incarnations of Buddha intertwined with mythical kings throughout the geometric design. Etched high into the dome, an immense dragon of devastating grandeur soared, each claw, each scale, painstakingly unique. A quiet voice broke our awe. A monk, clad in orange robes and a black sash, approached, his eyes a deep sea of contentment. Hastily removing his shoes, Dave stepped past the threshold and greeted the monk, and he gestured to the antechamber behind him. Never knowing what to do in these situations, I timidly waved Dave on and continued to marvel at the masterpiece. I recognized the traditional Buddhist deities, but one figure eluded me, the god towering over the monasterys entrance. Standing upon some sort of cage, his face was contorted in a grotesque expression. His third eye bulged out, tightly shut, and a pair of fangs, nearly imperceptible, rested on his bottom lip. Okay, we got everything, came Daves voice. Snapping out of my self-induced creep out, I turned to Dave, who was awkwardly slipping his shoes back on while holding a black chest. That was quick. Whats in it? I questioned. A few artifacts. The most important thing is the urn. Its filled with ashes from centuries of this monasterys incense burning, he revealed, pointing above the antechamber. Difficult to make out in the low light, two cylinders rose up from the roof of the antechamber, and orange motes of ash flickered out like fireflies. I stopped myself from commenting; the monk was watching us. He gave an enigmatic tap to his forehead as Dave bowed in farewell. After a nudge, I too bowed, though neither the monk nor I broke eye contact until we turned to leave. An intermittent drizzle had started on our way back, common for that time of year. Though the chest was well-crafted, we briskly walked home. Dave placed the chest on the table next to the altar, flipped open the latches, and opened it up. Picking up a yellowed index card, he announced, We really are lucky. The monk said my moms ritual is for owning a new house. Since were renting, its a lot shorter. Thunder rolled in the sky. Internally, I wondered why a god would care, but I brushed it aside as Dave set up the altar. Pulling a stick of incense from the bundle, he stuck it into the urn at the center of the altar, placing a platter of fruits and a stack of fake money to either side. Two ceramic cups, like little shot glasses, took front and center. Now for the other stuff, he thought aloud. Emptying the box of the remaining items, he organized a pair of scissors, a golden bell, and a dish of rice wine on the table. Rain tapped against the window as Dave took the note card and explained my role. I was following along, the process seeming straight forward, until he got to the scissors. You have to cut our hair? I asked incredulously. Yes, one offering must be personal to us, he insisted. It helps the god make the connection to our home. The thunderstorm rumbling outside did little to comfort me, but I had no logical reason to be suspicious. I looked into my boyfriends eyes. I trusted him, and we began. We stood side-by-side before the altar and placed our hands together in prayer. After three deep bows, Dave approached the altar, reciting a line of chant while lighting the incense. As the aroma filled the room, I stepped forward and flicked the bell a single time, releasing a resonant peal. Once it had faded into silence, Dave began the next line of chant. I filled each cup with rice wine and dipped a finger into it. After pressing it against my forehead and Daves, I gave the bell a second ring. Dave took the scissors, chanting while he snipped a lock of hair from each of us and placed it into our cups. With three final bows, I finished the ritual with a flick of the bell. It didnt ring. A deadened clank tolled from the bell, evoking a brief tremor from within the stone foundation of the house. The temperature sank, and a sense of vulnerability prickled over my skin; I felt like the unsuspecting prey hunted in an open field. Unwilling to move, I turned my head an inch to catch Dave in the corner of my eye. Above his terrified expression, a trail of blood oozed from the smudge I had made on his forehead. My attention snapped to the front door. Packages fell from her arms, and Daves mother stared at us quizzically from the entryway, rain dripping from her jacket. She flew to her son, frantically interrogating him. He stuttered a garbled flurry of words. With a frenzied lunge, she snatched the foul urn and hurled it out into the street. Shattering into a cloud of dust, the downpour swiftly extinguished the incense. As rain water carried away the ashes, fragments of bone appeared among the bits of ceramic. Without hesitation, Dave assisted his mother in launching the tainted altar into the trash pit across the street. I stood, stupefied, as they ravaged the altar, returning to the house only once every cursed artifact was destroyed. Dave and his mother joined me on the couch, too exhausted to dry off. Regaining his composure, Dave recounted our experience to his mother, her eyes narrowing at his depiction of the monk. Pressing for details, he pried for an explanation. She replied ambiguously that all things exist in duality, unwilling to verify the bones or acknowledge the existence of a crematorium. As she stood to depart, we were left with many unanswered questions, but she reassured us that the destruction of the altar severed the gods link to our home. With her years of experience in Buddhism, I am sure she is right about that. Each night since has been peaceful, but I can see it at the bottom of the stairs, a hulking black figure. Its myriad arms writhe. It strains, expression twisted, to open its protruding third eye, and its getting closer. His mom is right. We didnt invite a god into our home. We invited a demon."
36,vulnerability,nosleep,The Last Midnight Run,1,ens34q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ens34q/the_last_midnight_run/,2020-01-13 06:32:02,"Above me is the great canopy of space, dotted by innumerable blazing stars clustered together in their all-too-familiar patterns. The wind is glacial cold, swirling around me, dragging dry rags of refuse along the cracked tarmac. A dog barks from behind a chain-link fence, cutting through the thick silence, and my heart leaps to my throat in shock. Hand to my heaving, bleeding chest, a quick nervous laugh bursts from my lips. It quickly fades away with the wind. The dog scratches at the fence lazily before curling up into a grey shadow with a wide, toothy yawn. One step quickly followed by another, I resume my jog with a sliver of reluctance. Ahead, the amber glow of streetlights blink into existence; like a runway for joggers they guide my way. Seething against their wavering yellow circles is the darkness. Like the stars, it isn't so much as a blanket but a series of clusters, bundles and groups sliding over one another in the silent orchestra of the night. I see that now, and it is beautiful. There are faces there, pale and open, rubbing and pulling at each other as they press against the edges of darkness. I pay them no mind. Twisted into my ears are cheap, ill-fitting earbuds. They dont play music; the wire ends dangling at my hip. Instead I hear every empty promise I made, every rash word made in the heat of the moment and regretted in the cold of the night. I feel myself running in rhythm to the memories. Trees curl up from garden walls, tiny shards of starlight beaming through the rustling leaves. The empty eyes of windows watch me run, occasionally illuminated by a plethora of lightbulbs. I see a man, fat and balding, slouched in an armchair with the eery glow of the television casting sharp angles across his face. He's wearing a jersey two sizes too small and as I turn the corner, he leaps from the chair with surprising speed, his paw-like hands clasped to his temples, his watery eyes wide and angry in disbelief. Even from this distance, I hear the drunken slur in his voice as he rants relentlessly at the referee. I stopped then, not because I was out of breath - never again - but a force compelled me too. I see the man fall to the floor, seemingly folding in on himself, one hand clutching at his chest while the other flails around desperately for purchase. As he twists, his eyes alight on me and widen in fear. I wait another moment, to see what happens next. Theres something different playing on the tv now, something is reaching out for him. I regret being so morbidly curious, shaking the distraction from my mind as I resume my jog. The fleeting image of the man being dragged disappears behind a red-brick wall, chipped and scuffed with age and neglect. Greeting me at the end of the road is the livid red eye of the traffic light, impatiently waiting for the stray car to stall before it. Now that I'm away from natures mufflers, the bleeps, ticks and hums of late night traffic wash over me, coating my senses. Businessmen with bleary eyes cradle styrofoam cups of coffee in their grey cars, fingers flying over their carphones as they talked to the listening air. Taxis lug their drunken passengers back to their worried families. Truckers loom over the rest like an almighty god, arms slung out the window with the glowing stubs of cigarettes wedged between hairy fingers. Thrown into the mix is one or two police cruisers, the occupants leaning over their complicated dashboards with eyes sharp with suspicion. In the back of one cruiser is a man in a blue jumper. He notices me surprisingly. I nod at him, and after a nerve-shreddingly long moment, he nods back at me. The light descends into green and he slides away from view. I quicken my pace. The floor rises from underneath me and I falter momentarily as I realign myself to this new course. My runners slap crisply against the smooth concrete beneath, a steady ovation of applause accompanying every footfall. Across from me now is a training field, haphazardly cut and currently occupied. With white light glaring down at them, men the size and shape of tanks weave around neon orange plastic cones while the coach barks orders at them from the sidelines. A black, sleek sedan whizzes past and honks at him. Without turning around, he waves at the car in acknowledgment. I consider to stop and watch for awhile, something to break the dull cycle I had fallen victim to. My legs, however, wouldn't allow any more rest and so, I jogged on. I veer off the footpath, down onto the uneven cobbles beside the canal. Lily pads and wet fronds choke the waters in slick green and theres many a minute disturbance on the surface as fish or frogs shyly poke out and disappear under watchful eyes. Ahead, the River Walk cuts its away across and I feel myself forced to jog down its route. I am being guided, not by my feet, but by something too old for a name. Its too late for any living soul to walk down this path. Even the faces in the darkness have turned away. Im too focused on the flapping of my feet to notice a presence sidle up beside me, slowing down to match my speed. How long it was there, I dont know, but eventually it ringed its bell impatiently. Conditioned to move away, I do so, not realising how worthless that gesture would be in my current state, and not realising that nothing normal should be able to see me anymore. The Cyclist whips past me, one eye almost popping out of its socket as it sizes me up. I falter, afraid, considering turning around and running as fast as I could muster. The eye shrank back, and the Cyclist turns his attention away from me, pressing hard on his pedals and finally disappearing around the corner. Clearly not interested in leftovers. A tight ball has now lodged itself between my rib-cage and what equates as my breathing is shallow and rapid. I goad myself to go further, be better but my body is quickly beginning to unravel. I stumble, once, twice and then I stop. Hands pressed firm against my knees, I pull in long gasps of cool, night air; an unnecessary ritual too ingrained in my mind to let go of. The taste is different than it is at day. In the morning it had the tendency to miss your mouth or nose, instead tousling your hair into your eyes or wrapping its freezing coils around your neck. Towards the afternoon it congeals into a hot, sticky syrup that pours sweat down your back and transforms your legs into wobbling stacks of jelly. When evening approaches, it's almost as if it no longer exists. Maybe once or twice it brushes shyly against your cheek but, for the most part, it's simply not there. When the stars peek out, and when the moon clambers up to its summit, that is when the air brings with it a terrifying, invigorating chill. For the night is when the air tastes sharp and tangy. It is also at night when the ghouls and ghosts are concealed behind the darkness, always coiled and ready to leap out on unsuspecting joggers like myself. I straighten and wince as my spine pops back into place. I ask myself: should I keep going just for a little bit longer, or should I turn back and head towards my empty home? One foot points ahead, the other points back. In the pale moonlight, under the scrutiny of the stars, I weigh the options in my head. If I go on, something inside me will break. Im reaching the end of my tether, and once it breaks Ill be frail enough to be carried in a strong breeze, leaving only my voice in the wind. Up ahead the darkness is thick and palpable, watching me hungrily. I was promised one last night to be who I used to be. The faces had no right to look at me like that, to make me feel at risk. Maybe they werent aware of the arrangement, or maybe the Other Party werent entirely honest with me. Further is the future, and its full of dangers and risks. I could be nothing but a whisper. Or I could be free. If I go back, there will be nothing waiting for me, save for a pot of cold pasta, green and mouldy, stuffed into the fridge. The lights will need to be switched on, and I will be exposed in all my vulnerability. The home-phone is disconnected, most of the chairs have never been sat on, and there's a thick film of dust over the carpet. Upstairs the rest of me lies rotting in bed. In life I rarely smiled but now its all I ever do. If I put one foot in that house, Ill be relegated to looking through those withered eyes, waiting for someone to find me. Waiting to be free. My mind has been set and my feet both point in one direction. I jog on."
37,vulnerability,nosleep,The nicest man I ever met was in a mental health hospital.,1,eotjrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eotjrg/the_nicest_man_i_ever_met_was_in_a_mental_health/,2020-01-15 10:27:18,"No demonic tale on the shelf of a library can match the horrors of mental health. No ghost story from a friend of a friend can recreate the terror your own mind resenting you causes. I worked between those walls for two years. If I had done so for twenty more, I still wouldnt have gotten used to it. Mental health hospitals arent a place to go when you need to get better, just a place you go when you cant get any worse. A building of people who cant get any worse. Being the cleaner meant I didnt have to deal with the patients much. Id greet them whilst passing in the corridors and even make pleasant, ordinary small talk with some of the more social ones. They were the ones who surprised you when you were mopping up their blood the following morning after they made an attempt on their life. When thats your job, it takes awhile to realise that the man in the corner isnt a lunatic and the one you pass on the stairs isnt a psychopath. Theyre just like the man with the mop or the woman in the office. We dont choose our bodies and nor do we our minds. Paul taught me this. I was only a few weeks into my job when I met Paul. I was using my mop to push the bucket back to the storage room when I heard him. Hey, Mr Cleaner Man! I turned around to see a pudgy, bald, middle-aged man jogging towards me. He was slightly out of breath by the time he reached me. Despite his many tattoos, faintly visible through his white t-shirt and winding around his arms, he gave off no air of intimidation. Mind if I walk with you a while, Mr Cleaner Man? There was a childlike innocence in him when he spoke. He was a few inches smaller than me and had to look up slightly to make eye contact. I thought I should feel threatened, but he didnt seem to want a fight. Not with me, or worse, himself. He just stared through the suspense, waiting for my response. Yeah, sure. Im only going to the storage room. A brief look of excitement filled his face for a second before suppressing it and setting off beside me. I was almost paranoid by how friendly he was. He wanted to know about my day and told me about his. He asked me what I liked to do outside of work and I asked him what he liked about the clinic. Not all that much. We laughed as we arrived at the storage room. He thanked me for letting him tag along as I threw the mop into the corner. We shook hands before parting ways. Im Paul, by the way. You seem like a nice fella, Mr Cleaner Man. His words seemed completely transparent. There was no motive hiding behind him. Just a man, happy to be conversing. I found myself walking with Paul daily. We only saw each other during my minute-long journey to the storage room, but it never felt too short to have real conversation. I found out that Paul worked in a warehouse before having a mental breakdown in the midst of his divorce. The councillors tell him he cant leave whilst harbouring the risk of another suicide attempt. The worst part of the whole situation is how painfully aware Paul was of the wreck unfolding in his brain. I found a way of asking him how walking with a cleaner for barely sixty seconds effects the storm cloud above his mind. It saddened me to see his head droop as the usual, bubbling enthusiasm in his face grew still and cold. When I first met my wife, Ex-wife, I was a cleaner. Things were still nice then. If I can just walk with you for a minute whilst you hold that mop, I can pretend that theyre my hands keeping these floors clean, and at the end of the night, I can pretend that theyre my hands opening the doors to go back home to when... things were still nice. I felt my heart grow heavy as my brain rummaged, looking for words to say. No breakdown, mess or human under that hospital roof could express the loneliness in what had just left Pauls mouth. Paul, I.... The bubbling enthusiasm jumped back into his eyes. Dont let me depress you, Mr Cleaner Man. We dont talk long enough to spend our time sad! He firmly patted my back whilst hiding the sadness that simmered under his joyful, temporary facade. I liked Paul. I dont go out much and I dont even enjoy talking on the phone, but I never felt a conversation flow so freely than when it was with him. He was the weird kid in school you took under your wing to later realise their goldmine of a personality. After the first week we could ask about each others family members by name. After the first month we could mention important times in each others lives by the date. After a year, I saw him as a work friend. The best one Id met. He knew my name after the first day, but he still liked to call me Mr Cleaner Man. The only things I did in that hospital were exactly what I was told and talk to Paul, so when one of the councillors asked to see me, I had an idea of what it was about. Just take a seat here for me. Miss Lowden was a well dressed woman in her mid-fifties. She pulled up a chair for me and placed it by her desk. I felt I was receiving bad news at a doctors appointment. Now, I wont keep you too long. I just feel its important to address your relationships within this facility. She thought carefully and spoke slowly, almost as if she had no idea what word should come after the previous. I know what this is about, Miss Lowden, and I understand the concern, but me and Paul just talk. Nothing funny. My response lingered in the air as she processed what I just said. Paul... she continued, mentioning Pauls name like it was in a language she didnt speak. ... we feel is a part of your life that wont benefit you. You understand? My face mustve told her that I really didnt. Paul will likely lead to you making bad decisions. He may be a nice addition to your time here at the moment, but in the long run, wed dread to think of him bringing harm to you. Wow. I was surprised and saddened by the fact that even a councillor couldnt separate a troubled man from a dangerous one, but there we were. I completely understand, Miss. Ill be sure to keep this in mind from now on. Both were lies, but I had no interest in hearing what else she had to say. She didnt know Paul. I did. Well check up on your progress now and then to be sure further assistance isnt required. I left the room almost offended, knowing Id speak to Paul the next day. Mrs Lowden must have heard us talking from her office as we headed to the storage room before, so I made sure I took my time mopping the floor outside of Pauls room instead. What? Why would she think that? Ive never hurt anyone in here! I hated seeing such offence take over Pauls face. Stay inside your room. Ill talk from out here. I murmured as I continued mopping the floor to disguise our conversation. Theyre control freaks, Paul. They enjoy telling us what to do. I need this job, but not for them to decide my friends. I continued. Pauls face lit up in a small glow of pride at my use of the word friend. It was the first time Id called him one to his face. The glow suddenly dimmed into an emotion Id never seen within him before: pure anger. How can that bitch be so cruel? She deserves to be in here, not me! I watched him pace his room with his arms folded tightly. I quietly matched his rage. I saw the exact second an idea locked itself into Pauls brain. He froze before throwing his stare in my direction, smirking in excitement. Ive got it. Ive got it, Mr Cleaner Man! I wouldve matched his enthusiasm too if there wasnt a slight tinge or fear entwined with my anticipation. He turned to face me, taking a step closer. Cut my wrists! I prayed to find a sliver of humour in his eyes. What? How would that help anything? I noticed Id stopped mopping in my shock. Nothing will happen if I complain about Miss Lowden in here. Shell only find out. If I show you how to cut my wrists and make it look bad, Ill be taken to A&amp;E. Theyll listen there! His eyes told me that he genuinely believed what he was saying. Paul, this is ridiculous! Why do you need me to do it? Because I trust you, Mr Cleaner Man. Much more than myself. I didnt discard his words to be those of madness, but rather desperation. Im not going to hurt you, Paul. Im sorry. Ill come back and see you soon. Dont do anything stupid! I pointed at him like a teacher scolding a child. I stabbed the bucket with my mop and set off down the corridor. It felt strange not having him beside me. Think about it, Mr Cleaner Man! We could take her down together! The words echoed from his room as I stared ahead, begging that the double doors serval yards in front of me would come sooner. Im almost ashamed to say that I spent the next few weeks avoiding Paul. Id tiptoe whilst passing his room and I deliberately changed my cleaning routine to avoid an encounter. Miss Lowden called me into her office a few times during that period, but only for me to say things were going well then be dismissed by her. I wasnt scared of Paul, just concerned about how our friendship effected him. It was just over two weeks when I found the courage to talk to him again. My plan was to clean outside his room early in the morning and wait until he woke up. My plan didnt go well. I was hardly by his door when it opened a few inches and a hand shot out, grabbing me by the collar and dragging me inside. I regained my balance to see Paul stood there, excitement consuming his presence as he hid his hands behind his back. Hey... Paul.... Howre you doing? I felt my vulnerability prepare me to run if needed. I have it, Mr Cleaner Man. I have it! Look! Paul revealed a thin, sharp, plastic object from behind his back. No bigger than 6 inches with a light green and dark blue design swirling up it. What have you done, Paul? I felt my shoulders hunch and my head lower as I instinctively leaned back. Not bad, is it? It was a toothbrush. I was up all night, sharpening it against the walls. Remember the plan I had? He spoke as if I wasnt completely against the idea just weeks ago. He held out the toothbrush with one hand for me to grab, followed by the other with his wrist exposed. Do it, Mr Cleaner Man. Its the right thing to do. He began edging towards me. Stop it, Paul. Just let me get back to work. Closer. Well look back in pride. You know you have to, Mr Cleaner Man. Closer. He grabbed my hand and tried to wrap it around the toothbrush. I tugged him towards me and began wrestling him for the sharp object. I could hear were the squeaks of our shoes against the floor and the grunts as I tried to both gain control of the homemade knife and keep it away from both our torsos and throats. I forced Paul to the floor, only to have him put his foot against my stomach and kick me away. I fell back against the closed door as Paul used the walls to scramble to his feet, still armed with the weapon. We were so close, Mr Cleaner Man. Now youll have to wait until next time. Goodbye, Paul. He placed the sharp end of the tooth brush just below his left ear before forcing it into his flesh and slicing to his right. Paul! Stop! Blood sprayed across the room, leaving splatters on my trousers and shoes. He fell backwards against the wall and slid back to the ground, his eyes open but body lifeless. I thought off all the times I had to clean such a mess up. I swung the door open and stumbled down the corridor, leaving bloody footprints behind me. I burst into Miss Lowdens office and was met by her startled, concerned gaze looking up from paperwork. Paul cut his own throat! Hes lying in his cell! Hes not moving! I blurted as I felt my knees tremble and saw my world grow blurry with tears. Calm down! Just calm down! Look at me! Mrs Lowden stood up and walked around her desk to stand in front of me. Its my fault... oh god, its all my fault! I felt my stability sinking through my fingers. You need to tell me what happened. She tried to sit me down. Pauls dead! I screamed before falling into the chair and sobbing into my forearms upon my lap. It mustve been more than a minute before I heard the words that would scramble my reality and tear apart any grasp I had of it. Well done, Paul. I looked up to see Miss Lowden smirking. A mix of pride and satisfaction was chiseled into her face. What? I felt the shake in my voice. Ive worked with a lot of patients suffering from split personality disorder, Paul, even some with schizophrenia too. Very few have made a breakthrough quite as significant as this. She put her hand on my shoulder. You should be proud of yourself, Paul. The word no gently rolled out of my mouth. I looked down at my shoes and trousers to realise that Pauls blood was gone. I leaned out of the doorway and saw no red footprints leading to where I stood, just a cleaner, a stranger, mopping the floors. Whats happening to me? Why are you calling me that? I staggered backwards until I was against Miss Lowdens wall. Youve made progress, Paul. This man, this other version of you was a dangerous part of your life. All your troubles resided in him. Just because he wasnt real for everyone doesnt mean he wasnt real for you. This couldnt have been real. It was too sick to be a joke but too awful to be a nightmare. I felt the past few years of my life spiral through my mind. I realised I couldnt remember the last time I was home. I walked back to Pauls room, Miss Lowden following, trying to explain further. There was no one inside. All the furniture was the way it was left. The way it was left by me. I remember sitting on the bed I thought was Pauls, and life just... kept moving. If you strung together every word I said in the month that followed, youd barely make a sentence out of it. I grimaced every time someone called me Paul for awhile. It was a few weeks before it felt like my name again. I slept very little in a room I didnt even know was mine. I spoke with Miss Lowden every day as she explained that the man I saw was a hallucination, a personification of a small but negative part of my mind. Other sufferers see several of their negative emotions in the forms of people and I was being evaluated further to be sure that Paul was alone. I came to learn that I hallucinated a lot of my time in the hospital. It wouldve been harmful to tell you. We could only help. Everything he did was a hallucination. Everything he did to you or you to him, you did to yourself. It was your back you were patting and your hand you were shaking. She told me this, making me shiver at the echoing memory of Pauls last request. Cut my wrists! I didnt tell anyone about that. All I wanted to do was get out of that hospital and I knew that would only cause further evaluation. It was just under three months when I was deemed stable enough to leave, and in a bizarre way, I didnt want to go without my friend. I went back to the home I used to share with my ex-wife and was reminded of the understanding Paul gave me. It was a bond Id never feel with anyone else. Apparently your mind is capable of tricking you into believing that youre in a much happier time whilst in complete turmoil. My mind didnt trick me into thinking I was still a cleaner, it tricked me into thinking things were still nice. I wondered if I ever was to find myself slowly sinking into the darkness within my thoughts again, would Paul come back? Would someone else appear? I still dream about walking with him in those corridors every night and replay all our conversations from the first to the last. I wake up retelling jokes and repeating advice I gave him. I always listen for his response. That Pauls gone now. Hes just a time in my life that Ill have to brush over when meeting new people and making new friends. Pauls gone, but something else isnt. When I sit up in bed, quoting my old self, I normally turn over to face the night again, but sometimes, I dont hear, but I feel a response. A little storm cloud growing above mind. A wreck unfolding. I recognise its words but its a different tone this time, and its getting louder. Getting realer. Hey, Mr Cleaner Man."

My Kid Summoned A Demon, And Things Are Getting More Emotional Than Id Like",1,epyjyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/epyjyn/5_my_kid_summoned_a_demon_and_things_are_getting/,2020-01-17 21:14:29,"Part 4: [URL You want me to do what now? I was floored. I hadnt known what to expect when Seth appeared, but this didnt even make the list. Not even close. Seth snarled, Did he fuckin stutter? Lucas flinched at the venom in his voice. Woah, woah! Whats going on? Whats Katie done this time? Seras tone was light. Lucas jumped at her sudden appearance. Sebastian shot her a warning glance. Seth literally growled, low in his throat. We all took a wary step back, except Lucas. He looked at Seth with sympathy. That kid was too kind hearted for his own good. What has she done? Oh, its good this time, Sera. Seth was still snarling. Apparently, we love torturing souls. Apparently, were evil things. Apparently, we destroyed Katies life because it amused us. Sera giggled, then stopped when she realised Sebastian was staring at the floor. She looked from him, to Seth, to me. I didnt meet her eye. Whats he talking about, Katie? She sounded confused. I closed my eyes for moment, then decided on anger. Id kept my anger strictly in check since becoming a mum. I was (almost) infinitely patient with Lucas. But my old friends turning up? Lets say that shortened my fuse somewhat. And yes, anger is a secondary emotion blah blah blah, but in that moment, it felt good to unleash the past sixteen years of frustrations and, I can admit it now but you couldnt have tortured it out of me in that moment, loneliness. You know what? I spat. Yes. Hes right. You all took my childhood. I was just a kid. So fuck you. Fuck you all. I know shit no human should know, and now my son does too. And for what? A goddam soul heist? Are you fucking kidding me? You must enjoy torturing people to drag someone out of Heaven. MUM! Lucas was horrified. How can you say that, after hearing what these guys went through? Yeah, that took some of the wind out of my sails. My kid had never had the moral high ground on me before. Sera blinked, then addressed her brothers in a hurt, disbelieving tone. You told them? Tell me you didnt tell them about her. Sebine? Yes, Sera, they told us everythingoof. Sera threw Lucas across the room, and started to grow larger. SILENCE, whelp! She turned on her brothers. How could you! Seth started to loom as well. The kid needs to understand, Sera! Hey! You dont get to talk about my kid! Seth shot me a venomous glance, and I found myself flung across the room as well. Sebastian stepped between his siblings. Maybe Hell was freezing over, I mused to myself. Sebby being the rational one, and Sera raging- I guess anything was possible. Guys, calm down. Seth is right, Sera. The kid needed to know. And Katie Honestly I dont think Katie knows what she means to us. Seth roared and started throwing punches. So did Sera. Sebastian did the looming thing too, probably to avoid getting his arse handed to him by his now huge siblings, and fought back. Demons arent great at conflict management. In a rare moment of self- reflection, I admitted to myself that that might explain some of my less attractive personality traits. Maybe. Lucas started to get to his feet. I grabbed his arm and whispered urgently, not now, kid! They cant kill us anymore, but they can still hurt us. Let them blow off some steam. Lucas looked at me with an expression hed never pointed at me before- profound disappointment. He shrugged off my hand, took a deep breath, and roared, STOP! I leapt to me feet, prepared to shelter my son as much as I could, but to my utmost surprise, they stopped. They all stopped looming, rolled their shoulders, shifted their feet and looked at the general vicinity of my sons feet. Sera! Lucas voice rang with authority. Id never heard him speak like that. Yes, your brothers told us some uncomfortable shit that happened thousands of years ago. For some reason, they think I need to understand all that crap. I dont know why they think that, but hey, Im pretty sure Ive got a reasonable understanding of how Hell works now. Yay me! And from the way mum looked while they were telling the story, she understands better now too. Seth! Mum obviously loves your guts. If she doesnt get how you guys feel about her, maybe you should try to explain better. Not everyone speaks violence and mortal danger as a love language. Sebastian! He paused, and took in all of our dumbfounded faces. Actually, Ive got nothing for you. But if you wouldnt mind scratching my back, my shoulder blades are so bloody itchy. Sebastian complied almost dreamily. I burst out laughing. My son glared at me, and said, you need to stop. Apparently Seth risked everything to come to us. So how about instead of telling them to fuck off, you find out details of WHY they want us to do this. Watch your language, kid. Yeah, my parenting game wasnt strong today. Sebastian looked from me to Lucas, and started chuckling. Soon, he was roaring with laughter. Lucas and I were confused. Sebastian wiped tears from his eyes and, still chuckling, said, Im sorry. Pause for more laughter. Its just, hes sooo much like you Katie. So much. Despite themselves, Seth and Sera started to grudgingly giggle. I tried to be outraged, but ended up laughing along. Sera wiped her eyes, and said in a rare moment of vulnerability for her, Ok. Point taken, kid. But we dont ever need to talk about what happened again. She unconsciously flexed her gloved hand. I she paused, and drew a shuddering breath. I lost my sister. I almost lost my big brother. When Seth was carrying me across that field, I didnt think I would make it. Seth gave her a quick squeeze, before saying, Yeah, ok. Maybe I never said out loud how I feel about you, Katie. I guess I always thought you knew. I mean, you know I always wanted to get you in the sack. He smirked. I blushed. He didnt often catch me off guard, but I wasnt ready for that one. WOAH WOAH WOAH! Thats my mother, dude! Lucas looked outraged. Seth laughed at him as he rubbed his wrist. Sorry, kid. Seriously though, Katie He trailed off as he looked at me, hurt and vulnerability plastered on his face. He dropped his eyes and mumbled, I love you, you crazy bitch. Just like a sister. He exhaled hard. His siblings both drew a sharp breath and very pointedly didnt look at me. You know how sometimes, you can feel the weight of a moment, know how important it is to someone, but have absolutely no clue how to not fuck it up? All I could think in that moment was how glad I was hed never said that to me before. It held a LOT more weight now that I knew the story of Sebine. I definitely wouldve fucked this up in the past. I, wisely (I think) decided against saying anything and threw myself into his arms. We hardly ever hugged, Seth and me. We sparred, we wrestled, but there had always been a distance between us. Id hugged Sebastian often, and every now and then fallen asleep by the campfire cuddled up to Seras more aloof form, but mostly not Seth. We just didnt work that way. Dont get me wrong, Id considered him to be my closest friend, we just werent touchy feely. It was Seth I had spoken to first when Id found out I was pregnant with Lucas. I felt tears flowing down my face. I still had reservations about how the demons truly felt about me. (Whats that you say? Trust issues? Dont know what youre talking about.) But there had been a few occasions today where I was sure Id lost him for good, both literally and figuratively, and damn if it didnt feel incredible to have him back. I drew back, wiped my eyes, and trailed the back of my hand along his face. And that, dear one, is the closest youre getting to fucking me. MUM!! Everyone laughed at Lucas. He scowled back. I went over and tousled his hair. Sorry, kid. His scowl didnt lessen. Sebastian looked around, and said almost wonderingly, Guys. We need to take a minute here. Why? We were all curious, but Sera asked the question. Because, for the first timeever you two have been overemotional and had to apologise, and I didnt. Lucas and I laughed. Seth and Sera didnt. Im sure their lips twitched, though. I do need to ask you something though, Katie, while were being honest and touchy feely. Mmm? I was wary. How many Familiars do you think we have? I blinked. I dunno. Youve said before it was pretty rare. Um, maybe a hundred or so? Honestly I thought itd be higher. Surely there were plenty of peoplelike me whatever that meant. The demons faces were unreadable. Sera replied flatly, Currently, we have one. Youre the second. Hang on, theres only me and one other Familiar at the moment?! I was shocked. Sebastian clarified, Theres only you at the moment. Theres only been one other in human history. I was dumbfounded. Told you you were special. Seth smiled briefly at me. Id always thought they were just trying to flatter me. Guess I shouldve known they were telling the truth. Hell if I knew what made me special, though. Right. Sera rubbed her hands together. Enough with the circle jerk. Lets get moving. Katie, I brought you some clothes. Whats wrong with what Im wearing? I was indignant. She gave me a level stare. I REFUSE to challenge the very authority of Heaven with a chick wearing yoga pants. Get changed. Boys, out here. She spun and walked out the door. Authority suited her. They all followed her without so much as a quip. I opened the bag shed brought, and decided she was right. This outfit was much more suited for storming Heaven. I squirmed into the leather pants and vest, and looked around for my knives. And shoes. Hey Sera? I called out. Am I storming Heaven barefoot? You decent? She asked through the door. Automatically I replied, No, but I am dressed. She chuckled as they all filed back in. She looked through the bag, then grimaced. Sorry, forgot the shoes. Back in a sec. And she was gone. The guys were all staring at me, my son the most wide eyed. What? I snapped self-consciously. Did I put the top on backwards or something? I twisted around, examining my clothes. Nope. Thats perfect. Youve um Sebastian sounded distracted. Filled the fuck out! Damn, girl! Seth eyed me up and down. Without even looking at him, Lucas raised his hand and pressed his finger with the iron ring against Seths face. Thats still my mum. Stop drooling. Seth leapt back, and laughed, rubbing his face. Fair enough, kid. Respectfully though Katie, you do look good. Really fucking good. Im not sure respectful was a behaviour Seth could ever pull off, but he tried I guess. Luckily Sera arrived with my boots before Seth pissed my kid off any more. Oh. Oh my. I took the boots from her and cradled them lovingly. Oh my goodness. Wow. They were beautiful. Knee high, soft supple leather. A sturdy, flexible sole with a short heel, just the way I liked. They laced up, and there were sheaths hidden on the inside for knives. I couldnt help it. I rubbed my face against them as I wandered over to the bed to put them on. I slid my foot into the first, and wriggled a bit with pleasure at how comfortable they felt. I put the second one on, and stood up, stamping my feet and wandering around, absolutely engrossed with them. I love boots. MUM?! Yes, darling? I answered distractedly. I cant say for sure if that was the first time hed called me. Mum! Are you ok?! Of course. Look at my shoes! I ran across the room. You know, to test them out. Are theylike spelled or something? Whats wrong with her? Lucas sounded a little panicked as he addressed the demons. Sebastian chuckled indulgently. Your mum just really loves shoes, kid. Ive never seen her act like this before! Ive never had shoes this awesome around you before, kiddo. I hugged Sera tight. Thank you! Youre welcome. Stop touching me now. Get your knives, lets get moving. She said gruffly. I took a breath and composed myself, and looked around for my knives. (I can neither confirm nor deny that I kept wriggling my toes in delight.) Seth pointed out my case leaning against a wall, looking at me exasperatedly. I grinned at him, grabbed my case, and started secreting knives all over my body. Sera had outdone herself. There were sheaths built into the clothes in all my favourite spots to hide knives. Two in each boot; larger, more obvious ones on the outside, smaller on the inside. On the outside of my thigh. On my hips, like small swords. In the small of my back for my favourite double bladed one. On my shoulders. Sets of small throwing knives on the outside of my arms. I quickly wove my hair into a Lara Croft-ish braid, and hid my final knife within it. The hilt sticking out looked like a hair clip. I did a quick count, and said gratefully, You guys even got the ones out of the Enforcers for me. Thank you so much. Is that case empty? How many knives do you carry?! Lucas looked disbelieving. I laughed. Theyre not much good to me in the case, mate. Hang on! Oh my god! Mum, you wore your hair like that to your cousins wedding! I shrugged. I never liked her partner. But I behaved myself. I didnt even stab him a little bit. Why am I starting to feel like the parent in this relationship. He said it wonderingly, to no one in particular. Sebastian clapped a hand on his shoulder with a chuckle. Just strap in and enjoy the ride, kid. Shes a whirlwind. Ok, so were going to Hell, stealing a soul, switching with one in Heaven and bringing that soul back to Hell. Um, why? And why do you need me? Why is it important to us? You can answer that one, fearless leader. Sebastian said quickly to Sera. Pussy. She sighed. Hell its in a bit of a mess right now. There was a mistake. We need to fix it before God finds out or the whole Deal collapses and no one gets out of Hell. Remember a couple of years ago, that Charles Manson guy died? I nodded. Well, someone who was supposed to head straight to Heaven died at the same time, and they somehow traded places. Manson is in Heaven, and the good soul is in Hell. I looked at her in shock. What?! She grimaced. I know, I know. Why doesnt Lucifer just tell God there was a fuck up and swap them? Sera flexed her gloved hand unconsciously. Were pretty sure God would dissolve the deal if he found out Manson got in. So We kinda sorta havent told Lucifer that Manson is in Heaven you know, what he doesnt know and all that. Sera looked guilty. God doesnt know whos in Heaven? Lucas questioned. He doesnt give a shit, and thats working in our favour for now. As long as its not brought to his attention ignorance is bliss. Seth answered. More to the point, Lucifer has a good soul in Hell and is just allowing that? I was surprised and felt a little betrayed, honestly. That wasnt the Lucifer I knew. He knows, but he doesnt realise they arent supposed to be there. Weve only known about it for a year. They ended up on Satans side, you know, where Manson was supposed to be. Lord War brought them over after a while, because they were teaching Satans captive souls goodness, if you can believe that, and their side didnt want that going on. Wed been getting some come over which hardly ever happened. This explained it though. When we saw who the soul was, we had an idea of what had happed, so the guys and I checked the records and worked it out. Sera was rambling, which was very unlike her. Lucifer has been trying to work out how, why this soul got to us, and has been getting sicker and sicker. Weve, ah, worked out what we need to do, so here we are. Where do my son and I come in to this? I was suspicious. The demons traded furtive glances. Sebastian rubbed his chest, took a deep breath and said, Dear one, the good soul is your mother."
39,vulnerability,nosleep,My Niece has a Friend,1,eu9tw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eu9tw0/my_niece_has_a_friend/,2020-01-27 04:38:57,"Youre going to die, my nine-year-old niece randomly said. We were sitting in the family room, playing with her Barbies. Her remark was so sudden, so out of the blue, I nearly dropped the Judge Barbie I was holding. W what makes you say that? I asked, managing to compose myself. Ajax told me, Nicole said, brushing the Barbie she was holding. Looking up and seeing my face, she added in, Hes my friend. When I go to bed he comes in my room and we chat. Eventually I go to sleep and he walks around the house. I took a moment to respond before saying, Well, alright. But why did he say I was going to die? He told me, she repeated, He said she hesitated, her face scrunched up as she tried to recall what he said, word for word. She gave up, explaining, Something about your heart stopping like your Dads. That made the blood drain from my face. My Dads family had a long history of heart issues, and I was always worried about my own heart suddenly giving out on me. Which is why Nicoles Dad, my half-brother Abel, was trying to convince me to move in with them, and why I was currently babysitting Nicole. Well I struggled, unable to figure out what I wanted to say, Um could you please ask Ajax not to talk about me behind my back? Will do Cap, Nicole said. She said all of that, I said, a few hours later. Abel and his wife Chloe had returned from the musical they went to, and I ushered Abel outside to inform him about what Nicole had said to me. That is strange, Abel admitted. Chloe and I always talk about private matters, including your heart problems, when Nicole is out of the house or when shes asleep. Do you think its true about her friend? I asked, a bit worried. The idea that maybe there was an intruder in the house, creeping through the hallways, talking with Nicole and spying on my brother made my skin crawl. You always hear those stories of people living undetected in houses for years. It also didnt help Abels house was fairly large. Hes most likely an imaginary friend, Abel said comfortingly. We have cameras in the house, wed definitely know if someone was here. Anyways Andy, he turned and gently punched my shoulder, Well start cleaning out one of the spare rooms we have so you can move in. I frowned but didnt remark. I had constantly refused to move in, At least let me pay rent, I had tried to say, but Abel shot down that suggestion and argued that I will live in the house for free. And eventually, I caved. A month had passed since that day Nicole told me about Ajax, and I had moved into Abels home, which was different from the small apartment I used to live in. Abel and Chloe had a good income, compared to me, who was making a humble living off of ghostwriting. However, I wasnt exactly living there without contributing to the household, I got to babysit Nicole, which I had no problems with. I liked hanging out with her, and she with me. I dont want to brag, but out of all her other relatives, I was probably her favorite. Andyyyyy, Nicole whined, bursting into my room. ANDDDDDDDDDDDY! IM HUNGRY!! I nearly jumped a foot in the air. I had been sitting in total silence, reading emails. I love Nicole with all my heart, but good Lord did she know how to whine and scream. Didnt your Mom make you lunch? I asked, twisting my chair around to face her. I took off my glasses and rub my eyes. Peanut butter and jelly sandwich with chips. Go eat that. I dont want to, Nicole said, sticking out her lower lip. Shes been having me eat that garbage every day. I want something else! She stood in my room, defiant and unwilling to compromise. But I knew how to make her compromise. Ill make you something good to eat, I said, but before Nicole could celebrate, I waggled my finger at her, BUT you must eat one half of the sandwich and a couple of the chips. Do that, and Ill make you lunch. Ill even eat the rest of the sandwich and chips, so your Mom doesnt know, I added in. Nicole thought about it for a moment, before nodding her head solemnly. Ill do it, she said. I stood up and allowed Nicole to lead me downstairs. The house was quiet, both Abel and Chloe had gone off to work, despite it being a Saturday, leaving Nicole and I alone. However, it wasnt until I reached the bottom of the staircase did I get the sensation that someone was standing behind me, staring. I glanced back, but to be excepted, I didnt see anyone. But that just made me nervous. I was standing in the kitchen, cooking some mac&amp;cheese, thinking. The sensation of someone looking at me reminded me of Nicoles friend Ajax. Casually, I said over my shoulder, Remember how you told me about Ajax? Nicole made a noise in response, and I could hear her mashing buttons on my Switch, What does he look like? Hes taller than you, Nicole said, placing the Switch on the counter. And hes um, he looks like us, but kinda not. What does that mean? I asked, a pit in my stomach forming. Like he looks human, but his ears are pointed, and his eyes are completely black, and his teeth are kind of sharp. Nicole said. His face looks kinda off too. But hes nice. Sometimes he tells me stories of princesses battling dragons. She laughed, her face turning pink, And the princesses have to save the princes! Despite my worry, I laughed as well. He sounds like a good storyteller, I admitted, What else does he do? Ill sometimes tell him about my day, Nicole explained, And hell listen. Sometimes I tell him about movies or games. He doesnt tell me about his day, but he does tell me stuff he hears about. Like how Mom wants another kid, but Dad doesnt want another one he says one kid is enough. The worry I had multiplied. If Nicole was lying about Ajax being real, this meant she was eavesdropping on her parents. I knew about Chloe and Abels arguments about having more kids, because in a moment of being vulnerability Abel told me about their fights. Deep in thought, I poured the mac &amp; cheese into the colander and didnt hear what Nicole was saying, until I heard her shout. Y-yeah? I stammered, glancing over my shoulder to look at her as I dumped the hot noodles back into the metal pot. Ajax is here, Nicole said, pointing to the seat next to her. The seat next to her was indeed pulled out, but no one was there. At least, no one visible. He wants a small bite of it. I shot Nicole a nervous smile. Ok, let me just add the cheese in. Can you get the bowls and utensils? Will do Cap, Nicole said, turning the switch off and hopped off of the stool. She walked past me, and I stirred the cheese into the noodles. I turned to Nicole, who handed me a small bowl. I put one scoop into the bowl and watched as Nicole delivered it to the spot where Ajax was supposedly sitting. She placed a spoon in the bowl and bounded back over to me, holding a bigger bowl out to me. I put two scoops into the bowl, then two in my own, and walked back with her to the counter. I nearly dropped the bowl in shock. The smaller one was empty, and the spoon was licked cleaned. There was no way Nicole could have done that, she had been standing next to me, and I was watching her when she put the bowl down. There were no pets in the house, so I couldnt blame a cat or dog. He says thank you, Nicole said, noticing my hanging jaw. It tastes very good. I-Im glad he liked it, I said. It was all I could do to eat the mac&amp;cheese without feeling sick. We ate in silence, and I watched Nicole as she hummed and swung her feet, clearing enjoying the meal. She ate the serving rather quickly and peaked up at me. You dont have to be afraid of Ajax, she said. Hes really nice, honest. Im not really scared, I lied, Its just I cant really see Ajax, so Nicole nodded sagely, and quietly said, Thats because you dont belong here. Not offering an explanation, she shoved her bowl away from her and hopped down from the stool again, and scampered off, her footsteps carrying her to the living room, and a moment later I heard the tv turn on. What the fuck did that mean, I dont belong here? Yeah it might be weird to have your uncle living with you, but a lot of people did that, right? When I told Abel about the disappearing mac&amp;cheese, and what Nicole said, Abel just gave me a funny look but didnt seem to think anything was weird. I honestly felt like I was going crazy. I tried telling Chloe this as well, but she just laughed, shook her head, and headed into the kitchen to grab something to drink. It became harder to eat, harder to tolerate Nicole telling me about the gossip Ajax fed her. What once had been a possible safe space for me became a stressful prison. I cant do this anymore, I admitted to Abel and Chloe one night. I dont want to live here anymore. Im sorry. But you have nowhere to go! Chloe gasped, her cheeks turning pink. She stood tall, and said, I wont allow it. Youre my brother-in-law, and you will live here with us. I- I began to say, but Abel hit my shoulder, a laugh coming from deep within his chest. We should sleep on this, he said, Well discuss this properly tomorrow, when Nicole is at school and we have the house to ourselves. Its late and having a discussion while being exhausted is never a good idea. Good night Andrew. He and Chloe departed, heading up to their bedroom, and leaving me behind, flabbergasted and irritated. He was treating me like a child, and I didnt like it. But what could I do? This was his home, and I was merely living there thanks to his kindness. I usually sleep heavily, but around 3am I woke up, feeling tired and sore, my throat screaming for water. I didnt want to get out of bed, but I did, the dryness of my throat would make it impossible to fall back asleep. I could tell it was in the early hours of the new day. Theres always that stillness the air, like the house itself had fallen asleep long after its inhabitants went to bed. As a child, I always loved this time of day, where the night still clung stubbornly to the day and everything was silent. When you felt like a ghost moving through the house while the living slept. But that mystical feeling I once held as a child was no longer present. The stillness in the air made me feel paranoid, the sleepiness that clutched stubbornly to my brain was quickly releasing its grasp. I was wide awake by the time I reached the kitchen. I quietly opened the fridge, squinting against the bright light as I searched for the water bottle I put in the fridge earlier, my mind focused on quenching my thirst. A puff of breath brushed against the back of my neck, and it took all of my willpower to not jump and freak out. I knew who it was, even though I couldnt see who was standing behind me. Slowly closing the fridge, I turned around, coming face to face with Nicoles friend. True to her description, he stood taller than me, with pointed ears, pure black eyes and sharp teeth. But what she failed to mention was how he looked transparent. He looked solid, yet I could make out the counter that stood a few feet away through his torso. You can see me now, Ajax said, grinning like he knew a joke. Good. We have something to discuss. L-like what? I managed to get out. W-what do you want? Just to establish some ground rules, Ajax said. The smell of rot rolled off him in waves, making me recoil. If you ever talk about me to the Master and Missus again I will kill you. Im here for one thing and thats to guard the inhabitants of the house. They dont need to know. But Nicole knows about you, I blurted. Shell forget about me, Ajax said carelessly. They always do. The moment she turns ten, shell be convinced I was made up. An imaginary friend, as the Master once said. Children stop believing in the unnatural when they turn that age, He leaned forwards, towering over me. However, youll never forget, but I do hope you conveniently forget that you want to leave here. Little Miss will be very sad to see her favorite uncle go, and Ive grown rather fond of her, His smile grew, Do we understand each other, Andy? Yes sir. My voice came out as a squeak. Good. Have a nice night, Andy. With that, Ajax vanished. The ending is kind of anti-climactic, but the terror I felt that night was real. You try living in a house where you catch a brief glimpse of something inhuman watching your every move, seeing him peak from the shadowy gaps between furniture, black beady eyes watching you playing Barbies with your niece. But, at least he doesnt try to speak with me."
40,vulnerability,nosleep,Welcome to the Panic Room.,4,ev8zfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ev8zfl/welcome_to_the_panic_room/,2020-01-29 05:03:51,"I stood outside the door with my parents and sister. It was weird to think about where all the time went in my childhood. Every moment leading up to this one. Taking a deep breath and opening the door, I saw what looked to be a normal classroom. Posters littered the walls and desks sat jumbled into a corner. In the middle of the room stood the check in lady, clipboard in hand, as well as darts in the other. ""Welcome to room number one Rebecca! I am Miss Sam, a pleasure to meet you. She said enthusiastically, and in an almost robotic voice. ""Now is the time to say your goodbyes before IT is let loose."" She explained, walking towards the door. My little sister Allie grabbed me and pulled into a bear hug. Dont die on me Becca. She whispered, and ran off before I could say anything. I gave my parents quick hugs and goodbyes before they left. The door slammed shut and the lights soon flickered off. Tying my hair up, I walked over to a certain corner and slid down. I wasnt able to see out of the window on the wall, and whatever would be out there couldnt see me. After adjusting my headbands, I checked my phone. No signal, of course. My last hope is this app, and you people. I did manage to open this app with the little data I have left. You shouldnt cry or sleep in a Panic Room. If you sleep, IT watches your guard fall and will get to you before you fully lose consciousness. When you cry, youre showing vulnerability. Vulnerable ones dont survive. And then I heard it. The whispers, just beyond the window. I wasnt visible to them but they KNEW I was in here. How could they not? Curling up into a tighter ball, I zipped up my coat a bit more. The flimsy little thing was barely cooperating. The whispers were getting louder, and I had an urge to take out my pocket knife for my own safety. Even though they arent allowed, I had to sneak one in. A pocket knife may come in handy, you never know. My parents snuck one in with them during their turns in the Panic Rooms, so I decided to as well. The whispers continued getting louder, and it felt as if someone was whispering directly into my ear. If something actually was, I wouldnt see them. Not in this darkness. Among these whispers, I began hearing a woman sobbing softly. This gave me goosebumps, and I rubbed my arms to remove the cold. I wasnt keeping track of time anymore. It had been hours since Ive done anything. I did eat, though. They provided me with a small sandwich to eat. The door near the back of this small classroom suddenly opened. I sprang to my feet, pocket knife in my hand but with the blade put away. Whatever made it into the room quickly slammed the door behind them. I didnt move. A small light above them flickered on, and I saw the face of Miss Sam looking straight at me. She raised her arm and aimed a firearm at me. See you in room two. She whispered, and pulled the trigger. The tranquilizer flew at me and landed in my arm. Welcome to the Panic Room, I thought while I lost consciousness. I woke up in a maze of mirrors. Ill update you guys when and if I can. "
41,vulnerability,nosleep,SAFER [Part 1},4,evh8ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/evh8ps/safer_part_1/,2020-01-29 14:44:05,"It was our fifth week in orbit, positioned a few hundred kilometres above the planet upon the International Space Station. The goal of our mission was to implement and monitor new armour panels for the station's hull and solar trusses. Safeguarding 300 tons of metal in the unforgiving vacuum of space comes with a plethora of challenges; from severe temperature fluctuation, to orbital debris, to various forms of radiation. Our task at hand was assumed to be simple. My responsibility was to monitor the installation crew throughout the process and observe the effectiveness of the new panels against the hazards of space. We would initially have to remove the old shielding and Kevlar layer, worn down from fragmentation debris too small to detect and avoid. Once the old layers of armour are detached, we could replace any damaged padding before installation of new protective panels. The major pitfall of this process is the small window of vulnerability during the swap, leaving a chance for debris to make contact with the station while it rockets through the Earth's orbit at 28 000 kilometres per hour. At that speed, even something equivalent in size to a grain of sand would exert enough force to swiftly dispatch anyone unfortunate enough to be on board. &amp;#x200B; I awoke one morning with an inexplicable feeling of terror, despite our fortunate mission progress. The crew had successfully replaced the armour on a majority of the station, leaving only the Columbus Orbital Facility, a laboratory housing the scientific experiments of the European Space Agency. After my usual morning routine, I assumed monitoring position in the lab while the installation engineers suited up in preparation for their extravehicular work. I still couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. A foreboding sense of despair that had entangled every cell in my body. &amp;#x200B; We progressed through most of the day without any hitches. The engineers were in the process of removing one of the last damaged Kevlar restraint layers when the situation began to go awry. While in the laboratory, I received a low static hiss from mission control. The ominous sound seemed to contain a scrambled voice buried in it. I checked the connection to the relay satellites within range of the station but was unable to find an issue there. After some troubleshooting with the frequency of my receiver, I was able to make out some cryptic, yet alarming words. &amp;#x200B; ""Fired....Ash....Unknown....Cataclysmic"" &amp;#x200B; The engineers, distracted from their work, had pivoted themselves to gain a better view of the Earth. I was unable to read their expressions due to the sun visors on their helmets, but could tell they were paralyzed by whatever they could see. That is when I finally got a sense of what was wrong. The light reflecting from the Earth to the engineer's visors began to shift, slowly transitioning from a cool white/blue to black. &amp;#x200B; I knew I would be unable to properly see what was happening from my location. I quickly engaged the tether to the engineers, hoping they'd be able to safely return inside through the Joint Airlock. As I prepared to exit the laboratory, the hissing from my receiver resumed. I was contemplating staying to attempt communication with mission control, but was ultimately overwhelmed by the urge to get a better view of whatever had the engineers incapacitated by fear. On my way out, I received a final message from Houston, &amp;#x200B; ""May God be with you all."" &amp;#x200B; I propelled myself down the connected hallway, desperate to achieve any understanding of what was happening. I would be able to gain a line of sight of the planet from the station's Cupola, a windowed dome used for observation of the Earth. &amp;#x200B; Once at the Cupola, I could feel the air forcing itself out of my lungs. No amount of emotional detachment or desensitization could have prepared me for what I would see. &amp;#x200B; From the discernible horizon, a monstrous black mass was engulfing the entire surface of the planet. An omnipotent cloud seemingly swallowing our home, akin to a snake eating an egg. This unknown obstruction was soon followed by serpentine bolts of green, similar in appearance to the Northern Lights, but certainly different in nature. &amp;#x200B; Something had come to our planet, and undoubtedly was there to oversee the final chapter of humanity."
42,vulnerability,nosleep,The House That Clicked,1,ewa4tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ewa4tw/the_house_that_clicked/,2020-01-31 05:44:27,"I heard it in the bathroom. The couple I was staying with, the Kernstocks, had told me I would hear an occasional noise; seeming to come from various locations throughout the home. The bathroom would later turn out to be one such location, although the nature of its noise was entirely different from that of the other noises. They explained that the house was actually re-converted from another building, and although they werent sure as to the exact nature of its previous construction and purpose, they were informed upon purchase of it that, due to its previous uses, sounds would issue from various sections of the of home. These sounds were short-lived, and heralded nothing in the way of damage or structural decay. It was because of these sounds, I was told, that the Kernstocks acquired the home for a ridiculously low price. I am generally a heavy sleeper, so I was not worried about the sounds waking me, and assured the couple that the occasional noise would actually be more comforting than distressing; explaining to them my *distrust* of total, uninterrupted silence. They were happy that the houses eccentricities would not disturb me. I was meant to stay for only the weekend, as a temporary lodging during my trip to a neighboring state to visit for the first time a friend from the internet. I dislike Hotels, regardless of quality, and of course the same goes for the motel. The uncertain and immeasurable history of any tels room is not something I can stand, so I prefer to stay in rooms offered for rent by homeowners, where a rooms occupancy is generally restricted to the family and perhaps a handful of tenants before me. The Kernstocks, being only about ten years older than myself, were not shambling geezers who retired as soon as the sun went down, so I spent more time with them than I did alone; during my weekend stay in what I guess can now be called *The Clicking House*. They were nice people, well-educated, and, surprisingly, well-informed of current popular cultureconsidering the remoteness of their home from the nearest major city and Mrs. Kernstocks disinterest in the allure of the internet. Mr. Kernstock, however, required its use for his worksome sort of online financial business. We talked about films, books, and world eventscareful to dance around extremely political topicsand overall had a very light and pleasant conversation that first night. The house was large in the sense that it had many rooms which were uncluttered and spatially open, and in which furniture had been arranged so as to not infringe upon this openness. From the outside, it looked somewhat rustic and of simple design, but the inside bore the mark of a sophisticated architects hand, and the furnishings were almost strikingly modern compared to the general construction and outside appearances. Aside from the peculiar noises, which I will address in a bit, the house did not groan or creak, despite its size and reconfiguration. I never found out the purpose of the buildings previous state of existence, but, as my story will show, the modifications to it made were most likely for the better. There was really only one notably terrible thing that occurred. I know, considering the possibilities and implied history of the place, many other terrible things mightve happened, and I mightve just not observed them. But, as far as Im concerned, the one moment of outright horror was enough for me. Im sure the Kernstock coupleif they still livecould provide several stories of their own regarding the Clicking House. On Saturday night, as I repacked the few belongings I had withdrawn from my suitcases, I heard a sound from the bathroom. The sounds resembled a sort of *clicking*, some noise between the ticking of a watch, and the keys of a keyboard being slowly and rhythmically depressed; as if going back and forth along a simple musical scale. There is no better analogy I can think of than this comparison of two sounds which, if combined, could provide an approximation of the sound in the bathroom. It was loud enough to be heard from across the hall, in my room. My door had been closed, andas it usually isthe bathrooms door was as well. I had heard other sounds during the first day of my stay; Friday was filled with the often discordant and seemingly mobile noises that could be described as *thumps* and *bumps,* as if invisible creatures jumped across the walls of the home. I regarded these sounds as nothing more than a general ambience of the home, and not once had I felt unsafe or disconcerted by them. But something about Saturday nights *clicking* noises disturbed me, or rather, caught my attention in a way that the *other* noises hadnt. While those seemed really to be the results of some sort of *movement,* which had not presented itself to be hostile or unnerving, the clicking sounded as if there was an *inten*t behind it. As if something consciously *emitted* the sound, rather than the sound arising from things moving about within or atop the walls. The Kernstocks were out that night; had informed me that they were going to see a movie then head to a sports bar afterwardstold you they werent old and resigned to their homeso I was the only person in the house to hear, and of course investigate, the newly-arrived sound. I left my room, and it wasnt until I reached the bathroom door and placed my hand on its knob that I realized I had brought a flashlight with me. This was no ordinary beam-thrower, but a heavy andas I was assuredvery powerful device; given to me by Mr. Kernstock, who said it may become necessary if I chose to select a vintage of wine from their cellar; which they said I was free to do so whenever I pleased, but that the wiring in the basement was interminably faulty and the lighting could not be trusted. Whether by instinct or fear of the unknown, I had brought the thing, and I thanked the Kernstocks residual youth for keeping them out of the house and not seeing me under such embarrassing circumstances. The door to the bathroom was ordinary, as was the bathroom itself. The polished brown slab of wood opened to a mostly white, sparsely decorated personal room. Im not sure what I expected upon opening the door, but whatever I had unconsciously imagined to be lurking therein was not, at least not visibly. Toilet, sink, cabinet, tub, all there. Shining whitely, immaculately clean. The shower liner and curtain were both transparent, which I remember thinking to be a bit odd when I first arrived on Friday morning. I figured the Kernstocks hadnt put much thought into the bathrooms dcor, since they had a bathroom within their master-bedroom, and told me I was only the third person to rent the guest room since they started advertising it over two months ago. As someone who indulges in a lot of horror mediabooks, films, and even gamesI expected that if I didnt outright see something, the clicking noises would at least stop; a sign that whatever presence or force made them had shut up upon my entrance to the bathroom, so as to avoid detection and continue its auditory mischief later. But this was not the case, and I heard the clicking, louder then, while I stood in the bathroom. It was, in a way, comforting, that regardless of my actions it continued; providing a degree of doubt to the theory that the noises were willfully made by a conscious entity. Again, assuming this conscious entity would want to avoid detection, and continue its attempts to annoy or frighten me. I looked around, but could not determine a particular spot or area from which the noise arose. It seemed to emanate from the walls of the bathroom, as an exhalation from beneath the tiles. As if they were loose teeth in the mouth that was the rooms interior, blown back and forth by some source-less breath. Nothing moved, of course, and so I stood there trying to discern from immobility and innocuity the source of the not yet quite eerie but still puzzling sound. As if sensing its current location, my bodystomach, in particulardecided to undergo a room-appropriate operation. The click, which I told myself would persist regardless of my activity, was temporarily reduced in its priority, and I performed the necessary bodily function while thinking of other things. I finished, washed my hands, and promptly decided to ignore the sound for the rest of the night; to ask the Kernstocks about it in the morning. Things went, in a word, astray when I seized and turned the door knob. I actually heard the mechanical sequence before the floors collapse actually happened. Gears, or whatever hidden devices there were, coming alive, put into motion. The floor, the *entire bathroom floor,* gave way before I even thought to let go of the knob, and I fell instantly into a blackness below. I landed shortly after falling, I guess to my luck, although my fall not unaccompanied by pain. I had placed the heavy-duty flashlight into the waistband of my pants, tucked against my back, and I of course landed on my butt. The flashlight was unbroken as far as I could tell, but I knew a ghastly bruise would soon form on my lower back and tailbone. The fall was maybe ten or twelve feet; had it been more, there wouldve surely been a test of structural integrity of the flashlight vs my tailbone, and no doubt other parts of my body wouldve been considerably damaged as well. I rolled on my side, eyes shut closed in an attempt to block out all other senses and mentally concentrate on dispelling the pain. When I felt that I could clearly think, I opened my eyes, and realized the gesture of closing them had been pointless. The space was dark, unusually sothe Kernstocks had installed a dim ambient light in every room of the house, regardless of if anyone was actually in it. Knowing this, I quickly surmised that I had been dropped into the unlit basement. The realization that I had indeed been dropped arrived grimly, and brought with it a sense of extreme vulnerability. The bathroom was on the second floor of the home, and the basement, obviously, was beneath the first floor. This led to the only conclusion of being *dropped* rather than somehow *falling* through the floor*,* even if I hadnt heard the mechanisms put the action into motion. The bathroom was plainly constructed over some spaceprobably some hollow hidden chamber on the first floorand I plunged directly down through the first floor and into the basement. This was clearly an intentional act. The clicking had no doubt served to attract meor anyone who could hear itinto the bathroom, and upon trying to exitI couldnt remember closing the bathroom doorthe person was sent plummeting into the lightless basement for some plainly harmful purpose. There was doubtless some other, more convoluted scheme than an attempt to seriously harm the person. The fall, while perilous, would only have killed someone very young or very old, or already weakened in some way. I looked around, trying to discern an object or perhaps even a personstarting to doubt that the Kernstocks had actually gone outbut saw nothing. Then, remembering the one tool I had thought to bring with me, I turned on the flashlight and cast its beam around the room. It was mostly bare, although against a wall to my leftalong the entire wallwas a massive wine rack. It mustve held no less than four or five dozen bottles. I saw the stairs, and traced them with the light up to the door, which had no contraptions or mechanisms attached to it that I could see. If I was meant to be imprisoned here, there wasnt any visual indication that such efforts had been made. I was not enclosed by a cage or any sort of railing or fencing. Aside from the wine rack, the only other objects of note were a few folded metal chairs which probably hadnt been used in several years, judging by the faded red paint and rust. They sat in a leaning stack against the wall opposite the wine rack. On the wall behind me, covered in dust but otherwise looking newer than the chairs was a treadmill. Its disuse wasnt surprising. The Kernstocks, for their age, were very fit, and probably still exercised outside or at a gym; without needing to be near their home for personal safety and comfort. Something I had admired before, but now thought might be to my disadvantage if I would have to confront them. The door leading out of the basement was of course locked. I thought my chances were fifty-fifty, considering that there werent any signs which would suggest my intended imprisonment. But, I guess the locked doorfrom the outside, obviouslywas considered insurance enough. I considered using force, but thought against it. Something told me to consider that it had just been an accident; that the floor-trap had been an unintended occurrence; a structural remnant of the houses previous strange purpose. That, somehow, it had not been activated by the previous tenants of my room who wouldve doubtlessly used it. That, if I broke the basement door, I would owe the innocent Kernstocks money for the repairs, and a great apology. This voice, this line of reasoning, was understandably small compared to the otherwhich was that I had been purposely trapped here by the Kernstocks, who were conveniently elsewhere; perhaps even observing me now through some hidden system of surveillance. Returning to the spot of my landingindicated by the disturbance of the dust that covered the floorI cast the beam up to the ceiling and saw only black stone. The opening through which I had fallen was apparently re-sealed, seamlessly, and no matter how hard I concentrated I could not discern any lines, indentations, or markings in the smoothed stone to suggest that it could open. I did another sweep of the basement, hoping to find something which could provide me with a clue as to the purpose of my descent, or an idea of what was to comeif anythingbut found only the same objects Ive previously described. Left with no other options, I again ascended the basement stairs and tried the door, knowing it would not budge. I spoke aloud and saidin case I was truly being watched that I would pay for the door if the reason for its being locked was not a malicious one, and slammed my left shoulder against it. It did not so much as creak, so I performed the action again, and again, until I was forced to switch shoulders due to the pain. When this proved fruitless, I struck the knob several times with the hard shell of the flashlight, but stopped when the light flickered out for a few seconds. I was undeniably trapped. My cell phone was upstairs in the guest room. Im not the kind of person to bring his phone into the bathroom while doing my business. Its the last place I would ever want to linger, yet it seems people would rather hold their business until they can have their phones in their hand while doing it. Without a means of communicationand also entertainmentI decided to pass the time until whatever was to happen next while intoxicated; at the expense of the Kernstocks. I briefly scanned their collection of wineI hadnt the faintest idea of qualitybefore selecting a bottle with the highest alcohol content I could find; a dark red at 18% ABV. Luckily, several corkscrews hung on hooks throughout the rack. I popped open the bottle and drank deeply, forgoing the use of a glassof which there were several tucked into their own niches within the rack. Although the basement wasnt very cold, the warmth of the wine lifted my spirits, and helped to dull the sense of panic that I had started to feel when the door endured my assaults. It also served to numb the dull yet ceaselessly throbbing pain in my lower back. A few minutes and half a bottle later, an idea came to me that I shouldve slapped myself for not thinking of it earlier. In a house of strange, intra-walled noises, trap doors, and collapsing floors, it could easily be speculated that there were other hidden devices which, if I were lucky, could help me escape the basement or at least uncover a reason for my placement there. I spent nearly an hour feeling and patting walls, brushing my hands across the ceiling (with the help of the rusted chairs) and tapping and stomping every inch of the floor. But, as if luck actively worked against me, I found nothing, and only tired myself out. The shock and soreness of the fall, the alcohol, and ultimately pointless exertion started to collectively wear on me, and my eyelids became leaden with desires of sleep. I had finished the second half of the bottle, almost unconsciously, and decided then to not open another. I briefly thought about folding one of the chairs and using it to strike the door, like an impromptu battering ram, but one unmanageable recoil from the collision and I would fall backwards down the stairs; I did not trust my intoxicated self to compensate for such an event, so I discarded the idea. The only option left, it seemed, was to grab a chair, relax, and wait for the return of the Kernstocks. I mustve dozed off, because shortly after I sat on one of the chairs, I heard footsteps on the floor above me, and caught myself drooling onto my shirt as my head slouched forward. I straightened up, having slackened to the side in a position so awkward as to be immediately uncomfortable upon waking, and listened intently. I had no way to tell how much time had passed, but I figured it mustve been a few hours. From the time of their departure to my initial fall, only an hour at most couldve passed; so, for them to have returned, at least two or three more wouldve gone by as wellassuming they kept with their plan of going to a movie and then a bar afterwards. The footsteps denoted the presence of two people, and to my relief, they stumbled about as if considerably intoxicated. To me, this meant that they had indeed carried their night out as planned, which lent validity to my earlier thoughts that the Kernstocks had not intentionally trapped me in their basement. I heard onefemaleshush the other, who responded with a shushing of their ownmalemuch louder than the first, which then elicited giggling from them both. I got up from my seat and darted up the stairs, and called out to the apparently drunken duo. I accompanied my shouts with banging on the door, and hoped that the basement was not soundproofedwhich, if it were, would make the reasons for the trapdoor even more sinister than I feared. The noises stopped, and I heard the sounds of shuffling. The sounds drew closer, and I heard Mr. Kernstocks voice call out, obviously drunk. I told him my predicament, and said that even if it had been intended, or some sort of prank, I wouldnt hold it against them if they just released me and allowed me to leave. Mrs. Kernstock muttered something which I could not make out, and I heard someone fumble with the lock on the door. The smell of bourbon, and the faces of two plainly startled people greeted me. The Kernstocks stepped back, and I cautiously entered the kitchen. They were dressed nicely, in clothing befitting a night out rather than the garbs of torturers or criminals. Mrs. Kernstock clutched her purse to her chest, and Mr. Kernstock held his keys in his hand, a few protruding from between his curled fingers in a deadly yet plainly defensive gesture. Greg? What were you doing down there? How did you lock yourself in? I didnt know how to explain myself, and any accusations I couldve had were self-dismissed at the sight of the two who had plainly done nothing more than see a movie and get blitzed. I decided that, before I explained anything, I would go see if the bathroom still held the clicking noise, which I should now mention that I could not hear at all while in the basement. If it was still present in the bathroom, I would explain my entire story. If not, I would make something up, so that they did not see me as a crazy person and think to put me out earlier than planned. I politely moved past them, saying that I would be right back. I heard them following me, which I did not mind. If the noises still persisted, then theyd hear. If not, I wouldve simply said that I had to use the bathroom. I ascended the stairs and, sure enough, heard the clicking sounds as I climbed the final step and entered the hall. I went forward a little and turned back to the Kernstockswho still followedand saw the confusion on their faces as they too heard the anomalous noise. Mrs. Kernstock asked what it was, and Mr. Kernstock expressed his own previous ignorance of the sound with a similar question. I moved away from the stairs so they could ascend to level ground, then explained all that had happened to me. When I finished, we all entered the bathroom, and, as I suspected, the floor had resumed its flat solidarity. I remembered that when the floor gave way, the fixed objectssink, tub, toilethad remained in place, so I suggested that I repeat the procedure which had led to my fall, so that the Kernstocks could see for themselves. They agreed, and promised to assist me in exiting the room once it the trap had been sprungif the floor did not recover in a timely manner. I went inside, closed the doorconsciously, this timeand again listened for any discernible source to the persistent clicking sounds. I found none. I then relieved myselfmy bladder near bursting from the wineand flushed the toilet. I washed my hands, and once the water had completely drained, climbed into the sink. From my perch, I reached towards the doorknob and turned it, andmy heart practically danced at the soundheard the inner-wall mechanisms come alive, and watched as the floor collapsedrather, split open and the segments swing awayand showed the large, rectangular shaft of darkness at the bottom of which lies the basement. I released the doorknob, and upon doing so it turned on its ownor so it seemedand the door swung inward. I saw Mr. Kernstock first look at the floor, eyes wide with surprise, then at me, and something approaching a smirk cross his face. I knew I mustve looked ridiculous perched on the sinks counter like some bathroom gargoyle. Before either of us could say anything, the floor raised itself, and soon returned to its normal state without any hint that it possessed such a bizarre function. I lowered myself, hesitantly, onto the tiled floor, and the Kernstocks entered with similar apprehension. Together, we investigated the bathroom, but could not find from exactly where the clicking noisesstill audiblecame. We eventually gave up, having inspected every inch of the essentially bare room. Mrs. Kernstock, closest to the door, reached for the doorknob to let us out. I didnt remember closing the door, and hadnt noticed either of them close it either. Instinct born of experience caused me to lunge towards the sink counter, and, as I terrifyingly suspected, the hidden mechanisms were again activated, and the floor collapsed beneath us. I held onto the smooth counter, curling my hands into the depression of the sink, and heard the surprised shouts and screams of the couple as they plummeted to the darkness below. The bathroom door, which was ajar from Mrs. Kernstocks attempted exit, began to slowly and silently closethe reason for why I hadnt noticed during my first tripand with my last reserves of strength I sidled over to it, flung it open with one hand, and dove into the hall. The floor started to close beneath me, as did the door once I cleared the threshold. Without hesitation, I ran downstairs and into the kitchen, where the door that led down to the basement was located. Only, it wasnt there. The wall where it had been was smooth, unblemished, and bore no markings that would indicate it opened or be made to open in some way. I felt around, called outand hopefully downto the Kernstocks, and beat on the surface, but nothing happened, and I heard nothing in response. I was totally, utterly confused. And then I heard, for the first time that night, the others sounds which had, on the previous day, seemed so harmless. The *thumps* and *bumps,* which now seemed like beatings and poundings, came alive instantly, simultaneously. In a wave, the noises surged, deafeningly audible, towards my position; echoing off every wall, as if invisible creatures crawled along every available surface of the house towards me. I dove to the floor, expecting to be trampled to my death by a horde of unseeable and therefore unimaginable creatures, but the sounds went past me, and seemed to enter the wall at the exact spot where I remembered the basement door to have been. The sounds the funnel into and down that unseen staircase, and almost immediately after I heard the muffled screams that I knew to belong to the Kernstocks. Accompanying the screaming was a chaotic chorus of breaking glass, which I immediately recognized as the destruction of the wine bottles. Some awful struggle ensued, and screams, breaking glass, and shrieks of a certainly inhuman nature could be heardalbeit muffled by the impassible wallfrom the basement. I laid there on the floor, listening to the nightmarish violence, not sure what to do. About a minute later, all was silent. It was an uncomfortable silence, a silence that could only follow some terrible event. A sorrowful, awful silence. I hated it, as Ive always hated absolute interrupted silence. Without going upstairs to retrieve my things, I fled the house. I ran through the darkness until my legs burned, and after that, walked briskly until I came across a gas station. A single attendant manned the station, and after explaining briefly and vaguely that I needed help, used his phone to call the police. They arrived, and I traveled with them back to the house. I provided them with the explanation that while I was packing my things, I saw the Kernstocks arrive from their night out, and heard some sort of crashing accompanied by screams. I didnt mention the basementwas afraid that even if it could be somehow determined that a basement did exist, the absence of a door to it would severely inhibit the believability to my story. I accompanied one officer upstairs to my retrieve my thingsI told them I didnt want stay in the house any longerwhile another investigated the first floor. Ten minutes later, the three of us exited the home; without having spotted any sign of the Kernstocks. This, not to my surprise, re-oriented things, and I was of course questioned heavily. I told the officers that I knew nothing beyond that the homeowners had gone out, and hadnt mentioned to what theatre or which bar. I also told them about the destination of my trip, when I had arrived at the house, what I had done while there, and all the other pertinent informationwithout mentioning the bathroom trap-door. My reason for omitting this particular piece information, if you havent guessed already, was because if they were found down there, dead, mauled by invisible horrors, the blame for their demise could plausibly rest on no one but myself; and Id be hauled away, locked up, andwithout a lawyerconvicted of, and sentenced for, a crime I did not commit. So, I held my tongue, and was eventually allowed to leave the police station. The police *recommended* that I stay in town, possibly at a motelas if Id everbut I instead walked to a bus stop (thankfully within walking distance) and bought a ticket. I didnt purchase a ticket for my original destinationI had told them about itbut instead for one chosen at random. If, for whatever reason, they sought to question or even implicate me in the deathsif the Kernstocks had truly diedI do not plan on being easily-found. I did not murder them, and I did not have anything to do with that clicking noise, the trap door, or the other sounds which all congregated in that basement and seemed to besiege the poor drunk Kernstocks."

I thought I might also like to get some peroxide or rubbing alcohol to clean out the gash on my arm, maybe even some gauze or something clean. The place had one of those bullet-proofish glass cages around the counter. Some dude was sitting behind the glass jabbering into an ancient cell phone. He gave me a glance and went back to his conversation. Just as well, no real scrutiny. I found what I needed and plopped everything on the counter. I had to hold up each item so he could scan them through the glass. He never really looked at me, just continued talking into the decrepit phone. Place smelled like someone had poured straight *Fabuloso* on the floor over fresh urine and didnt bother mopping. The stench burned my nostrils and made me a little nauseous. I started to leave through the single battered but working glass door, the other was locked tight and blocked with a rack of off brand chips, all to stop grab and go thefts and slow down robbers for the too obvious security camera. I realized that Id be walking from a brightly lit interior into near darkness. There were stickers and advertisements plastered all over the glass, so I couldnt see outside. I paused to peer through the few open spaces on the none too clean glass. Just inky blackness. Weird, there should have been at least some lighting from the yellow tinged pole light out front. I pushed hard on the door to clear a path if need be. I ended up stumbling out onto the crumbling pavement of the sidewalk. I quickly looked in each direction; nothing but the pole light and a bat chasing some insects near the bulb. Another shiver. It wasnt that cool outside and the heavy work shirt was adequate for mid-September but like earlier, this chill seemed to come up from my bones and radiate outward. *Were my wounds already infected?* *What had been on Aranias blade? Just regular crust likely... had he used it to cut drugs and failed to wipe it off when done?...* and I was just freaked out again, it had been a freaky night so far and it was still early. I decided on a route back, home to the fosters. Id have to cross my original trail back through Jaguars territory but maybe they had other targets tonight, maybe Sony I took off and rode toward my last foster home. As I went, I noticed that the streetlights were working but almost no light came from the businesses and homes on either side of the street. Weird, it wasnt late enough for people to go to bed and besides, in this hood, nobody turned off outside lights. I had hoped to take as many alleyways as possible to avoid car traffic. Cars that might hold angry gang turds. However, as I approached the first alleyway on my planned route, I saw that it was dark. Too dark to risk. The left-hand detour around it was also dimly lit. The righthand street was clear. No brainer, I turned right, Id just adjust the plan a little. Yet as I rode along, all of the streets and alleyways that would have led me back to the left and back on track were dark or obstructed in some way, junk cars, groups of random hood rats standing around burning trash cans, a couple of dumpsters, this was getting old! Up ahead, there was a larger avenue. It was well lit and I saw a few vehicles go by in either direction. No choice, Id have to risk the bigger, busier roadway. The last alleyway I passed was full of what an old pulp novel Id read referred to as, stygian gloom, pure darkness, like in a cavern. *Were those eyes? Orange glowing eyes?!* I almost crashed into a parked garbage truck. Another chill. This one wouldnt shake, so I picked up the pace to warm myself with exercise and put some distance between the alleyway and my body. As I made it to the wider, more brightly lit street, *MLK*, I was finally able to turn left. I realized that there was a plastic convenience store bag dangling from my right wrist. It was banging against the bike and throwing off my balance just a little. I pulled into a covered bus stop with shadows on one end but mostly illuminated by a nearby streetlight. I took a much needed seat and took care of my bod; not that I tasted the empty calories I wolfed down. The bus stop and indeed the surrounding block was empty and silent. Cars went by at various speeds but no one seemed to pay me any particular attention, just people going about their evening. I had found a small bottle of isopropyl alcohol at the store. I doused the wounds and the cheap gauze bandage Id procured, then wrapped and taped my arm. Stung like crazy but it smelled good and made my arm feel warm. I used a little more to douse the cut on the side of my head. Just a pressure cut but it was over a major goose egg lump that was painful to the touch. I used the citrus-tasting energy drink to wash down a couple of pain killers, then gobbled up a candy bar to chase down the chips Id already finished. The crappy store hadnt had energy bars; dump! Junk food aside, I was feeling pretty satisfied that I had handled my crisis and prepared to get back on the bike when I noticed that not only were there no people around, there was nothing living: no strays, no rats, no bats, not even any bugs. Except for the sounds of autos and the occasional, Thump; thump, thump; thump-thump,  from the bass on their stereos; nothing. Then the chill came rising up from my bones once more and the shadows began to deepen and seemed to expand towards me. I heard a vague and distant rumbling sound, almost like thunder in my ears The only way that remained lit was the direction Id intended to travel, so I hopped on the bike and began to pedal, not insanely fast but I quickly geared up to a good speed. *MLK* was a large thoroughfare that led to places where people worked for a living, so it was better maintained than most streets in the area. I cruised along until I was back near to where Id run into Arania and Feo. Then I saw it, the black SUV that crept along a cross street. The windows were dark tinted and the carriage was underlit in rotating colors; Jaguars crew! I looked desperately for a place to ditch and hide. *The ditch!* I rolled my bike into the ditch alongside the roadway, laid it flat and stretched out prone beside it. The grass was damp and muddy but it beat being spotted by those animals. It certainly beat having old tires thrown over my still breathing body and set on fire. I couldnt risk rising up to look around, I just laid there, panting, whispering over and over, Keep going, keep going, keep going Naturally they turned onto *MLK* and headed in my direction. *FUBAR*! I ducked my head into the wet grass and stiffened. They drove by slowly but no more so than they had been traveling on the cross street. They kept going! It was hard but I waited, this block was the only nearby stretch that was ditch rather than sidewalk. I needed them to get far enough away that they wouldnt look back. Hopefully theyd turn and Id be out of their line of sight Nope! Yet they kept going. Eventually I felt like I could safely get up and get going. Not far to go now, I hopped on and started pedaling. I knew I had to change roads in case the searchers turned back. Besides, I had to go a few blocks more to the west, my left, to get back to my fosters neighborhood. I started looking for a well lit left turn off of *MLK* but all the ways were either blacked-out dark or blocked in some way. Then I caught a flash of light out of the corner of my eye. I looked over my shoulder. FUBAR indeed! It was Feos beater with the super bright headlights. I heard the engine roar as whoever was driving floored the gas pedal, couldnt be Feo, the idiot had a broken arm, *Ha!* I had no choice, I had to get off the road. I turned into an alley that had been shrouded in darkness. Now a door opened on one side and enough light streamed out that I was able to ride full speed ahead. Feos ride would not fit but I didnt want to catch a bullet in the back. I rode until I found a cross street that was lit. *What was going on with the lights in this town?*! I tore up the street, then followed the path of light down several more twists and turns, all the while I tried to stay on narrow streets and alleys. I could hear tires screeching several times as Feo, his new driver (*Ha! Old one was dead*) and I waltzed through that part of the cityon our little game of cat and mouse. Unfortunately I was the mouse. I dodged him again by fleeing into a narrow dark alley, this time there was no light and I was sure Id find a place to hide or run in a direction they couldnt see. I was feeling giddy and started to laugh when I slammed into the front drivers quarter panel of the black SUV. I went over the handle bars and slid across the hood. Ah great, hood rats really loved their rides. *Burning tires for me*, I thought. At least sliding across the hood was better than slamming into pavement. I rolled off the hood onto the pavement on the passengers side, mostly on my feet. I was momentarily confused. *How had I managed to do that? Why wasnt I already dead? Hope theres a surveillance video, this would look great on social media* *or news media if they whacked me on the spot*. I steadied my stance and stood erect to see around me, looking desperately for a place to run. Big Ray unfolded himself from the passengers side of the SUV and Escorpion, Jaguars main enforcer, leapt from the drivers side, clearly infuriated. *Im* *fooked*! I thought. These guys were full on badassed murder for hire gangsters. Then, another door opened in another nearby wall and light once more spilled forth. It was the back door to a restaurant. I bolted toward it. I ran past a tired employee who splashed garbage on me as we lightly collided. Fortunately Big Ray was slow, in mind as well as body, so it took him a moment to register the situation, decide what to do, and act. Escorpion was not slow but he had tripped over the remains of my bike and was, even more pissed; *great*! I was definitely going to be tortured and eventually murdered. Still, I did my best to delay that fate as I dodged into the kitchen. The faintly fishy smell of Asian Cuisine nearly overwhelmed me as I dodged through the kitchen and I slipped and slid along on the wet floor. Big Ray wasnt so lucky. He slipped on the slick surface and fell. I looked back in time to see him catch his fall on his right hand. His gun hand. I knew it was his gun hand because it was filled with a gun! However, I could see the pain on his face as his arm gave way. Apparently 350 lbs. coming down on a wrist joint may cause it to break. I didnt know whether to cheer or cry; another broken bone on my tab with these guys. I almost took a wrong turn into a storage area but an employee was in the way. He gawped at me, jaw hanging loose and hands fumbling with the items he carried. I slowed and carefully entered the dining area of the restaurant. I didnt want more attention and I knew that Escorpion was unlikely to shoot me in the middle of a restaurant with ten or fifteen witnesses. At least thats what I hoped. As I passed the aquarium near the front entrance, **Wham! Wham! Wham! Wham!** bullets impacted the glass and the water and the poor fish burst out onto the floor; *better them than me* I thought as I ducked and scampered around the front wall and out the front door. Escorpion hadnt needed to chase me into the dining area, he had simply stopped at the kitchen doorway and sent bullets to do his work. I ran out onto the sidewalk. The light was better to my right, so I took off in that direction. I didnt care where I was going, just away from the bullets and murderous thugs. I expected either Escorpion or Feo to run over me at any moment. I took a few more turns and finally had to slow to catch my breath, I wasnt a runner. I saw a patch of darkness to my right and heard the rush of water. It was one of those pedestrian bridges over a drainage creek. *Right direction* The lights on either end were out and the shadows were deep but I needed to get out of the way of the hunters. A little darkness might be my friend. I crossed out onto the bridge and paused. I leaned on the rail, just catching my breath. As the harsh sounds of my own breathing faded back to normal, I heard a new sound from under the bridge. My first thought was, *druggie camp*! but the sounds did not seem natural. The chill came into me and stayed in my bones. I heard wet, slavering noises coming from just over the edge of the rail. A heavy panting and intake of breath into enormous lungs. The drop-off was a good twelve or more feet to the water in the creek, yet the head that rose in the darkness to gaze at me from just under the rail was clearly attached to a body that stood in the water. The heavy, slime-covered hand that reached over the rail from the darkness, the hand with the foot-long, razor claws, was there to finish the job that Jaguars turds were unable to do. I backed against the opposite rail as though those few feet would make a difference to this gargantuan beast. *No place to flee; freezing was out of the question; FIGHT!* I had a knife No! I had a gun! I had no time to curse myself for not checking the thing earlier but it was now time to do or die! Fortunately the monster was in no hurry and although its blazing orange-yellow eyes reached to just below the rail, it had to awkwardly reach over the rail, like a small child reaching onto a counter to find a cookie. *Huge but not huge enough; maybe short arms, hard to tell with a blacker than black monster against a very dark backdrop.* *Prolly not too bright either*! I thought smugly, as I pulled the pistol from my pocket. I pointed at the eyes and started blazing away at the thing. *An actual troll from under a bridge,* my mind insanely gibbered. I fired the five remaining rounds into the lump of a face. *Six rounds between those and the one that had taken out Arania. The magazine would have held thirteen!* *Feo is truly a dumbass.* I was out of rounds and my sanity was soon to empty from my mind as the rounds had from the pistol. The hand had pulled back over the rail to shield what passed for a face on that thing. I flung the pistol over the rail in between where the eyes of the beast had resided. I heard the wet slap as it struck followed by a splash as the water absorbed and obscured that little piece of evidence. The sounds were probably my imagination as I was already at the far end of the bridge and beating feet toward the next working streetlight, my ears ringing from the gunshots. I again slowed to a walk after a few more turns. The chill had finally faded. I was getting pretty worn. However, Id figured out what to do; stay on the path of light. Follow the brightest lights on the pathway home. When I did this, all was well. When I was tempted to look into the shadows, dark figures with fiery eyes stared hatred and menace towards me and I caught the faint clatter of hooves and hard feet rapidly approaching; I may even have heard hounds baying... I followed the lights and I was at the edge of my neighborhood, just a few blocks from home, yeah, sure, the fosters the Hernes, had given me a home and I had just started to appreciate that for the first time in many years. Then the bright headlights blinded me and the roar of a pair of engines sounded as Feo and Escorpion closed in from a side street. I was in a brightly lit four-way intersection. *Great*! So close but it would end here, no way to avoid the showdown. No torture though, I decided as I pulled out my own knife, a long kitchen affair that I kept hidden in a leg sheath inside my pants leg. Escorpion piled out quickly, Big Ray rather slowly as he gingerly cradled his right wrist in a makeshift sling. Odd to see such a big man display vulnerability. Feo had picked up a new partner, so much for his, brother Arania. I couldnt recall this guys name, he looked like a rat that had decided to walk upright, grown to 56, and joined a street gang; like Splinter from that Mutant Turtle show. Feo smiled hideously through the new gap in his teeth, I toll you, you wuth gonna die. Escorpion gritted through his still intact teeth that were grotesquely covered with a gold grill, You fucked up my ride. I might have killed you quick but now you gotta pay. Big Ray just looked pained and serious but he gripped his pistol in his left hand. Splinter didnt have any particular axe to grind, he was just along for the hate-ride but he pointed a Tech-9 vaguely in my direction. They lined up in the street like some freakshow version of the Earps in an old Western movie. Escorpion gritted out in his best movie gunslinger voice, You put down that knife boy and come with us. You can ride with me in the car you fucked up. Big Ray may even let you sit on his lap. Feo gave what passed for a laugh with him, Splinter swallowed and gaped, and Big Ray looked confused and a little nervous. Then I saw that closing in faster than they were, was the Darkness. That stygian gloom again. The rumble and thunder of hooves and hard feet and the distant baying of hounds on the chase Shadowed figures took form and writhed and raised arms and hands and claws in a nightmare throng that crowded in behind the crew of killers. It took a moment for Einstein ur, Escorpion, to notice the changes. After a moment, just as he connected a synapse and started to speak, his comrades finally registered the encroaching darkness and the Figures within it. Again like a movie, they all turned around in unison and peered into the frantically dancing DARK that was upon them. A dark made up of hunters from the realm of nightmares. Blazing eyes, razor claws, and rows of gnashing teeth, heads crowned with antlers and horns, hard feet and hooves, so many of each, came into focus and sounds began to emerge from the maelstrom of inky figures. Grisly snapping and clashing, baying, snarling, howling, and a chittering laughter of pure devilish delight shattered the silence over Jaguars unheroic crew of hunter-killers. They screamed in unison and three of them fired the weapons they clutched. Feo had Aranias knife clutched in his good hand. He dropped it as his good hand fell limply to his side. I noticed a satisfying puddle form near his right boot The screaming abruptly halted, the other sounds faded and then stopped, but the darkness did not dissipate. An enormous figure stepped forward. His head was crowned in antlers, yet He was clearly a Man. The other Beings huddled in behind him, each anthropomorphic in some way. The giant pointed at the gangsters and His Minions swarmed forward to shred the would-be hunters with the teeth, claws, and other appendages of the True Hunters. When they were done, there was nothing but a few shreds of flesh and bone and satisfied belches could be heard from some of the Hunters and Hounds. Then the antler-crowned Hunter turned His head to face me. He rumbled in a thousand voices and one, Tonight you were to be Our prey. These mortal fools tried to take you in their own feeble version of the True Hunt. I give you credit for making it past midnight Since my Pack has satisfied Their hunger, you shall have a respite until the next Hunters Moon. Then at midnight, we shall resume this hunt and finish it. If you survive until dawn, you will be free I had no idea how to reply. I didnt even know if He wanted a reply. Then I realized what I was seeing and hearing; maybe all the pressure tonight had caused me to snap! Could be like I thought earlier, some type of drug on the knife or something someone slipped to me. This had to be a hallucination With that, the cacophony of hooves and hard feet and skittering claws began once more and the Darkness receded, to be replaced by a normal nightscape with all the light pollution a city boy could want. I stood there, astonished and Im sure gaping like a fool. After a while, I started to walk toward home but stopped by another spot first; my stash. I took out the jewelry that belonged to the fosters Mr. and Mrs. Herne. I stuffed it in my pockets and took it home and sneaked in through the front door. Mrs. Herne had left a dinner plate for me in the icebox. The next day I surreptitiously returned the pieces to Mrs. Hernes jewelry box. Over the next couple of weeks, I pretty much kept quiet and did some chores around the place. I avoided the streets and going into the nearby hood at all costs. I ran a few errands for the Hernes, mostly during the daytime. The gangs had likely returned to *bidness* as usual. The dent in Jaguars crew made him more interested in a peaceful solution. As a mere courier, Id been forgotten in the mix. I made no attempts to remind any of them that I existed. Apparently someone had stolen or just taken back the SUV and beater at the front of the neighborhood. Then one evening in early October, Mrs. Herne needed something from the store. It was only a few blocks, so I volunteered to go get it. No maam, I have some money, Ill get it for you. She smiled tightly and nodded, perhaps a hopeful look on her face; hope that I had turned a corner. Id come to realize that these people actually cared about me. For no reason other than that I existed and was a guest in their home. I had to stomp down my initially cynical thought of, *Suckers*! It was after dark but I didnt worry. The streets were well lit, at least on the path I needed to follow. I rode my new bike, a high quality one Id bought to ride come the next full moon... When I got back, the little house was dark and silent and I feared the worst. The Monsters! Shadow Fiends or mortal ones had decided to take me after all and had maybe taken or harmed the Hernes first! I crept up the front steps and as quietly as possible I opened the front door, it was unlocked, which was unusual. *Crap! Theyve already taken them!* I thought fearfully as I stepped in and quickly stepped to one side of the door, crouched and prepared A small group shouted, Happy Birthday!!! as the lights came up. I nearly fainted. It was a surprise eighteenth birthday party. The Hernes and a few of their relatives and friends greeted me. Mr. Herne took pity at the look on my face, swept me over to the punchbowl and handed me a cup. I hadnt had a birthday party, one that I was ready to appreciate, since my folks died. I wasnt quite sure how to act but I managed to get through the ordeal; I think I may even have had, just a little... fun? \*\*\*\* \* \*\*\*\* So now, here I am sitting in Centennial Park, one foot resting on my dark-painted bike. The night is clear and the air is crisp if not clean. The clock on my phone display indicates, 23:59. I had a small backpack with me. Just some things Id need to keep up the pace for the hopefully long night ahead. Id seriously considered just going down to the Army recruiter like Mr. Gosling had so many years previously; maybe The Hunt wouldnt follow me that far. Yet I had to see first. I had to know for sure that The Hunters were just in my mind. Something else had surely happened that night a month ago. Maybe Id outrun the turds and simply imagined the final confrontation. Maybe theyd caught me and I was in a coma dream. Maybe Id just freaked out and lost my mind Then I heard something in the distance a rumble, and then a thunder of hooves and hard feet and the baying of Hounds coming towards me through the scant trees of the city park time to ride!"
44,vulnerability,nosleep,The nicest man I ever met was in a mental health hospital.,1,ee8hf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ee8hf9/the_nicest_man_i_ever_met_was_in_a_mental_health/,2019-12-23 05:42:44,"No demonic tale on the shelf of a library can match the horrors of mental health. No ghost story from a friend of a friend can recreate the terror your own mind resenting you causes. I worked between those walls for two years. If I had done so for twenty more, I still wouldnt have gotten used to it. Mental health hospitals arent a place to go when you need to get better, just a place you go when you cant get any worse. A building of people who cant get any worse. Being the cleaner meant I didnt have to deal with the patients much. Id greet them whilst passing in the corridors and even make pleasant, ordinary small talk with some of the more social ones. They were the ones who surprised you when you were mopping up their blood the following morning after they made an attempt on their life. When thats your job, it takes awhile to realise that the man in the corner isnt a lunatic and the one you pass on the stairs isnt a psychopath. Theyre just like the man with the mop or the woman in the office. We dont choose our bodies and nor do we our minds. Paul taught me this. I was only a few weeks into my job when I met Paul. I was using my mop to push the bucket back to the storage room when I heard him. Hey, Mr Cleaner Man! I turned around to see a pudgy, bald, middle-aged man jogging towards me. He was slightly out of breath by the time he reached me. Despite his many tattoos, faintly visible through his white t-shirt and winding around his arms, he gave off no air of intimidation. Mind if I walk with you a while, Mr Cleaner Man? There was a childlike innocence in him when he spoke. He was a few inches smaller than me and had to look up slightly to make eye contact. I thought I should feel threatened, but he didnt seem to want a fight. Not with me, or worse, himself. He just stared through the suspense, waiting for my response. Yeah, sure. Im only going to the storage room. A brief look of excitement filled his face for a second before suppressing it and setting off beside me. I was almost paranoid by how friendly he was. He wanted to know about my day and told me about his. He asked me what I liked to do outside of work and I asked him what he liked about the clinic. Not all that much. We laughed as we arrived at the storage room. He thanked me for letting him tag along as I threw the mop into the corner. We shook hands before parting ways. Im Paul, by the way. You seem like a nice fella, Mr Cleaner Man. His words seemed completely transparent. There was no motive hiding behind him. Just a man, happy to be conversing. I found myself walking with Paul daily. We only saw each other during my minute-long journey to the storage room, but it never felt too short to have real conversation. I found out that Paul worked in a warehouse before having a mental breakdown in the midst of his divorce. The councillors tell him he cant leave whilst harbouring the risk of another suicide attempt. The worst part of the whole situation is how painfully aware Paul was of the wreck unfolding in his brain. I found a way of asking him how walking with a cleaner for barely sixty seconds effects the storm cloud above his mind. It saddened me to see his head droop as the usual, bubbling enthusiasm in his face grew still and cold. When I first met my wife, Ex-wife, I was a cleaner. Things were still nice then. If I can just walk with you for a minute whilst you hold that mop, I can pretend that theyre my hands keeping these floors clean, and at the end of the night, I can pretend that theyre my hands opening the doors to go back home to when... things were still nice. I felt my heart grow heavy as my brain rummaged, looking for words to say. No breakdown, mess or human under that hospital roof could express the loneliness in what had just left Pauls mouth. Paul, I.... The bubbling enthusiasm jumped back into his eyes. Dont let me depress you, Mr Cleaner Man. We dont talk long enough to spend our time sad! He firmly patted my back whilst hiding the sadness that simmered under his joyful, temporary facade. I liked Paul. I dont go out much and I dont even enjoy talking on the phone, but I never felt a conversation flow so freely than when it was with him. He was the weird kid in school you took under your wing to later realise their goldmine of a personality. After the first week we could ask about each others family members by name. After the first month we could mention important times in each others lives by the date. After a year, I saw him as a work friend. The best one Id met. He knew my name after the first day, but he still liked to call me Mr Cleaner Man. The only things I did in that hospital were exactly what I was told and talk to Paul, so when one of the councillors asked to see me, I had an idea of what it was about. Just take a seat here for me. Miss Lowden was a well dressed woman in her mid-fifties. She pulled up a chair for me and placed it by her desk. I felt I was receiving bad news at a doctors appointment. Now, I wont keep you too long. I just feel its important to address your relationships within this facility. She thought carefully and spoke slowly, almost as if she had no idea what word should come after the previous. I know what this is about, Miss Lowden, and I understand the concern, but me and Paul just talk. Nothing funny. My response lingered in the air as she processed what I just said. Paul... she continued, mentioning Pauls name like it was in a language she didnt speak. ... we feel is a part of your life that wont benefit you. You understand? My face mustve told her that I really didnt. Paul will likely lead to you making bad decisions. He may be a nice addition to your time here at the moment, but in the long run, wed dread to think of him bringing harm to you. Wow. I was surprised and saddened by the fact that even a councillor couldnt separate a troubled man from a dangerous one, but there we were. I completely understand, Miss. Ill be sure to keep this in mind from now on. Both were lies, but I had no interest in hearing what else she had to say. She didnt know Paul. I did. Well check up on your progress now and then to be sure further assistance isnt required. I left the room almost offended, knowing Id speak to Paul the next day. Mrs Lowden must have heard us talking from her office as we headed to the storage room before, so I made sure I took my time mopping the floor outside of Pauls room instead. What? Why would she think that? Ive never hurt anyone in here! I hated seeing such offence take over Pauls face. Stay inside your room. Ill talk from out here. I murmured as I continued mopping the floor to disguise our conversation. Theyre control freaks, Paul. They enjoy telling us what to do. I need this job, but not for them to decide my friends. I continued. Pauls face lit up in a small glow of pride at my use of the word friend. It was the first time Id called him one to his face. The glow suddenly dimmed into an emotion Id never seen within him before: pure anger. How can that bitch be so cruel? She deserves to be in here, not me! I watched him pace his room with his arms folded tightly. I quietly matched his rage. I saw the exact second an idea locked itself into Pauls brain. He froze before throwing his stare in my direction, smirking in excitement. Ive got it. Ive got it, Mr Cleaner Man! I wouldve matched his enthusiasm too if there wasnt a slight tinge or fear entwined with my anticipation. He turned to face me, taking a step closer. Cut my wrists! I prayed to find a sliver of humour in his eyes. What? How would that help anything? I noticed Id stopped mopping in my shock. Nothing will happen if I complain about Miss Lowden in here. Shell only find out. If I show you how to cut my wrists and make it look bad, Ill be taken to A&amp;E. Theyll listen there! His eyes told me that he genuinely believed what he was saying. Paul, this is ridiculous! Why do you need me to do it? Because I trust you, Mr Cleaner Man. Much more than myself. I didnt discard his words to be those of madness, but rather desperation. Im not going to hurt you, Paul. Im sorry. Ill come back and see you soon. Dont do anything stupid! I pointed at him like a teacher scolding a child. I stabbed the bucket with my mop and set off down the corridor. It felt strange not having him beside me. Think about it, Mr Cleaner Man! We could take her down together! The words echoed from his room as I stared ahead, begging that the double doors serval yards in front of me would come sooner. Im almost ashamed to say that I spent the next few weeks avoiding Paul. Id tiptoe whilst passing his room and I deliberately changed my cleaning routine to avoid an encounter. Miss Lowden called me into her office a few times during that period, but only for me to say things were going well then be dismissed by her. I wasnt scared of Paul, just concerned about how our friendship effected him. It was just over two weeks when I found the courage to talk to him again. My plan was to clean outside his room early in the morning and wait until he woke up. My plan didnt go well. I was hardly by his door when it opened a few inches and a hand shot out, grabbing me by the collar and dragging me inside. I regained my balance to see Paul stood there, excitement consuming his presence as he hid his hands behind his back. Hey... Paul.... Howre you doing? I felt my vulnerability prepare me to run if needed. I have it, Mr Cleaner Man. I have it! Look! Paul revealed a thin, sharp, plastic object from behind his back. No bigger than 6 inches with a light green and dark blue design swirling up it. What have you done, Paul? I felt my shoulders hunch and my head lower as I instinctively leaned back. Not bad, is it? It was a toothbrush. I was up all night, sharpening it against the walls. Remember the plan I had? He spoke as if I wasnt completely against the idea just weeks ago. He held out the toothbrush with one hand for me to grab, followed by the other with his wrist exposed. Do it, Mr Cleaner Man. Its the right thing to do. He began edging towards me. Stop it, Paul. Just let me get back to work. Closer. Well look back in pride. You know you have to, Mr Cleaner Man. Closer. He grabbed my hand and tried to wrap it around the toothbrush. I tugged him towards me and began wrestling him for the sharp object. I could hear were the squeaks of our shoes against the floor and the grunts as I tried to both gain control of the homemade knife and keep it away from both our torsos and throats. I forced Paul to the floor, only to have him put his foot against my stomach and kick me away. I fell back against the closed door as Paul used the walls to scramble to his feet, still armed with the weapon. We were so close, Mr Cleaner Man. Now youll have to wait until next time. Goodbye, Paul. He placed the sharp end of the tooth brush just below his left ear before forcing it into his flesh and slicing to his right. Paul! Stop! Blood sprayed across the room, leaving splatters on my trousers and shoes. He fell backwards against the wall and slid back to the ground, his eyes open but body lifeless. I thought off all the times I had to clean such a mess up. I swung the door open and stumbled down the corridor, leaving bloody footprints behind me. I burst into Miss Lowdens office and was met by her startled, concerned gaze looking up from paperwork. Paul cut his own throat! Hes lying in his cell! Hes not moving! I blurted as I felt my knees tremble and saw my world grow blurry with tears. Calm down! Just calm down! Look at me! Mrs Lowden stood up and walked around her desk to stand in front of me. Its my fault... oh god, its all my fault! I felt my stability sinking through my fingers. You need to tell me what happened. She tried to sit me down. Pauls dead! I screamed before falling into the chair and sobbing into my forearms upon my lap. It mustve been more than a minute before I heard the words that would scramble my reality and tear apart any grasp I had of it. Well done, Paul. I looked up to see Miss Lowden smirking. A mix of pride and satisfaction was chiseled into her face. What? I felt the shake in my voice. Ive worked with a lot of patients suffering from split personality disorder, Paul, even some with schizophrenia too. Very few have made a breakthrough quite as significant as this. She put her hand on my shoulder. You should be proud of yourself, Paul. The word no gently rolled out of my mouth. I looked down at my shoes and trousers to realise that Pauls blood was gone. I leaned out of the doorway and saw no red footprints leading to where I stood, just a cleaner, a stranger, mopping the floors. Whats happening to me? Why are you calling me that? I staggered backwards until I was against Miss Lowdens wall. Youve made progress, Paul. This man, this other version of you was a dangerous part of your life. All your troubles resided in him. Just because he wasnt real for everyone doesnt mean he wasnt real for you. This couldnt have been real. It was too sick to be a joke but too awful to be a nightmare. I felt the past few years of my life spiral through my mind. I realised I couldnt remember the last time I was home. I walked back to Pauls room, Miss Lowden following, trying to explain further. There was no one inside. All the furniture was the way it was left. The way it was left by me. I remember sitting on the bed I thought was Pauls, and life just... kept moving. If you strung together every word I said in the month that followed, youd barely make a sentence out of it. I grimaced every time someone called me Paul for awhile. It was a few weeks before it felt like my name again. I slept very little in a room I didnt even know was mine. I spoke with Miss Lowden every day as she explained that the man I saw was a hallucination, a personification of a small but negative part of my mind. Other sufferers see several of their negative emotions in the forms of people and I was being evaluated further to be sure that Paul was alone. I came to learn that I hallucinated a lot of my time in the hospital. It wouldve been harmful to tell you. We could only help. Everything he did was a hallucination. Everything he did to you or you to him, you did to yourself. It was your back you were patting and your hand you were shaking. She told me this, making me shiver at the echoing memory of Pauls last request. Cut my wrists! I didnt tell anyone about that. All I wanted to do was get out of that hospital and I knew that would only cause further evaluation. It was just under three months when I was deemed stable enough to leave, and in a bizarre way, I didnt want to go without my friend. I went back to the home I used to share with my ex-wife and was reminded of the understanding Paul gave me. It was a bond Id never feel with anyone else. Apparently your mind is capable of tricking you into believing that youre in a much happier time whilst in complete turmoil. My mind didnt trick me into thinking I was still a cleaner, it tricked me into thinking things were still nice. I wondered if I ever was to find myself slowly sinking into the darkness within my thoughts again, would Paul come back? Would someone else appear? I still dream about walking with him in those corridors every night and replay all our conversations from the first to the last. I wake up retelling jokes and repeating advice I gave him. I always listen for his response. That Pauls gone now. Hes just a time in my life that Ill have to brush over when meeting new people and making new friends. Pauls gone, but something else isnt. When I sit up in bed, quoting my old self, I normally turn over to face the night again, but sometimes, I dont hear, but I feel a response. A little storm cloud growing above mind. A wreck unfolding. I recognise its words but its a different tone this time, and its getting louder. Getting realer. Hey, Mr Cleaner Man."
45,vulnerability,nosleep,A Christmas Suicide,1,ef8hba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ef8hba/a_christmas_suicide/,2019-12-25 10:01:27,"December arrived quickly, as if on the heels of June, and I found myself again without holiday plans of any sort. I have no real family with which to spend time, and my friendsthe few that remainhave families of their own, and I wouldnt dare intrude upon their homes during these times. And even then, friend is a term for my own benefit; if you were to ask them about me, Im sure theyd have polite words, but would regard me more as a sustained associatea coworker with whom theyd spent minimally casual time outside of work. Fortunately, for people like me, bars exist and burn their lanterns brightly on the night before Christmas, inviting all despondent spirits to come and drink. I visited one about ten minutes away from my home, going there via ride-share, so that I could drink myself into a stupor and not worry about remaining sober enough to travel back home and risk an accident. I arrived at around 4pm, when the shifts swapped and the night servers more attractive, for obvious reasonstook their place. Most were familiar with me, and they provided me with my drink of choice without my having to ask. I drank slowly, wanting to coast on the buzz until later in the night, when the festive patrons arrived, and intoxication would be necessary so as to facilitate the introduction a more friendly, social version of myself. I had a beer of a middling alcohol volume, which would be followed by shots of the cheapest whiskey with the highest ABV. The hours flew past me, and I felt the warmth start in my belly and rise upward until I was flush with the fire of inebriation, and the bar filled with people celebrating the Eve. I was not overtly bothered, for which I was grateful, but neither was I ignored; pats on the back were issued to me by nearby patrons, and toasts were made, some intelligible, others garbled. I chose not to order food, even when offeredpeople were being particularly generousdue to the inhibiting effect it would have upon my perpetual plunge into intoxicant depths. Coeval with my dive, was a feeling that appeared as something awoken, rather than born of the situation. A feeling that had dwelt within me for the last few years, but never reared its head to the forefront of my mind. Instead, manifesting in smaller ways, altering my mood or influencing my decisions of a social nature. The feeling, as best as I can describe it, is one of self-loathing. A sort of subsuming hatred for my existence, where I for the first time realized that, as a person of twenty-four years, I was incredibly inconsistent, irresponsible, and, at times, inimical towards the lives of others, in petty, weasel-like ways. The feeling first matched then surpassed my intoxication, so that I was drunk on inwardly-directed ire, giddy with desires of immediate self-termination. It seemed that Id at last solved a mystery with which I had been unconsciously contending, for years, and could now move onto to something elsenamely, the commission of my death. I had never before been suicidal, or considered any sort of self-harm, so there was a sort of peculiar excitation about contemplating the method by which Id do myself in. I mustve looked weird, then, going from a somewhat sullen, half-spirited man slouched at the bar to the upright-sitting, broadly-smiling man Id become. A man next to me, who Id only noticed in that peripheral, apathetic way one notices others at the bar, asked me what had altered my mood. The bar roared with Christmas music, conversation, and random bursts of cheers, so I felt no need to lower my voice, and said to him plainly aloud, Ive figured out whats been bothering me. I hate myself! I think, after I finish this drink, Im going to pay my tab and go kill myself! Although drunk on two different intoxicants, I still had enough sense to expect some sort of disgusted or surprised reaction from this stranger, but to my surprise he didnt react anything like that. He looked into my eyes, nodded, then took a heavy gulp of his drink. He then motioned for the bartender to close his tab, then looked back at me and said, Well, would you like some help? Again, the surprise was mine, and I involuntarily and incredulously laughed at his proposal. I repeated an abridged version of my previous statement, considering maybe that he hadnt heard me clearly, but he again nodded and offered his assistance. I looked away, letting the gravity of the situation sink in, and an *almost* sobering wave of some indescribable emotion passed through me. The mans offer, which apparently had been genuine, brought an unexpected **reality** to my feelings. I silently asked myself if my feelings were sincere, and if they were, could I go out like thatassisted in suicide by a stranger from a bar, on Christmas Eve? The alcohol, that ever-nudging friend, dissuaded the pesky inhibition of animal self-preservation, and after paying my tab I found myself walking down the street with the stranger who would help in effecting my demise. The streets were mostly bare, with any shops that remained open having little or no customers. Buildings were decorated festively, and lights illuminated the rain-sodden pavement with dizzying iridescence. My partner in soon-to-be crime strode soberly beside me, clearly better at handling his inebriation. Occasionally others stumbled past, equally or more drunk than I, onto destinations hopefully less final than my own. It wasnt until we had walked for about twenty minutes or so that I thought to ask where we were going. He told me there was a good place to do it, where we wouldnt be observed, and if we were, wouldnt be bothered or reported. I didnt consider the suggestions of how he knew of such of placeI had no reason to care, and didnt inquire further. We arrived at a beach, and from there walked along its shore until we reached a dilapidated pier which extended far beyond the shore, reaching over the night-blackened waters. We walked over the pier, which bore our weight silently, until we reached its edge, and from there we sat beside each other on the damp planks. The man removed something from the pocket of his jacket, and placed it in his lap. Although shapes had already started to shift in my drunken vision, I could tell through the murk that it was a firearm of some sort. Are you ready? His words were melancholic, but sure, without any tones of hesitation. He was prepared to perform the act, but was I? I again went through that re-examination of my motivations; telling myself that if considerable doubt arose, I would postpone the deed, apologize to the man profusely, and hope that he did not splatter my brains just for wasting his time. After all, what kind of person would offer to help someone kill themselves on Christmas Eve? But no doubt came. I was granted a strange certainty about it all, a resolve towards meeting my end that triumphed over the ingrained self-defense mechanisms of my animal brain. I nodded in acceptance, and he rose and stood behind me. He told me to think of everything which upset me about my life, so that in those last micro-seconds of existence I did not regret my choice and jerk awaypotentially ruining the attempt and leaving myself in some unforeseen agony. So, I did. Staring out at the softly rolling waves, I thought of my pointless, insubstantial life, of the time Id spent living without virtue, committing dubiously-ethical or outright immoral acts for no real reason beyond boredom or malicious curiosity. I thought of the people Id disappointed, the people whose lives I couldve made better by simply acknowledging them in a world that hadnt, and all the other social situations in which Id failed to be a decent, considerate human being. The flames of my self-loathing were stoked until they burned as a great, hateful conflagration, and I found myself happily awaiting the deathblow which would send me bullet-first into unending, subsuming oblivion. Blackness, sudden and total, arrived in the middle of my dark elation. Slowly, the blackness ebbed into a softer, less dominant darkness, though I could discern nothing amidst the void. Then, over the course of what couldve been minutes or hours, a sense of spatial awareness came to me, and I came to place myself within a vast expanse of nothing; a lone speck in a gulf of ever-receding shadow. My self-hatred, which had been so fiery in what still felt like just moments before, had been completely extinguished and replaced by a sense of eerie vulnerability. I felt acutely exposed, visible to things I hadnt yet come to know, susceptible to strange and malign forces beyond the pitifully mundane knowledge of Man. Then, as if to confirm my ominous suspicions. I felt the introduction of unseen presences into the darkness. I was still blind to everything about the area, but felt the void become occupied by things other than myselfthings which, somehow, I knew to be much larger, and much older, than anything of terrestrial origin. These entities, I felt with terrible certainty, had become aware of me upon my placement in this Chthonic domain, and had turned their attention from other, assuredly sinister matters to me. My instincts, which had before been placated or usurped by my self-destructive desires, resumed their autonomous control of my body, driving me to try and flee from whatever obscene things lurked beyond the bounds of visual perception. But even as I ran blindly through that black expanse, I felt that I made no progress, covered no measurable ground at all, and simply ran in place; as if tethered to the spot at which Id initially arrived. I eventually tired myself out and sat down, feet out and hands at my side. Subsequently, what Id hope would not happen, happened, and in what wouldve elsewhere been the sky I saw a massive, looming form. As time passed, the form clarified minutely, until I could make out a sky-spanning face, decidedly inhuman, and peering down at me with an awful malignity. The face, which appeared as if a thousand clouds had been shaped into some monstrous visage, seemed attached to a greater body beyond, nearly imperceptible in the gloom, though I gleaned from its proportions that it was of a size beyond worthwhile contemplation; a super-massive bulk which could threaten in sheer enormity any planet. Then, impossibly, horribly, the face of this great body began to shift, altering its features quickly, at varying rates, so that it looked as if it suffered some celestial strokerounded and curved ridges, which suggested a mouth, twitched and parted, while bulbous mounds in the organization of eyes cycled violently. To my horror, I even recognized a few faces among the chaotic swapping, even though I knew for a fact that I'd never seen them before; the visages of a classically-painted Satan, a grimly-leering genocidal dictator, the hideous and spherical countenance of that cosmic horror, *Yog-Sothoth*, the smug and sinister face of *The Black Horologist....* The shifting form, never settling on a single appearance, but alternating between monstrous amalgamations of several, drew nearer, until I beheld each and every infernal detail of it. When nothing but the undulating, swelling, and surging surface of its cloud-like face could be seen, I was broken; my mind shattered in black terror at the maleficently-peering face, and consciousness was fortunately swept from me. I awoke staring at another, more familiar blackness; the similarly-shifting black waters beyond the pier. I sat there, still petrified by the fright of what Id just experienced. When this subsided, I cautiously looked around, and saw my forgotten companion standing a few feet behind me, the weapon in his hand. He smiled down at me, and offered me a hand. I took it, and unsteadily rose to my feet with his help. I stared at him for a bit, and he did not speak, but returned my ponderous gaze with one of deep kindness. Finally, I asked what Id experienced, and he explained what happened. He had shot me, as Id requested, but not with a bullet, and not with a gun of any normal design. He told me that what Id been shot by was actually a potent and definitely illegal hallucinogenicinstantly-acting and incredibly powerful. Before I could ask why, he stopped me, and told me to look around. Confused, but for the time being compliant, I did as he commanded. And what I saw, what I felt, was so radically different from what Id seen before entering the apparent hallucination. Before, I had looked upon the world through the eyes of a forlorn and dejected wretch, but now, after the nightmarish hallucination, everything was given a completely added aspect of life and substance. Even the dreary environs of the beach and nearby buildings were given a fresh, almost animate vitality. The world felt like it had gained some soul or spirit about it that Id failed to observe and appreciate before. I felt in that moment so hilariously inexperienced, so ignorant of pleasures, knowledge, and relations that I was earlier so willing to stupidly reject. It took a willful effort to return my attention to the man, who stared at me happily. He asked if I understood, and I told him that I did, explaining how the black reverie in which Id come literally face to face with that Stygian horror of face-shifting doom gave me a new appreciation for our mundane world and life. He clapped me on the back, holstered his weapon, and together we walked away from the pier and the churning black waters, heading into a world where Id remake myself into a better, more appreciative person. A person who would from now on try to see the good and wholesome elements of the world, and bring joy to the lives of others."

We learned swiftly that there are a finite number of weapons inside an enclosed ship, including our own body parts, as well as more abstract weapons, like psychological tactics, or violently shaking the ship with the ships yoke, and that tying up a person who doesnt want to be tied up can be annoyingly elbow-jabbing. Youd also think it would be easier to fly a space ship, what with modern autopilot, but nope, the captains brain is extremely valuable in this respect, especially in deep space with no communication to any ground control, and when the captain is tied up and laughing maniacally and death is far from *last* on his priorities death explosive, spectacular, like evil, colorful fireworks dragging his crew to the depths of hell with him, hold on okay, a bit of turbulence we think we have some sort of control of this fucking tin canwere not un-bright, albeit crew members and not trained in the intricate function of flying where are Han Solo and Chewbacca when you need them?  the way a child craves sending bottle rockets into a July 4th sunset, might be how the captain wants us to plummet into the sun or some asteroidnot important, right now, hes already tied up, shackled, and slapped into silliness, which is a step down from his maniac-level cackling, but were on some sort of track here, so let me take a breath and tell you why were in space. Hey, there. Gambling? Risk? Danger? What brings me to this point well, the most dangerously risky pursuit there is brought me to this point, not mine, though, our friend the captains the pursuit of lovehis love. His true love. His one true love. This was the goal of the mission: love. Out in deep space, to which we rocketed out to find *her*. To save *her*. To bring her home safely, and to be held cozily by the fire. But what we find out halfway through the mission, is that you cant saveor bring backeven in deep space, someone who doesnt want to be with you. So here we are flinging ourselves to the edge of the universe to win her back the captains lost love. But shes not a lost love. She doesnt love him. Hes delusional. (And tied up.) Does she even exist? (None of this sounds surprising to me. Maybe hes not insane. Is not a break up the most painful experience most people experience? Many of which are people wandering around like ghosts, wisps of past love emanating off their ghostly selves, unable to be reborn.) Entering the flow state: the perfect, glowing, pure feeling of optimal risk. Martinez started playing the electric guitar. Bending the air molecules into a stampede of musical cloudinessthe sounds massaged the moment into a spectacular symphony of joy-despair. Starting to feel like theres too much oxygen, or not enough now. Here we go. Everyone finds love. No they dont. Martinez, did you find love? (Why is there always a space crew member named Martinez?) Martinez: No. Me: Thats not the best attitude. Not for nothing the captain (nicknames include cappy or cap) wrote *The Fires of Ambition will Eat you Alive* in green alien-blood on the walls of his office someone check the knots? Tight enough? Whered the green alien blood come from? Hmm this would account for that alien-cow we picked up that disappeared. And that strange dinner the captain cooked for his birthday. Dont leave me out. What do we do to not be left out. That is the saddest thing in the world. Dont leave me out of life. Thats sort of what the heart says when youve lost love. What was deep space but the deep wound, the wound of lost love. How far would you travel to get her back? It doesnt matter. She doesnt want you. I dont think you understand how painful a breakup is, said the captain, tied up real good. Unrequited love is the Super Bowl of pain. It drives men mad, up the wall, and into the abyss of insanity. The least I could do was go insane and take you all down to a fiery death with me. See thats where I think I disagree, I pointed out. Im not ready to die, even it looks like beautiful fireworks. I have a couple more things I want to try in life. Ive never even swam with dolphins at one of those beach resorts. Sure, life has its downsides: the deep, structural unfairness of life: death and its annihilation of all memory; love that is fundamentally unrequited for arbitrary reasons; the impenetrable mystery of life that leads us to walk blithely off cliffs; the unbridgeable gap between humans on the other hand Alien: \[looking up from eating sandwich\] Martinez: whered you get that sandwich? Alien: Its also the great locale for that great delicious pain the pain of love, the beating heart, the power the makes blood flow the ocean of riptides of heart-titanic-sunken-depths-where-sharks-wildly-swim-around-sniffing-the-blood-of-broken-hearts-ravenousy-pursuing-your-little-seashell-collecting-scuba-suited-body. *At least* the unrequitedness love gives life meaning at least theres a hole in the heart to be filledangels might not exist but snow angels do. The pain is the goal. Floss the teeth of the shark, is what I say. The truth is it wasnt day 14 of day 30. It was year 15 of infinity. Infinite blackness. This was the ship of the death-pursuing, broken-hearted. Of the rejected and dejected, collected to be slung-shot across the universe into some asteroid field off a fading star system, shredded back into stardust. Captain: The truth is Im mired in guilt. She left me because of my dumb, selfish actions. I have no one to blame but myself. \[Now Joey is on the acoustic, the twinge of thick feelings, melancholically bouncing around the metal interior with every strum. Note to self: what is a guitar, anyway? Its a piece of wood you tie strings to and pluck the strings, dislodging a cascade of air molecules which create vibrations in peoples skulls, causing them to dance? Figure this out later. Its not possibly were dead already, right? Alien: doubtful. I feel alive. I feel alive when death is near. This is your captain speaking: what the fuck do you know about unmourned grief? This is your crew speaking: You dont think weve all been there? Abjectly devaluing oneself in a self-flagellating paroxysm of monstrous embarrassment? Weve all been there, bud. We want to live. Unseen and unknown depths made themselves known on the radar with bleeps, bloops, and blim-bops. Sirens, whistles, bells made themselves audibly knownapparently were out of gas, out of luck, out of the patterns and thought-structures that normally construct what is called sanity. Aint gonna be no self-incineration. Self-immolation. Self-annihilation. We want to live. Lchaim. To life. Doubt that the stars are fire (Shakespeare). Waking up in the middle of the night, fire-lusts conflagrating inside. Fire meets fire is love. Alien: Tell me about earth. A blue-green marble. Where truly sweet, kind, innocent people were subtly and prolongingly humiliated and tortured for nothingbut where also joy, happiness, and goodness and magic usually won in the long run, and on and on it again went. (Alien: funny little animals, humans.) Was I deep? Had I loved deeply enough to be considered deep, or had I been not deep enough to love deeply? What is depth? When hell looks you in the eye, there is the revelationthe glimmerof the sea of vulnerability that effervescently flashes a crack of light behind the pose. This is it, gents. Was it worth it?"
47,vulnerability,nosleep,Im here to warn you,1,egqxyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/egqxyz/im_here_to_warn_you/,2019-12-29 00:50:19,"There are unspoken rules in every part of life, some more important than others. Some of these rules could even cost you your life. And youve been slipping up. You used to be good at sticking to the rules when you were younger, but every year youve gotten gradually worse. Yes, thats right. Ive been watching you since you were a young child. Its my job to make sure you follow the rules. But youre not following them. When you were a child, I watched you spend countless nights, hidden in bed with the covers over your head, pretending you were sleeping. I saw you run as fast as you could up the stairs, as if you were being chased. And I was there when you were too scared to leave your bed after a nightmare. You see, that was good. Fear is necessary in life, it keeps humans like yourself safe. Those things Ive just mentioned that you did, were just a few of the rules you followed. You followed them because you were scared. But as youve gotten older, youve started to slip up. Youre not as scared as you used to be. Or, youre trying to convince yourself you arent. You try to tell yourself theres nothing to be scared of, but deep down you know there is. And although you ignore some of the rules. Sometimes at night Ill see the fear on your face as you read countless scary stories, trying to convince yourself they arent real. But on nights like those, the mask drops. You become vulnerable, scared. As you were growing up, that was enough to make you hide under the covers again, pretending to sleep. But now it isnt, not anymore. You stay on your phone, scrolling through posts. But the vulnerability stays. And its getting stronger. You tell yourself you dont need to do the silly things you did when you were little. But you do. Those are the rules. Youre not following the rules. The rules keep you safe. Youre protected when you follow them, all of them. But when you make yourself vulnerable, I get stronger. Because when youre not following the rules, I feed on your fear. I wouldve gotten you by now. But you see, there are certain rules I must follow too. 1. I cannot do anything to you if you follow the rules. 2. If you dont follow the rules, I can only harm you if you are scared, and vulnerable. Youre scared now, reading this. That was the whole point of this message to you. I wanted to make you scared, and as I watch you now, from the corner of the room I can sense the fear. No, dont bother looking at the corner of the room, you cant see me. Yet. But I can see you, and I always have. And very soon, youll be able to see me too. Its too late for you now, and Im getting much stronger. So Im here to warn you, youre about to die."
48,vulnerability,nosleep,Stay on the Straight and Narrow and Seek the Light or Else!,1,egwnvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/egwnvg/stay_on_the_straight_and_narrow_and_seek_the/,2019-12-29 08:37:50,"Stay on the Straight and Narrow and Seek the Light or Else! \- Bear Lockhart / Bear Lair 64 *Ha*! I was a snotty and cynical piece of crap at age seventeen. I wasnt dumb like so many other punks my age. I had managed to avoid juvie, though not foster parents. I had no say in the latter. I wasnt born into tragedy or a broken home, just normal folks who lived and worked in the big city. They also died in that city in an apartment fire; so the tragedy and broken home hadnt come until I was eleven. Real shame, they were nice people and no, I didnt have a hand in it. I was riding bikes down at the local park with some of my friends. We all hooped and yelled as the fire trucks and ambulances rolled by the playground. Then another group of them passed; something big. One of my friends pointed toward the area where my home was and at the black billowing column of smoke that rose in the clear, early summer sky. Other buildings obscured a direct view but the direction he pointed was about right for the apartment complex where I lived. I looked over my shoulder: *cant be; close, but no way; bet mom and dad have a great view though*, I tried to convince myself. After a short discussion, we decided to ride down to see for ourselves; several of us lived at the same apartment complex and we eyed one another in concern. One of the boys said excitedly, Maybe its the school! The rest of us cheered but I already knew better. I had that sensation of my heart sinking in my chest. This was about to be the worst day of my life so far but hey, I was only eleven and a half, many years ahead. As we got closer, I tore out ahead of the rest, my legs pumping the peddles as hard as I could. The entire building was engulfed. There were several residents standing around, some in shock, some craning for a view into the dark orange flames and black, oh so black smoke. I looked and called for my folks. When I didnt see them, I started to run toward the building but one of our neighbors, an older man, Mr. Gosling, grabbed me. Stop Robby. You cant do anything there but get hurt. I strained for a moment but then collapsed back against him. *Maybe they were not inside, maybe theyd gone out*, I thought desperately looking for an escape from the horrid reality before my senses. Mr. Gosling patted my shoulder, Youre safe Robby, well have to wait and see. Im sure your parents are safe too. Ill wait with you. The rest of it is just stuff, its lives that matter. I dont think I ever really thanked him for that. He was a nice old man, retired from the Army, always polite to mom... They werent safe. No one who had been inside that building at 2:36 PM that day was. Some kind of gas leak, I never really cared to learn; I know only that it took my folks from me. The rest of that day and many to follow was a blur. The survivors *refugees!* were put into a shelter. I was a juvenile but with all the mess and it being late on a Saturday, Child Protective Services let Mr. Gosling take responsibility for me and help find my next of kin. The only ones I knew of were an aunt and uncle on moms side, her sister. Dads folks were dead and he was an only child. Moms lived across the country and we heard from them only on Birthdays and Holidays. So, I ended up with Aunt Tabitha and Uncle James; at least for the summer. They decided that they just couldnt take care of a mopey, sometimes angry, tween and just after the funeral my far away grandparents had gone silent and remained far away and unreachable. So, I entered the loving arms of the government. I know, you expect me to relate horror stories of abusive foster parents and give excuses for why I turned out to be such a turd (*in a sing-song, pathetic falsetto:* Oh poor me, I was put through an uncaring system and treated savagely, its not my fault that I now steal and deal drugs) Nope! My parents were good people and raised me to pity victims rather than want to be one. Besides, most of the, fosters were okay, despite being involved with government. I was the one who caused the problems. I did everything I could to keep each of them at a distance from day one. My stays usually lasted around six months. The ones that went longer had to do with CPS having to find fosters who were willing to take on a, problem child. Most of them just wanted the extra income that the state paid for being, as their advertisements claimed, Caring Foster Parents for Children in Need. That didnt make them bad people but I never stayed in a mansion or even a nice suburb. I didnt care. I didnt need anyone, I could take care of myself. I developed a detachment from possessing material goods once all of mine had been instantly destroyed, yet I enjoyed the finer things and having them, at least temporarily until I could find a direct buyer or a fence. I think that the loss of my personal property caused me to lose empathy regarding, things. I didnt value property, why should anyone else? That made it easier to steal, it was after all, just, stuff as Mr. Gosling had said. It was hard at first to turn over items for a profit but I learned. I also learned not to steal from fosters unless I was ready to kick rocks. I didnt get into dope or booze, Id lived around enough rough neighborhoods to see what it did to people. However, Id picked up some friends who were dealers and not averse to teaching a juvie how to, hold for them and later to transport. By age seventeen, I still rode bikes and I wasnt scared of much. Losing all the people for whom you truly care can free one from fear. Whats left, my life? What adolescent truly values his life? Its why the military hires teens: no decent sense of self-preservation. So, I put mine at risk regularly. Transporting drugs was easier, less risky on a day-to-day basis, and more profitable than thievery. Not that I stopped stealing entirely, sometimes an item was too nice and too easily obtained by way of careless former owners to pass. All of the fosters eventually knew me as a thief and a liar and the religious ones hammered at me about getting on, the straight and narrow path or looking for the Light but none ever caught on to the drug smuggling for murderous gangsters. The dealers liked me. I was never curious as to what I carried or what, bidness they might be doing. I dressed like any innocent kid, no tattoos, piercings, freaky hair, or anything that would draw official attention or adult ire. I had the good sense to ride safely and I could lie like a rogue; someone once told me I had innocent eyes; whatever, as long as they helped me weasel out of trouble. So thats the general scoop. I was happy that I would soon be free of the foster care system and CPS. I was ready to close out the current, last fosters, so I took some items from the ladys jewelry box, a big, gaudy wooden thing with carved curvy knots and vines interwoven all over the polished surface. Too bad Id have to leave it in place, I knew a fence who would pay well for that: it would re-sell as a storage box for some rich dudes personal stash of drugs or his little equalizer. While these fosters hadnt been thumpers, they were still, straight and narrow types when it came to moral behavioral issues. Shed prattled on about being second generation something or other. He hadnt said much about his background but I knew, the look, the one that grown men gave me; a mix of pity, disgust, and contempt, I genuinely didnt care what they or anyone thought of me. Who were they to judge? They claimed to be Roman Catholic but I never saw them go to mass, nor had they ever dragged me to church for which I was grateful; Id prolly catch fire or something. The items in her jewelry box were real gold and silver and the stones in them looked real as well; no wonder I never saw her wear them, shed definitely be robbed. Most were artwork pieces, including one unpolished, greenish stone, narrow and a couple of inches long. It looked like a little pecker; weird, probably just sentimental value but it was on a solid gold chain. Who knows, maybe her people had stolen this stuff? Not that I needed any justification other than my own desires. At any rate, it should have been a while before she noticed. By then Id be eighteen and on my own. I hadnt had a chance to get rid of the loot but it was well hidden and would soon pay for my own travels. I made good money as a courier between gangs and other crooks, though I had decided that I wanted to look into other criminal activity, maybe cyber crimes. I had learned to fight on the street and thanks to the philosophy of some of my fosters that martial arts would teach me, discipline. I worked hard at it and I became a very disciplined criminal. These days I carried a knife on me at all times since being a courier could be dangerous; but I knew that robbing people or burglarizing homes was super high risk and if I had to cut anybody, Id be tracked down like a dawg. So many choices though. At just shy of eighteen years, I knew that I absolutely had more wisdom than anybody else. Had to, so many had let me steal from them. Id skated past the scrutiny of every adult until I chose to get caught. No foster had ever turned me in to, the authorities, Id convinced them how sorry I was and how Id make it up to them I was looking at a great life ahead Right?! \*\*\*\* \* \*\*\*\* They say that pride *goeth* before a fall. I wish it did, Id have had something better to land on than pavement. Thing is, I didnt fall, I was knocked off my bike and sprawled onto the pavement. I fell well, Id done it many times, nothing worse than some road rash on my left forearm and a bruised left knee. What worried me was the ringing I heard in my ears and the pain coming from the right side of my head. I was pretty sure that the wet substance now sliding around the side of my face was blood. *Rotten bastard! Probably some dirty wine bottle, thought I heard it clink* I shook off the shock and started to scramble to my feet but no such luck. Whoomf! there went my wind as a boot connected with my midsection. I rolled and managed to come up on my feet, though still bent forward and on wobbly legs. I tried to see what was happening and I held up my hands in a feeble attempt to locate and fend off my attacker. *Oh dang! AttackerS!* I saw another one approach from around the front of my bike. That momentary distraction saved me though. As I turned toward the second, the first missed his swing at my jaw and connected instead with my shoulder. I lashed out in a side kick that caught his left knee and he went down. Not sure how I did that in my condition but thanks for the, *funk-jitsu* lessons fosters! Number two pushed me and I once again sprawled, this time on my butt and this time I was able to roll away a few extra feet. Good thing. Hed stepped forward with a knife in hand. I curled up as though I was scared. Okay, maybe I was a little, instinct and all. He went for it, stepped closer and bent forward to get in a stick with the knife. I let him have it in the face with both feet. He went over backward and again, I was rolling, then once more back on my feet, a little dizzy but beginning to catch my breath. Number one had recovered and was reaching behind his back, very obviously for a weapon. I ran forward and planted my right knee in his gut as he pulled out a small pistol, one of those East European pieces of crap, invariably a 9mm. At the time though, I was busy. I was able to catch hold of his wrist and pull it to my chest. I bent forward and twisted. Once his elbow locked, I stepped back and hammered it with my left fist: Snap! Went the joint, Aaaaagh!... whine went Pistol Pete, Thunk! went the crappy pistol on the pavement. I pushed him to the ground where he curled around his injury and I picked up his pistol. I pointed it at number two, who had risen and was closing in with his knife. He was too close, I had no time to even raise it fully but I pressed the trigger and the loud crack of the pistol sounded as his blade sliced into my left forearm over the road rash. I managed not to scream but that was only adrenaline and the clenching of my teeth; made for a nice grunting growl though, sounded tough enough to me. I stepped back and to the side as he advanced forward but suddenly he collapsed. A bloodstain was growing way too rapidly at the top of his right leg. Id hit his femoral artery and broken his pelvis. All I knew was that this situation was FUBARed (Got that from some movie or trashy novel, maybe both). I looked more closely at my two new friends. Mr. broken arm, formerly Pistol Pete, had recovered enough to start screaming, Oh shit! Oh fuck! repeatedly and in that order. Bleeding Guy lay there, clutching at his groin and praying? Hhmmm I had to get the noise to stop, it would draw attention, people could dismiss a single gunshot but a shot followed by screaming some, good citizen would call to, Get some 911 up in heah!; so I did the best thing I could think of and kicked a field goal with the screamers face. It got him to stop yelling and gave me a moment to study the situation. I looked back at the bleeder. His head was back and the blood was starting to pool. So much blood. Then I recognized him. He was a member of one of the local gangs, who called himself Arania (Spider). He had a tattoo of a black widow spider on his neck. Guess he didnt know it was a female spider. He was known for abusing the local prostitutes and clearly hated women. I giggled hysterically for a moment, likely due to the adrenaline, *served him right getting shot in the groin.* That would mean that the other was, Feo (Ugly), since they constantly worked and hung out together. Feo was pretty ugly to start, facial tatts and piercings didnt help, nor had the kick Id delivered improved his features. I casually pointed the pistol at his unsavory countenance and asked simply, Why? He leaned forward, clutching at his arm, spit out a tooth (*ooh, that was not going to get him a new sobriquet*) and lisped, You dead, muhfuckah! We wuth jus gonna give you a beatdown. You fucked up tho, now you gonna be dead. I just continued to gaze and I flicked the muzzle of the pistol upward to encourage him to answer my question. Jaguar sthay you las load was light. You get a beatdown cause iths yo firs prollem an Sony an he crew gonna be dead! Now you dead too! Surprisingly thats all the explanation I needed. Jaguar was the leader of Feos branch of whatever trashy gang and Sony was the leader of another trashy gang that supplied drugs and other criminal necessities. I had delivered for Sony a few days past and he or one of his thugs had hosed me when they hosed Jaguar; for that matter, Jaguars turds may have hosed me. This was going to be bad for business. I didnt care if the gangs warred and killed one another but that meant no regular business for a courier until it was straightened out and the relative peace was restored. Money was the primary motivation for criminal gangs but they had to have street cred. A non-fatal hit on Sony or dusting a few low level associates would be enough to satisfy what passed for honor and allow for a parley, as long as no one who mattered was dead Thats when I heard Aranias death rattle. Id heard one before when a fosters elderly relative died while we visited her in the hospital. *FUBARRRRRRR*! I didnt even look, just picked up my bike and flew. Run muhfuckah! You sthill gonna die! Feo screeched / lisped as I peddled for my life, literally for my life. I pumped the pedals furiously and headed in the same direction Id been going. I still had a delivery to make and it was to a party that was linked to neither Jaguar nor Sony. I know its crazy but when things go sideways, some odd notions pop into the old melon. As I rode as hard as I could, I thought about what to do:  *Get rid of the gun? Might be handy to have it for protection but I didnt like risking gun charges.*  *After the delivery, where should I go? Should I warn Sony and crew? I didnt like to get that involved and I certainly didnt want to take sides, Id lose all my business.*  *What would I do about Arania?* *Chances were that Jaguars group would dispose of him unless they thought a gang funeral was in their best interests.* *I didnt have to worry too much that anyone would tell the police, theyd rather take care of it on their own.*  *I should have offed Feo and figured out a way to dump both bodies.* *Id have had their junky old ride with the stereo system and super bright headlights that were worth more than the car itself to haul away their carcasses.*  *FUBAR! Id likely have to blow town but I needed to be clear of the fosters and eighteen so CPS didnt label me a runaway: still a few weeks to go.*  *Id keep the gun for now but I needed to check the load and condition. Likely Feo wouldnt have taken care of the thing.*  *Just a glitch or two.* *All I had to do was stay alive and avoid Jaguars bunch for a while.* *Probably Sonys too in case they wanted a scapegoat.*  *Note to self: If I ever become a gang leader, pick a better handle than, Jaguar or Sony.* *Maybe I could keep my current one* \*\*\*\* \* \*\*\*\* I made it to my delivery location and almost missed my contact in the dark and at my still considerable speed. L looked at me oddly, What up Hot Wheels? You look like shit dude. Thats when I realized, I was exhausted from my mad ride and the sweat and blood on the side of my head must have looked pretty nasty. My arm must have looked even worse. No wonder no one else had accosted me. I probably looked pretty frightening. Not cool, blood would draw official interest. I grinned and took my payment. Ah, you know 'L' I like to try out stunts on the bike. Sometimes they dont go right; my bad but I hurried over, want to keep my customers happy. I knew that was a lame answer but my mind was racing again. I was trying to settle down and concentrate but now that he mentioned it, my head hurt! So did my arm. He let it pass as, yo bidness. I thanked him for the payment and rode off in a new direction. I needed to change up my route, by now, Jaguars crew would be on the hunt (no pun intended, he was named for the car, not the cat  dumbass gang names!). First, I rode to a nearby park. It was closed at night but there were some public restrooms behind a feeble fence. I could fade this one. Any cop or security guard that spotted me, I could claim a serious call of nature and face it, nobody likes to talk about taking a dump. I slithered through a hole in the fence that most good citizens would not have even noticed. Fortunately, the lock on the structure was already busted, some hood rat may already have had the same bright idea, so I proceeded with caution. I was alone and took a little break to get cleaned up and do a preemptive strike on an actual call of nature. I took a look in the mirror after Id cleaned my wounds. I needed a change of shirt, too much blood. I took off my outer long sleeve, tore off the clean right sleeve, and ditched the bloody mess in the trash, clean side showing. No one would look closely in this neighborhood, especially not a cleaning crew getting city pay. I was wearing a black wife-beater underneath, not great but it would have to do until I could snag something better. I used the relatively clean sleeve to bandage my left forearm. Definitely not good but until I could get something better... Crap! The reflection in the mirror showed a large, dark figure looming behind me. I stepped aside and turned to face him... it... whatever... Nothing. I looked around, still nothing, just a quick goose-flesh inducing chill and a slight shiver. No one in the stalls and no one could have gotten out of the main door that quickly. Clearly my mind was playing tricks on me. I fled the facilities and resumed my ride. I knew of a thrift store nearby, there were donation bins on the side of the building. Maybe I could get a shirt or jacket or something. I didnt dare go into the local Wally-world store. How many crooks get caught on camera? The dumbassed ones! Nobody bothered to monitor thrift stores. I just had to hope that the local homeless population hadnt beaten me to the best pickings. *Wow*! I realized I was competing with homeless people for resources; I would maybe need to reevaluate my lifes calling. Definitely getting out of the drug courier business, at least in this town. Bingo! Found a faded but serviceable work shirt in the bin. Things were looking up again. As I donned my, new apparel, I thought I saw something move inside the shadows cast by the bin from the parking lot lights that were, amazingly, working. Maybe a dog or cat but it had seemed bigger. I felt a cold shiver. I was giving myself the creeps for no reason. Sure Id killed someone and had a pack of gangsters after my blood. Gangsters known for their torture skills Still, no reason to get freaked out, there were no large shadow figures on my trail, just my rattled, wine bottle bashed brain playing tricks... I stopped at a nearby convenience store to get a drink and an energy bar. I thought I might also like to get some peroxide or rubbing alcohol to clean out the gash on my arm, maybe even some gauze or something clean. The place had one of those bullet-proofish glass cages around the counter. Some dude from somewhere in Asia (biggest continent, how should I know?) was sitting behind the glass jabbering into an ancient cell phone. He gave me a glance and went back to his conversation. Just as well, no real scrutiny. I found what I needed and plopped everything on the counter. I had to hold up each item so he could scan them through the glass. He never really looked at me, just continued talking into the decrepit phone. Place smelled like someone had poured straight *Fabuloso* on the floor over fresh urine and didnt bother mopping. The stench burned my nostrils and made me a little nauseous. I started to leave through the single battered but working glass door, the other was locked tight and blocked with a rack of off brand chips, all to stop grab and go thefts and slow down robbers for the too obvious security camera. I realized that Id be walking from a brightly lit interior into near darkness. There were stickers and advertisements plastered all over the glass, so I couldnt see outside. I paused to peer through the few open spaces on the none too clean glass. Just inky blackness. Weird, there should have been at least some lighting from the yellow tinged pole light out front. I pushed hard on the door to clear a path if need be. I ended up stumbling out onto the crumbling pavement of the sidewalk. I quickly looked in each direction; nothing but the pole light and a bat chasing some insects near the bulb. Another shiver. It wasnt that cool outside and the heavy work shirt was adequate for mid-September but like earlier, this chill seemed to come up from my bones and radiate outward. *Were my wounds already infected?* *What had been on Aranias blade? Just regular crust likely... had he used it to cut drugs and failed to wipe it off when done?...* and I was just freaked out again, it had been a freaky night so far and it was still early. I decided on a route back, home to the fosters. Id have to cross my original trail back through Jaguars territory but maybe they had other targets tonight, maybe Sony I took off and rode towards my last foster home. As I went, I noticed that the street lights were working but almost no light came from the businesses and homes on either side of the street. Weird, it wasnt late enough for people to go to bed and besides, in this hood, nobody turned off outside lights. I had hoped to take as many alleyways as possible to avoid car traffic. Cars that might hold angry gang turds. However, as I approached the first alleyway on my planned route, I saw that it was dark. Too dark to risk. The left-hand detour around it was also dimly lit. The righthand street was clear. No brainer, I turned right, Id just adjust the plan a little. Yet as I rode along, all of the streets and alleyways that would have led me back to the left and back on track were dark or obstructed in some way, junk cars, groups of random hood rats standing around burning trash cans, a couple of dumpsters, this was getting old! Up ahead, there was a larger avenue. It was well lit and I saw a few vehicles go by in either direction. No choice, Id have to risk the bigger roadway. The last alleyway I passed was full of what an old pulp novel Id read referred to as, stygian gloom, pure darkness, like in a cavern. *Were those eyes? Orange glowing eyes?!* I almost crashed into a parked garbage truck. Another chill. This one wouldnt shake, so I picked up the pace to warm myself with exercise and put some distance between the alleyway and my body. As I made it to the wider, more brightly lit street, *MLK*, I was finally able to turn left. I realized that there was a plastic convenience store bag dangling from my right wrist. It was banging against the bike and throwing off my balance just a little. I pulled into a covered bus stop with shadows on one end but mostly illuminated by a nearby streetlight. I took a much needed seat and took care of my bod; not that I tasted the empty calories I wolfed down. The bus stop and indeed the surrounding block was empty and silent. Cars went by at various speeds but no one seemed to pay me any particular attention, just people going about their evening. I had found a small bottle of isopropyl alcohol at the store. I doused the wounds and the cheap gauze bandage Id procured, then wrapped and taped my arm. Stung like crazy but it smelled good and made my arm feel warm. I used a little more to douse the cut on the side of my head. Just a pressure cut but it was over a major goose egg lump that was painful to the touch. I used the citrus-tasting energy drink to wash down a couple of pain killers, then gobbled up a candy bar to chase down the chips Id already finished. The crappy store hadnt had energy bars; dump! Junk food aside, I was feeling pretty satisfied that I had handled my crisis and prepared to get back on the bike when I noticed that not only were there no people around, there was nothing living: no strays, no rats, not even any bugs. Except for the sounds of autos and the occasional, Thump, thump, thump; thump-thump,  from the bass on their stereos; nothing. Then the chill came rising up from my bones once more and the shadows began to deepen and seemed to expand towards me. The only way that remained lit was the direction Id intended to travel, so I hopped on the bike and began to pedal, not insanely fast but I quickly geared up to a good speed. *MLK* was a large thoroughfare, so it was better maintained than most streets in the area. I cruised along until I was back near to where Id run into Arania and Feo. Then I saw it, the black SUV that crept along a cross street. The windows were dark tinted and the carriage was underlit in rotating colors; Jaguars crew! I looked desperately for a place to ditch and hide. The ditch! I rolled my bike into the ditch alongside the roadway, laid it flat and stretched out prone beside it. The grass was damp and muddy but it beat being spotted by those animals. It certainly beat having old tires thrown over my still breathing body and set on fire. I couldnt risk rising up to look around, I just laid there, panting, whispering over and over, Keep going, keep going, keep going Naturally they turned onto *MLK* and headed in my direction. *FUBAR*! I ducked my head into the wet grass and stiffened. They drove by slowly but no more so than they had been traveling on the cross street. They kept going! It was hard but I waited, this block was the only nearby stretch that was ditch rather than sidewalk. I needed them to get far enough away that they wouldnt look back. Hopefully theyd turn and Id be out of their line of sight Nope! Yet they kept going. Eventually I felt like I could safely get up and get going. Not far to go now, I hopped on and started pedaling. I knew I had to change roads in case the searchers turned back. Besides, I had to go a few blocks more to the west, my left, to get back to my fosters neighborhood. I started looking for a well lit left turn off of *MLK* but all the ways were either blacked-out dark or blocked in some way. Then I caught a flash of light out of the corner of my eye. I looked over my shoulder. FUBAR indeed, it was Feos beater with the super bright headlights. I heard the engine roar as whoever was driving floored the gas pedal, couldnt be Feo, the idiot had a broken arm, Ha! I had no choice, I had to get off the road. I turned into an alley that had been shrouded in darkness. Now a door opened on one side and enough light streamed out that I was able to ride full speed ahead. Feos ride would not fit but I didnt want to catch a bullet in the back. I rode until I found a cross street that was lit. *What was going on with the lights in this town?*! I tore up the street, then followed the path of light down several more twists and turns, all the while I tried to stay on narrow streets and alleys. I could hear tires screeching several times as Feo, his new driver (*Ha! Old one was dead*) and I waltzed through that part of the city. I dodged him again by fleeing into a narrow dark alley, this time there was no light. I was feeling giddy and started to laugh when I slammed into the front drivers quarter panel of the black SUV. I went over the handle bars and slid across the hood. Ah great, hood rats really loved their rides. *Burning tires for me*, I thought. At least sliding across the hood was better than slamming into pavement. I rolled off the hood onto the pavement on the passengers side, mostly on my feet. I was momentarily confused. How had I managed to do that? Why wasnt I already dead? I steadied my stance and stood erect to see around me, looking desperately for a place to run. Big Ray unfolded himself from the passengers side of the SUV and Escorpion, Jaguars main enforcer, leapt from the drivers side, clearly infuriated. *Im* *fooked*! I thought. These guys were full on badassed gangsters. Then, another door opened in another nearby wall and light once more spilled forth. It was the back door to a restaurant. I bolted toward it. I ran past a tired employee who splashed garbage on me as we lightly collided. Fortunately Big Ray was slow, in mind as well as body, so it took him a moment to register the situation, form a plan, and act. Escorpion was not slow but he had tripped over the remains of my bike and was, even more pissed; *great*! I was definitely going to be tortured and eventually murdered. Still, I did my best to delay that fate as I dodged into the kitchen. The faintly fishy smell of Asian Cuisine nearly overwhelmed me as I dodged through the kitchen and I slipped and slid along on the wet floor. Big Ray wasnt so lucky. He slipped on the slick surface and fell. I looked back in time to see him catch his fall on his right hand. His gun hand. I knew it was his gun hand because it was filled with a gun! However, I could see the pain on his face as his arm gave way. Apparently 350 lbs coming down on a wrist joint may cause it to break. I didnt know whether to cheer or cry; another broken bone on my tab with these guys. I almost took a wrong turn into a storage area but an employee was in the way. He gawped at me, jaw hanging loose and hands fumbling at the items he carried. I slowed and carefully entered the dining area of the restaurant. I didnt want more attention and I knew that Escorpion was unlikely to shoot me in the middle of a restaurant with ten or fifteen witnesses. At least thats what I hoped. As I passed the aquarium near the front entrance,  **Wham! Wham! Wham! Wham!**  bullets impacted the glass and the water and the poor fish burst out onto the floor; *better them than me* I thought as I ducked and scampered around the front wall and out the front door. Escorpion hadnt needed to chase me into the dining area, he had simply stopped at the kitchen door and sent bullets my way. I ran out onto the sidewalk. The light was better to my right, so I took off in that direction. I didnt care where I was going, just away from the bullets and murderous thugs. I expected either Escorpion or Feo to run over me at any moment. I took a few more turns and finally had to slow to catch my breath, I wasnt a runner. I saw a patch of darkness to my right and heard the rush of water. It was one of the pedestrian bridges over a drainage creek. *Right direction* The lights on either end were out and the shadows were deep but I needed to get out of the way of the hunters. A little darkness might be my friend. I crossed out onto the bridge and paused. I leaned on the rail, just catching my breath. As the harsh sounds of my own breathing faded back to normal, I heard a new sound from under the bridge. My first thought was, *homeless camp*! but the sounds did not seem natural. The chill came into me and stayed in my bones. I heard wet, slavering noises coming from just over the edge of the rail. A heavy, panting and intake of breath into enormous lungs. The drop-off was a good twelve or more feet from the bottom of the bridge, yet the head that rose in the darkness to gaze at me from just under the rail was clearly attached to a body that stood in the water. The heavy, slime-covered hand that reached over the rail from the darkness, the hand with the foot-long, razor claws, was there to finish the job that Jaguars turds were unable to do. I backed against the opposite rail as though those few feet would make a difference to this gargantuan beast. No place to flee; freezing was out of the question; fight! I had a knife No! I had a gun! I had no time to curse myself for not checking the thing earlier but it was now time to do or die! Fortunately the monster was in no hurry and although its blazing orange-yellow eyes reached to just below the rail, it had to awkwardly reach over the rail, like a small child reaching onto a counter to find a cookie. *Huge but not huge enough; maybe short arms, hard to tell with a blacker than black monster against a very dark backdrop.* *Prolly not too bright either*! I thought smugly, as I pulled the pistol from my pocket. I pointed at the eyes and started blazing away at the thing. *An actual troll from under a bridge,* my mind insanely giggled. I fired the five remaining rounds into the lump of a face. Six rounds between those and the one that had taken out Arania. The magazine would have held sixteen! Feo was truly a dumbass. I was out of rounds and my sanity was soon to empty from my mind as the rounds had from the pistol. The hand had pulled back over the rail to shield what passed for a face on that thing. I flung the pistol over the rail in between where the eyes of the beast had resided. I heard the wet slap as it struck followed by the splash as the water absorbed and obscured that little piece of evidence from memory. The sounds were probably my imagination as I was already at the far end of the bridge and beating feet toward the next working streetlight, my ears ringing with the gunshots. I again slowed to a walk after a few more turns. The chill had finally faded. I was getting pretty worn. However, Id figured out what to do; stay on the path of light. Follow the brightest lights on the pathway home. When I did this, all was well. When I was tempted to look into the shadows, dark figures with fiery eyes stared hatred and menace towards me. I followed the lights and I was at the edge of my neighborhood, just a few blocks from home, yeah, sure, the fosters had given me a home and I had just started to appreciate that for the first time in many years. Then the bright headlights blinded me and the roar of a pair of engines sounded as Feo and Escorpion closed in from a side street. I was in a brightly lit four-way intersection. *Great*! So close but it would end here, no way to avoid the showdown. No torture though, I decided as I pulled out my own knife, a long kitchen affair that I kept hidden in a leg sheath inside my pants leg. Escorpion piled out quickly, Big Ray rather slowly as he gingerly cradled his right wrist in a makeshift sling. Odd to see such a big man display vulnerability. Feo had picked up a new partner, so much for his, brother Arania. I couldnt recall this guys name, he looked like a rat that had decided to walk upright, grown to 56, and joined a street gang. Feo smiled hideously through the new gap in his teeth, I toll you, you wuth gonna die. Escorpion gritted through his still intact teeth that were grotesquely covered with a gold grill, You fucked up my ride. I might have killed you quick but now you gotta pay. Big Ray just looked pained and serious but he gripped his pistol in his left hand. Rat boy didnt have any particular axe to grind, he was just along for the hate-ride but he pointed his Tech-9 vaguely in my direction. They lined up in the street like some freakshow version of the Earps in an old Western movie. Escorpion gritted out in his best movie gunslinger voice, You put down that knife boy and come with us. You can ride with me in the car you fucked up. Big Ray may even let you sit on his lap. Feo gave what passed for a laugh with him, rat boy just swallowed and Big Ray looked confused and a little nervous. Then I saw that closing in faster than they were, was the Darkness. That stygian gloom again. Shadowed figures writhed and raised arms and hands and claws in a nightmare throng that crowded in behind the crew of killers, *Ha*! The previously blinding headlights were now something like the yellowish streetlights that had dimly but clearly lit my way this evening. It took a moment for Einstein ur, Escorpion, to notice the change in light. After a moment, just as he connected a synapse and started to speak, his comrades finally registered the encroaching darkness. Again like a movie, they all turned around in unison and peered into the frantically dancing DARK that was upon them. A dark made up of hunters from the realm of nightmares. Blazing eyes, razor claws, and rows of gnashing teeth, heads crowned with antlers and horns, hard feet and hooves, so many of each, came into focus and sounds began to emerge from the maelstrom of inky figures. Grisly snapping and clashing, baying, snarling, howling, and a chittering laughter of pure devilish delight shattered the silence over Jaguars heroic crew of hunter-killers. They screamed in unison and three of them fired the weapons they clutched. Feo had Aranias knife clutched in his good hand. He dropped it as his good hand fell limply to his side. I noticed a satisfying puddle form near his right boot And then they were gone. Suddenly and abruptly, the whole mess, including the gang members and their cars vanished as if theyd never existed, first engulfed in darkness, then, nothing. The screaming abruptly halted, the other sounds faded and then stopped, the darkness receded but did not dissipate. It never has entirely. \*\*\*\* \* \*\*\*\*"
49,vulnerability,nosleep,Fear has a strong stench,1,dw0ff5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dw0ff5/fear_has_a_strong_stench/,2019-11-14 10:28:52,"When a death occurs, the living can go to great lengths to separate themselves from the corruption of its unhappiness. Especially when the circumstances are sudden, tragic or plain horrific, this unhappiness becomes an unfortunate residue that is never completely dealt with. It grows like mold; acrimonious at being forgotten. Soon, it manifests and grows into an ominous presence youd best avert your gaze from. It could be the apartment at the end of the corridor from where you grew up in; but when the bodies are cleared and the tapes are pulled down, youll swear the laughter from your childhood memories no longer echo from there. So strong is the void of unhappiness that your feet grow heavier in its proximity. Your mind races, wanting to get away from the dark spaces where musty smells start settling in. You had seen countless people walking by at one time, but now your eyes point to the floor because youre afraid of catching someone peeking out from the anteroom. Fear is the vague memory as well as a reminder of loneliness: of the time you thought you would never be found again as the edge of your vision turned darker. An unhappy death in a familiar place is simply the beginning of overwhelming feeling turning to reality, as what was once a home begins to fade - condemned and doomed to be forgotten wantonly. When allowed to fester for long without remedy, an open wound contaminates its surroundings slowly. The physical symptom without respite and retribution never rids itself of the resentment that spilled over, becoming a taint nothing short of a curse. The shadow of a curse begins reeking slowly, now maturing from a bud, beckoning to all manner of things that feed off of it. It draws in every manner of ill and being, just as sharks move to blood and stray dogs seek meat. Fear has a smell and it smells like shit. A marker, if left uncovered, signalling to predators from miles which way the prey can be found. It is easy to miss because the senses of people cannot decipher it. We are only familiar with it as a quick impulse  most of us know its oppression and the repressed breath at the end of our lungs as it settles in and the numbing of senses signalling its presence. Intangible, it floats carelessly, visible only to those whose domain it enters. I already told you - it moves quickly and suddenly - so to be afraid is something we have no control over. It is a primal impulse because it is the first thing we ever experience. Happiness is a learned habit, but it is fear we are born into. To call it our drive for self-preservation is a convenient euphemism which helps us push our vulnerability under the carpet. Truth be told, we arrive from oblivion only to retreat within it when it comes calling. We take great care erasing all evidence of fear over time, because our desire to forget is stronger. We celebrate life and neighbours smile at each other, promising to send an invitation over for the next pot-luck. But from the corner of your eyes you see that place of unhappiness and wonder why your nostrils flare up. Which is why we distract ourselves from the source with people to laugh with and things (goals) to chase in our head, because we want to drown out the possibility of overhearing the hushed whispers prodding us to come closer and explore the chasm. We become braver in steps, flirting perilously with everything that breaks us because proving our invincibility lets us forget that we will ever die. Which is why fear is so urgent and immediate, so it can cut thick with your own screaming voices before you give in to the requests coming from the dark and certainly, empty, night. You try to tell yourself that the light will still follow you when you throw the doors open, but it is the strong stench of fear that keeps you from turning the knob on that door. It is fear that contracts your cells reaching out to pull away from the place it has been aware of known since you were alive. You turn away and walk back into the light as you realise that some things are best kept separate from the world outside. Which is why you heed when every impulse makes you want to get away. Because when confronted with places of great unhappiness, we cannot deny its ability to find us. Because Death has a stench... and it never fades away..."

I knew what I was hoping  that she'd remember instantly, that the sound of her name would bring it all flooding back and we'd immediately charge out and find the nameless one together. But that was not the case. I could see it had rung some bell deep inside her, yes, some memory she had not noticed in a time, but the confusion in her eyes was clear, and I realised this information would take some time to process. I wanted to tell her my name too  did she recognise me? I couldn't tell  but if the nameless one got to us before she remembered who she was and took her name again, I didn't want anyone else to know mine. Not unless she remembered it of her own accord. So I bit my lip and did not tell. What did you call me? she asked. I went to reply, but then something strange happened. She flickered suddenly like static. All of a sudden she was not a woman, but a little girl, same black hair, same blue eyes, standing in the doorway. A second passed and she was the woman again, looking confused. Do you recognise me? I asked, hoping. Yes. She frowned, as though trying to place me. But I don't know where from. That hurt, though I was used to it. I reached out and touched her shoulder. Solid. I felt relief. The flickering had worried me a minute, it seemed something a Thin would do. But no. Solid. I stepped back. Do I know you? she asked. No, I said. I looked at her. She was too young. Barely out of her teens. Not yet. But you will, one day. She nodded. Didn't say anything. I smiled ruefully. I must sound crazy. No, I   She shook her head. Come in. I entered the house. It was so familiar  things I hadn't seen since I was a child; mine and my sister's model aeroplanes on the special shelf we got to use, the coat-rack with the big tartan blanket hanging off it; the clunky old telly they'd had for years before it finally stopped working; they were all there. And other things too, that I didn't recognise. A bicycle that looked to be from the 1940s, a radio about the same age. I ran my hands along the walls and took it in. It smelled the same. And I loved it so. Tea? she asked. I nodded. Yes, please. The woman moved to the kitchen and set the kettle going. I waited politely. Charlie explored the house, which Madeline didn't seem to mind. I'm fond of cats, she told me, pouring out the tea. I nodded. I know. She spooned sugar into one cup. Looked at me. You don't take sugar, do you? she said. I shook my head. Thanks, I said, and took the tea. We went into the living room and sat down. Madeline was the girl again. She gestured for me to sit anywhere, and I took the chair I usually did. This must have sparked a memory, because she looked confused for a moment. Her eyes widened. She stepped back, as though hit with something. You   she started, and then she flickered, back to the woman, then again, older, hair greying at the edges. She reached for something on the shelf, a photo frame, one I recognised, from within which beamed my smiling face. My parents with my sister and I as children. Then another picture, and another, our family history charted on film, until she found her own picture several times among them and ran her fingers over it, whispering, staring. Madeline, she whispered. Madeline, yes   She flickered again, little girl, woman, little girl, woman. My heart raced. It was working. Slowly and clunkily, but it was working. She seemed to steady herself. There was the little girl again. She turned to me. How's your tea? she asked, in a child's voice. I knew that voice. *Don't!* It's lovely, thanks, I said, Just how I like it. Madeline stared at me for a while, looking back and forth between me and the pictures on the wall. I do know you, she said, as if reading my mind. I turned to where she held up a picture frame. Me in the boat as a child. In here. That is you. I nodded. I saw him. But you were older, like this. I saw him try to take you and I shouted and I didn't think you'd hear me but   I did, I said, remembering the voice. Remembering the nameless one and the reeds. I heard you. You saved me from him. Thank you. I had to. You needed me. Even here she had kept her promise. *I will always protect you.* We sat, sipping tea. I think you'd better tell me what's going on, she said. I explained as best I could, fumbling over the details in my excitement. I had to keep going back several times and retelling things. Charlie sat patiently in my lap. When I'd finished, Madeline said, Well. Well, I echoed. She patted her knees decisively and got up. What are you doing? She was rifling through a desk drawer. After a minute she came up with handfuls of papers. I've been trying to figure out a way out of here for ages. They landed in front of me on the floor, masses of diagrams and scribbled equations. Physics. I studied, you know. I know, I said, taking a piece of paper. At Oxford. I examined the markings. It made no sense to me. I don't know what any of this means. Not to worry. We need to find the nameless one. We will, she said. She pointed. Look. This place doesn't conform to our laws. The physics is all wrong. Little pockets. Little places of difference. If we could find one we could escape. How do you find one? Humans can't, I don't think. She pointed to Charlie. But cats. Cats see things we don't. Charlie *mrrp*ed. I patted his head. So you'll help us? Yes. We need to get the book. Maybe we can get everyone's names back. You have yours  might take you a while to remember, but you do  we just need to find a way to get it. And we just have to go back along the river? You're sure he's following you? I'm sure, I said. Madeline nodded. Fine. In that case, I think there might be an exit point nearby, they seem to be near where people live. She turned to Charlie. Is that how you travel? He *mrrp*ed. She nodded. Right. So we should stick to this side... Madeline, do you know   My head is spinning. Absolutely spinning. Please let me focus on one thing at a time, else I won't be able to bear it. I held up my hands. Okay. The little girl was back, then the young woman. You... She trailed off, looking uncertain. It's okay, I said. He's strong, she said. It'll be hard to fight him. We'll just have to try. She chuckled. You were always the brawn. Like a yin-yang, you and your... sister... The words slipped from her. She tried to hold onto the thought, but the memory had got away again. Yes, I said. It was true. She's always been more like you. Madeline shook her head again, cleared her thoughts. So, do you have a plan? I think I do. My plan was not particularly sophisticated. It went like this: Eat as much powder as we could. Wait for the nameless one. Creep up to him coated in powder. Snatch the book. Read out the names and follow Charlie. There were problems with it, I'll admit. The nameless one was strong and scary and I had no idea how to fight him if I had to, but I didn't know if anyone did and I couldn't wait any longer. I had found who I wanted to find and now we had to leave. I had to get everyone out of here. All those who'd helped me, all those who hadn't; I couldn't leave them. This place had its pretty parts but it was hard and scary, the environment changed without warning and such a treacherous beast as the nameless one stalked the land. Those who lived here lived elsewhere too, at least the Solids  and, I realised, I didn't think the Thins lived at all, except in memory  and why, they had no idea, they forgot until they slept, then forgot once more. I knew who he was, though not how he came to be, and I believed for a moment I knew his name. He touched you already? Madeline asked, poring over her diagrams. I touched him. Yeah  he did, but I touched him first. It was an accident. You have your name and you touched him. That might make him vulnerable to you. But he can touch you. He can, and it didn't feel good last time. But maybe it felt just as bad for him. And you have your name, now. Yes, but I can't remember, I can't   She smacked the side of her head in frustration. Bloody remember. I grabbed the photo. You can, you did  you remember me, and W   I stopped myself. You remember us. You remember Lake Windermere. I remember, but like in a dream. *This* is the dream. That stopped her. She looked at me for a long time. Her face shifted. She looked like she was desperately trying to remember, but the thoughts were just wisps, slipping through her fingers, when she tried to grab them. But the photo  she had caught a tendril or two. With one hand she folded her maps away, tucking them into her pocket. How did you find me? she asked quietly. I've know you forever, I said. I handed her the drawings. She took them and held them up next to the picture frames, next to the one of her house. Then again alongside the photos of her childhood home, the one with flowers in the front garden. I never noticed the difference, she murmured, running her hands over the page. Two... houses... She was the child again, wide-eyed and uncertain, forehead drawn in confusion. I ached to tell her it was all right, I was here and I would help her, but I could not give the nameless one a chance to hear my name while she still did not fully remember hers. So I held her hands, like she had done for me eighteen years before, and let her process it all. Thank you, pet, she murmured, blinked, and shook her head. Back to the woman with the diagrams. She'd almost had it. I sighed and got to my feet. We ate a handful of the powder each, offered Charlie his fill, then corked the bottle and set it sailing along the river. I hoped it would reach someone. There were definitely people in this place we wouldn't be able to save this time, but, if I was correct, the people we could would pave the way for more, would build a road out of this place for all who were here. *We will do our very best,* I promised silently. Until then, I hoped the rest of the powder could be of use. We set out into the field. She shifted back and forth. The little girl held my hand and skipped and twirled, the woman walked silently, with purpose. I said Can you control it? and she shook her head. Not really. I can a little, hold it back. But it's like sneezing. It comes out eventually. Maybe try and keep it in when he's there. If you can. It might be better if he doesn't know you can do that. That makes sense. I untied the boat and we followed the river, walking slowly alongside her like barge-horses. Even she seemed understanding of the need for care; she floated so lightly, so quietly. Charlie led the way, sniffing the air, lithe like the tiger. It was a while, over an hour, before the prickling began on the back of my neck and our strides grew careful, tiptoeing; Charlie's fur stood on end and Madeline's eyes narrowed. And we saw him. The nameless one. Instinctively I ducked, and Madeline froze, grabbing my shoulder. He didn't see us. With sloth-like speed we tied up the boat and continued toward him. Cautiously we crept closer until we were almost directly in front of him, quiet as we could. His face  it was so hard to focus on  showed no sign of recognition, but he did look confused, peering around as though he knew *something* was there but did not know what. *Ready?* I mouthed. She nodded. *Ready.* I grabbed the book. He reacted as soon as I touched it. He jerked the book away and reached toward me; before I could jump out the way he had touched me. Madeline jumped forward  I cried out to stop her  but she shoved him away; he stumbled, but in doing so she had touched him too, and now he could see us, oh, he could see us. He grinned. Well, he said, in that hollow crackle. You have come to offer me. I licked my lips. My throat felt dry. Not   I started, then swallowed quickly. *Get it together.* We haven't come to offer you anything. Oh? He smiled too wide. It was like light off a mirror. Why have you come? I stood as tall as I could. I want the book. He laughed. I have a thousand books. I want the book. It is mine. Its contents aren't yours. Give me the book. He just laughed. A horrible sound, smug and creaking. A haunted music box. I will not, he said, stroking the pages. It is my treasures. Your stolen treasures, I said. Not stolen. Offered. Taken. Through trickery and deceit. It is all the same. Like the hunter who thanks his victims for their lives, fooling himself they gave them up willingly and he did not steal them. I stood my ground. It isn't. He moved closer to us, that fearsome grin never leaving him. Madeline stiffened beside me. Tell me, he hissed, face far too close to mine. Tell me your name, you can stay; you are so little  you know so little. I know what you are, I said. He swayed lightly in the breeze, just out of sync with the landscape. His voice lost its sing-song cadence. Speak, then, he said, eyes never leaving mine. I know your name. Do you? He laughed. Or do you know only my titles? The German doctor? That is his name, not mine. He saddled me with it in his attempt to understand. Or the common name? You speak one language, boy-who-rows, I have names in all of them. And none of them are yours? You would never know mine. It came to me at once, the realisation. I stepped closer. Charlie crouched behind me, tense, unseen; Madeline stepped in front of him. No, I wouldn't, I said, not taking my eyes off his face. Because you don't have one, do you? He tried to hide it, but a flicker of fear crossed his face. My heart thumped wildly. We had him. My skin tingled, I felt so tightly wound I could hardly contain myself. I have a name, he said, voice faltering. I shook my head, stepped toward him so our faces were nearly touching. No, you don't. *Al.* You have a code. A genetic code. Or maybe you do have a name. Maybe you're just a personification, I don't know. A creature made in response. A manifestation, said Madeline. Yes. A manifestation. I kept walking, pushing him back. You filled a void left by weakness, you became  for what, control? You took hold of a vulnerability and used it to steal from people. And that's how you live. Your sick kingdom. I don't know why you do it, I don't know how you can bear it. Built on lies. Everything is code, he snarled. You took people's control over their own code! You took their power, you took their names! My feelings had been pent-up for so long, now they were coming out. Everything is code, yes, language is a code, and your name is your key. That's why names have power, that's why you want them. A name is but a code. A name is but a code, but not all codes are names. He realised then. I saw it on his face. He was on the back foot and I was angry. For I knew him, not as a human, but as an illness, a nefarious code that pillaged your mind like a battery drained dark. A thief. Strings had been right, a monster. He had built an illusion of memory, but it was not real; he had tricked people, stolen their understanding of themselves, lied to them and dragged them from their lives and homes and loved ones. He had reduced my independent larger-than-life grandmother to a blank stare and a drug trial, and I knew it, and I knew now it was working, whatever scientists had toiled for years and years to find was working, and we were going to escape. They have decoded you, I said. They have made a drug to keep you away. And are you here to deliver it? he asked, voice dripping with ire. I shook my head. I'm here to collect. Madeline lunged for him. He smacked her down with the back of his hand. Rage spiked hot in my stomach and I grabbed him, he hit me away too but Madeline was back and she was flickering, shifting back and forth between woman and girl, strong enough to fight him, small enough to slip away. He growled in frustration. I kicked him hard and he stumbled but it was not enough, he did not have the weak points of a man because he was not a man, he was a personification, a creature of hurt and loss, mirroring and stealing from his victims; I scrapped at him anyway, tight with rage, as Madeline wriggled slippery from his grip and returned again, going for the book; he punched me away and I hit the floor with a bloodied lip and heard Charlie hiss beside me. Dimly I heard Madeline's sounds of exertion, the nameless one's fury, and the ringing in my ears from where he'd hit me like he had in the theatre, this whole body echo, numb. Madeline. I lurched to my feet and went for him again, grappling at the wrist that held the book. He headbutted me and I felt blood stream from my nose. Madeline punched him right back but he did not bleed, instead flickered horribly like static, like a creature of blood and spark; he was, I realised, it made sense. He was a thief; he supped at the throat of greed, he lapped at the trough of cruelty, the twisted lord of a stolen kingdom. He raked his hands down my arm. I shouted. I grabbed his throat and squeezed until he choked and brought his hands to my face, and we fought and scrabbled; his noises became more and more inhuman, like a fox yelling, that auditory scrawl, and we pushed and pulled and spat until the back of my throat felt hot with adrenaline and I took him by the shirt-collar and yanked him forwards and *he dropped the book.* Time seemed to slow. I lunged forward and snatched it from the floor. In a half-second he realised but I was too quick, and I was off, book held tight to my chest, heading for the boat. I knew he would drop Madeline and I was right; he left her there and came after me, and all of a sudden a bright orange shape came barrelling out of the grass and latched itself round the nameless one's neck, hissing. Blessed Charlie. The fighter, the friend, the utter wonder. The nameless one grappled for me but couldn't reach, he squalled and flailed as I opened the book, searching, searching. Names. So many names. He may have been right there were other books but at least I had this one, and if it was a start, if we could show the trial worked  a miracle, I thought, searching for the most recent entry, incredible. He caught me, sending my thoughts all astray, not here but elsewhere; memories flitted through my head, my sixth birthday party, my first day of preschool; childhood memories, because of course they were the strongest, but he didn't have me yet, he didn't have my name and that made me strong, and Madeline was remembering and remembering; she shifted between ages ever-faster now, stronger, tenacious; I shook the ringing from my head and scrambled free and Charlie yowled and Madeline fought and I shielded the book against my stomach and he caught me once more, grabbed my hand and wrenched so hard I felt something snap and screamed in pain; the book fell to the floor and I kicked it away, the nameless one dropped me and reached for it but I threw myself forward and landed on top, my body a shield. He dragged me back; Charlie latched onto his face and hid us from view, I feinted, pretended to stumble like I'd hurt my foot; the nameless one grabbed at me but I hit back, kicked him hard in the leg, and the closer we got to the river the slipperier the surface was. Madeline held on tight, forcing him backward. I grabbed the book and backed away. Madeline shouted to me. You have to cross it out! Or destroy the page somehow! Of course. The hands. Cordey's right hand, my right hand; they were our writing hands. Oh, of course it would be; I wrenched the pen from his snarling grip, tore the book back open and read the names there, no idea who most of them belonged to, just prepared to shout them out loud, but before I could Charlie meowed loudly at me and butted the air, directly ahead. There it was, a tear in the fabric of the illusion. Though it was far away down the river, back the way we came, through it I could see bars of light as if dancing in a breeze. It flickered and rippled like static, like a Thin. Was it due to our getting the book from the nameless one, or Charlie sharing his feline secrets? I didn't know, but I knew we had to get there. I've got the book! I shouted, and ran for the boat, the nameless one lumbering behind. Madeline held on tight, Charlie hissing and batting his paws, and I reached the boat and threw the book inside. I undid the painter with shaking fingers, scratching myself and sending bolts of pain up my bleeding arm, but it was fine; hospital, I thought, trying to keep my breathing steady, I could always go to the hospital soon. Get in! shouted Madeline. They were nearly there. In one move she bounded from the nameless one's shoulders onto the bank and jumped into the boat. I laughed inexplicably with sheer adrenaline. The nameless one lunged. I shouted Charlie! He meowed urgently back to me. I jumped into the boat, pushed off from the side, keeping close enough for him to jump in. He sprung from the nameless one's face and ran ahead, looked at me, then looked back, along the river the way we'd come. I understood. He would be faster on land than with us. Go, I said. He *mrrp*ed back at me. I shouted Thank you!, which would never be enough for all he'd done for me, but was all I had. He streaked away, a stroke of paint. Madeline grabbed the oars. You read, I'll row. What? You read, I'll row! Madeline began rowing, straight toward the flickering lights. The nameless one followed. Holding their faces in my head, hoping I would know which face to put to which name, I opened the book. John Sullivan! I shouted, crossing out the name. In my head, I saw the Bard's eyes opened wide. Silas Lee Parker! Eccles. I imagined him, too, hearing the shout across the water, unsure if it was in his mind or not. Then there was another, a word I could not pronounce, but tried, and I saw him in my head. Wren. Cross it out. The nameless one howled with rage and tried to scrabble from the bank. He was behind, but I knew not for how much longer. Each name faded from the paper as soon as it was crossed out, leaving only a blank page. Jane McKendrick! That was Cordey. Gerald Selkirk! That was Strings. I read out name after name after name. Some of them seemed familiar, others didn't. I kept going, hoping I had the names and faces right in my head, wondering if it even mattered. The nameless one pursued us, but he would not let his feet go too far down the bank. He would not enter the water, I realised; the thought filled me with relief. I kept reading. Thaddeus Moore! Scarecrow. Eloise McHale! The schoolgirl. Celia Gladstone! Goldie. Simon Gladstone! Ginger. Nathan Crow! The soldier. Jean Temitope! Poppet. Amrita Gupta! Calka. Jayant Mishra! Robot Lego Truck. Sandra Rhys! Love. Robert York! The miner. Others I didn't know, didn't recognise, but I read them anyway, until I came to the last page and there she was. I looked behind me. The ripple grew closer, only a few strokes away now. The nameless one chased us, face twisted in anger, somehow even harder to focus on  I shouted  Madeline Greger! Crossed it out, dropped the book to the floor. Madeline's face changed in shock. I saw her hands tremble, her whole body; I shoved myself beside her and grabbed the starboard oar and we rowed together, one, two, one, two. I remember! she shouted. You remember? I don't know, I think so! We rowed hard. The nameless one gained and fell back over and over. He was angry, not giving up, but neither were we. I wanted to reassure her, tell her it was all going to be okay, but the truth was I didn't know that, and how could I possibly explain when I didn't have the words? If this didn't work I had no clue what I would do, it had to work, it had to work  I swallowed my fear, replaced it with love, the sort of love you know would make you do anything, and we tore through the water until we were nearly there, only a few metres away, where scraps of London flittered and flapped through the tear in this kingdom, and I spoke, told her the most important thing, twenty metres to go, but I had to say it. You made me a promise once! I shouted, voice thick. When I was nine. Fifteen metres. You said you'd always protect me. Ten metres. And you did. And now I'm paying you back. Five metres. And if this doesn't work   Four metres. I just want you to know   Three metres. I love you. Two metres. I grabbed for both oars and my hand came over hers. Our eyes met, and her face cleared in recognition. Otto? One metre. And we were through. She heaved the oar toward me. My hand cried out in pain, the muscles in my chest were screaming. Then a sudden burst of light, trails of confusing perspective fluttered wildly in my vision, the boat jerked violently in the water, and with a hard *thump* I fell back into the boat, panting. I was alone. On my back, legs tangled over the seat, I saw Putney Bridge at the top of my vision. I scrambled up, nearly falling over. The river stretched before me, tranquil and brick-banked. The plains were gone, replaced by buildings and trees. Birds flew overhead. No sign of the nameless one. No Madeline. I touched the seat beside me. Empty. Fear and relief tumbled through me in equal measure. I was buzzing like I'd just had an electric shock, I could feel every beat of my heart. For a moment I felt like I must have made it up, I had surely been dreaming  but no, I knew that wasn't true. I could taste blood, and my hands were shaking. Speaking of hands, and blood, my right hand was still hurt. It hung crooked and bruised. I tried carefully to flex my fingers and pain shot up my arm. I'd have to get that looked at. God bless the NHS. No boats were coming, and luckily for me I seemed to have reappeared quite close to the bank. I took oars, gingerly with my right hand, and slowly paddled starboard. Are you all right? shouted a voice. A woman stood on the bank, waving at me. I flinched at first, my automatic reaction to strange voices from people on banks, but no  it was not the nameless one, it was a woman, in the physical world, with a face easy to focus on. Internally I chided myself. I hoped I wasn't going to need therapy after this. I'd have to lie about so much just to make the story believable. Um  yeah, yeah. Thanks! I shouted back. She pointed to my arm. You look like you've hurt yourself. I nodded as normally as I could, and replied Yeah, uh... I dropped an oar on it. It's fine, I'll get it looked at now. A weak excuse, it was the first semi-credible thing I thought of, and anyway she probably wouldn't have believed the truth. I didn't see you at first, she said. Like you just appeared out of thin air! I nodded politely and mumbled something agreeable. She wished me well and I thanked her, and she left. I got out my phone with shaking hands. I'd probably been gone for ages. My parents were going to be furious. Still, maybe they'd calm down when  I turned on the phone. The date was the same, virtually no time had passed. I sighed in relief. Five minutes, that whole thing took. Five entire minutes. Ridiculous, I murmured, then laughed, and in a moment I was laughing as though I'd just seen the funniest thing in the world. Two weeks of madness had to come out somehow, I thought, hoping nobody could see me. I must have looked a state. I was covered in blood and dirt, my hair was a mess, I still had on the jeans the scarecrow had given me. A thought occurred to me and I searched the floor for the book, but it had gone. Destroyed in the crossing or left in the other place, I wasn't sure. I hoped the others had got out. I hoped Charlie had got to Cordey. My phone dinged. Two missed calls. I frowned. Odd. From Mum? What... Before I could call back the phone rang again. I answered it immediately. Mum? Dear! Oh, thank God! Mum? That scared me. She sounded like she was crying. Mum, what's going on? She's  she's   My throat constricted in fear again. She's what? I managed, insides fluttering. She's lucid, Mum said, voice twisted with emotion. She's  the doctors are saying it's  a miracle, it's worked, all of them  lucid  just like that   I nearly dropped the phone. She's *lucid?* She asked for you. She recognised me, and your Dad, and Granddad and Wilma   She took a moment  Come now, I can't believe it   I'm coming now, I said quickly. Love you. Love you. I hung up. So it was happy tears. And happy tears meant  it meant  *It had worked.* I forgot the pain in my hand, forgot the mess on my clothes, forgot everything except this; I took oars and clenched my teeth and turned the boat around, rowed hard along the Thames back the way I'd come, back toward Hammersmith Bridge; I hooked the flat of my wrist round the oar and dragged it that way, heaved with my whole body, I couldn't tell whether I felt more fear or relief or just plain jump-jacking energy, but it filled me until I was a tightened spring, no wants but to row, no goal but one, and looking over my shoulder I saw the ladder to which I could moor, I headed for it; I did not row to my usual place because it was further on, there was not enough time, I had to do this *now,* so I tied tight the painter and bolted the cubby and scaled the ladder one-handed, hauled myself clumsily over the edge of the bank and my feet hit the pavement and I ran. The dirt was beaten from my shoes with every step, I dodged and weaved between pedestrians  just a five minute walk from the river, usually, but today I went at a sprint, through the buildings, through the gardens, barely time to register the small ginger shape watching from the bushes as I burst across the road, through the gates and into the teaching hospital, where I bypassed the front desk and ignored the lift and took the stairs instead, because I was running on disbelief and I had no time to stop and wait, I couldn't if I'd wanted to. First, second, third floor, I knew the way, past the nurses and through the double doors to the clinical trial, nearly ploughing through a mass of doctors comparing charts, following their calls of Hey! with a mumbled Sorry!, and pausing just long enough to hear their conversations  A miracle   Just kicked in, like that   Drastic improvements   Lucid, every one of them  I even called that guy with the horse? He said the same thing, came when he called   We've done it, haven't we, we've bloody done it. A food trolley rumbled past. I slowed to a jog long enough to peer into the window of each room. They were all there, every one of them. How I hadn't recognised them before I do not know, but there they were, each one awake, each one lucid, talking animatedly to their visitors as I went past  the broad-shouldered man with the stack of books his family came every day to read to him; the man with the thick grey beard; the couple whose family had insisted they room together; the man with calloused fingers who always had classical music on the radio; the veteran, medals displayed in his room; the kind-faced woman; the Oxford professor; the woman surrounded by photographs, largely of a handsome blonde man and a ginger cat; the man with the friendly boyfriend; the hippie woman with the long hair; the boy, twelve years old, the youngest here with the juvenile form of the disease, talking happily to his slack-jawed parents as he clutched a toy elephant tight to his chest; the woman surrounded by cards, the tall man who'd turned his living from coal to solar. All there. All lucid. The door at the end opened and my Dad peered out. You're here! He registered what he was seeing. What happened to you? Long story, tell you later. Is she   Come in. He pulled me through the door. Inside were my family. My grandfather and mother sat beside one another, faces streaked with tears. Happy tears. My sister was in one of the hospital chairs, talking to her. That wasn't unusual, but the woman now sat upright in the hospital bed, feet hung off the edge like she'd never had to lie down in her life  Was talking back. I stared. *She was talking back.* I couldn't believe it. I knew, but I couldn't believe it. Mum grabbed my hand. She asked for you, Mum said. I let go and walked over. My heart beat a drum in my chest. I was slaked with incredulity. Our eyes met. She sat, upright and steady, dark grey hair tied neatly at her nape, sharp chin raised in defiance. Gone were the clouds of fog in her head; I could see from the way she looked at me, blue eyes sharp and clear, that no beasts circled the memories in her mind. The nameless one had gone and she was free. Around me I could hear it faintly; the buzzing of intercoms, the baffled whispers of the doctors, the happy cries of the families in the adjacent rooms, but I wasn't listening, because I was watching her. Her gaze landed on my arm. Her eyes watered, and she was smiling. Mine watered too. I knelt in front of her like the awestruck child, staring, unable to articulate, and she watched me, watched me with her sky-blue eyes. She grabbed my hands. Hello, Otto, she whispered. I smiled. Hello, Gran."

I knew what I was hoping  that she'd remember instantly, that the sound of her name would bring it all flooding back and we'd immediately charge out and find the nameless one together. But that was not the case. I could see it had rung some bell deep inside her, yes, some memory she had not noticed in a time, but the confusion in her eyes was clear, and I realised this information would take some time to process. I wanted to tell her my name too  did she recognise me? I couldn't tell  but if the nameless one got to us before she remembered who she was and took her name again, I didn't want anyone else to know mine. Not unless she remembered it of her own accord. So I bit my lip and did not tell. What did you call me? she asked. I went to reply, but then something strange happened. She flickered suddenly like static. All of a sudden she was not a woman, but a little girl, same black hair, same blue eyes, standing in the doorway. A second passed and she was the woman again, looking confused. Do you recognise me? I asked, hoping. Yes. She frowned, as though trying to place me. But I don't know where from. That hurt, though I was used to it. I reached out and touched her shoulder. Solid. I felt relief. The flickering had worried me a minute, it seemed something a Thin would do. But no. Solid. I stepped back. Do I know you? she asked. No, I said. I looked at her. She was too young. Barely out of her teens. Not yet. But you will, one day. She nodded. Didn't say anything. I smiled ruefully. I must sound crazy. No, I   She shook her head. Come in. I entered the house. It was so familiar  things I hadn't seen since I was a child; mine and my sister's model aeroplanes on the special shelf we got to use, the coat-rack with the big tartan blanket hanging off it; the clunky old telly they'd had for years before it finally stopped working; they were all there. And other things too, that I didn't recognise. A bicycle that looked to be from the 1940s, a radio about the same age. I ran my hands along the walls and took it in. It smelled the same. And I loved it so. Tea? she asked. I nodded. Yes, please. The woman moved to the kitchen and set the kettle going. I waited politely. Charlie explored the house, which Madeline didn't seem to mind. I'm fond of cats, she told me, pouring out the tea. I nodded. I know. She spooned sugar into one cup. Looked at me. You don't take sugar, do you? she said. I shook my head. Thanks, I said, and took the tea. We went into the living room and sat down. Madeline was the girl again. She gestured for me to sit anywhere, and I took the chair I usually did. This must have sparked a memory, because she looked confused for a moment. Her eyes widened. She stepped back, as though hit with something. You   she started, and then she flickered, back to the woman, then again, older, hair greying at the edges. She reached for something on the shelf, a photo frame, one I recognised, from within which beamed my smiling face. My parents with my sister and I as children. Then another picture, and another, our family history charted on film, until she found her own picture several times among them and ran her fingers over it, whispering, staring. Madeline, she whispered. Madeline, yes   She flickered again, little girl, woman, little girl, woman. My heart raced. It was working. Slowly and clunkily, but it was working. She seemed to steady herself. There was the little girl again. She turned to me. How's your tea? she asked, in a child's voice. I knew that voice. *Don't!* It's lovely, thanks, I said, Just how I like it. Madeline stared at me for a while, looking back and forth between me and the pictures on the wall. I do know you, she said, as if reading my mind. I turned to where she held up a picture frame. Me in the boat as a child. In here. That is you. I nodded. I saw him. But you were older, like this. I saw him try to take you and I shouted and I didn't think you'd hear me but   I did, I said, remembering the voice. Remembering the nameless one and the reeds. I heard you. You saved me from him. Thank you. I had to. You needed me. Even here she had kept her promise. *I will always protect you.* We sat, sipping tea. I think you'd better tell me what's going on, she said. I explained as best I could, fumbling over the details in my excitement. I had to keep going back several times and retelling things. Charlie sat patiently in my lap. When I'd finished, Madeline said, Well. Well, I echoed. She patted her knees decisively and got up. What are you doing? She was rifling through a desk drawer. After a minute she came up with handfuls of papers. I've been trying to figure out a way out of here for ages. They landed in front of me on the floor, masses of diagrams and scribbled equations. Physics. I studied, you know. I know, I said, taking a piece of paper. At Oxford. I examined the markings. It made no sense to me. I don't know what any of this means. Not to worry. We need to find the nameless one. We will, she said. She pointed. Look. This place doesn't conform to our laws. The physics is all wrong. Little pockets. Little places of difference. If we could find one we could escape. How do you find one? Humans can't, I don't think. She pointed to Charlie. But cats. Cats see things we don't. Charlie *mrrp*ed. I patted his head. So you'll help us? Yes. We need to get the book. Maybe we can get everyone's names back. You have yours  might take you a while to remember, but you do  we just need to find a way to get it. And we just have to go back along the river? You're sure he's following you? I'm sure, I said. Madeline nodded. Fine. In that case, I think there might be an exit point nearby, they seem to be near where people live. She turned to Charlie. Is that how you travel? He *mrrp*ed. She nodded. Right. So we should stick to this side... Madeline, do you know   My head is spinning. Absolutely spinning. Please let me focus on one thing at a time, else I won't be able to bear it. I held up my hands. Okay. The little girl was back, then the young woman. You... She trailed off, looking uncertain. It's okay, I said. He's strong, she said. It'll be hard to fight him. We'll just have to try. She chuckled. You were always the brawn. Like a yin-yang, you and your... sister... The words slipped from her. She tried to hold onto the thought, but the memory had got away again. Yes, I said. It was true. She's always been more like you. Madeline shook her head again, cleared her thoughts. So, do you have a plan? I think I do. My plan was not particularly sophisticated. It went like this: Eat as much powder as we could. Wait for the nameless one. Creep up to him coated in powder. Snatch the book. Read out the names and follow Charlie. There were problems with it, I'll admit. The nameless one was strong and scary and I had no idea how to fight him if I had to, but I didn't know if anyone did and I couldn't wait any longer. I had found who I wanted to find and now we had to leave. I had to get everyone out of here. All those who'd helped me, all those who hadn't; I couldn't leave them. This place had its pretty parts but it was hard and scary, the environment changed without warning and such a treacherous beast as the nameless one stalked the land. Those who lived here lived elsewhere too, at least the Solids  and, I realised, I didn't think the Thins lived at all, except in memory  and why, they had no idea, they forgot until they slept, then forgot once more. I knew who he was, though not how he came to be, and I believed for a moment I knew his name. He touched you already? Madeline asked, poring over her diagrams. I touched him. Yeah  he did, but I touched him first. It was an accident. You have your name and you touched him. That might make him vulnerable to you. But he can touch you. He can, and it didn't feel good last time. But maybe it felt just as bad for him. And you have your name, now. Yes, but I can't remember, I can't   She smacked the side of her head in frustration. Bloody remember. I grabbed the photo. You can, you did  you remember me, and W   I stopped myself. You remember us. You remember Lake Windermere. I remember, but like in a dream. *This* is the dream. That stopped her. She looked at me for a long time. Her face shifted. She looked like she was desperately trying to remember, but the thoughts were just wisps, slipping through her fingers, when she tried to grab them. But the photo  she had caught a tendril or two. With one hand she folded her maps away, tucking them into her pocket. How did you find me? she asked quietly. I've know you forever, I said. I handed her the drawings. She took them and held them up next to the picture frames, next to the one of her house. Then again alongside the photos of her childhood home, the one with flowers in the front garden. I never noticed the difference, she murmured, running her hands over the page. Two... houses... She was the child again, wide-eyed and uncertain, forehead drawn in confusion. I ached to tell her it was all right, I was here and I would help her, but I could not give the nameless one a chance to hear my name while she still did not fully remember hers. So I held her hands, like she had done for me eighteen years before, and let her process it all. Thank you, pet, she murmured, blinked, and shook her head. Back to the woman with the diagrams. She'd almost had it. I sighed and got to my feet. We ate a handful of the powder each, offered Charlie his fill, then corked the bottle and set it sailing along the river. I hoped it would reach someone. There were definitely people in this place we wouldn't be able to save this time, but, if I was correct, the people we could would pave the way for more, would build a road out of this place for all who were here. *We will do our very best,* I promised silently. Until then, I hoped the rest of the powder could be of use. We set out into the field. She shifted back and forth. The little girl held my hand and skipped and twirled, the woman walked silently, with purpose. I said Can you control it? and she shook her head. Not really. I can a little, hold it back. But it's like sneezing. It comes out eventually. Maybe try and keep it in when he's there. If you can. It might be better if he doesn't know you can do that. That makes sense. I untied the boat and we followed the river, walking slowly alongside her like barge-horses. Even she seemed understanding of the need for care; she floated so lightly, so quietly. Charlie led the way, sniffing the air, lithe like the tiger. It was a while, over an hour, before the prickling began on the back of my neck and our strides grew careful, tiptoeing; Charlie's fur stood on end and Madeline's eyes narrowed. And we saw him. The nameless one. Instinctively I ducked, and Madeline froze, grabbing my shoulder. He didn't see us. With sloth-like speed we tied up the boat and continued toward him. Cautiously we crept closer until we were almost directly in front of him, quiet as we could. His face  it was so hard to focus on  showed no sign of recognition, but he did look confused, peering around as though he knew *something* was there but did not know what. *Ready?* I mouthed. She nodded. *Ready.* I grabbed the book. He reacted as soon as I touched it. He jerked the book away and reached toward me; before I could jump out the way he had touched me. Madeline jumped forward  I cried out to stop her  but she shoved him away; he stumbled, but in doing so she had touched him too, and now he could see us, oh, he could see us. He grinned. Well, he said, in that hollow crackle. You have come to offer me. I licked my lips. My throat felt dry. Not   I started, then swallowed quickly. *Get it together.* We haven't come to offer you anything. Oh? He smiled too wide. It was like light off a mirror. Why have you come? I stood as tall as I could. I want the book. He laughed. I have a thousand books. I want the book. It is mine. Its contents aren't yours. Give me the book. He just laughed. A horrible sound, smug and creaking. A haunted music box. I will not, he said, stroking the pages. It is my treasures. Your stolen treasures, I said. Not stolen. Offered. Taken. Through trickery and deceit. It is all the same. Like the hunter who thanks his victims for their lives, fooling himself they gave them up willingly and he did not steal them. I stood my ground. It isn't. He moved closer to us, that fearsome grin never leaving him. Madeline stiffened beside me. Tell me, he hissed, face far too close to mine. Tell me your name, you can stay; you are so little  you know so little. I know what you are, I said. He swayed lightly in the breeze, just out of sync with the landscape. His voice lost its sing-song cadence. Speak, then, he said, eyes never leaving mine. I know your name. Do you? He laughed. Or do you know only my titles? The German doctor? That is his name, not mine. He saddled me with it in his attempt to understand. Or the common name? You speak one language, boy-who-rows, I have names in all of them. And none of them are yours? You would never know mine. It came to me at once, the realisation. I stepped closer. Charlie crouched behind me, tense, unseen; Madeline stepped in front of him. No, I wouldn't, I said, not taking my eyes off his face. Because you don't have one, do you? He tried to hide it, but a flicker of fear crossed his face. My heart thumped wildly. We had him. My skin tingled, I felt so tightly wound I could hardly contain myself. I have a name, he said, voice faltering. I shook my head, stepped toward him so our faces were nearly touching. No, you don't. *Al.* You have a code. A genetic code. Or maybe you do have a name. Maybe you're just a personification, I don't know. A creature made in response. A manifestation, said Madeline. Yes. A manifestation. I kept walking, pushing him back. You filled a void left by weakness, you became  for what, control? You took hold of a vulnerability and used it to steal from people. And that's how you live. Your sick kingdom. I don't know why you do it, I don't know how you can bear it. Built on lies. Everything is code, he snarled. You took people's control over their own code! You took their power, you took their names! My feelings had been pent-up for so long, now they were coming out. Everything is code, yes, language is a code, and your name is your key. That's why names have power, that's why you want them. A name is but a code. A name is but a code, but not all codes are names. He realised then. I saw it on his face. He was on the back foot and I was angry. For I knew him, not as a human, but as an illness, a nefarious code that pillaged your mind like a battery drained dark. A thief. Strings had been right, a monster. He had built an illusion of memory, but it was not real; he had tricked people, stolen their understanding of themselves, lied to them and dragged them from their lives and homes and loved ones. He had reduced my independent larger-than-life grandmother to a blank stare and a drug trial, and I knew it, and I knew now it was working, whatever scientists had toiled for years and years to find was working, and we were going to escape. They have decoded you, I said. They have made a drug to keep you away. And are you here to deliver it? he asked, voice dripping with ire. I shook my head. I'm here to collect. Madeline lunged for him. He smacked her down with the back of his hand. Rage spiked hot in my stomach and I grabbed him, he hit me away too but Madeline was back and she was flickering, shifting back and forth between woman and girl, strong enough to fight him, small enough to slip away. He growled in frustration. I kicked him hard and he stumbled but it was not enough, he did not have the weak points of a man because he was not a man, he was a personification, a creature of hurt and loss, mirroring and stealing from his victims; I scrapped at him anyway, tight with rage, as Madeline wriggled slippery from his grip and returned again, going for the book; he punched me away and I hit the floor with a bloodied lip and heard Charlie hiss beside me. Dimly I heard Madeline's sounds of exertion, the nameless one's fury, and the ringing in my ears from where he'd hit me like he had in the theatre, this whole body echo, numb. Madeline. I lurched to my feet and went for him again, grappling at the wrist that held the book. He headbutted me and I felt blood stream from my nose. Madeline punched him right back but he did not bleed, instead flickered horribly like static, like a creature of blood and spark; he was, I realised, it made sense. He was a thief; he supped at the throat of greed, he lapped at the trough of cruelty, the twisted lord of a stolen kingdom. He raked his hands down my arm. I shouted. I grabbed his throat and squeezed until he choked and brought his hands to my face, and we fought and scrabbled; his noises became more and more inhuman, like a fox yelling, that auditory scrawl, and we pushed and pulled and spat until the back of my throat felt hot with adrenaline and I took him by the shirt-collar and yanked him forwards and *he dropped the book.* Time seemed to slow. I lunged forward and snatched it from the floor. In a half-second he realised but I was too quick, and I was off, book held tight to my chest, heading for the boat. I knew he would drop Madeline and I was right; he left her there and came after me, and all of a sudden a bright orange shape came barrelling out of the grass and latched itself round the nameless one's neck, hissing. Blessed Charlie. The fighter, the friend, the utter wonder. The nameless one grappled for me but couldn't reach, he squalled and flailed as I opened the book, searching, searching. Names. So many names. He may have been right there were other books but at least I had this one, and if it was a start, if we could show the trial worked  a miracle, I thought, searching for the most recent entry, incredible. He caught me, sending my thoughts all astray, not here but elsewhere; memories flitted through my head, my sixth birthday party, my first day of preschool; childhood memories, because of course they were the strongest, but he didn't have me yet, he didn't have my name and that made me strong, and Madeline was remembering and remembering; she shifted between ages ever-faster now, stronger, tenacious; I shook the ringing from my head and scrambled free and Charlie yowled and Madeline fought and I shielded the book against my stomach and he caught me once more, grabbed my hand and wrenched so hard I felt something snap and screamed in pain; the book fell to the floor and I kicked it away, the nameless one dropped me and reached for it but I threw myself forward and landed on top, my body a shield. He dragged me back; Charlie latched onto his face and hid us from view, I feinted, pretended to stumble like I'd hurt my foot; the nameless one grabbed at me but I hit back, kicked him hard in the leg, and the closer we got to the river the slipperier the surface was. Madeline held on tight, forcing him backward. I grabbed the book and backed away. Madeline shouted to me. You have to cross it out! Or destroy the page somehow! Of course. The hands. Cordey's right hand, my right hand; they were our writing hands. Oh, of course it would be; I wrenched the pen from his snarling grip, tore the book back open and read the names there, no idea who most of them belonged to, just prepared to shout them out loud, but before I could Charlie meowed loudly at me and butted the air, directly ahead. There it was, a tear in the fabric of the illusion. Though it was far away down the river, back the way we came, through it I could see bars of light as if dancing in a breeze. It flickered and rippled like static, like a Thin. Was it due to our getting the book from the nameless one, or Charlie sharing his feline secrets? I didn't know, but I knew we had to get there. I've got the book! I shouted, and ran for the boat, the nameless one lumbering behind. Madeline held on tight, Charlie hissing and batting his paws, and I reached the boat and threw the book inside. I undid the painter with shaking fingers, scratching myself and sending bolts of pain up my bleeding arm, but it was fine; hospital, I thought, trying to keep my breathing steady, I could always go to the hospital soon. Get in! shouted Madeline. They were nearly there. In one move she bounded from the nameless one's shoulders onto the bank and jumped into the boat. I laughed inexplicably with sheer adrenaline. The nameless one lunged. I shouted Charlie! He meowed urgently back to me. I jumped into the boat, pushed off from the side, keeping close enough for him to jump in. He sprung from the nameless one's face and ran ahead, looked at me, then looked back, along the river the way we'd come. I understood. He would be faster on land than with us. Go, I said. He *mrrp*ed back at me. I shouted Thank you!, which would never be enough for all he'd done for me, but was all I had. He streaked away, a stroke of paint. Madeline grabbed the oars. You read, I'll row. What? You read, I'll row! Madeline began rowing, straight toward the flickering lights. The nameless one followed. Holding their faces in my head, hoping I would know which face to put to which name, I opened the book. John Sullivan! I shouted, crossing out the name. In my head, I saw the Bard's eyes opened wide. Silas Lee Parker! Eccles. I imagined him, too, hearing the shout across the water, unsure if it was in his mind or not. Then there was another, a word I could not pronounce, but tried, and I saw him in my head. Wren. Cross it out. The nameless one howled with rage and tried to scrabble from the bank. He was behind, but I knew not for how much longer. Each name faded from the paper as soon as it was crossed out, leaving only a blank page. Jane McKendrick! That was Cordey. Gerald Selkirk! That was Strings. I read out name after name after name. Some of them seemed familiar, others didn't. I kept going, hoping I had the names and faces right in my head, wondering if it even mattered. The nameless one pursued us, but he would not let his feet go too far down the bank. He would not enter the water, I realised; the thought filled me with relief. I kept reading. Thaddeus Moore! Scarecrow. Eloise McHale! The schoolgirl. Celia Gladstone! Goldie. Simon Gladstone! Ginger. Nathan Crow! The soldier. Jean Temitope! Poppet. Amrita Gupta! Calka. Jayant Mishra! Robot Lego Truck. Sandra Rhys! Love. Robert York! The miner. Others I didn't know, didn't recognise, but I read them anyway, until I came to the last page and there she was. I looked behind me. The ripple grew closer, only a few strokes away now. The nameless one chased us, face twisted in anger, somehow even harder to focus on  I shouted  Madeline Greger! Crossed it out, dropped the book to the floor. Madeline's face changed in shock. I saw her hands tremble, her whole body; I shoved myself beside her and grabbed the starboard oar and we rowed together, one, two, one, two. I remember! she shouted. You remember? I don't know, I think so! We rowed hard. The nameless one gained and fell back over and over. He was angry, not giving up, but neither were we. I wanted to reassure her, tell her it was all going to be okay, but the truth was I didn't know that, and how could I possibly explain when I didn't have the words? If this didn't work I had no clue what I would do, it had to work, it had to work  I swallowed my fear, replaced it with love, the sort of love you know would make you do anything, and we tore through the water until we were nearly there, only a few metres away, where scraps of London flittered and flapped through the tear in this kingdom, and I spoke, told her the most important thing, twenty metres to go, but I had to say it. You made me a promise once! I shouted, voice thick. When I was nine. Fifteen metres. You said you'd always protect me. Ten metres. And you did. And now I'm paying you back. Five metres. And if this doesn't work   Four metres. I just want you to know   Three metres. I love you. Two metres. I grabbed for both oars and my hand came over hers. Our eyes met, and her face cleared in recognition. Otto? One metre. And we were through. She heaved the oar toward me. My hand cried out in pain, the muscles in my chest were screaming. Then a sudden burst of light, trails of confusing perspective fluttered wildly in my vision, the boat jerked violently in the water, and with a hard *thump* I fell back into the boat, panting. I was alone. On my back, legs tangled over the seat, I saw Putney Bridge at the top of my vision. I scrambled up, nearly falling over. The river stretched before me, tranquil and brick-banked. The plains were gone, replaced by buildings and trees. Birds flew overhead. No sign of the nameless one. No Madeline. I touched the seat beside me. Empty. Fear and relief tumbled through me in equal measure. I was buzzing like I'd just had an electric shock, I could feel every beat of my heart. For a moment I felt like I must have made it up, I had surely been dreaming  but no, I knew that wasn't true. I could taste blood, and my hands were shaking. Speaking of hands, and blood, my right hand was still hurt. It hung crooked and bruised. I tried carefully to flex my fingers and pain shot up my arm. I'd have to get that looked at. God bless the NHS. No boats were coming, and luckily for me I seemed to have reappeared quite close to the bank. I took oars, gingerly with my right hand, and slowly paddled starboard. Are you all right? shouted a voice. A woman stood on the bank, waving at me. I flinched at first, my automatic reaction to strange voices from people on banks, but no  it was not the nameless one, it was a woman, in the physical world, with a face easy to focus on. Internally I chided myself. I hoped I wasn't going to need therapy after this. I'd have to lie about so much just to make the story believable. Um  yeah, yeah. Thanks! I shouted back. She pointed to my arm. You look like you've hurt yourself. I nodded as normally as I could, and replied Yeah, uh... I dropped an oar on it. It's fine, I'll get it looked at now. A weak excuse, it was the first semi-credible thing I thought of, and anyway she probably wouldn't have believed the truth. I didn't see you at first, she said. Like you just appeared out of thin air! I nodded politely and mumbled something agreeable. She wished me well and I thanked her, and she left. I got out my phone with shaking hands. I'd probably been gone for ages. My parents were going to be furious. Still, maybe they'd calm down when  I turned on the phone. The date was the same, virtually no time had passed. I sighed in relief. Five minutes, that whole thing took. Five entire minutes. Ridiculous, I murmured, then laughed, and in a moment I was laughing as though I'd just seen the funniest thing in the world. Two weeks of madness had to come out somehow, I thought, hoping nobody could see me. I must have looked a state. I was covered in blood and dirt, my hair was a mess, I still had on the jeans the scarecrow had given me. A thought occurred to me and I searched the floor for the book, but it had gone. Destroyed in the crossing or left in the other place, I wasn't sure. I hoped the others had got out. I hoped Charlie had got to Cordey. My phone dinged. Two missed calls. I frowned. Odd. From Mum? What... Before I could call back the phone rang again. I answered it immediately. Mum? Dear! Oh, thank God! Mum? That scared me. She sounded like she was crying. Mum, what's going on? She's  she's   My throat constricted in fear again. She's what? I managed, insides fluttering. She's lucid, Mum said, voice twisted with emotion. She's  the doctors are saying it's  a miracle, it's worked, all of them  lucid  just like that   I nearly dropped the phone. She's *lucid?* She asked for you. She recognised me, and your Dad, and Granddad and Wilma   She took a moment  Come now, I can't believe it   I'm coming now, I said quickly. Love you. Love you. I hung up. So it was happy tears. And happy tears meant  it meant  *It had worked.* I forgot the pain in my hand, forgot the mess on my clothes, forgot everything except this; I took oars and clenched my teeth and turned the boat around, rowed hard along the Thames back the way I'd come, back toward Hammersmith Bridge; I hooked the flat of my wrist round the oar and dragged it that way, heaved with my whole body, I couldn't tell whether I felt more fear or relief or just plain jump-jacking energy, but it filled me until I was a tightened spring, no wants but to row, no goal but one, and looking over my shoulder I saw the ladder to which I could moor, I headed for it; I did not row to my usual place because it was further on, there was not enough time, I had to do this *now,* so I tied tight the painter and bolted the cubby and scaled the ladder one-handed, hauled myself clumsily over the edge of the bank and my feet hit the pavement and I ran. The dirt was beaten from my shoes with every step, I dodged and weaved between pedestrians  just a five minute walk from the river, usually, but today I went at a sprint, through the buildings, through the gardens, barely time to register the small ginger shape watching from the bushes as I burst across the road, through the gates and into the teaching hospital, where I bypassed the front desk and ignored the lift and took the stairs instead, because I was running on disbelief and I had no time to stop and wait, I couldn't if I'd wanted to. First, second, third floor, I knew the way, past the nurses and through the double doors to the clinical trial, nearly ploughing through a mass of doctors comparing charts, following their calls of Hey! with a mumbled Sorry!, and pausing just long enough to hear their conversations  A miracle   Just kicked in, like that   Drastic improvements   Lucid, every one of them  I even called that guy with the horse? He said the same thing, came when he called   We've done it, haven't we, we've bloody done it. A food trolley rumbled past. I slowed to a jog long enough to peer into the window of each room. They were all there, every one of them. How I hadn't recognised them before I do not know, but there they were, each one awake, each one lucid, talking animatedly to their visitors as I went past  the broad-shouldered man with the stack of books his family came every day to read to him; the man with the thick grey beard; the couple whose family had insisted they room together; the man with calloused fingers who always had classical music on the radio; the veteran, medals displayed in his room; the kind-faced woman; the Oxford professor; the woman surrounded by photographs, largely of a handsome blonde man and a ginger cat; the man with the friendly boyfriend; the hippie woman with the long hair; the boy, twelve years old, the youngest here with the juvenile form of the disease, talking happily to his slack-jawed parents as he clutched a toy elephant tight to his chest; the woman surrounded by cards, the tall man who'd turned his living from coal to solar. All there. All lucid. The door at the end opened and my Dad peered out. You're here! He registered what he was seeing. What happened to you? Long story, tell you later. Is she   Come in. He pulled me through the door. Inside were my family. My grandfather and mother sat beside one another, faces streaked with tears. Happy tears. My sister was in one of the hospital chairs, talking to her. That wasn't unusual, but the woman now sat upright in the hospital bed, feet hung off the edge like she'd never had to lie down in her life  Was talking back. I stared. *She was talking back.* I couldn't believe it. I knew, but I couldn't believe it. Mum grabbed my hand. She asked for you, Mum said. I let go and walked over. My heart beat a drum in my chest. I was slaked with incredulity. Our eyes met. She sat, upright and steady, dark grey hair tied neatly at her nape, sharp chin raised in defiance. Gone were the clouds of fog in her head; I could see from the way she looked at me, blue eyes sharp and clear, that no beasts circled the memories in her mind. The nameless one had gone and she was free. Around me I could hear it faintly; the buzzing of intercoms, the baffled whispers of the doctors, the happy cries of the families in the adjacent rooms, but I wasn't listening, because I was watching her. Her gaze landed on my arm. Her eyes watered, and she was smiling. Mine watered too. I knelt in front of her like the awestruck child, staring, unable to articulate, and she watched me, watched me with her sky-blue eyes. She grabbed my hands. Hello, Otto, she whispered. I smiled. Hello, Gran."

That ability is crucial in a hospital. I had a [bus full of dying children to think about](URL I needed to be confident in the abilities of Dr. Vivian Scritt. I didnt know whether that confidence came from the outside world, or if I generated it myself and put out for all to see. I was pretty sure that both opposing ideas were true at the same time, and that simply believing made the idea real enough to have faith in it. My head spun. I shouted at the surgical team. We dont have enough operating rooms in the pediatric surgical unit, these kids dont have enough doctors for everyone to get a surgeon, and I dont have enough patience to put up with any donkey shit. Im Dr. Scritt, and you work for me now. Dr. Matthews, how many surgeons do we have ready to go? His head jerked to attention like it was caught on a fishing line, and I felt a surge of strength at the fear I could feel radiating from him. Nine, uh, and ten if you take a patient yourself, Ms.  uh, Dr. Scritt. He cleared his throat. Ive got four nurses scrambling to make calls, but its not looking good. Most of the streets are completely flooded, and everyone whos attempted to drive here has gotten stranded. We tried contacting everyone we can  but the storm knocked the landline phones out, and its crippling our cell reception. Were admittedly caught off-guard, its really a freak storm for August. Well I dont I stopped short. Whats the date? I whispered to him. Its the Thursday  I mean, August 25th. Vertigo hit me so hard that it felt like my asshole was turning inside out. Excuse me. I dashed out of the room and headed down the hallway. Before I could make it back into my own office, I dove into [a familiar janitors closet](URL I wanted to cry, but I was shaking too much. I looked down at my watch. My childhood home was going to burn down in an hour. My brother was still alive. Thoughts flitted independently across my brain like fifteen border collies on crack. *They need me now. Timmy needs me now. The landlines are out. Im needed in surgery. Someone is going to die. It is going to be my fault.* *You have five seconds to keep shaking and feeling sorry for yourself before you go out the door and decide whose life changes forever.* I didnt think I could do it. Then I opened the door and walked outside. Dr. Matthews. It seems were at least two surgeons short. How can you help me out? He looked at me steadily, but still with that hint of fear. I fed on it. Well, its not ideal, but I think that well have to put some interns on solo procedures. He winced. My stomach turned to clay. Who do you have in mind? Doctors uh, Yangston and Branying have been doing very well. I closed my eyes. Who *else* do you have? He wouldnt speak until I looked straight at him. Dr. Scritt, I dont know how they do things where  where you come from, but its not customary for first-year interns to- Desperate, shitty times call for desperate, shitty measures, doctor. *Who else do you have?* His face grew ashen. No one that I could, in good conscience, trust with the life of a child. I was about to cry. There was no stopping it. Then the doors burst open, and everything changed. Game time. Orders fired from my mouth before thought could form. Everyone followed what I told them to do. Get me a phone! I shouted to one nurse. I looked down seconds later to find that I had been given one. Doctor Scritt, there are three more patients awaiting an O. R.! I grabbed Dr. Matthewss arm. What are the simplest procedures that these kids need right now? He swallowed. It looks like a deep leg laceration on a male, ten years old, and an abdominal lacerations on a female, also ten, no signs of damage to any major organs. Im going to take one of those patients, pair Tweedledee and Tweedledum with the other and keep them close enough to- Doctor Scritt! Three other children are in cardiac arrest, are you really going to- I need to make a phone call! Youre needed in surgery! Im the fucking chief of medicine! Because youre the one whos supposed to make the hardest decisions! I froze. The tears were waiting, but there simply wasnt time to cry. Its amazing what happens to impossible when there just isnt space for it. Get Yangston and Branying on the easy cases, I commanded, and prep a third patient for me in an operating room *with* them! I want an eye on as many surgeries as possible! I turned around to face a nurse at the desk, then scribbled a phone number on a sheet of paper. Call this house, tell them to get everyone out to safety! She physically drew back in fear. All of our landlines are down, Doctor. Well since Im fresh out of carrier pigeons, *use a cell phone!* She fought back tears. God damn, it was annoying me. I cant. Why not? Because I gave you mine. Im sorry. My eyes bulged. Well? Does no one else at the desk have one? What is this, 2006? She winced. Not yet. Im sorry. Oh, yeah. Not wanting to look stupid, I stared her down like this was her fault. Then I raced into surgery. * Does *any*one have a cell phone that gets reception? I snapped at Dr. Matthews as we both ran down the hall. No, he gasped as he fell behind me. It looks like the storm has completely cut off all cell reception. * I didnt have time to ponder whether a satellite phone existent anywhere in this God-forsaken hospital. I was stitching up some kids abdomen, staring at my watch and glancing across the O. R. at Branying and Yangston. *Compartmentalize.* Im finished here. Nurse, take this kid to recovery, I have to make a phone- Patients coding! The voice came from the far end of the room. Surprisingly, it was neither Branying nor Yangston, but a young resident that I knew would not endure into my original timeline. I raced across the O. R. to find that the doctor was frozen in place. Im sorry, he mumbled through his surgical mask, I saw something in the closet my mind isnt- Able to realize that you left forceps inside of the patients arm? I shouted. When he didnt move, I dove in. Though it had been difficult at the time, Id faced the same hospital ghosts this man couldnt handle. Nothing in front of him was impossible, but he had chosen to believe that as an excuse to himself. This is why I have no patience with people. But even when she had stabilized, the patients temperature was abnormally high. I also noticed how swollen her abdomen appeared. This is why Im such a good doctor. Seconds later, I was doing a damn good job of removing the girls burst appendix, able to glance up at Branying and Yangston but unable to do anything to help them. Those numbers are fine for an *adult.* Is this your first time working on a child? a nurse snapped at Yangston. We performed the hemogram test, did you even *check* the results- Yangstons face turned bright red against the white surgical mask. You need to get the hell out of my O. R., Nurse- Your patients coding! NOW. *Fuck.* It was happening. My own patients appendix was in a *bad* state, but I had nearly finished. What  what happened? Branyings panicked voice came from across the room. The scalpel shook in my hands. I could see the crash cart from the corner of my eye, recognizing an ID number of 8251913 as I knew I would. You cut his splenic artery, Doctor, a nurse responded flatly. Im sorry! Branying wailed. My hands were shaking, Im so sorry- ------------ *I hate church, I whined, flopping myself onto the couch. How do we even know that God is real?* *My father ran his fingers through his thinning hair. His nails were dirty. They were always dirty. Going to church makes your pregnant mother stop nagging me for a whole hour each week, and thats all the proof of the divine I need, he sighed as he plopped on the couch next to me.* *I didnt understand what he meant, so I kept the scowl etched deeply into my face. I flinched when he tried to hug me.* *Daddy cleared his throat. I didnt go to college like your mom did, so I never learned the best ways to convince people that theyre wrong. He shook his head slowly. I dont know if adults understand church any more than six-year-olds like you do, Ellie, but many adults are old enough and wise enough to know when we should stop thinking and just go along with things.* *I kept my head turned away to show that he wasnt winning me over.* *I could hear him scratching his scalp in frustration.* *Okay, he continued, exasperated. Ill give you my best answer about church, and then you have to put your shoes on and just go out the door with me, because thats the best youre getting. Do you understand?* *I huffed.* *I dont  its impossible for me to give a reason why we should believe in God, Ellie. It seems like so many things in life are unfair. But heres the thing. He put a great arm around me and pulled me close. You and I are here, arent we? Well, what guarantee did we have of that? Where was the proof that my spirit and your spirit would be together, or even exist at all? Yet it happened, somehow. God believed in us before we *were* us, and two souls existed where there was nothing at all before. So I dont think its about us believing in God, not at first. God believed in us, and were responding to that with everything in our lives.* *I didnt understand his reasoning, but I felt his vulnerability, and I relaxed into his hug.* *Your mom says that every action has a reaction. But I think its backward, at least with church stuff. Every reaction leads to an action. Did you know theres a prayer about it?* *I shook my head, pigtails bouncing.* *The prayer says that in giving, we receive; in pardoning, we are pardoned; and in dying, we are born.* *I finally turned around to look at him. How can we be born by dying? Isnt dying the end of all things?* *His face moved around in funny ways that I did not understand. I dont think dying is the end. Did you know that every single person youve ever met is changed because of you? And everyone they meet is different because of them. The entire world exists in just this way, at this moment, because of everyone who ever lived and died. Remember what I told you about the trees in west Texas? You dont stop affecting people after death, Ellie.* *I squirmed. So all dead people are ghosts that stay with us for the rest of our lives?* *My little Ellie-bean, I dont see any other explanation.* *I stared up at him with the kind of awe that only a child can have for their parent. So who taught us to talk backwards to God? Where did that prayer come from?* *He furrowed his eyebrows and scratched his chin. I believe, Ellie, that its called the Prayer of St. Francis.* -------- I could feel my mind breaking when my patient started coding. She was the *only one* that Time hadnt promised to take from me, and apparently that hope existed just to string me along. I breathed deeply, stopped trying to understand Time itself, and focused on what was causing this girls heart to fail. She was losing more blood than made sense for an appendectomy. What was wrong? The forceps. The damn resident must have damaged her arm during his panicked procedure, and now she was hemorrhaging, possibly from her brachial artery. She was bleeding from two places at once, and it would take a miracle to manage both issues at the same time. Since I didnt believe in miracles, though, Id have to rely on myself. And Im a damn good doctor. I was stitching her up just in time to settle back into the outside world. Dr. Yangston was staring in frozen shock at the dead child below him, while a nurse held Dr. Branying steady as he sobbed over his own failure. Below me, the girls heart monitor beat steadily. * You *have* to give yourself room for forgiveness, Dr. Branying. *Tell* me that you hear me! He rolled his red-rimmed eyes all over the hallway, looking at everything but me. *Tell me that you hear me!* Its a simple request mastered by children who have yet to figure out the fine art of toilet usage. *Dr. Branying!* He slowly focused on me. I think I need to go be alone, he muttered distractedly. I knew how this story ended. I know that youre in a bad place, but I cannot monitor you every second. You need to take responsibility for self-care first, Dr. Branying. You need to avoid being alone for the next day! He finally found my eyes. Youre right, Dr. Scritt. Im responsible for myself. Its all on me. All of it. He deflated. You cant hold me back forever. Please let me go. I wanted to shake him, scream at him, tell him that I knew what he was about to do. Most of all, I wanted to smack the shit out of him. But he was right. I couldnt hold him back forever. I checked his pockets for illicit pills, but found none. What more could I do? I had a phone call to make. Dr. Branying, I want you to remember something, I commanded with a note of finality. He looked at me forlornly. If you insist on being so damn melancholy over the things you cant change, then *step up and take responsibility for the things that you can.* Then I turned and ran. I pulled out the cell phone and attempted to dial while moving at top speed. The call went through. And no one picked up. Youve reached the Afelis home, but were gone- I screeched to a halt in front of a familiar-looking janitor emerging from a well-used closet. He held up a gentle hand with dirty fingernails, indicating that I needed to stop. I obeyed. He smiled sadly. If youd run to Huntington Bank across the street, you could have used their phone in time. He sighed. But Im sorry, its too late. You house has [burned to the ground](URL [BD](URL [Listen](URL"
53,vulnerability,nosleep,The Space Behind The Universe: Realities Witching Hour. P1,1,e5wb03,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e5wb03/the_space_behind_the_universe_realities_witching/,2019-12-04 19:34:53,"I want to start by saying, everything I'm about to tell you is 100% real. I know that a lot of these posts probably began like this but I really want to make that point apparent. I might not be able to prove physically they these events took place but I know in my soul that they without a doubt happened to me. Which brings me to state another cliche ""I'm not crazy"" but I'm really not. I've struggled with serious mental illness growing up and I know what it's like to feel crazy. On to the events that have all but consumed my life. I've lived an average life in an average city in the United states. I wouldn't describe myself before these events as believing in anything other than what I could see with my own two eyes. I'm not religious or believe in something like life being a simulation. I'm just an ordinary guy living a completely ordinary life. That was until about a month ago. It happened that night with no warning. I want to preface by saying I've struggled with insomnia for years and not sleeping or having a normal sleep pattern has become a lifestyle for me. So it was no surprise when I awoke in the middle of the night about 3 hours after having fallen asleep. My head throbbed and my vision was blurry. I felt like I had been kicked in the head. As I came to I could make out a soft scratching noise. I thought my dog was scratching at my door and I sighed internally, annoyed he had awoken me. I was going to get up so I could get the door when the noise started growing in intensity. I was quickly able to hear that it was coming from the back door leading outside. Which my dog would have never been allowed at this time of night. I had two doors in my bedroom, one that led to the main house and one that led outside to the garage. Starting from the back of my room it seemed to move to my bed. I looked back to the door first and it appeared to be opened. Which was merely strange to my barely functioning brain. I have always left that door locked since I never used it. Then my vision slowly moved from the door down to the edge of my bed. My vision cleared more and I made out a dark shape near the foot of my bed which the noise was coming from. This had the effect of a cold glass of water to the face and kick started the rest of my brain's start up processes. The shape came into focused and I could make out what appeared to be an old woman wrapped in a dark hooded cloak. There was a person in my room. I want to jump up, scream, and piss the bed all at the same time, I tried all of those things but I couldn't. I felt a cold numbness surrounding me. As if I was merely a ghost sitting just where my eyes were and looking out with zero control. If any of you reading this have ever had sleep paralysis then you know exactly how I felt. If you for some reason don't know what sleep paralysis is then I'll explain that here.(Don't worry I'm lazy too)Defined as ""Temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking."" Basically you are unable to move or make a sound even though your brain knows pretty well that you're awake. I felt trapped, like I was dying and just down right vulnerable. To make matters worse my blanket had slipped off the bed and my arm was hanging down the side, doubly adding to my feeling of vulnerability. As I realised this though it was like that.. witch(we'll call her that for now) knew as well. She seemed just a statue before but now came to life. She started to laugh loudly, a scratching, hissing sound like a plastic bag slowly scraping against old dried bark. She slowly leaned down until she was centimeters from my face. She grabbed my arm for support and I felt the icy sting of her iron embrace. That horrible hissing laughter filled my ears and her hot rancid breath filled my nostrils. Something akin to rotting garbage. I was trying to cry, beg, anything but I couldn't make a sound. I couldn't move a single muscle. I could only scream in my head as my body failed to listen. It was such a horrible feeling to lose control of my body like that. I didn't want to at all but my vision was drawn by some unearthly force to look upon her face. Her skin was light brown and gnarled like some ancient tree. Her eyes were milky white but then she blinked her eyes closed the wrong way. The skin started from the middle of her iris and spread upwards and downwards. Before coming back together to disappear in an impossibly thin line. My mind was filled with nothing but my own internal screaming and crying, mixed with thoughts of her killing me. Right then however, she spoke. Or at least it was what I thought were words. It sounded like a howling wind blowing shrill and piercing through an old window pane. It didn't sound like English but I understood her all the same. ""Ripe as roses...time as farthest...you I've chosen...soul I'll harvest."" ""What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck"" began to run through my head. This fucking harpy had broken into my room to give me some nursery rhyme bullshit? She continued despite my thoughts after a moment of catching her breath. ""Your body you wallow...Mind untethered...door is open...my prey to follow..."" Side note here, I still really don't know what this means. I sort of have a clue after this past month. When she was finished she took a step back and I heard that horrid laughter again but this time she seemed to speak over too of it and at the same time. ""The door is open the door is open the door is open"" over and over and over she repeated it. My head spun and I felt sick. I was literally going to vomit when the noise suddenly started to subside and she slowly moved backwards through the door. I fought to move then. Terrified she might come back for more. I struggled with all the mental fortitude left to me. Slowly my right arm wiggled then my left leg and finally my head. Then as if some invisible weight had lifted off me I sat up suddenly, hitting my forehead on the upper bunk.(I had a bunk bed when I was living at my parents) I sat breathing hard for a while trying to realise what had just happened. I felt my body for the first time. I was sore and completely soaked in a cold sweat. I remember thinking it must of been some crazy nightmare. Some hot sauce fueled dream quest which my mind had conjured up. I laughed out loud, starting to feel really silly with myself. I mean I was too weak to stand I was shaking like a child. I could even feel her cold clammy hands where she had gripped me unconsciously looking at the spot as if there would be some mark. My breath caught in my throat then and all I could think was ""..what in the hell.."" In the middle of my wrist where she had grabbed me was a red hand mark. Exactly where I still felt her icy grip. I clumsily leapt up and ran to the door leading to the outside. The door I left locked because I never used it. I turned the handle without trying anything else. My door opened to the cold black starry night. I heard her repeated saying again in my head as I closed and locked the door. Hoping that my troubles were over. I could never have imagined what was in store for me the very next night. What could come to change my entire life and view of the world we live in. Thank you all for reading what I could manage to write down today. It seriously makes my stomach turn remembering it all but I hope to get it all out eventually. I don't want this to come back and bite me but I can't live with the things I've seen. If they do come looking for me again after this, then at least I won't have died in complete obscurity. And if I could offer one piece of advice, maybe it's best that some doors stay closed. Forever. "
54,vulnerability,nosleep,QD: Employee of the Month - I have found danger down the rabbit hole,5,dfnd5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dfnd5b/qd_employee_of_the_month_i_have_found_danger_down/,2019-10-10 08:03:02,"[Previous Entry](URL A special note to those who read this - I do not know how much time left, things are getting dangerous for me in ways I didn't expect. I will have to post these in a way different than I'd like to. You see, these posts have never been made the same day they were written. In the interest of guaranteeing, everything gets out to you and myself, I will be accelerating my release time table. Some entries may now release together. I am deep into my investigation of Quantum Dynamics. I have some of the answers I was looking for, but I also have plenty more questions. And now, the entries, &amp;#x200B; -------------- To all of you out there reading these posts, please help me. I didn't realize things were this bad. I broke into this apartment to see what's been going on with my boyfriend. To my surprise everything seemed ok. The apartment is cleaner than I remember, His shirts are hung up, and all the dishes are done. Its tidy and there's not a spot of mess. It made me cry to see that and think he was doing so well without me. I loved my boyfriend, and I still do. We had been doing so good until his accident. After it, everything changed. He changed. At first, he was doing everything the doctors told him. He was journaling, he was doing his physical therapy and he was smiling. He was so lucky and I know he felt it. He was happy to still be here and to be with me. A few weeks in to his recovery, after he was cleared to leave the hospital, he changed. I dropped him off at his apartment and overnight he was a changed person. He was still kind, but he became distant. Little things would make him angry and he would get jumpy at dumb things, even the drop of a pen. I told him he should speak with his doctor about it but he refused. Eventually he started to push me away. It wasn't immediate, worse, it was slow and painful. It eventually got bad enough that he didn't return my calls. I would show up at his apartment when I knew he was home but he wouldn't come to the door. There were times I would sit at his door crying and he would never make a sound. At some point he had told the doorman not to let me in. I wasn't welcome. Something was terribly wrong, and he wouldn't tell me what. Years have gone by and its keeps me awake wondering what happened and If there was anything I could have done differently. It took every bit of courage in me to come in here, to our place, and I'm glad I did. After spending some time looking around I decided to go through this computer. He had left this site open. I figured out how to open his profile and discovered these posts. Words can't describe how sad I feel after reading them. I didn't realize just how broken he was. Please, you that read this, tell him to contact me. Tell him that he needs help. He is remembering things that didn't happen. These things he is talking about are delusions, he is delusional. He needs help. Tell him he is safe with me. If you read this \*\*\*\*\*\*(I have redacted my name), always know that I love you. Let me be there for you. &amp;#x200B; -------------- Entry #18 Well, fuck me. How the hell did my girlfriend get in. My doorman knows she isn't supposed to be let anywhere near my place. My last post went up less than 24 hours before she tried posting this so it was automatically removed. It never went live for all of you to see. Part of me wanted it to stay that way, but you and myself need to see it so you can understand. I love my girlfriend. It seems like a mountain of time separates the good times we had from now. But now you can see why the mountain needs to be there. Its better for me, and anyone close in my life. She thinks this is some fantasy of mine. A delusion. Something that can be fixed. She can still love me because she believes that. She still sees the hope of things returning to the way they were. Well they can't. She was right, the accident changed me and there is no going back to the way things were. She cannot read these entries of mine, this chronicle of my dark truth, and see it for what it is. How could she if she wanted to love me? She can't love a man who has killed. Would she even love Me? Between Me or Myself how could she choose, who would she choose? For that matter what would I do if she chose Myself over Me? Just thinking about it makes my stomach turn. No my life is different and I have accepted that. I cannot have what others have, at least not yet. Speaking of, I got the job. The interview was easy. They threw me softball questions and I fed them back the answers they were looking to hear. After the interview was over, I approached the woman who interviewed me. You see, as the interview went on, I had this stone in my gut that got heavier and heavier. It was a question. Why are they making this so easy for a man like me? I am a returning employee, from what I was told at the start of my employment with QD it was a long shot for someone like me to even be considered a candidate for hire. What was the catch? So I asked her just that. She told me that the company was shocked someone like me would even want to come back. After the injuries I suffered on the job, it was expected that I would go the other way and never look back. She said that if I was still interested in working for Quantum Dynamics after all the things I had been through, then that was something special they didn't want to turn away. She then shuffled her papers into a folder, packed them in her briefcase and winked at me. ""Don't worry the job is yours. A car will come pick you up tomorrow. Welcome back!"" And with that, it would seem I'm a Quantum man yet again. I know I promised some of those older entries, but those will have to wait. I don't have much time so I will have to end this entry here. I have to pack. After all, tomorrow, I'm going back. &amp;#x200B; Sincerely, Your Friendly, Diligent, &amp;#x200B; Quantum Dynamics Employee -------------- Entry #19 \[Also including: Entry #02\] I got into a small black sedan in the early hours of the morning. It was waiting for me right outside the etrance to my apartment complex. The first time I had gone through this, it felt cool, I felt special. This time around it terrified me. The windows to the car were tinted. We drove for at least twelve hours with no stops. The first hour wasn't so bad. It was the second hour when my situation began to sink in. Here I was, in a backseat with windows so tinted I couldn't see anything through them. The doors were locked, I checked both of them. There was no way to force the locks open either. I had no way to pass between or interact with my seats, and the ones in front. There was a solid divide. I was completely solitary. Alone. I was at the mercy of wherever this car was taking me. I could be traveling to a convienent place out in the woods for them to kill me. No, I'm too valuable, if they knew the truth, they were likely driving me to a secure facility to be examined and interrogated. Or maybe, they were just driving me to my home away from home, Quantum Dynamics. Those twelve hours were the longest of my life. There is only one other time, I can recall being so afraid... That night waking up in the woods naked and alone, I was so terribly confused. I had no clue where I was, I had no clue of the day or time. My memories of the last several hours were foggy and didn't add up. It was dark and cold outside, the animals were out, they were in the rustling of the bushes, the shaking in the trees and the tiny circular lights in the darkness staring at me. The overwhelming confusion, and my sobering physical vulnerability filled me with a terror I had never felt before. I couldn't write if off or laugh it away. It stuck to me. In me. My muscles were tightened to the point of being unconfortable. Every second that passed, I could feel them tighten from the fear just a bit more. In even easy small movements my muscles creaked and my joints popped under the tension. I might have broken under such pressure, but the animal instinct in me knew to move. To find shelter. After several hours of searching, fortune smiled upon me. I had found my home, Quantum Dynamics. Luckily, they were confident enough in the security of the facility that the doors to exit the building were never locked. You could come and go as you pleased because there was no where to go to. It was late enough, there was no one to see me coming into the lobby naked. Everyone was sleeping. At the lobby desk, there was a bowl of fake fruit. I emptied it out and used it as best I could to cover up. It was quite simple to make it to my room. I reached for the door handle and it opened fine. It was suprisingly unlocked. My room was a bit of a mess. Shirts, pants, boxers, socks, they were all piled on my bed. The drawers and closet they had been in were all open and rifled through. My personal laptop on my desk was gone. I walked up to my bed and grabbed the closest pair of boxers. I began to slip them on when the door to my quarters was opened. ""Holeeeeeey shit!"" Ron fell down on to the floor rear end first. ""Wha wha what are you doing here man, you should be in the hosiptal!"" Ron's face was twice its normal length. His mouth was completely agape, his eyes wider than the open door, and his eyebrows ready to jump off his face. ""Dude! and your skin is normal, you were all burnt up man, like an over cooked pizza. Dude are you DEAD?!"" He breathed in audibly. ""Are you here to like haunt me? I'm sorry dude! I'm sorry! I didn't realize this would happen. Please don't hurt me."" Ron was in tears prostrated at my feet. Needless to say I was left speechless. Ron was in MY room while I was practically naked, and he seemed to be high on some crazy shit. Probably whatever I had taken to have me wind up in the woods. ""Hey Ron, calm down man, I'm fine see? You are just having a bad trip. Nothing happened to me."" Ron looked up at me, but my best smiling and reassuring face I could put on didn't seem to help. He turned several shades whiter and let out a strange gurgling gasp. ""No man, they took you out of here, I saw it all. You were barely alive. They came in here and took some of your stuff. They also went through it to check for drugs man. Don't worry though, I took out your stash and everything before they could get here because what are bros for right? SO PLEASE DON'T HAUNT ME- OH GOD."" Ron ran out the room and slammed the door shut behind him. I let out a hearty laugh. The tension in my body that had been killing me since I woke up disappeared. I was back, I was ok. I shook my head and let out a smaller chuckle. ""What a weirdo."" That moment was the last moment of my life that I felt regular. Normal. Later that night everything would change. And that's where we stop. Until tomorrow, &amp;#x200B; Sincerely, Your Friendly, Diligent, Quantum Dynamics Employee &amp;#x200B; -------------- Entry #02 I am writing this in the middle of the night. I woke up to rattling sounds at my door. I peaked open my eyes to see my door creak open painfully slow. The dim yellow light from the hallway leaked in and I could see a silhouette standing in the doorway. The figure was facing forward. After a pause, it turned its head to look at me, lying in the bed. His face now caught some of the light from the hallway. It became painted a sickly yellow. It was my face. It was me. He stared at me for what felt like forever. I think his eyes must have finally adjusted to the dark of the room, because he noticed me looking back at him and he fled. He ran like the devil was chasing him. I am terrified and I am too scared to go close the door. Am I going crazy? I want to call the nurse, but I fear she would think I'm losing my mind. &amp;#x200B; Please Help, A Quantum Dynamics Employee"
55,vulnerability,nosleep,Beware the Instructing Manual,31,dh0jct,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dh0jct/beware_the_instructing_manual/,2019-10-13 07:36:39," This will be necessarily brief. My terminal access with Internet privileges is highly limited. They will likely purge the events I have written here anyways, but, with luck, a few may see this warning and prepare themselves sufficiently. I am, rather *was*, a writer. I like thinking I was anyway. The accurate term is: technical writer. My writing was freelance and whatever my clients required. Whatever theyd ask I delivered. If any reading this are unaware what this writing career entails, let me say that I wasnt writing anything fancy, like screenplays and alternatively fantastical tales. Instead, my career was writing technical leaflets, instructing manuals, and industry-specific text. All the tiny little things that are read in the day by day, things that arent really perceived as being writing at all, these things might have been written by me. Many might believe this writing task is uninteresting, perhaps lacking creativity, and definitely dull. My sibling that isnt a sister even inadvertently titled my technical writing career as: *Technically a Writer*. As much as it pains me, I admit, the title: Technically a Writer is apt as much as it is accurate. Certainly, my dream as a writer was eventually Id be crafting exciting narratives rather than typing manufacturer warranties. The effect created by this gulf between my dreams and the my careers reality left me wanting. As a result, I frequently injected my technical textual writing field with a creative flair based in individualist challenges aimed at testing my writing abilities. Generally speaking, my self-directed challenge was made in the restrictive negative sense rather than a genesis additive sense. Specifically speaking, Id ensure whatever I had written was lacking a single specific letter in the alphabet. Any currently reading may believe this artificial and unnecessary handicap displays little else but quaint and childish anarchy. Until relatively recently that is all it was, a secret and discreet act, my quiet and meek defiance. See, there isnt a single human alive thatd ever be aware if what they were reading was missing the letters like: Z and Q. Unless the text was intended as a primer in zebra mating habits, I guess. Truthfully, hiding rare letters like that was the full extent I reached with my limited bravery and skill. I had never attempted an unmistakably absent letter like the letters E and A. What if my client ever clued in and lashed back at my alphabetical gap? Likewise, and perhaps with greater significance, my pride might be irreparably harmed if the exercise in deleting a greater difficulty letter indicated little else but my inadequacy as a writer. In summary, I crippled my chances at greater success because I d0ubted my abilities and was plagued by all the fears which circle failure. This fear persisted during the many years I languished in my career as Technically a Writer. It wasnt until just under five weeks in the past, I received a lucrative assignment that was by large definitely strange when measured against all my earlier assignments. It was a simple instructing manual. I have created hundreds. At the time, there was little thatd separate this particular manual as the threat itd mature as later. What did stand separately in this case was the small tiny business which hired me was in this case particularly vague as what they needed in the final manual. They didnt indicate at all what they needed when I was hired. They invited me inside their small unassuming facility, a squat structure near the citys edge, then they put me in a plain chamber with the unassembled Device, as I can inadequately call it. They required I remained at this site during the entire task. Usually my writing isnt finished at the site itself but this didnt raise any alarm initially. When I first arrived, I was greeted by their representative and he gave me the single piece which was intended as guidance. It was an itemized list which included ephemerally imprecise directives such as: [1.] Describe in rich detail the perimeter ring assembly. [2.] Describe in rich detail the circumference attachments linkage. Three. Set-up the [etc.] This isnt the verbatim directives, but the generally wide breadth they described is the same. I.e. rarely are we technical writers given Rich Detail as a desired requirement. Usually it is brevity and clarity which are emphasized. Besides the vagueness in the directives, the directives I was given had a quality with *sinister* relevance I will discuss later. At any rate, at the time I didnt see why they needed a freelancer such as myself in this matter, particularly since I struggled with understanding what the Device even was, but their representative assured me the Devices assembly was trivial. Trust me, itll be a cinch! He assured me with exuberance. This business representative, a rail thin man wearing a suit which was a bizarrely bright citrus hue that isnt called lime but likewise half-rhymes with hinge, he further insisted if I can build it, and describe in detail the steps taken in the design, the entire public can build it as well. Specifically, he indicated to me: Clear eyes are best. We need that naive spirit. It is what will let us share the Device with all. I was still d0ubtful, and I hadnt signed the hiring papers yet, but the man in the brightly citrus suit gave me further financial incentives which exceeded my flat fee. These extra rewards were linked with quality requirements but they were sufficiently enticing that I signed the hiring papers accepting the task. This seeming *laissez-faire* attitude imparted by my new client, paired with a subliminal unsettled feeling that I failed in placing, eventually Id be induced by a rash yet in a way lucky risk. Id exclude a highly prevalent letter in my writing. But lets return in hand with the Devices assembly. The representative hadnt lied. Fabricating the Device was easy and surprisingly intuitive despite the many finicky pieces, as well as the Devices still very much unclear intended use. At first I was expecting the directives were needed in the assembly, except rather than give hints, the directives they gave me were, if anything, impeding my assembly. Quickly I wasnt reviewing them at all, leaving them unexamined. I didnt require them. Assembling the Device with just the Devices pieces was fully in my capability. It was as if the Device itself knew the way I was thinking and perceiving its design, and then helped invisibly guide me. I spent far greater time writing the preliminary instructing manual than I did assembling the Device itself. Unlike the directives I wasnt reading, my instructive writing were indeed clear. When I finished, I inspected the Device. I was still baffled by what the Device was meant in achieving. I can merely describe the shape. It was sized like a small chair. Every surface was nearly the same black shade. There was a raised circular disk. The bulk was largely metallic with a few electrically wired parts. Perhaps this isnt very helpful. Instead, imagine if a furniture business like Ikea successfully designed the newest data calculating terminal but never had a clue as what all past and present data calculating terminals even are, and was especially clueless as far as having a terminal with screen and a digital display. I studied the finished Device, reviewing the draft instructing manual I had been writing, and I firmly believed if I plugged the Device in, Id understand what its intended use was. Thats when I realized: the Device was already plugged in. When had I? *Why* had I plugged it in earlier when I just finished it that instant? I reviewed my instructing manual draft, searching where in the assembly I had plugged it in. There it was, plainly written in my handwriting: Plug in the Device at [] Except it was written as the final step. I didnt understand. Id failed recalling writing that, just as I failed in recalling plugging the Device in. It was like there was a gap in my remembrance, an empty space where events had been. At the time I just assumed Id erred and my mind blanked. It isnt as if I was even really frightened by my missing remembrance. Instead I was strangely indifferent and calmly sanguine. Besides, as an incentive that was discussed earlier, the man in the brightly citrus suit had indicated if I finished antecedent the deadline, Id receive an extra premium fee rewarding my speedy alacrity. Plus it was getting late. I left the facility, crawled in bed, and slept. As I slept that night I dreamt I was eaten by an ever expanding black sphere. It grew and grew, until it sucked me in, ripping me apart, fading me away, erasing me. Then there was emptiness. Everywhere was empty. Everything was empty. I didnt think. I didnt act. In the purest sense, I didnt exist. Eventually I was awake again. Id never slept as peacefully in my all my 32 years alive. I felt great. Except, after that night, the image the black sphere left behind was seared within my psyche. Id see it clearly every time I shut my eyes. I *still* see it even presently. Id see the circle left by emptiness. Despite this afterimage, I returned, re-entering the facility, and began writing the finished instructing manual. It was at this time I decided Id exclude the significant letter. Again, I am unsure why I did this here when I never did it earlier. I understand why I decided the letter I did, the *shape* the emptiness presented in my brain was the same as the fifteenth letter in the alphabet. It wasnt a rebel attitude that made me exclude that letter this time, instead it was best described as greed. I felt perfectly entitled in this matter, their directives were vague after all. It just didnt seem right, giving them that letter that is. Except, excluding this letter quickly revealed itself as an incredible challenge. First, my first draft was littered with the fifteenth letter. 2nd, I was unaware the essential nature the fifteenth letter in the alphabet was in regular writing. In particular, the fact grammatical infinitives required that letter made things unbelievably difficult. Third, there were a few terms that had the letter intrinsically and required inelegant answers. Plug the Device in the [] In the what? Eventually I settled with the clunky: Plug the Device in the nearest electrical circuit plug. With all these setbacks, it was quickly apparent that rather than finish ahead the schedule, Id be struggling with the deadline itself. It required the full week they had given me as a deadline. During that time, I was writing by day in a plain chamber with the plugged in Device and dreaming the same dream in my bed every night. Luckily I did manage writing the full Instructing Manual step-by-step absent a single fifteenth letter. I felt such pride. I was stupid. When the man in the brightly citrus suit came by at the early day which held the deadline, I gave him my final draft. He smiled as he started reading. Languidly, his smile slipped as he kept reading. Eventually it was clear he grew angry, and this anger became shaking fury by the time he finished reading. His lips wrinkled, What. Is. This? It was evident my client was aware I had left that letter unused. My fears had been true. The manual. The directives were clear. Werent they? Y-yes. He grabbed the numbered sheet with the directives and slapped it in the desks middle. He then used his index finger and circled a term in every directive. I realized then they each had the fifteenth letter. My veins chilled. I didnt understand these terms were required. The man wheezed. Technically that is true. Well then am I still being paid? I mean, if they cared that badly, they can just add the terms themselves, right? He wasnt unamused. Re-write it with the listed terms by the days end. Refusal isnt advisable. Neither is failure. Then he left. This time, I heard the exit seal with a mechanical click. The exit didnt budge. I was stunned. They trapped me in this chamber because there was a missing letter! At the time I didnt have a cellular signal that reached past the chamber walls. Similarly, the terminal inside the chamber didnt have Internet access. My hands shaking, I examined the directives again. Why did they care this much? What was this valuable in these terms with the fifteenth letter? Well, remember that *sinister* relevance I alluded earlier? See, the typeface used was unique. The fifteenth letter didnt exactly resemble the way it is regularly written. It appeared instead as if it was instead the equality between the first number and its negative. As I realized this, I felt the image made by the black sphere shift. The sign, the mark, that equality between the first number and its negative, it effectively cultivated and reshaped the empty space in my mind. I spent my time reviewing the directives, twisting their terms inside my instructing manual, typing away. They didnt fit quite right, like square cubes in circular spaces. All the while, the Device sat plugged in and the empty sphere grew in my mind. By the time I finished, I was utterly unsure what the time even was. The emptiness filled nearly my full perspective. A hadnt a single idea in my mind by then. I struggled thinking at all. Everything was blank. Empty. Muffled. Grey. Neutral. Aseptic. Bland. Absent. Numb. Barren. Endless. Lifeless. Meaninglessness. When the man returned, he wasnt by himself. Except I cant even picture the appearance these extra blurred figures had. The man in his dull hued suit gave me a verbal directive and I acquiesced. Whatever the directive was I cant say with certainty. Then he gave me further verbal directives and I gave in and surrendered t0 them. During this time I became dimly aware the blurry figures were advancing in the chamber. They encircled the Device and luckily they must have unplugged it because the emptiness in my mind filled with myself again. The third man, with his suit turned bright again, was still speaking,  and likewise never share what happened here with the public under any circumstance. Am I clear? Yes. I answered reflexively, the haze lifting. Excellent. Alright, I will- Hey, he yelled at the less than three figures picking up the Device, I didnt say take that yet! The meek seeming man and female carrying the Device silently did as asked and put the Device back. Each was wearing the same style khakis and plain T-shirt with the business name stitched at the breast. They were haggard, dark bags under their eyes. A frail weakness haunted their gaze as they glanced back at the man wearing a bright suit. It was if they desperately desired refusal, but were left with just an accepting physical shell. Where were we? The man snapped his fingers. He turned facing me again, Right. Let me acquaint us all with the new living quarters. He led me inside areas in the facility I hadnt ever seen, a place that lacks an external view. There Ive resided the last few weeks. I have been dutifully serving them the entire time. The influence the mans directives had while my mind was emptied has fully persisted. My mind is mine again but my will is their slave which they use as they wish. I cant ask help. I cant name names. The smallest anarchy I can secretly make is sharing my experience with the wider public here. Let me make my warning clear: the business is using these Devices, whatever they are I cant say exactly, as a catalyst. The Device creates a mental gap, a vulnerability. By itself the Device is harmless. I am unsure whether it is terrible science if it isnt an arcane ritual, but its that sign, that mark, that equality between the first number and its negative, seeing it repeatedly breaks a mental barrier, eliminates a psychic resistance, fertilizes the empty seed planted by the Device. Whatever the mechanism, they are targeting the general public by selling the Device with the instructing manual I have written. They are altering the Devices size and superficial design elements which will thus make my earlier inadequate attempt at describing the Device insufficient at identifying it when it debuts in the marketplace. I have attempted sharing what I can with all reading this. The systems here, I believe they replace every fifteenth letter with their special character. Which is why I have written this averting that letter. Perhaps it might have been best if I just simply spelt wrds withut the fifteenth letter but the spellcheck might fix these errs if I lack the due prudence and care. Plus I fear if the writing lacks accurate spelling and grammar the excessive mistakes might make this seem like a farce. I assure any reading this that this isnt a farce. I may just be Technically a Writer and perhaps I have erred in my writing, but learn the many mistakes which have led me here. If there is a single thing every reader must understand: Beware the instructing manual. By embracing the emptiness *they* instruct, a human being will be surrendering their free will. Much like I already have."
56,vulnerability,nosleep,My eccentric neighbor was a Collector of unique arts... [PART 1/2],2,dluhpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dluhpp/my_eccentric_neighbor_was_a_collector_of_unique/,2019-10-23 16:08:04,"My parents always told me to stay away from old Mr. Walton. He lived a little down the way from us, in a massive estate; I used to think to myself as a kid that his house was at *least* four or five times the size of mine. Looking back with the information I have now, I can say with confidence that all the space he owned was at least ten times that of the size of my familys humble abode. I used to ride my bike past his house - a truly pristine modern marvel - and catch him watching me pedal along, perched up on his porch. I used to feel bad for him, really. I never saw him interacting with anyone, although I sometimes saw a maid enter or leave his house to take care of the place. Besides, it hurt to look at Jebediah Walton, cause he looked like the opposite of everything he owned. He was decrepit, always looking like he was about to fold in on himself. He desperately hid his balding head with wispy, grey-white hair, despite being in his early seventies already. He always wore a suit, but no matter which suit he wore, it was always several sizes too big, making him look as though he withered away after buying it. This was the look of a man who was alone, and even as a young boy, I learned to pity him. And thats why, one day, on my way down the road, I stopped pedaling my bike in front of his house, kicked out the stand, and hopped off my two-wheeled speed demon. I gulped hard as I looked up at the porch. Mr. Walton was surveilling me with a face I couldnt quite read, but he was watching me nonetheless. I decided that maybe I had made a wrong decision, but before I could turn around and mount myself back atop my bicycle, my thoughts were interrupted. Cat got your tongue, lad? Walton called out to me, a spritely smile lighting up his otherwise dreary face, State your business, boy, I dont bite. I paused for a moment, my tongue smoothing over the words as they passed through my mind, considering what to say. I was just wondering if youd like some company, sir, I started, we can chat about whatever you want, and Im all ears. I have lots of time today. His smile grew brighter, I think I would like that, son, now come up here and take a seat, he replied, gesturing to a wicker chair next to him. You can chain your bike up at my stair railing, if it so pleases you. Whats your name? My name is Samuel, but I like to go by Sam, and my friends often call me Sammy. Mr. Walton pondered on it, Well Sammy, lets have a chat. For the next few hours, I had one of the most riveting conversations I had ever had in my life with Mr. Walton. He regaled me with some of the tales of his youth, from his heroics in World War II, to the time he first realized he was sweet on his wife. He smiled and laughed, and I did too. He shed a couple tears, and Im not ashamed to admit that I did as well. The man had an air of charisma about him, he laid bare who he was and it made you want to do the same in his presence. My parents dont like you, yknow? The words left my mouth before I could even consider how harmful they might be, They think youre just some creepy old man, but I always figured you were a lot more than that. Mr. Walton let out a chuckle, but his face read pain. I could tell that this was how so many people viewed him, and it hurt my heart to see. Maybe I could talk to my parents, and tell them all about my conversation with you today. Theyre open-minded people, I swear. There was a moment of silence between us, and Mr. Walton sighed. Boy, its getting late, and I dont want you to get caught in the dark. Take your bicycle and ride on home. Well talk again tomorrow, should you desire. And with that, he rose from his chair, shaking as he did so. I went to assist him in getting up, but he waved me off. He was a strong man, thats for sure, and his life experiences had definitely built him up to value his strength and independence. He made his way inside, and I took my bike over to the dirt road and pedaled my way home. Mom, Pops, I talked to Mr. Walton today. I broached the topic right away as soon as I got home. Excuse me, you did what? My mom seemed disgusted, I thought I said to stay away from that house altogether! My father walked in, adding, *We* taught you better than to talk to strangers, Diego. I took a breath, and played what I saw to be my trump card. Well, you guys might not be happy to hear that I invited Mr. Walton over for dinner tomorrow night, then. I dont know what I expected at the time, but I vividly remember the hell I caught for that one. Was it true? No, but I was going to make it happen anyway. My parents told me that if he showed up and made a mess of a nice family dinner, it would be my ass grounded for a month, and then they sent me to bed without dinner. But after that day, I was determined for them to see Mr. Walton the way I saw him after our conversation, so I deemed the punishment as worthwhile for my cause. The next day, I rode my bike out to the Walton estate, and was pleased to see the old man where I met him yesterday. He seemed to be in some state of daydreaming, so I called to him from my bicycle. Hey Mr. Walton, Im inviting you over to my house, dinner with my parents tonight! You interested? He scratched the scraggly white hairs on the bottom of his chin, Well son, I suppose I could make that work. Where do you live? The first building down the road, I pointed in the direction of my house, come by around 6, thats around the time when my family has dinner prepared. My house was filled with frenetic energy that day, with my mother bustling around to prepare some elaborate meatloaf or another and my father coming home early and putting on his Sunday best to be more presentable, or so he claimed. My parents may not have liked the idea that Mr. Walton was going to be their guest, but they were surely going to treat him as they would any other guests in their home. It was exactly 6 PM when the doorbell rang. I ran to get it and when I opened the door, I was shocked. Mr. Walton cleaned himself up for this occasion - he changed his ill-fitting suits for a more subtle dress shirt, looking humble, yet professional. I invited him in, and he beamed his signature smile at me. By now, my parents were also at the door, each of them at either shoulder, and they regarded Mr. Walton in an icy cold manner. Mr. Walton, to his credit, merely looked upon them and said, You raised your boy here right, I havent seen a young man exhibit such hospitality in a long time. Well, my mother intoned, we just want him to be the best man he can be someday. He takes to some lessons quite well. Others he seems to brush off. Regimental difficulties, like doing his chores Behavioral issues, like stranger danger My father cut in at this point, Why dont we go eat the meal you made, dear? What an abysmal start to the night, I thought to myself, cringing at the first impression my mother had just made. Mr. Walton seemed to be taking things in stride, though, and we all moved into the dining room. My mother had finished setting the table just as Mr. Walton had arrived, so the meals were fresh and hot. I was ready to dig in, when my mother intervened. Samuel, you know we must say grace before our meals. Do *you* want to speak tonight? I thought for a moment, and instead decided that Mr. Walton should be the one to say grace that night; all things considered, he was our guest, and that meant he should be given that privilege. I gestured in his direction and everyone seemed to understand my intent. Tonight I want to say thanks, Mr. Walton began, enthusiastically, for the friendship I was able to find in Sammy, and for his family for welcoming me into their home to partake of a beautiful meal. God blessed me with these things and I certainly wont take them for granted. Amen. Then we all dug in. After Mr. Walton said grace, my parents seemed to ease into the idea of having a conversation with him. They prodded away at his personal life, and soon Mr. Walton was telling many of the same stories he had already told me, elaborating and retreading and changing some details around here and there. Even having heard these stories before, some of them elicited a deep emotional reaction within me, ranging from belly-aching laughter to tears. There was just something so raw in the way Mr. Walton connected to people through his stories, something so real in the things he said, that you couldnt help but like the guy once he got talking. In retrospect, I say that his natural charisma was his defining trait - his biggest strength, and my ultimate downfall. By the end of supper, my parents were in love with the idea of Mr. Walton. He had talked their ears off and truly wowed them. My mother and father walked him to the door around 9 PM (he had gotten them to listen to him for three whole hours!) and told him that he could come back anytime, and that theyd love him to keep being Sammys friend. Well, I took that as a win and visited Mr. Walton everyday from then on out. When school started, Id even made sure to leave a couple hours afterwards to sit with him and talk about all kinds of things. One particular visit, Mr. Walton said a very innocuous thing that sticks with me even today. We were having a chat about Mr. Waltons long passed wife, and he was talking about her physical beauty. Oh her face was that of an angel, Sammy, I tell ya. Her lips like rose petals and her nose was just a dainty little thing, like a button. But the real stunner was her eyes, Sammy, her eyes I tell you. He paused and looked at me in a most discerning way for a moment, before continuing, Yknow Sammy, you have great eyes too, just like hers. Blue and as free as an ocean. Like many thoughts of Mr. Walton, that was just a momentary stop in a stream of consciousness, and he was right again prattling on about other things not a moment after he said that. But I still will never forget how he said that. As I grew up, Mr. Walton would always have something to talk to me about. Early on, we just talked about his life experiences and hardships, and I gleaned all the information I could. Right before high school, he bred in me a love of the real world, and we discussed current events and politics upon every visit. In my freshman year, Mr. Walton took a more vested interest in my own life. How are things going in school, Sammy? It was a question he had asked every single day I visited, and I gave him the same answer as always. Good as ever, Mr. Walton, keeping my grades up as best as I can. It was then that he surprised me with a much different ask, one that he had never voiced to me before. Swell, swell how bout girls, Sammy-boy? Any of those young bodies tickle your fancy, son? I was caught off guard, and stuttered out, Not particularly, Mr. Walton, no- Bullshit, son, bullshit! I can hear it in the wavering of your voice; I was the same with my father when he asked about girls. I composed myself for a moment, before answering once more, There is one - her name is Katrina - and shes just so beautiful, Mr. Walton, really and truly so. She has a face like an angel, her lips are like buttons and shes got a button nose, just a cute little thing. Her eyes are green, and so full of life. Shes so smart, too, smarter than me. She really knows what shes talking about. But shes dating this douchebag, Marcus, and I cant stand him at all. Mr. Walton paused, furrowing his brow, This Marcus. Youve told me about him before, no? Yeah, hes the captain of the football team. Thats why everybody loves him. He isnt good looking, talented at anything else, and hes dumber than a box of rocks I hate the guy. I felt uncomfortable speaking at length about Marcus. Just the thought of how he bullied me brought heat to my cheeks and burning tears welled in my eyes. Sammy, son, a man like Marcus only has so much to offer to this world. Hes a shitstain, mere grime on the face of humanity. Hes below you and what you have to offer, and one day the people around you will realize that. I contemplated on what Mr. Walton was saying, and I suppose at the time it did make me feel a little better. I went home that night and slept like a baby, and woke up actually looking forward to school the next day. When I got there, though, I saw that the place was empty. Backpack slung over my shoulder, my confidence quickly turned to confusion. Why the hell was school closed on a random Thursday? I saw a group of administrators quickly push through the front doors and hurry their way down the steps. I recognized several of them - the principal, the vice principal, the superintendent of the district, and the mayor, but there were a couple more faces that were foreign to me. When the principal saw me, he sent me home. Schools closed due to a local panic, Sam, go home and lock yourself up tight. I did as I was told, making a stop at Mr. Waltons house along the way. Mr. Walton, the entire town is in a frenzy right now! Do you know whats going on? He regarded my question with an air of calmness, Sit, Sammy. Take a breather, you look winded. Id love to, sir, I spoke quickly, but I need to get home in a couple minutes. I just want to see if youre in the know about whats happening. Ah yes, well apparently the star of the high school football team has vanished. Right out of bed last night. There was no call for alarm at first, because I suppose he would often go on benders with his friends, but they hadnt seen him all of last night when he was set to show up at a party. Small towns really take these disappearances hard, Sammy, but Im sure hell show up boozed out somewhere close by. And if he doesnt, people will move on quicker than you know. Take care of yourself, Sammy, and make sure to get home safe and sound. Mr. Walton had said that with such a coldness in his voice, a coldness that I likely detected and had ignored. He was like a second father to me, and I obeyed him. I went home and took the day to catch up on some reading I had been putting off doing. The next week, school was closed up. There was a strict curfew for all citizens under 18 years of age to remain inside between the hours of 10 PM and 9 AM. Marcus still wasnt found. The next week, the school opened again, and the mood of every student was somber. People gave Katrina space, and some people talked about how shed be found crying in the bathroom from time to time. A week later, the curfew was lessened to 12 AM to 6 AM. A week after that, it was lifted altogether. Months went by, and soon no one even spoke of Marcus. It was like he dropped off the face of the planet. I remembered frequently what Mr. Walton had told me - people will move on quicker than you know - and I wondered if I was the only one to ever still think about Marcus. *How ironic would that be?* I found myself thinking that that was both a tragic and comedic idea. The one who he had terrorized the most remembered him more so than even his girlfriend. Well, as it were, I took advantage of the vacuum formed in the social pyramid, and made a name for myself. I didnt push or shove of become an asshole myself, I merely took advantage of speaking to people who would never have spoken to me before. The vulnerability that Marcus disappearance opened up in people was incredible - it was like there was a mass-self-reflection taking place in my own school. I even put myself out there and asked out Katrina, and she even said yes to me! I wouldnt have been able to dream of these things prior to Marcus absence. I pitied his family, and I even felt a strange remorse for having hated him so much when he was around, but now that he was gone I felt truly at peace with my life. I had never been so happy before. That was, of course, until I shared the most unfortunate experience with Mr. Walton. It was a day just as any other when Mr. Walton brought forth his unusual offering, the one that would change my life forever. I dont know what made him choose this day, or anything else that could have been going on in that cold, calculating mind, but I do know that I resent it all. Sammy, son, I have something to show you. Lets take a walk inside of my house, shall we? I had never been inside of Mr. Waltons house, even after all this time, so this offer, to put it frankly, blew my mind. Sounds like a plan, Mr. Walton, I could barely contain my excitement, but are you sure you want me to come in? Of course, boy! Youre like the son I never had, and I want to let you in on my greatest hobby. Once you know, however, youll be shedding whatever life you had before, though, I must warn! He chuckled to himself and I smirked, Its really that big of a secret, huh? Entering Mr. Waltons house was like entering a museum. There was velvet furniture and marble floors, there were paintings that couldnt have possibly been reproductions, and taxidermies of animals I hadnt even heard of. Ascending the spiral staircase at the middle of the front room (which served as a hub for the rest of the house, from bedrooms to dining rooms to kitchens, I would later find out from a police report) we arrived at his private study. As Mr. Walton began striding around the room, I took stock of the place. The room was extravagant, with a beautifully crafted mahogany desk as a centerpiece. Upon the desk was a collection of numerous personal journals, as well as a collection of transactions that looked to be as thick as *War and Peace* \- a collection I assumed was built in Mr. Waltons days of doing business. A chandelier hung as the only light source aside from a handheld lantern placed on the desk, and the diamonds that shimmered from it had to be worth a pretty penny. Bookshelves adorned every side of the room, containing almanacs and encyclopedias and novels and collections in languages I never even fathomed could exist. Mr. Walton walked up to one of these books with a purpose, pulling it from the wall. As he did so, the bookshelf slid forward and to the left, revealing a descending set of stairs. I was not mentally prepared for this. The thoughts that might have resounded in another mind, such as *thats cliche* or *holy shit I did NOT sign up for this* were elusive to me. Instead, I thought of what could be in store for me, *Could it be money? Pieces of Mr. Waltons history? This is what he meant by life-changing, this is incredible!* We walked the staircase together, but it was completely dark when we reached the bottom. Sammy, my boy, I take ten steps forward and tell me when you have done so. I had complete trust in Mr. Walton, and so I did as he said to do. Alright Mr. Walton, Ive done as you asked. Is there any light in- I was cut off mid-sentence, because the amount of light that shone down at me was near blinding. It took a second for my eyes to adjust, but when they did, I started screaming. I was positioned mere inches away from some thing. It certainly was not human, merely attempting to mask itself with some semblance of humanity with its composite parts. Eyes bulged out of its head, hanging out on stalks composed of human fingers. Human toes were positioned as fangs outside of the mouth. The torso was largely untouched, but the legs and arms were swapped in position. The thing smelled sickly of formaldehyde, but I suppose that the chemical smell would be better than the stench of the thing otherwise. Mr. Walton spoke up, That was my first piece of true art. Made it out of my wife when she passed. Youre one of the only people to see my collection. I ran around the other side of that twisted exhibit, to see that I was stuck between two columns full of similar sights. They stretched along the entirety of the room, capping off with one final piece on the other end. My breathing sped up at this point, as I realized just how many of these twisted, depraved sculptures there truly were. I started scurrying down the middle of the rows, as it was the only place I could go. So your wife you killed her to make your art? I spoke to Mr. Walton, gauging just how much of the man I thought I knew was actually real. Goodness, no, Sammy! Do you take me for a monster? After all the times I told you about my wife, you think that I have no love for her? I replied quickly, hoping to stem Mr. Waltons anger, Im sorry sir, its just that I didnt expect this situation. It certainly raises a few questions. He was advancing on me now, knife in hand. I squealed, like a boy, like a cornered rat. It did give me the taste, though. Making that piece. Its my favorite, too, though each one holds a special place in my heart. Each one has a story, yknow, Sammy? I love telling stories. They got more and more complex with time, but I never took and killed people that didnt either deserve or yearn for death. Im no monster, after all. Some of the stories, over time, became more complex, Mr. Walton paused and pointed to the exhibits to either side of him, for example, on my left is a piece made from a bank robber and his getaway driver, and on my right is a serial killer and three of his victims that had previously gone undiscovered. Ysee, Sammy, I like finding the stories with more people involved, because it gives me a little more creative liberties with what I can do, artistically. He licked his lips at this statement, and flourished his knife as if to accentuate this point. How do you do it all, I asked, somewhat earnestly, the research and the killing and the piecing together? Oh, I dont! I only do the research and the planning. I leverage my assets to take care of the rest, contracting out of house, so to speak. See, Sammy, Im an art collector. I source my pieces and have my people take care of things for me. There is a Butcher, for the killing, and shes very good at what she does, leaving things in one piece, and there is a Dollmaker, and he is very good at rearranging the pieces that need to be rearranged. This knife is all for show, unless you make a run for it, son. I was openly crying at this point, bawling my eyes out, when I backed into the final piece of the exhibit - and therefore, my dead end. I turned around to look at it, and at this distance, it was abundantly clear what I had not been able to see before. It was Marcus, or at least half of him. He was missing parts; an arm, a leg, certain holes punched through his body, but most importantly, his right eye was completely removed from his socket. Mr. Walton, who had maneuvered his way forward until he was only several feet behind me, spoke up then, This is my unfinished piece, and I intend for it to be the last in my Collection. This boy has more use here than he ever did while alive, isnt that funny, Samuel? But let me digress, if you will. His absence allowed for your success. This is a service I did for you Sammy, but now its time for that debt to be repaid. This piece is going to exemplify the dichotomy of man when its done. Some pieces of a dreg of society, and some pieces of the best of the youth. You have such a beautiful eye, Sammy, and I made sure the Dollmaker left that open to adorn the piece later. The sheer danger of my current situation weighed even greater upon me now, and I darted past Mr. Walton to make my way to the staircase. As I made my way forward past the columns of exhibits, a figure stepped out from between some of them, standing in front of me and knocking me onto the floor. Mr. Walton piped up, in a sing-songy, cheery manner, Ah! The Butcher is right on time as always! That was the last thing I heard before I was put to sleep."

Mr. Walton pondered on it, Well Sammy, lets have a chat. For the next few hours, I had one of the most riveting conversations I had ever had in my life with Mr. Walton. He regaled me with some of the tales of his youth, from his heroics in World War II, to the time he first realized he was sweet on his wife. He smiled and laughed, and I did too. He shed a couple tears, and Im not ashamed to admit that I did as well. The man had an air of charisma about him, he laid bare who he was and it made you want to do the same in his presence. My parents dont like you, yknow? The words left my mouth before I could even consider how harmful they might be, They think youre just some creepy old man, but I always figured you were a lot more than that. Mr. Walton let out a chuckle, but his face read pain. I could tell that this was how so many people viewed him, and it hurt my heart to see. Maybe I could talk to my parents, and tell them all about my conversation with you today. Theyre open-minded people, I swear. There was a moment of silence between us, and Mr. Walton sighed. Boy, its getting late, and I dont want you to get caught in the dark. Take your bicycle and ride on home. Well talk again tomorrow, should you desire. And with that, he rose from his chair, shaking as he did so. I went to assist him in getting up, but he waved me off. He was a strong man, thats for sure, and his life experiences had definitely built him up to value his strength and independence. He made his way inside, and I took my bike over to the dirt road and pedaled my way home. Mom, Pops, I talked to Mr. Walton today. I broached the topic right away as soon as I got home. Excuse me, you did what? My mom seemed disgusted, I thought I said to stay away from that house altogether! My father walked in, adding, *We* taught you better than to talk to strangers, Diego. I took a breath, and played what I saw to be my trump card. Well, you guys might not be happy to hear that I invited Mr. Walton over for dinner tomorrow night, then. I dont know what I expected at the time, but I vividly remember the hell I caught for that one. Was it true? No, but I was going to make it happen anyway. My parents told me that if he showed up and made a mess of a nice family dinner, it would be my ass grounded for a month, and then they sent me to bed without dinner. But after that day, I was determined for them to see Mr. Walton the way I saw him after our conversation, so I deemed the punishment as worthwhile for my cause. The next day, I rode my bike out to the Walton estate, and was pleased to see the old man where I met him yesterday. He seemed to be in some state of daydreaming, so I called to him from my bicycle. Hey Mr. Walton, Im inviting you over to my house, dinner with my parents tonight! You interested? He scratched the scraggly white hairs on the bottom of his chin, Well son, I suppose I could make that work. Where do you live? The first building down the road, I pointed in the direction of my house, come by around 6, thats around the time when my family has dinner prepared. My house was filled with frenetic energy that day, with my mother bustling around to prepare some elaborate meatloaf or another and my father coming home early and putting on his Sunday best to be more presentable, or so he claimed. My parents may not have liked the idea that Mr. Walton was going to be their guest, but they were surely going to treat him as they would any other guests in their home. It was exactly 6 PM when the doorbell rang. I ran to get it and when I opened the door, I was shocked. Mr. Walton cleaned himself up for this occasion - he changed his ill-fitting suits for a more subtle dress shirt, looking humble, yet professional. I invited him in, and he beamed his signature smile at me. By now, my parents were also at the door, each of them at either shoulder, and they regarded Mr. Walton in an icy cold manner. Mr. Walton, to his credit, merely looked upon them and said, You raised your boy here right, I havent seen a young man exhibit such hospitality in a long time. Well, my mother intoned, we just want him to be the best man he can be someday. He takes to some lessons quite well. Others he seems to brush off. Regimental difficulties, like doing his chores Behavioral issues, like stranger danger My father cut in at this point, Why dont we go eat the meal you made, dear? What an abysmal start to the night, I thought to myself, cringing at the first impression my mother had just made. Mr. Walton seemed to be taking things in stride, though, and we all moved into the dining room. My mother had finished setting the table just as Mr. Walton had arrived, so the meals were fresh and hot. I was ready to dig in, when my mother intervened. Samuel, you know we must say grace before our meals. Do *you* want to speak tonight? I thought for a moment, and instead decided that Mr. Walton should be the one to say grace that night; all things considered, he was our guest, and that meant he should be given that privilege. I gestured in his direction and everyone seemed to understand my intent. Tonight I want to say thanks, Mr. Walton began, enthusiastically, for the friendship I was able to find in Sammy, and for his family for welcoming me into their home to partake of a beautiful meal. God blessed me with these things and I certainly wont take them for granted. Amen. Then we all dug in. After Mr. Walton said grace, my parents seemed to ease into the idea of having a conversation with him. They prodded away at his personal life, and soon Mr. Walton was telling many of the same stories he had already told me, elaborating and retreading and changing some details around here and there. Even having heard these stories before, some of them elicited a deep emotional reaction within me, ranging from belly-aching laughter to tears. There was just something so raw in the way Mr. Walton connected to people through his stories, something so real in the things he said, that you couldnt help but like the guy once he got talking. In retrospect, I say that his natural charisma was his defining trait - his biggest strength, and my ultimate downfall. By the end of supper, my parents were in love with the idea of Mr. Walton. He had talked their ears off and truly wowed them. My mother and father walked him to the door around 9 PM (he had gotten them to listen to him for three whole hours!) and told him that he could come back anytime, and that theyd love him to keep being Sammys friend. Well, I took that as a win and visited Mr. Walton everyday from then on out. When school started, Id even made sure to leave a couple hours afterwards to sit with him and talk about all kinds of things. One particular visit, Mr. Walton said a very innocuous thing that sticks with me even today. We were having a chat about Mr. Waltons long passed wife, and he was talking about her physical beauty. Oh her face was that of an angel, Sammy, I tell ya. Her lips like rose petals and her nose was just a dainty little thing, like a button. But the real stunner was her eyes, Sammy, her eyes I tell you. He paused and looked at me in a most discerning way for a moment, before continuing, Yknow Sammy, you have great eyes too, just like hers. Blue and as free as an ocean. Like many thoughts of Mr. Walton, that was just a momentary stop in a stream of consciousness, and he was right again prattling on about other things not a moment after he said that. But I still will never forget how he said that. As I grew up, Mr. Walton would always have something to talk to me about. Early on, we just talked about his life experiences and hardships, and I gleaned all the information I could. Right before high school, he bred in me a love of the real world, and we discussed current events and politics upon every visit. In my freshman year, Mr. Walton took a more vested interest in my own life. How are things going in school, Sammy? It was a question he had asked every single day I visited, and I gave him the same answer as always. Good as ever, Mr. Walton, keeping my grades up as best as I can. It was then that he surprised me with a much different ask, one that he had never voiced to me before. Swell, swell how bout girls, Sammy-boy? Any of those young bodies tickle your fancy, son? I was caught off guard, and stuttered out, Not particularly, Mr. Walton, no- Bullshit, son, bullshit! I can hear it in the wavering of your voice; I was the same with my father when he asked about girls. I composed myself for a moment, before answering once more, There is one - her name is Katrina - and shes just so beautiful, Mr. Walton, really and truly so. She has a face like an angel, her lips are like buttons and shes got a button nose, just a cute little thing. Her eyes are green, and so full of life. Shes so smart, too, smarter than me. She really knows what shes talking about. But shes dating this douchebag, Marcus, and I cant stand him at all. Mr. Walton paused, furrowing his brow, This Marcus. Youve told me about him before, no? Yeah, hes the captain of the football team. Thats why everybody loves him. He isnt good looking, talented at anything else, and hes dumber than a box of rocks I hate the guy. I felt uncomfortable speaking at length about Marcus. Just the thought of how he bullied me brought heat to my cheeks and burning tears welled in my eyes. Sammy, son, a man like Marcus only has so much to offer to this world. Hes a shitstain, mere grime on the face of humanity. Hes below you and what you have to offer, and one day the people around you will realize that. I contemplated on what Mr. Walton was saying, and I suppose at the time it did make me feel a little better. I went home that night and slept like a baby, and woke up actually looking forward to school the next day. When I got there, though, I saw that the place was empty. Backpack slung over my shoulder, my confidence quickly turned to confusion. Why the hell was school closed on a random Thursday? I saw a group of administrators quickly push through the front doors and hurry their way down the steps. I recognized several of them - the principal, the vice principal, the superintendent of the district, and the mayor, but there were a couple more faces that were foreign to me. When the principal saw me, he sent me home. Schools closed due to a local panic, Sam, go home and lock yourself up tight. I did as I was told, making a stop at Mr. Waltons house along the way. Mr. Walton, the entire town is in a frenzy right now! Do you know whats going on? He regarded my question with an air of calmness, Sit, Sammy. Take a breather, you look winded. Id love to, sir, I spoke quickly, but I need to get home in a couple minutes. I just want to see if youre in the know about whats happening. Ah yes, well apparently the star of the high school football team has vanished. Right out of bed last night. There was no call for alarm at first, because I suppose he would often go on benders with his friends, but they hadnt seen him all of last night when he was set to show up at a party. Small towns really take these disappearances hard, Sammy, but Im sure hell show up boozed out somewhere close by. And if he doesnt, people will move on quicker than you know. Take care of yourself, Sammy, and make sure to get home safe and sound. Mr. Walton had said that with such a coldness in his voice, a coldness that I likely detected and had ignored. He was like a second father to me, and I obeyed him. I went home and took the day to catch up on some reading I had been putting off doing. The next week, school was closed up. There was a strict curfew for all citizens under 18 years of age to remain inside between the hours of 10 PM and 9 AM. Marcus still wasnt found. The next week, the school opened again, and the mood of every student was somber. People gave Katrina space, and some people talked about how shed be found crying in the bathroom from time to time. A week later, the curfew was lessened to 12 AM to 6 AM. A week after that, it was lifted altogether. Months went by, and soon no one even spoke of Marcus. It was like he dropped off the face of the planet. I remembered frequently what Mr. Walton had told me - people will move on quicker than you know - and I wondered if I was the only one to ever still think about Marcus. *How ironic would that be?* I found myself thinking that that was both a tragic and comedic idea. The one who he had terrorized the most remembered him more so than even his girlfriend. Well, as it were, I took advantage of the vacuum formed in the social pyramid, and made a name for myself. I didnt push or shove of become an asshole myself, I merely took advantage of speaking to people who would never have spoken to me before. The vulnerability that Marcus disappearance opened up in people was incredible - it was like there was a mass-self-reflection taking place in my own school. I even put myself out there and asked out Katrina, and she even said yes to me! I wouldnt have been able to dream of these things prior to Marcus absence. I pitied his family, and I even felt a strange remorse for having hated him so much when he was around, but now that he was gone I felt truly at peace with my life. I had never been so happy before. That was, of course, until I shared the most unfortunate experience with Mr. Walton. It was a day just as any other when Mr. Walton brought forth his unusual offering, the one that would change my life forever. I dont know what made him choose this day, or anything else that could have been going on in that cold, calculating mind, but I do know that I resent it all. Sammy, son, I have something to show you. Lets take a walk inside of my house, shall we? I had never been inside of Mr. Waltons house, even after all this time, so this offer, to put it frankly, blew my mind. Sounds like a plan, Mr. Walton, I could barely contain my excitement, but are you sure you want me to come in? Of course, boy! Youre like the son I never had, and I want to let you in on my greatest hobby. Once you know, however, youll be shedding whatever life you had before, though, I must warn! He chuckled to himself and I smirked, Its really that big of a secret, huh? Entering Mr. Waltons house was like entering a museum. There was velvet furniture and marble floors, there were paintings that couldnt have possibly been reproductions, and taxidermies of animals I hadnt even heard of. Ascending the spiral staircase at the middle of the front room (which served as a hub for the rest of the house, from bedrooms to dining rooms to kitchens, I would later find out from a police report) we arrived at his private study. As Mr. Walton began striding around the room, I took stock of the place. The room was extravagant, with a beautifully crafted mahogany desk as a centerpiece. Upon the desk was a collection of numerous personal journals, as well as a collection of transactions that looked to be as thick as *War and Peace* \- a collection I assumed was built in Mr. Waltons days of doing business. A chandelier hung as the only light source aside from a handheld lantern placed on the desk, and the diamonds that shimmered from it had to be worth a pretty penny. Bookshelves adorned every side of the room, containing almanacs and encyclopedias and novels and collections in languages I never even fathomed could exist. Mr. Walton walked up to one of these books with a purpose, pulling it from the wall. As he did so, the bookshelf slid forward and to the left, revealing a descending set of stairs. I was not mentally prepared for this. The thoughts that might have resounded in another mind, such as *thats cliche* or *holy shit I did NOT sign up for this* were elusive to me. Instead, I thought of what could be in store for me, *Could it be money? Pieces of Mr. Waltons history? This is what he meant by life-changing, this is incredible!* We walked the staircase together, but it was completely dark when we reached the bottom. Sammy, my boy, I take ten steps forward and tell me when you have done so. I had complete trust in Mr. Walton, and so I did as he said to do. Alright Mr. Walton, Ive done as you asked. Is there any light in- I was cut off mid-sentence, because the amount of light that shone down at me was near blinding. It took a second for my eyes to adjust, but when they did, I started screaming. I was positioned mere inches away from some thing. It certainly was not human, merely attempting to mask itself with some semblance of humanity with its composite parts. Eyes bulged out of its head, hanging out on stalks composed of human fingers. Human toes were positioned as fangs outside of the mouth. The torso was largely untouched, but the legs and arms were swapped in position. The thing smelled sickly of formaldehyde, but I suppose that the chemical smell would be better than the stench of the thing otherwise. Mr. Walton spoke up, That was my first piece of true art. Made it out of my wife when she passed. Youre one of the only people to see my collection. I ran around the other side of that twisted exhibit, to see that I was stuck between two columns full of similar sights. They stretched along the entirety of the room, capping off with one final piece on the other end. My breathing sped up at this point, as I realized just how many of these twisted, depraved sculptures there truly were. I started scurrying down the middle of the rows, as it was the only place I could go. So your wife you killed her to make your art? I spoke to Mr. Walton, gauging just how much of the man I thought I knew was actually real. Goodness, no, Sammy! Do you take me for a monster? After all the times I told you about my wife, you think that I have no love for her? I replied quickly, hoping to stem Mr. Waltons anger, Im sorry sir, its just that I didnt expect this situation. It certainly raises a few questions. He was advancing on me now, knife in hand. I squealed, like a boy, like a cornered rat. It did give me the taste, though. Making that piece. Its my favorite, too, though each one holds a special place in my heart. Each one has a story, yknow, Sammy? I love telling stories. They got more and more complex with time, but I never took and killed people that didnt either deserve or yearn for death. Im no monster, after all. Some of the stories, over time, became more complex, Mr. Walton paused and pointed to the exhibits to either side of him, for example, on my left is a piece made from a bank robber and his getaway driver, and on my right is a serial killer and three of his victims that had previously gone undiscovered. Ysee, Sammy, I like finding the stories with more people involved, because it gives me a little more creative liberties with what I can do, artistically. He licked his lips at this statement, and flourished his knife as if to accentuate this point. How do you do it all, I asked, somewhat earnestly, the research and the killing and the piecing together? Oh, I dont! I only do the research and the planning. I leverage my assets to take care of the rest, contracting out of house, so to speak. See, Sammy, Im an art collector. I source my pieces and have my people take care of things for me. There is a Butcher, for the killing, and shes very good at what she does, leaving things in one piece, and there is a Dollmaker, and he is very good at rearranging the pieces that need to be rearranged. This knife is all for show, unless you make a run for it, son. I was openly crying at this point, bawling my eyes out, when I backed into the final piece of the exhibit - and therefore, my dead end. I turned around to look at it, and at this distance, it was abundantly clear what I had not been able to see before. It was Marcus, or at least half of him. He was missing parts; an arm, a leg, certain holes punched through his body, but most importantly, his right eye was completely removed from his socket. Mr. Walton, who had maneuvered his way forward until he was only several feet behind me, spoke up then, This is my unfinished piece, and I intend for it to be the last in my Collection. This boy has more use here than he ever did while alive, isnt that funny, Samuel? But let me digress, if you will. His absence allowed for your success. This is a service I did for you Sammy, but now its time for that debt to be repaid. This piece is going to exemplify the dichotomy of man when its done. Some pieces of a dreg of society, and some pieces of the best of the youth. You have such a beautiful eye, Sammy, and I made sure the Dollmaker left that open to adorn the piece later. The sheer danger of my current situation weighed even greater upon me now, and I darted past Mr. Walton to make my way to the staircase. As I made my way forward past the columns of exhibits, a figure stepped out from between some of them, standing in front of me and knocking me onto the floor. Mr. Walton piped up, in a sing-songy, cheery manner, Ah! The Butcher is right on time as always! That was the last thing I heard before I was put to sleep."

For what felt like hours, I tried to force the abominable temptation from my mind My landlord stopped by today. She informed me weeks ago about her plan to do so. I was hoping that replacing my carbon monoxide detector was littler higher on her priority list. Never the less, it provided an opportunity to inquire about the people I believe to be the previous occupants of this place. Hmm I dont remember Beth ever mentioning an Abby or a Jaden.  She delivered the disappointment while perched awkwardly atop my step ladder. Given what Id come to know about the previous owner, I found this hard to believe. Granted the two had in fact been tenants. Beth had seemed incredibly enthusiastic about being the live-in manager, and was able to specify her plans for renovation in minute detail. I know because I recall the particular moment where I pretended to grasp an explanation of her newly purchased boiler system. I also recall her ability to name each current occupant, their spouse, and occupation. It made sense though, the woman before me now, not having the same rapport with the place. Beth had sung the buildings praises. Shed championed her achievement in bringing the place out of exclusive felony housing. Yet she chose not to inform me about her on going intentions to sell the property. I moved in, while Beth moved out. I was never given an opportunity to inquire why she had done so with such haste. Miraculously, the proprietor who Id signed no contract with, successfully staved off electrocution, and climbed her way down. Youre sure she didnt? Its just that Beth swore by everyone in the building. So I thought maybe Ya know.. I just.. I havent really been here that long, and Im not terribly familiar with everyone just yet. Can I ask what it is youre The way in which her question trailed off and the ting of suspicion growing across her face hinted that an explanation was in order. This This girl Abby, I believe... showed up here the other night. I wouldnt have paid any mind to it except it was really late and she seemed pretty distraught...Like she might have been in trouble or.. something. I just I have no way of knowing whether or not she wound up somewhere safe. As she listened her look changed from skepticism to one of sympathetic concern. Oh Um Well You mentioned you have some of her mail? I suppose I could contact the post office Im not sure how much information theyll be able to provide butI should probably ask about having the mail rerouted...  If you could just confirm with someone that shes alright Yes, of course. Ill try by best. Unwilling to prey any further, I initiated a mundane conversation about a better method in which to deliver my rent, and then she repaired to exit. I was offering a, Well thank you very much, when she paused, as if struck by some sort of revelation. With an inquisitive look she turned back to me. You know Dave might know something. You know, Dave? In #10... Below you? The unexpected offer of information had me taken aback, and for a moment and I hesitated. Im Im not sure I She reiterated the name. Dave. Hes the guy with the bike out back. I think his wife just had a baby. Clarity stuck me, and I was suddenly aware of what she was referring to. Often on treks from my car, through the back parking lot, Id encounter a burley looking gentlemen with a lengthy charcoal beard. He was surely one of individuals with whom Id exchanged gestures, but not words. Apparently the space, occupied not by a car, but exclusively by a motorcycle belonged to this man Dave. If you happen to run into him, he might be able to tell you better than I can. He's one of the hold overs from the reform housing. Being offered a potentially substantial lead had my mind distracted, and I scarcely remember the landlord leaving. Again, I was with only the walls. For months Id congregated with them, and them alone. Now I had a been offered a small glimpse into what they might have seen before my arrival. -Dae"

Whilst some of the new school may have switched to apps or websites to communicate, anyone whos been a trucker for a while sticks to the CB. Perhaps if Id made the switch, Id never have been aware of any of this: the Black 571s, the Bible verses, the hunger in the diner, Angel. Although, I suppose, if I had switched, I wouldnt have been there when I needed to be. \- Todays broadcast ends with a Bible verse they use often: Micah 7:2 *The godly has perished from the earth, and there is no one upright among mankind; they all lie in wait for blood, and each hunts the other with a net.* *-* Sorry  I should explain what CB radio is. CB stands for Citizen Broadcast radio. Its essentially a radio transceiver that lives in the front of your truck. You can broadcast and receive on a channel in a roughly 50-mile radius (sometimes more, sometimes less). Its used for all sorts of reasons: alerting other drivers to cops or roadblocks, notifying other drivers about whats going on at certain gas stations or pit stops, arguing about one thing or another, discussing weather conditions and perks of the job, the list goes on. Plus, after a week on the road its just nice to hear another human voice every now and again. Even if that voice is just telling you theres a bambi (dead deer) 30 miles down the road, or their skins (tires) are out, or even just that theyve won a driving award (been given a speeding ticket). Regular truckers and contributors to whatever channel theyre speaking on will have nicknames. This can be to do with the make of your truck, or the company youre working for  or even just something stupid youve said once. I suppose, apart from the occasional insider tip I just like the inane chatter of it. Certain frequencies, or channels, will be *roughly* dedicated to a certain topic. Theres usually one for chit-chat, one for more serious updates, and a local one. I say roughly because they all usually bleed together, the chit-chat refers to local news, the updates end up in political arguments. Sometimes I think about the first day I stumbled across the channel, and I wonder how things would be different if Id, like the rest of them, just let it fade away. \- Its early in the morning, and Ive already been driving for a couple hours. Im listening to an argument between two rigs, Rocket and Mollusc, about the Black 571s. Rocket says that he doesnt mind them, and he doesnt see why everyones getting so fucking antsy about them, they keep themselves to themselves and dont bother anyone and so why should we bother them? Because they give me the fuckin creeps man. Theres a pause and Im unsure whether Mollusc has stopped speaking or hes just taking a breath, but then, quieter this time: They give me the fuckin creeps. Im kind of on Molluscs side here, whilst I dont have anything against the Black Trucks, something about them doesnt feel right. They roll into truck stops all chrome and matte black, with that distinctive giant 571 painted on their side, seemingly out of nowhere. No-one really knows where they come from or where they go, and to this day Ive never seen anyone get out of one. Ive seen a couple get *in* to one, but Ill get to that. Im about to chime in to give my two cents, when Rocket brings up something Mollusc said a month ago and the two are off at it again, arguing like an old married couple. Shit, for all I know, they could be. And so I start cycling through channels on the CB, looking to see if Im in range for any new local frequencies, or if somethings kicking off in the News channel when I hear a strange noise. Its something like moaning, and the sound of someone licking their lips, and barely perceptibly in the background I can make out a conversation, two hushed voices but its only for a second before the channel changes again and its gone. It takes me a moment to process. Sure, you hear some strange shit over the CB, but Ive never heard several voices like *that* before. Curious, I use my free hand to turn the knob, attempting to locate the channel again. Maybe Id just caught some commercial radio waves by mistake? It takes a while, maybe five minutes, but there it is again  this time for a little longer. I can hear chewing now, noisy, the unmistakable sound of food in someones mouth and then giggling from a conversation in the background, a man and a womans voice. My hand still on the knob, I listen closer, and jump in my seat when another voice cuts through. This sounds like no-one from before, and instead is a cold, calm womans voice reading out a set of numbers. Shes ascribing numbers to locations, and attaching odd comments, and ending with a Bible verse. *Sierra 2-5-7, Sierra 2-5-7, 2 Raw, 2 Raw, Inbound  Moving Four Units North-West. Philippians 3:2* Its no trucker code Ive ever heard before, but before I can listen to anymore to see if I can figure out what it means, it cuts back to the sound of eating and conversation. When I try and look at the display to see what frequency this channel is on, the display seems to freeze, and the numbers all glitch into 8s. And so, with nothing better to do but drive, I listen to the station for the next few hours. They seem to be discussing some sort of import and export, though of *what* Im not entirely sure. They use a code I cant quite figure out, and the cold womans voice comes roughly every half an hour with an update. But its not all business, it seems, and as it gets later into the night the voices over the receiver begin to get weirder; I hear people just whispering in some sort of stream of consciousness in frantic voices, there is one voice in particular who reads excerpts from various religious texts in a half-laugh, Im pretty sure at one point I heard a group of people having sex, and theres one voice in particular that cuts in and out that sounds like two or three voices layered over each other  wailing. That night, I dont sleep too well. Something about the channel disturbed me. It all seemed so *real,* and there was a sense that there was some sort of structure behind the consistent madness. The whispering voices, the code, the wailing  they all seemed to be trying to communicate *something.* Although communicate what, Im not sure. After an hour of tossing and turning in the sleeper cab, I decide to head into the diner at the stop and have a bite to eat, maybe a cup of decaf. On my walk over I can see several prostitutes in a clump by the mens bathroom. Theyre having an argument about something, and I stand to watch. There seem to be a couple of younger ones, being berated by the oldest. You can tell theyre young from the way they stand: theres a vulnerability there, not quite as hard yet, a sense that they can tell this is dangerous  whereas sadly, it seems some of the older women Ive seen at stops dont care if they live or die. The two younger girls then start arguing amongst themselves. There is a shorter one with black hair, and an awful, gaudy tattoo of an angel on her leg  the other, taller and blonde, in fishnets that seem to be so ripped its amazing they stay together. As I approach the diner I can hear the topic of their argument  its who goes up to the Black 571 thats arrived. The tattooed girl is saying that she said shed do anything but she wont do *this,* and that she knows what happens to girls who go into the black trucks  and the blonde replies saying that its just a *fucking* urban myth, and tells her to grow up and that shes not in a position to pick and choose anymore, and the way she says anymore makes me think that these two girls have known eachother for a very long time. And then the blonde girl says okay, well I guess Ill *fucking* go, and then the tattooed girl is saying no, please, Mary, dont, and one of the older woman gets involved again and slaps the girl with the tattoo so loud I can hear it, and the blonde marches off towards the back of the truck. Theres not much more I can do, and so with a pit in my stomach I head inside. As I continue to watch through the glass, I can see the tattooed girls eyes are wet with tears and her mascara is running. She takes a flask from her coat and an older woman starts to shout at her again but she stares straight ahead like she's used to this, used to this sort of abuse and she lets the woman tire herself out and just takes deep sips and tries not to grimace but I can see her lips curl a little at the taste. I order a portion of fries and a milkshake for myself, and Im about to pay when I hear the entrance bell ring. I turn and I see the tattooed girl stood behind me, arms crossed, her bruised knees knocking together from the cold. The man behind the counter starts to raise his voice at her, and says that you gotta buy something here, otherwise you gotta get out, and the girl shrugs as if to say Ive got nothing, and the man raises his voice again but I step in. I tell him that Ill pay for a burger and coffee for her, and hand over a few notes. She can hear me do this, and I turn to her, but she only offers a half-smile in response, as if shes used to men buying her things and wanting something sordid in return. So, I make the decision to leave, but as I walk past her I cant help but blurt out Whats your name? She flinches, and grimaces as if she knows what comes next. Silence. I point to her tattoo, is it Angel? She shrugs again, but this time, speaks: Can be. And with that, I leave. Thats the last I see of Angel for three months. I spend those months obsessing over this secret CB channel. I have to spend about fifteen minutes every morning finding it, and more often than not after tracking it down it slips away. The connection is often faulty, but with enough time and dedication, I eventually settle on it. Ive heard of numbers stations, Government controlled radio stations that were supposedly transmitting messages to spies behind enemy lines using codes, or something like that, but this *feels* different. Sure, theres a code that I havent been able to crack, but there also seems to be a *community.* It was after about a week that I realised its the same two voices who just whisper into the microphone, and even though its almost impossible to hear what they say, I often catch snippets of Bible verses, or words that make me think theyre trying to talk *to* someone. There are voices that hold brief, if confusing conversations, voices that seem sophisticated in some way. The sex continues as well, although it sounds like different people each time, often in large groups, replete with smacks and gasps and screams. Theyll often discuss one truck stop in particular, somewhere in the country, although Id never been close enough to go and check it out. But something about it is undeniably sinister. Its nasty, often someone might broadcast screams, or someone crying, and the unmistakable sound of something striking flesh - *hard*, and once or twice Ive heard in the background of various broadcasts voices pleading, people begging, their voices shaking and muffled. Perhaps Im weird for being so obsessed with it, but it became an addiction. I could find no trace of it online, and no-one Id talked to at truck stops seemed to have any idea what I was talking about. But Im sure that theres something behind it all, and Im determined to figure it all out. It was a few days ago that luck was on my side. The stop mentioned in the broadcast was only half a days drive away from the stop Id planned to stay at, and so without a moments hesitation I turned my truck around and started making my way there. Id tell my employer Id blown a tire, or something, and worst came to the worst theyd just dock my pay. I *had* to know. I pull up to the stop in the early evening, and not much seems out of the blue. So, I park my truck, and wait. I listen to the channel, but make sure to turn down the volume. Even though Im sure nothings wrong, something about the idea of being found listening to it when Im sure Im not meant to gives me a deep sense of anxiety. The voices get clearer as the evening goes on, and the static begins to die down, as if everyone on the channel is zeroing in on my location. For some reason, this begins to panic me, and I consider leaving, just driving off and pretending like this had never happened, throwing out my notebooks and just spending the rest of the year listening to the radio like a normal person. But Ive come this far, and I just cant bring myself to do it. People come and go, in cars and trucks, but no-one particularly out of the ordinary. But as the sun sets, I spot a familiar face. In a group of three, Angel walks to the front of the mens bathrooms and lights a cigarette. Her blonde friend isnt with her. Even from this distance I can see that she looks older, thinner. Her face seems gaunt, and theres a new stiffness in her posture. Shes not as receptive to what the others are saying, and clenches her jaw, staring into the distance. She doesnt look strung out, currently, but shes changed in that way addiction changes you, makes you harder, makes you retreat within yourself so that your eyes lack life and look like dull globes instead. I feel weird just sat here in my truck, and so I decide to walk into the diner at the stop, half trying to catch Angels eye as I walk past, to see if shed recognise me, but she stares straight ahead as if I was a ghost. Upon entering the diner, I can tell somethings wrong. The AC is more than cool, its *cold,* and everyone turns to look as I come in, a sea of pale faces watching me as I walk to the counter. I ask if they do coffee and a woman pours me a mug and points to a free seat. As this is happening I can see Black 571s start to fill the parking lot up, one after another after another, like metal beetles in the night, but no-one gets out, and instead the patrons of the diner seem to get excited, shifting in their seats and gazing out the window hungrily, some biting their lips or rubbing their thighs under the table. I start to think this might be a bad idea. I have no idea whats actually in those trucks, and what this station is for  but I know it cant be good, and I think that this was all a stupid idea, and try to figure out why *I* feel so strange, so out of place in this diner. I think about it as I watch Angel walk towards the back of a 571. I think about running out of the restaurant and telling her not to, shaking her and telling her to stay away  but what would I say? That Id met her once before, months ago, and that she shouldnt go into a Black 571 because they gave me the creeps? I had no evidence that the 571s and the Channel were connected, and even if I did what would that mean? And so I watched, with a sinking feeling, as she strode to the back of the trucks, rubbing her nose. It was as Angel disappeared from view that I realised what had been making me so uncomfortable. What had been making me feel strange in this diner. Looking around, I realised that I was the only one with a cup of coffee. In fact, I was the only one whod actually *bought* anything. Everyone else was sat silently, with a plate and knives and forks in front of them but there wasnt a single speck of food anywhere. They were waiting  waiting and watching the window, *hungry.* I could feel their eyes on me, too, and knew then I had to get out of there. The woman behind the counter noticed me looking at everyones plates, and began to walk around the counter and towards me, and she nodded at a man near the back who stood up, and must have been nearly 65, and he too started to make his way slowly towards me, and so I stood up, walking as fast as I could without making it obvious, straight across the lot and into my truck, where I sat for a moment catching my breath. Something made me jump. A loud, frantic thumping on the door to my truck. *Bang!-Bang!-Bang!* My heart was racing now, beating so fast that I could hear and feel it in my chest  and I debated just turning the engine on and just driving, thinking about what could be on the other side of that door, but then I heard a voice: *Please*. A voice I recognised, and I leant over and threw the door open and it was Angel, her face bruised and covered in blood, and in an instant she clambered up and into the seat next to me and slammed the door shut, and her clothes are ripped and through one rip I can see what looks like red bite marks on her arm, and her eyes were wide with terror and she held a scalpel under my chin, which felt wet with blood, and she told me to *fucking drive,* and so I did. It takes an hour of driving, coasting on pure adrenaline, before I try and ask what happened. She says nothing. I try and tell her that Im not the threat here, and that I wont hurt her, and that maybe she should take the blade away from my neck, but she says nothing, and the blade stays exactly where it is, and doesnt move for the next few hours as we drive under the cover of darkness. Slowly, the first rays of sun begin to creep over the horizon. And, moving my hand inch by inch, I reach for the buttons for the commercial radio. She says nothing, but in my peripheral vision I see her give the tiniest of nods. I turn it on, and what I think is an old Nina Simone record begins to play. Its the first noise except the sounds of the road and of the truck either of us has heard for hours. And so we drive like that; her holding a scalpel to my neck, my hands on the wheel, listening to the radio as America unfolds in the dawn before us."

It was a small place, like a wee village post office or general store. I wasn't sure if I ought to stop at first, but Charlie put his front paws on the side of the boat and stared at it, meowing. That was good enough for me. I turned in, moored  there was a small fringe of bushes along the river about thrice the length of the shop  and clambered out, making sure to grab my pack this time. Charlie leapt upon my shoulder and perched there. The door tinkled as we walked in. Charlie batted the bell as we walked through. Stop it, I whispered, trying not to smile. I swear he winked at me. Hello. A woman stood at the counter. She was blue-eyed and blonde, with long loose curls that hung halfway down her back and fingernails painted in all sorts of colours. She wore a dress in tie-dyed red and yellow, long, loose as her hair, which hung wide at the cuffs and dipped deep at the chest, though that was tied together with a brown cord. There were bangles of silver and purple beads at her wrists, and a swirling sea-blue necklace on a long chain. She smiled brightly at us. Hello, I said, but she was looking atop my shoulder. Hey, Charlie! she exclaimed, holding out her hands. Charlie purred and jumped down. The woman came round the counter, scooped him up, and cuddled him, while he rolled around, preening. Oh, beautiful angel creature, beautiful... hello, she said, apparently to me this time. I doubted the 'beautiful angel creature' comment was directed at me. Hello, I said. You know each other, then? Oh, yes, she said, scratching Charlie's belly. He purred happily. He comes to visit sometimes. He's *lovely,* aren't you? I let them hang out for a few minutes and perused the shop. It seemed like a general store, but a little more... earthy? Lots of normal general store things, but a lot more fresh fruits and vegetables, herbs, other such things. I was just looking through what appeared to be a shelf full of ointments in glass bottles when the woman spoke again. Sorry, she said, I lose all social grace when I reunite with an old friend. Charlie was swanning around the shop now, sniffing things. The woman held out her hand. I'm Love. Frisbee, I said, shaking it. She shook my hand very enthusiastically. I felt very calm near her; she seemed to emanate friendliness. Love beamed and went back around the counter. I noticed she was barefoot. Great to meet you, Frisbee! She gestured to the room around us. Are you after anything? Or did you just come in to say hello? Charlie made me stop, I said truthfully. Ah, she said, He's always popping in. but I haven't seen you before. A traveller, then? Yes, sort of, I said. I gave her a brief run-down of the situation. She seemed interested. When I got to the part about the nameless one, she screwed up her face. Ah! El Creepo! Well, that's the best name I've heard for him. She laughed. Fitting, isn't it. Did you say you were trying to find him? I want his book, I said, hopefully sounding calmer than I felt. Her eyes widened. Dude. Yep. You're crazy. Quite possibly. I *love* it. She immediately went to the wall of little glass bottles and gestured widely. Will you take anything, traveller? What should I take? A pinch of luck, a sprig of fancy... thyme? Time? She gestured to some bundles of herbs. Thyme, she said, running her hands along them. Then she turned her attention to the clock on the wall, so I could not be sure what she meant. I'll take whatever you think I need. You must decide for yourself. I didn't know where to start. I scanned the names of the tinctures, looking for what I needed. They all had scientific names I didn't understand. *Trifolium hybridum, thymus vulgaris.* What do you need? To find him? Not just to find him. I tried to gather the words. I need to get the nameless one off my trail. But I still need to be able to find him, so maybe keep him on my trail but quite far back, until I find who I'm looking for  and I need to find who I'm looking for, figure out who it is. I need to look after Charlie. I need to understand where I am, and why  I keep thinking I almost know, and then it's gone. I want that resolution. I want to get everyone their names back. I want to get home. Love nodded. She moved around, taking herbs and flowers and all sorts of things from shelves. I watched her grind a little here, sprinkle a little there. I recognised some of the plants  snapdragon, gladiolus, nasturium. Sunlight played off her movements. In the changing lights her hair looked as though it was streaked with grey. I kept noticing things moving around the shop out the corner of my eye. I looked around, trying to focus on them. It reminded me of a video game render. Everywhere she looked the needed object would appear, only to flicker out of sight again the moment she looked away. Her sight created her surroundings. It reminded me of the 'When a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?' thought exercise, but I couldn't figure out a succinct enough way to say it, so I kept my mouth shut. She turned to the shelf, selected a vial, poured the little mixture in, shook it hard, and handed it to me. It was pale pink and fizzed slightly. When my fingers touched it it changed colour. The change started at my fingertips and curled out until the whole thing was a uniform lavender. She hummed. Funny, she said. You seem to already have some. What is it? I asked. The colour change indicates what you have in your system. It reacts if elements of itself are already in there. I wondered what Calka would have thought of this curious example of physics. Do I... drink it? Yes. I looked at it apprehensively. It looked like a soft drink made by lilac fairies and did not behave in any way I'd seen before. I uncorked it and gave it a sniff to be sure. It smelled sweet. Take it. You might need it. What is it? I asked. Luck? Fancy? She shook her head. Fortitude. Love was right. I would certainly need that. Thank you. How much? She shrugged. What do you have? I, um... I fumbled in my pockets. Empty. I'd given Eccles the last of my money for that bread, all I had was a bank card and somehow I doubted that would be useful here. My eyes landed on my backpack. Do you trade? She nodded. Yes, she said. What will you trade? I looked at Charlie. He blinked up at me calmly. I took that as a positive. Carefully, I opened my backpack and pulled out the bottle I'd gotten from Calka. I held it out. Love's eyes widened. You've met the professor, she said, taking the bottle from me. She held it up to the light, the contents shifting as it moved. Calka? I said. Yes, she said. Calka. Or the scientist. I think she does both. Fantastic. She handed the bottle back to me and smiled. I can trade you the same amount, she offered, indicating the vial of fortitude. I looked at Charlie. He blinked slowly. I nodded. Deal. Fantastic! Love looked excited. We shook hands. I watched as she searched for a vial the same size as the other one. She passed to me alongside a small funnel and I poured it, filling the little bottle carefully to the neck. She nodded. Thanks, she said, taking it. I tucked the sparkling vial into my pocket. So are you like the local shop, or... You could say that. I sell a little. Walk a little. You know. She tossed her hair behind her shoulder. You can see it's not all that busy. It can be  this place is big. I haven't seen many people. I mean, not together. You haven't been here long, and you probably feel like you've travelled a while, but there are many people here. It's just quite... diluted. Lots of space. Is it all like this here? I thought of the Blitz. I thought I saw a whole city, two actually  sort of   I remembered Oxford, out the window but not out the door, and wondered if Gran would have made something of the impossible physics. Or maybe it was an illusion, a simple trick. Most that I've seen. Love busied herself again, rearranging the vials in a little rainbow of colour. Sunlight shone through them and made geometric patterns on the floor. Charlie basked in it. HELP! HELP! I froze. Charlie shot upright. A shadow flashed past the window. I pressed my face against it, but saw nothing. A scream reached us, a noise of genuine terror. What the fuck is that? I demanded, heart pounding. Love's eyes widened. Oh, that boy! What? What is it? She ran to the window. The little voice cried again, HELP! HELP! It sounded like a child. He's only young. Things come after him. Then he comes to me, all torn and bloodied  didn't you say El Creepo was after you? I nodded dumbly. She winced. He's so scared of him. And when he gets scared, he has waking nightmares  things come   I felt my heartbeat increase. If I took him in the boat   Take him and go, she said, shoving my backpack into my arms. Quickly! Thank you, I said, and ran for it. Charlie streaked ahead, into the boat before I was even halfway. I jumped, fumbled with the painter, and tore away, churning through the river. I saw them in the distance, a bundle of shapes running  lumbering  Charlie set eyes on them and froze, all his fur standing up. I glanced back and forth behind me, rowing hard, sweat prickling at my shoulders, and the shapes became clearer and clearer, a little boy in shorts and a t-shirt sprinting away, squealing in fright, and lumbering after him not the nameless one, not a single creature, a swarm, a horde; we drew even  Are you fricking serious, I muttered. Zombies. Of course. Why not. They lumbered, not ran, but their legs and strides were long, so much longer than the little boy's; he could only have been about three. He clutched a stuffed toy in one hand and ran and ran, puffing hard, eyes wide. The zombies were almost comical, they were childish  green and stitched and shabby-clothed, they looked like something out of a cartoon. But they were so *wrong,* so crooked in the way they moved and strange in the way they groaned, with their lurching pursuit and outstretched fingers, they touched some primal place of fear. HEY! I shouted, steering closer. The boy looked at me. I tried to get as close as I could. MATE! He tried to say something, but the exertion caught his breath. The boat rocked, unstable in the current. I half-stood, making it rock more. JUMP IN! I called, pulling ahead. I could see him looking at me, deciding whether or not I was safe. QUICKLY! He drew closer, veering toward me. The zombies were gaining on him, closer, closer  JUMP! I shouted, standing up as far as I dared. JUMP NOW! He jumped. I caught him, flew back, crashed like a stone onto the bottom of the boat. The zombies lurched at us, groaning. Charlie meowed in my ear. I pulled away from the shore. The zombies tumbled in one after the other, reaching, grabbing, the boy cried out in fear again, I dragged at the oars, through my full weight behind them, and the river filled with zombies, churned with them, and we rowed and rowed away, away, until few remained on the banks; the boy clung to my side, and the zombies were  Disappearing? In the river they bobbed, struggled, slow, fumbling. I thought they might drown, but they did not. Instead they lay on the surface, not sinking, not swimming, but groaning, slow. They floated, limp and drifting, before slowly fading away like the soldiers on that ship. They can't swim, the boy said, between great heaving breaths. They go away. I fell back against the seat. The boy leaned against me and I hugged him, feeling his pulse racing with adrenaline. What if you'd jumped in the river to get away from them? I asked. I can't swim either. Not good enough for the river. Charlie circled round the boat, headbutting the little boy and nuzzling his face. He giggled. I looked around, searching for stragglers. The river was clear, but on the bank, two zombies still stood, glaring menacingly at us. The boy saw and his whole body tensed. Oh, no! They're gonna eat our brains! We won't let them, don't worry. I was worried. I was very worried. I had not been expecting this. His face crumpled. They're gonna eat my brains! And your brains, Mum and Dad said! I heard them! I *heard* them! Do you know how to stop them? You have to use monster spray. Tears trickled down his cheeks. I don't *have* any! It's okay, we'll figure it out, I said. The zombies didn't move from the banks, seemingly aware of their vulnerability in the water. Monster spray. Monster spray. That rang a weird little bell. I was sure I'd read something on the internet about that. For parents and caregivers. You fill a spray bottle with scented water and spray it around your child's bedroom, say it's 'monster spray' to repel the creatures lurking beneath the bed. Could it really be that simple? If that was what he meant... I dug into my pack and pulled out my water bottle. The boy watched me with concern. That's not the bottle like Mum and Dad has, he said. I leaned toward him. I keep my monster spray in this bottle, so the monsters don't know it's there, I whispered, as though I was sharing with him a great secret. His eyes widened. *Oh!* Ready? He nodded. I opened the top of the bottle and sprayed it wildly at the zombies. Go away, zombies! I shouted, in a voice far more authoritative than I felt. You're not allowed in here! Go away! I felt ridiculous. There was no way this could possibly work, except it *did.* The zombies pulled away and grumbled at me, then disappeared, just faded away like the ones in the river. The bank was quiet. The zombies were gone. Sweat cooled on my back. I put the water bottle away with shaking hands. Was that all it took, I wondered? Just a bit of bluff and a bottle of water? Maybe it was easy to chase the nightmares away if you believed in monster spray. I looked at the little boy, playing with the cat in the bottom of the boat. What's your name? I asked. He didn't look up. Um, Robot Lego Truck. Wonder who chose that. My name's Frisbee, I said. Hi. Hi. He was small and fidgety with straight black hair, brown eyes and dark skin. He wore green shorts, white shoes, and a bright red t-shirt with a car on the front. A little grey stuffed elephant was tucked into his lap. Something nudged me, though, at the back of a memory  I recognised him. Not as he was now, but an older version of him, about twelve, very skinny, with sunken eyes, yet so childishly peaceful  I'd seen him before, but  where? And then one word ticked a corner of my brain. *Juvenile.* And I knew exactly who he was. But that was impossible  shit. *Shit.* Memories flooded through me, a cold wash down my back. A sudden sheen of sweat slicked my skin. My pulse raced, the heartbeat thudding like a drum in my ears, I could *feel* it like noise, my chest froze up; a hundred points of information connected in my head, each thought a glowing realization, a sudden line to the next thought, ping, ping, ping; I knew, oh, how it was possible, no, I could not know that, but I knew it deep and sudden within the very heart of me, and it all made a terrible twisted sense, of course it was, *of course* it was, how could I possibly have missed it before, it was so obvious but for the sheer impossibility of it, that made my head spin. I knew where I was. And I knew who I was looking for. I had to sit down. Robot Lego Truck looked up at me. Can you take me home? he asked, unaware of my internal processing. I swallowed. Um, sure. I tried to gather the oars, but they were slippery in my hands. I swallowed again, trying to make my mouth work. Where do you live? I tried. He pointed back in the direction we'd come. There. With your parents? Yeah. But. Um. Love. He looked around, trying to find his words. Um, Love helps me when the zombies come. So we'll go back there, I said, managing to grab the oars. Robot Lego Truck nodded. Uh-huh. Okay. I turned us around and began the slow journey back there. My limbs were shaky, I realised, they felt about the same as my stomach did, which churned like I was on a roller coaster. I spent most of the journey back staring blankly into the distance, occasionally turning around to check my path. Charlie watched me intently. I think he'd seen my reaction. It took a few minutes to get back. Hardly anything, but it felt like ages. Robot Lego Truck played contentedly with Charlie and the elephant, the frightened tears dried on his cheeks. He sang at one point, a happy nursery rhyme, his voice filled with the childish confidence of victory. *Row, row, row your boat* *Gently down the stream* *Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily* *Life is but a dream.* Normally I quite liked nursery rhymes. Today it creeped me out. I didn't want to make him stop, though, not when he was so relieved. Instead I tried not to think about it, and looked at Charlie, hoping we could work this out with my opposable thumbs and his strange feline wisdom. We pulled up to the bank with a *bump,* got out, and Robot Lego Truck and I walking hand-in-hand to the shop. When we got in he let go and ran to Love, who picked him up and hugged him tightly. Oh, Robot! Did you get chased by zombies again? He nodded. They wanted to eat my brains! Oh, darling. She rocked him back and forth, in big swinging movements. It's all right. You're safe now. Did Frisbee help you? Mmm-hmm. What did he do? He had monster spray in his boat! He told them to go away! Oh, good job Frisbee! She smiled at me over his shoulder. Did you say thank you? He twisted round to look at me, waving the elephant in my direction. Thank you. You're welcome, I said, looking around. Um. Love. Do you have a pen and paper? Of course. In the drawer. Thanks. I found some. Racking my brains, I drew, trying to put down as much as I could, anything that could help. Robot Lego Truck watched me with interest. I held up the piece of paper. Do you know any place that looks like this? Love took the paper off me. I saw her gaze run down the page, take in the images. I hoped they were enough. Hmm, she said. Yeah. This place. I couldn't believe it. It was that simple. Which one? I asked, hardly daring to look. She touched it with her thumb. This one, she said. That's only a few days downriver. It's got plants outside like this one, she pointed to another drawing, But the rest is the same. You could get there in three if you go straight. I actually felt like crying. This was it. This was it! *Thank* you, I said, folding the piece of paper and stuffing it in my pocket. Thank you so much. Oh, that's all right! she said. Robot Lego Truck lay against her chest, half-asleep, the elephant cradled in his arm. A proper sleep, not a sleeping spell. Charlie watched him. I think the nameless one might pass by here, I said. You might want to use that powder. Thank *you,* Love said. She put Robot Lego Truck down on the chair behind the counter. Charlie rubbed his face against him before coming back. Bye, Robot Lego Truck, I called, waving. He waved sleepily. Bye-bye, he said, before leaning his face on the elephant. Love led me to the door, telling Robot Lego Truck she'd be right back. I'll put him to bed, she told me. Let him sleep it off. It happens sometimes. Thank you for helping him. I nodded. Sure. I looked around, but could see no-one. I had the powder anyway, I thought, I could feel the bottle against my back. I'd applied it earlier that morning. That was recent enough that even if he was still following us down the river he shouldn't be able to see us. Are you sure this is the right way? Absolutely, she said. I nodded. Thank you. She gave me a big hug, pulled me right in. It felt good. I closed my eyes for a few seconds, let the calm settle me  she had a very calm feel, Love, very relaxed  then stepped back, allowing Charlie time to say his goodbyes. Love picked him up and kissed him on the head. You take care, Charlie, she said, rubbing his back. Both of you. We will, I said. Thank you again. Come back if you need anything. Always welcome. We said our goodbyes and went to the boat. Love moved back toward the doorway to keep an eye on the sleepy boy, and waved as we drew away. Charlie sat on the opposite seat again, keeping an eye out as we rounded the bend and slipped out of sight. Charlie, I said, not really sure what else to say, I must be mad. He looked like he was about to meow in agreement, but then another sound reached us, stopping him in place, sending a violent shiver down my back. It was far away, but still it reached us, a thin mocking noise in a familiar tune. Creaking, corrupted, a cold warning, sending all the fur on Charlie's back straight up; tripping light and sharp over the water, it laughed at us, latent, it wrapped its fog-tipped fingers around my very heart and made my blood run cold; a sound from a face too normal to focus on, a sneer, a scrawl. Slow as molasses, wheedling, threatening, in a cracked hollow voice that wavered, dripped, trickled unbearably to a chilling end. *Row. Row. Row, your boat* *Gently down the stream.* *Merrily, merrily* *Merrily, merrily* *Life* *Is* *But* *A* *Dream.*"
62,vulnerability,nosleep,The Horns from Hell (Part 2),24,dpm6v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpm6v1/the_horns_from_hell_part_2/,2019-10-31 22:31:05,"[Part 1](URL I yelled in fright and leapt back, banging my foot on the corner of the sink cabinet. The sharp edge sliced through my bare skin, and now I was hopping on one leg, blood pouring from the cut on my foot, my thoughts spinning faster than I could handle. *What the hell was going on??* Acting on autopilot, I pulled open the top drawer and fished around for a band aid. Finding one, I ripped it open and went to apply it to my foot. Only thing was, there was now no cut there to cover. I wrenched my foot as close to my face as I could without toppling over. There was absolutely no sign of any wound. Blood was still trickling onto the floor, but the cut had completely disappeared. It had somehowhealed? In just a few seconds? I didnt know what on Earth to do or how to handle anything anymore, and when my legs began to buckle, I let myself sit down hard on the bathroom tiles. This had to be a dream. No way could any of this be real. I slapped myself in the face. Wake up! I snarled, and that only succeeded in giving me a sore face. Okay, I needed to calm down. *Deep breaths.* Slowly, I began to stand up. I closed my eyes, turned to the mirror, and braced myself. When I opened my eyes, everything would be normal again. This was not real. *This was not real.* I opened my eyes and saw the horn sticking out from my head and the broken glasses in the sink, and I wanted to cry. Why was this happening to me? What had I done to deserve this? Gingerly, I reached up, and slid my fingers across the surface of the horn. It was black, and about ten centimeters in length. It tapered up into a curved point at the top, and the base was rounded. The tip felt sharp, and I pressed the pad of my finger against it. A bead of blood welled up, and even as I watched, the skin closed over, the little mark gone in a few seconds. I stared at my finger for a long time, then sighed. So this was actually happening. Fantastic. Googling horns grown overnight probably wouldnt get me far. I was on my own with this. I turned my attention to the glasses, having dreaded this moment. I picked them up, and the glass in the sink shifted as I moved it. I studied the glasses, a deep pit opening up in my stomach. I could have put it down to a coincidence, that everyone wears sunglasses like this, that just because I met some guy with ones like them yesterday didnt mean these were his. But if that was true, how did they get here then? I really didnt want to think about the next question, but it was unavoidable. *If, for some unexplainable, awful reason, they were hiswhere was* ***he****?* I turned, looked out into my bedroom, at my shoes lying dirty and haphazard on the carpet. *And what did I have to do with this?* Still holding the glasses, I made my way into the living room. The tv remote was on the coffee table, and I picked it up. I paused before clicking the on button, not sure if I wanted to see whatever might be on the news. But I had to, or Id never gain the courage again. And there it was. It wasnt breaking news; people died all the time. But it was important to me. A reporter stood in the middle of a park I walked in occasionally. Police and forensic examiners moved behind her, inside yellow tape marking out a square no civilian was allowed to cross. A square in which a mound that looked suspiciously like a body lay. It was covered by a black sheet, but the shape was clear. My worst fears were confirmed as I heard the reporter speak. In the early hours of this morning, 24 year old Dash Carters body was found. It appears he was strangled by an unknown assailant. Police are investigating further. A photo of Dash popped up next to the reporter. I felt my mouth go dry, my stomach heave. It was him. The owner of the car with red rims and tinted windows. The jerk whod almost cost me my life. And now hed lost his. The more I stared at his picture, the more I hated the feeling that I had something to do with his death. The horn, the glasses, the shoes. Everything was connected. I flicked the channel abruptly, not wanting to see anything anymore. It landed on some other news channel, where a 90 year old lady was talking to the camera about some miracle or something. I only caught the last of her sentence. -But Im telling you, its true. I really did die, and now Im alive again. I switched the tv off. Delirious old grandma. I had bigger things to worry about. The major thing being the fact that I was 97 percent sure Id killed Dash Carter in my sleep and stolen his sunglasses. I sank down on the couch, suddenly feeling so tired and sad. Was this karma for something bad I had done when I was younger? Yeah, I hadnt been the greatest kid growing up, but honestly, who was at 8 or 9? Yes, Id accidently thrown a baseball through my neighbors window and blamed it on my brother when I was 13. Yes, Id overfed my sisters goldfish on purpose when she pissed me off about something, and when they died, refused to come to the ridiculous funeral she made for them. Yes, Id talked back to my mum, argued with my dad. Had fights with my siblings, all of that. But that was all part of growing up. Id never done anything to ask for this type of retribution. Id broken up with my girlfriend a while back, true, but shed been cheating on me! Not the other way around. I rubbed my hands across my face. This wasnt fair. None of this was fair. I ran my hands through my hair, taking care not to poke myself on the tip of the horn, and thats when I felt it. On the right side of my forehead. A pimple. No, no, no. I muttered frantically, leaping up and running to the bathroom. Just like the first one, it was coin sized. A nasty red colour. A definite pimple. Except it wasnt, was it? I rubbed the spot in despair, but knowing, that like always, I couldnt do anything. In a fit of sudden anger, I grabbed the left horn and pulled. Hot pain seared through the side of my head, and I gasped, staggering backwards. It wasnt coming out anytime soon, thats for sure. So was this it? Was I stuck being thiscreature? A real life version of Hell Boy. Just not red, tall and badass. I wanted to scream, honestly. But even that wouldnt do anything. \*\*\* I stayed inside all day. I couldnt go out, obviously. Both the horn and the knowledge that the police were looking for Dashs killer made me stay. I sat on the couch and stared numbly into space for hours. It was weird. My mind felt so crowded with thoughts, but when I tried to focus on one, I just gotnothing. I felt nothing. I had gotten to the point where I honestly just didnt care anymore. I was a monster, a murderer. A guy who was in way too deep and had no way out. Fun times. The pimple on my right side had grown, I could feel it. I knew when I looked into the mirror, it would seem to be no different, of course. It was itchy as well, and that just made me feel worse. It was about 7:30 pm when a loud knock came at the door. I sighed. The police had found me. I knew I could do nothing but face up to what Id done. No idea how Id explain the horn, or how Id actually killed Dash, but whatever. At least in jail I wouldnt be able to kill anyone else. I went to the door and pulled it open. Officers, I- I stopped in surprise. It wasnt the police. It was my ex-girlfriend. Alia stood on my doorstep, head down. I crossed my arms. What do you want? She lifted her head, and despite my anger at her suddenly turning up, I felt cold when I saw the ugly bruise across her cheek. She locked eyes with me, and I expected her to say something about my horn, but it never came. I left a jacket here, I just came to get it, she said quietly, and her voice was nothing like the loud, boisterous tones Id known. The sight of her made me momentarily forget about my problems. Are you sure? I thought you did a pretty thorough search of the house when you moved out. She hugged her arms, looking smaller than ever. I must have left here. I cant find it anywhere. Look, can I just check your bedroom quickly? I promise Ill be gone in a second. This wasnt the Alia Id known. She used to be outgoing, mischievous, fun loving. Yeah, she cheated and yeah, I didnt think much of her anymore, but seeing her like this didnt give me any pleasure. I had an inkling as to why shed changed so much though, and it was soon proven true. A car honked behind Alia, and when I looked at the driver, I felt my jaw clench. Alias new boyfriend, the one she decided she preferred kissing over me, sat in the drivers seat. He flipped me the bird and took a long drag on the cigarette between his fingers. Hurry up, he yelled to Alia, then honked again. I didnt think it was possible for Rion to be any more charming, but apparently Im wrong. I said, waiting for the dickhead to point at my horn and laugh, and feeling confused when he didnt. Alia shot me a look. Stop it. She pushed past me into the house and went straight down the hall. I closed the door and waited for her to return. When she did, empty handed, I raised an eyebrow. Told you it wasnt here. Shut up, she replied, but a small smile touched her lips. Guess I was wrong. And am I wrong in thinking you got that shiner by walking into a door? Her smile fell, and she went to the door. Its nothing. Forget about it. She had hurt me badly, and I would never truly forgive her for what she did, but some miniscule part of me still cared for her. I know, it was stupid, but I couldnt help it. Alia, you need to leave him. Hes dangerous. Hes fine. Im fine. Mind your own business. She went to open the door, and I put my hand on it, keeping it shut. She turned to glare at me and I reluctantly dropped my hand. Alia, please. Dont be stupid. That was the wrong thing to say. She stared at me for a long moment, then yanked the door open and left. I watched her walk away, back to Rion, who snapped at her for taking too long as she got in the car. I felt a muscle in my jaw clench as I watched the way Alia cowered back into her seat, her hair falling back into her face, hiding her from his view. From my position on the doorstep, I saw her glance out the window, back towards me. And I saw, just for a second, the raw desperation and vulnerability in her eyes, the pleading expression she hid from Rion and only showed me. Im sorry, she mouthed. I wasnt sure what she was sorry for, exactly. Cheating on me. Getting with Rion. Staying with him despite what he did to her. As Rion put the car in reverse and revved the engine, as Alia sunk down lower past the window, dropping her gaze from mine, I felt the right pimple on my forehead begin to pulse with a dull ache. It was the same feeling Id got yesterday, in the car pack with Dash. I looked at Rion pulling out of my drive, backing over my lawn in the process, calling me a wanker as he sped off, and the ache increased. As the car turned the corner, Alia disappearing from my sight, I felt something like a weird tingle at the base of my left horn. And it was then, as I touched my horn gently, I realised neither Alia nor Rion had said anything about it. Anything at all. It was like they hadnt noticed. I turned to go inside, and a little thought stopped me in my tracks. *Maybe they just couldnt see it? Maybe I was the only one who could?* I hesitated. It made sense, didnt it? I healed injuries in a few seconds, I disappeared across town during my sleep, and now no one but myself could see the horn growing from my head. If we were following the pattern of weirdness, then it really wasnt that unbelievable. Right? Only one way to properly find out. I quickly stepped outside, closed my front door and bounded down the path. Crossing the road, I went straight to the house opposite mine and knocked on the door. A middle aged woman answered, looking frazzled. I could smell something burning from behind her and gave a pleasant smile. Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you knew where Airedale Court was? She sighed and pointed to her left. Down there, turn right at the first intersection. I thanked her and she was already closing the door before I got all the words out. Her rudeness didnt bother me though; I was focused on more important things. My experiment had given me interesting results. No one could see my horn but me. I dont know what I felt at that moment. Not really. It wasnt happiness, but it also wasnt despair anymore. I could still go out in public, still function as a normal person. There *was* just that small problem of me killing Dash Carter, but maybe nothing would come of that? If my horn wasnt visible, what else could be hidden from the world? I walked back to my house, lost in thought, and only came back to reality when I stepped on something on my lawn. Looking down, I saw numerous cigarette butts strewn across the grass. One was still smoldering gently. The tire marks of Rions car, scarred into my lawns surface, sat next to them. I stared down at the mess for a few seconds, and unbidden, the memory of Alias nasty bruise floated into my mind. The way she had looked so scared next to Rion, the way he had snarled at her, the way he had laughed as he ripped up my lawn when leaving. The way people like him, like Dash, existed and ruled over everyone else with fear and force. I felt the dull ache return to my pimple, felt like my heartbeat was thudding loudly through my ears, felt my left horn give another small tingle. And I decided to try another experiment. \*\*\* When I woke the following morning, I had an idea as to what I might see in the mirror. When I got up to look, instead of feeling anguish or frustration, I felt something not unlike triumph. My left horn now had a partner. Overnight, the right pimple had grown into the second glossy horn, and now, looking in the mirror, I had to admit it. Once you saw past the minotaur/Hell Boy look, I looked pretty cool. Pretty badass, to be honest. Then I glanced into the sink, already guessing as to what Id see. A single, unlit cigarette lay in the bottom of the sink. I picked it up, and turned to look into my bedroom, just like I had done with the glasses yesterday morning. I distinctly remembered putting my shoes in my wardrobe last night. Id even taken a photo of them in there, for evidence. They were tossed back under my bed, the laces trailing once more. When I turned on the tv in the living room, I knew what would be playing. Sure enough, there she was. The reporter from yesterday, looking too gleeful for someone who was reporting another murder. Probably the biggest stories shed got all year, in her defense. Nothing ever happened in my town. Not until now. 21 year old Rion Harvall, who was last seen late last night, was found dead in his garage by his father, at about 5:30 this morning. Like Dash Carter, he appears to have been strangled. Police say this is the work of the same killer, and a growing investigation is underway. Rion will be dearly missed by his parents, girlfriend and friends. Not by Alia. Not by me. I felt a tingle of guilt towards his parents but shook it off. I couldnt take back what Id done. And if I was being perfectly honestI didnt want to. I didnt regret what had happened. If you were in my position, had my abilities, what would you have done? My phone buzzed on the kitchen table, drawing me from my cloudy thoughts. It was the supermarket Id had the interview with two days ago. Id got the job, could I start on Monday? I could hardly believe it. Things were, incredibly, looking up. The supermarket asked me to come in today to fill out some paperwork, and I did want a walk, so I agreed, told them Id be there in 20. It was sunny outside again. The warm rays shone down on my face; the gentle breeze tossed my hair back. My horns stood up proudly, exposed for everyone to see, but no one did. I passed many people on my way to the store, and each time marveled at their oblivious nature. It was quite amusing, to be honest. It was funny to think that Id gone from hating these horns to accepting and showing them off. I still wasnt totally at ease with the whole murder side effect, dont get me wrong, but it helped my conscience to know only those who deserved it suffered. I reached the crossing where everything had started, and this time walked by without any trouble. I got to the supermarket with plenty of time to spare, and the manager took me through all the papers I had to sign. One of them was to prevent me from suing them if I was injured in their store, or under their management, and I tried not to laugh at it. If I was injured, I wouldnt sue them to get my revenge. Not if I could go one better (That was a joke, by the way. I wouldnt kill any of my colleagues. Not unless they were *really* asking for it.) Leaving the store, I felt better than I had for days. I had a job. Alia was free from her abusive partner. And my hornsthose random, weird, slowly-growing-on-me hornsI barely even noticed they were there anymore. I turned a corner, and in my happy little bubble, didnt notice the woman coming towards me. I knocked my hip into something hard, and realised she was pushing a pram and Id bumped it. Oh, shit, Im so sorry! I said, then my eyes caught up with my brain and I realised I knew her. Oh, hi! It was the mother from yesterday, the one Id helped across the road. She began to look up at me, laughing easily. Whoops, sorry about that. Hope I didnt hit you to- She broke off abruptly, stepping back with a gasp. Her eyes were fixed on mine, and shed gone completely still. With a sudden cold chill running up my spine, I realised there was only one reason as to why she was staring at me with such shock. She wasnt looking at my eyes, she was looking above them. ***She could see my horns.*** ***The ones Id thought no one else in the world could see.***"
63,vulnerability,nosleep,Step on a Crack,53,dpybxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpybxg/step_on_a_crack/,2019-11-01 13:39:44,"*Step on a crack, break your mamas back.* That saying invaded my head as we walked through town. I spent nearly the whole time staring at my own feet, skipping and sidestepping to avoid any cracks in the sidewalk. Stop that, Ivy, Mom hissed. Youre a young woman for goodness sake, act like one. It took quite an effort to keep myself looking ahead as we continued down the street. Its not that I was afraid that Id cause irreparable bodily harm to my own mother; I hadnt really thought that since I was a kid. But when I was small I truly had believed that I might accidentally kill her, which would have left me completely and utterly alone - and back then, that terrified me more than anything. At this point, avoiding the cracks was just an ingrained habit. As soon as I lifted my chin, I remembered the other reason why I typically kept my eyes on the ground. The whole of Candors main street was washed with a sepia-toned depression, people included. We passed many storefronts with vacancy signs, and most pedestrians who noticed us hastened in the opposite direction. I went back to avoiding cracks. For all my eighteen years, I'd been mostly sequestered away. I was home-schooled and allowed minimal contact with the wider world. The once a month trips into town were my only reprieve from domestic captivity, and Mom didnt allow technology in our mansion, despite being able to afford the most advanced of devices. We had a land-line phone for deliveries and such, and that was about it. The only things Mom spent real money on were clothes, decor for the mansion, the occasional new model of luxury vehicle, and in-home beauty services. I suppose it wouldn't do to not look the part, even if it was mostly for ourselves. When I was younger, our monthly trips were much nicer. The paint on the buildings wasnt so faded, and people would even greet Mom back then. They called her Miss Ariel. Sometimes I would even receive gifts or treats from virtual strangers. But now, everyone just avoided us. The only person who spoke more than five words at a time to us was the widowed Mrs. Miller, who ran Moms favorite tearoom. With the days shopping done, we entered *Le Petit Four,* ringing the little bell above the front door. Mrs. Millers head popped up immediately from the bakery case and she hastened over, completely disregarding the patron she had been serving. My dears! she cried, leading us to our usual table. Id almost thought you wouldnt come! I couldnt help but wonder if that had been a secret hope of hers, but she patted my arm and gave us a radiant smile regardless. Miss Ariel, its a pleasure to see you as always. Ivy, could it be possible youre more beautiful than last month? And that dress, its to die for! I mumbled my appreciation with burning cheeks, and Mom ordered tea and a sandwich tray which was served almost immediately. Now, Ivy, Mom began after a long sip of her tea. I know youve learned the incantation, and Ive prepared you for this day for the past several weeks, but I do want to make sure you understand how important this is. I want you to take it seriously. Mom, do I have to? Im not really interested Mom silenced me with a raised eyebrow, drumming her flawless French manicured nails on the tablecloth. Then she clasped her hands together and leaned in. There is something I havent told you yet, Ivy. The reason Im teaching you my monthly ritual is because I am expecting you to take up the responsibility yourself, starting next lunar cycle. I lowered the small cucumber sandwich triangle Id just been about to bite into. Mom, what? I cant, I mean, I dont even know what happens! I dont *want* to know. Why? Why cant you just keep doing it? Lower your voice, she snapped, her eyes glittering dangerously. This is not a request or a favor. This is your duty, and you will take it on with poise and dignity. You will never have to work. You will never have to dirty your fingers with grease, or paint, or, she glanced up at Mrs. Miller, sweeping several tables over, flour. All you must do is complete the ritual once a month, and enjoy the luxury youve already come to know. But I dont enjoy it, Mom, I replied, trying to stay quiet. I hate the mansion, I hate learning the craft, I hate being isolated from everything. I want to live in town and make friends. I want to go to school. Really, Ivy, look at this place. Candor is a dying town, theres nothing worthwhile here. Yeah, I replied, taking a bite of my sandwich without any pleasure, because of you. I expected backlash, but Mom let it go with a sardonic smile. Ive kept this town alive rather than let it burn itself to the ground. The people here are thankful for me. Just look at Mrs. Miller. She wouldnt have any business if I didnt keep this place above water. Mom sipped her tea with a self-satisfied smile, and I said nothing. She was delusional, that was clear, and no words from me or anyone else would ever cure that. I pushed my plate away and sat staring out the storefront into the gray street, wanting only to leave. At last, Mom paid the bill, leaving an extravagant tip, and we headed to the Hotel Burgess a few blocks down the street. The hotel was old and famous, and despite the decaying town, the hotel boarded a healthy number of tourists and business people each year. The doorman held open the tall glass door, and Mom led us into the grandiose lobby. It didnt take her long to spot her prey. I watched her eyes lock onto a man sitting at the lobby bar. I followed her as she sidled up next to the man, who sat drinking dark liquid from a rocks glass. He was younger, maybe in his twenties, with a well-groomed beard, thick black plastic-rimmed glasses, and arms covered in tattoos. Most likely a tourist, from his casual attire. The man did a subtle double-take towards my mom. After a couple flirtatious exchanges, he turned his attention fully to her. She laid on the charms thick and fast, trailing a finger down his arm and stealing his drink for a sip. Then she spoke the words shed taught me. Words of great power and nuance; words that set a deadly trap. I was a ghost in the background, watching unhappily as she bent the poor man to her will. Of course, Id seen her work before, but this time I was to be taking notes and learning the subtle art of seduction in tandem with the spell. It made my stomach lurch uncomfortably. Everything was over for the man as soon as the last word was spoken. His eyes went glassy, and he followed us out of the hotel without any protestation. I kept my head down, feeling the eyes of the hotel clerks watching us. They wouldnt say anything, but that didnt make me feel any better. When we got to the car, I took the drivers seat while Mom and the man got in the back. Shed taught me to drive at the age of fourteen, so this was the usual routine for us. Avoiding looking in the rear-view mirror, I drove us out of town and along the mile or so of country road to our mansion, all while trying to block out the disturbing noises coming from behind me. Mom didnt have to keep up with the physical part of it - the words were enough - but she obviously enjoyed it. I entered the key code for the gate to our driveway when we arrived, and parked in front of the house. Mom took the mans hand and ran inside with him, giggling like a schoolgirl. I followed reluctantly. This place is amazing, the mans voice echoed in the foyer. Darling, this place is a humble shack. We have virtually nothing. Mom slipped her arms around the mans waist. Dont you feel sorry for me? Youre right, he responded in a flat tone, staring deeply into her eyes. How could such a beautiful woman live in such a squalid place? I would do anything to help you. Would you? Come to my room then, Ill show you how you can help. She took his hand and began to lead him upstairs. As she stepped onto the third-floor landing, she glanced back down at me. I cringed. Come on then, Ivy. The lesson is nearly over. My feet were leaden as I trudged up the stairs after them. Down the long hall, past room after unnecessary room, we finally arrived at Moms master suite. She sat the man down on her four-poster bed, then opened her roll-top desk to retrieve an old, thick book, a pen, and something else which she stuck between her lips: a needle. Whats your name? she asked the man through one side of her mouth, sitting next to him. Bruce. Bruce Baker. Bruce, Mom purred, running the back of her hand down his cheek. And how much money do you have, Bruce? Do you have life insurance? Retirement? Yeah, Bruce said breathlessly. Its not a lot, but I started saving last year. I have life insurance through work too. Will you promise it to me, Bruce? We have so little Of course! You can have it all! Thank you, love. Theres just one thing I need you to do. Anything, Ariel. Anything for you. She cracked open the book and handed him the pen. Sign here. Bruce did as she asked. Let me see your thumb. Bruce held out his thumb. Mom took the needle from her lips and stuck it into his flesh. Bruce didnt react. She smeared the little bubble of blood pooling where shed stuck him, covering the skin. Then she pressed his thumb to the page next to his name, leaving a thumbprint as neat as fresh ink. Bruce looked at my mom. Can I kiss you now? he asked. She ignored him and turned her attention to me. Do you see, Ivy? How simple it is? Of course, enchanting the book was not an easy process, but it will last us many years to come. One day Ill teach you how the magic works, but for now, all you need is a name and blood to seal it. What happens to him? Hell go back home and make all the arrangements to have his wealth transferred to us, and then hell begin to fade away. By the next full moon, he will be gone. Its disgusting, I said, eying the book. There were ten names on the page Bruce had signed, and that was many pages in. Why cant they just be bewitched into giving us money? Why do they have to die? Mom laughed and stroked Bruces leg. Hed begun to paw at her. The seduction spell only lasts a month, Ivy. Thats why the book is cursed to drain them of life in the same span of time. It wouldnt do to have them change their mind or spill our secrets, would it? Now, the next part isnt really part of the lesson, so you may be excused, Ivy. Why dont you go practice the words while I finish up with Bruce. She turned back to him and accepted his eager lips. I didnt linger, slamming the door behind me and making my way to the farthest possible end of the house. &amp;#x200B; As with all the others, Bruce had already gone by the time I woke up. I guess in my heart I always knew that the men my Mom ensnared didnt go on to lead long, fulfilling lives, but knowing it for sure now put me into a state of deep depression. Everything we had, all these empty rooms to ourselves, all the expensive clothes and vases and bullshit - it was all acquired through the gradual deaths of innocent men. Mom wasnt even picky; she didnt go out of her way to find exclusively rich men. Anyone was fair game to bleed dry, figuratively and literally. That morning I made a couple of slices of toast and brought them to my room so that I could be alone. I sat on my bed and read *One Thousand and One Nights*, trying desperately to clear my head. It wasnt long before Mom knocked lightly at my door, opening it without waiting for my reply. She leaned on the doorframe, wearing a silk robe. Ivy, youre not studying? I thought maybe youd want to practice the spell. I do expect you to handle your first mark next month. Im not doing it, I said, keeping my eyes on the page I was reading. We have enough money, and we have enough stuff. Im not going to do it. I sensed the icy anger radiating from her, but I didnt look up. You will, Ivy. Ive already told you, this is not a request. You *will* do what I say. No, I *wont*. Mom rushed to my bed and grabbed the book from my hands. Her nostrils flared, her dark eyes intense. This is not up for discussion. You will practice the words for two hours today, and thats final. After that, you may have your book back. I looked at the book in her hands and focused on it. I knew it wouldnt help matters, but I was just so angry and so tired of being told what to do. I bound it to my mind and willed it to escape her hands. Suddenly, the book had torn itself from her grip, flying over her head. She looked up with annoyance and tried to reach for the book - but I moved it out of the way just in time. Mom made a strangled cry of frustration, glared at me, then stomped out of the room, ranting about how ungrateful of a daughter she had. I couldnt help but smile. Mom was a skilled practitioner of seductive and dark magics, but telekinesis was a natural talent all my own. &amp;#x200B; Over the next few weeks, our home was the site of a minor warzone. I occasionally studied to cool Moms temper, but I told her again and again that I wouldnt lure a man to our home to sign the book. She tried all manner of tactics to talk me into it, even going so far as to say we could find someone close to my age - they wouldnt have any real money of course, but it would be good practice. That didnt exactly sit well with me, and I locked myself in my room for most of a day. Mom used an unlocking spell to break in that evening and called a truce. Ill tell you what, Ivy. I wont expect you to have someone seal their signature. Just get as far as bringing them home to sign the book. If all we have is their name, they arent in real danger. What do you say? Come have some tea and a cookie, and well talk about it. I was starving, to be honest, and relented. Finally, mom convinced me to at least go that far. I wasnt happy about it, but I felt that there would be little point in denying her any longer. She was stronger than I was, and I had nowhere else to go. On the day of the next full moon, we went into town. I wore a pretty burgundy dress, and Mom had pinned a sunflower in my curled hair. For once she dressed more plainly than me, wearing jeans and a black blouse. As usual, we shopped and had tea, and finally we walked down the street to the hotel. I was beginning to get nervous, and found myself sweating despite the mild autumn day. Once inside, my heart began to beat very fast. Over there, checking in, Mom pointed at the front desk. What do you think? Too old? Mom Ivy, youre not going to back out of our deal, are you? No, its just maybe if you would back off I wouldnt be so nervous. Mom pursed her lips, then shrugged. Fine. Ill go back to *Le Petit* for another cup of tea. Meet me there in an hour, and make sure you dont come alone. She turned on her heel and left. I sighed, feeling lost. Hey, do you need help? A boy my age had approached me. He was a bellboy, dressed in one of those old fashioned uniforms. The hotel tried to keep up that vintage feel by having all the staff dress the way they had when the hotel had opened a hundred years ago. Im fine, thanks, I said, trying not to let my lips tremble as I smiled. Im just going to have a soda from the bar. I began walking, and the boy followed. Oh, okay. Hey, do you go to Candor High? I just started there as a senior, I dont think Ive seen you there. No, I responded. My mom teaches me at home. Oh, gotcha. Im Colby by the way. We moved here in the summer. I sat at the bar, and was surprised when Colby sat next to me. Im Ivy. Shouldnt you be I gestured at the lobby. We havent had many guests today. People dont even usually want help with their luggage, to be honest. Even if they do, they hardly ever tip. He grinned at me, then looked up at the bartender. Hey Alex, can we have a couple Cokes? Diet for me, please, I said, feeling my cheeks warm. Thank you, Colby. Yeah. So what do your parents do? I was caught off guard by the question. Oh, well, my mom is an heiress. I never knew my dad. Im sorry, Colby said, clearly taken aback. He took a thoughtful sip of his soda. I hope this isnt too insensitive, but Ive noticed there seems to be a lot of kids in my school without dads around. Its kind of spooky. Yeah, I replied. It sure is. I knew I should start saying the words soon. I hadnt even had to do anything to get Colbys attention - it would be so easy but all I wanted to do was keep talking to him. It had been so long since Id talked to someone other than Mom. So why did you move to Candor? Well, my parents are both teachers, and they transferred to the high school. Trust me, Id rather be back in Portsmouth. Uh no offense. None taken. Candor isnt very nice anymore. It used to be, once. So what do you do for fun around here, Ivy? Fun? I asked, tilting my head and squinting at the boy. What is this fun you speak of? Colby laughed. Point taken. Well maybe we could hang out sometime? You seem pretty cool. My heart fluttered in my chest, and my mouth went dry. I took a sip of soda, trying to think of something to say in response. Would you like to see my mansion? Colby blinked. Mansion? Yeah. We have the biggest house in town. Well, just outside of town. You can come see it. Really? Sounds kind of cool. Maybe I could come by after work? Why not now, I whispered, trying to give him a coy look. Would they really miss you? Colby glanced around, a mischievous glint appearing in his blue eyes. Yeah, why the hell not? Ill tell em I got sick, it wont be a big deal. With knowing looks and laughter, we made our escape out of the hotel and down the street. Once wed caught our breath, I nodded my head at the tearoom. I have to tell my mom its time for us to go. She wont bother us at the mansion though, I promise. Uh, yeah. Sure, thats fine. We stepped in, and Mom beamed at me when she saw us. Oh Ivy, good. I was just about to hunt you down myself. Mom, this is Colby. Hes going to stop by and see our house. Colby waved awkwardly. Hi, Mrs Call me Ariel, Mom said, giving me a sideways glance. Its a pleasure to meet you, young man. &amp;#x200B; Mom drove us back, while Colby and I made quiet, awkward conversation. I caught her looks in the rear-view mirror occasionally. She could tell I hadnt used the spell, of course. Colby gasped when he saw the mansion appear over the next hill, and I couldnt help but feel a little proud. Id never brought anyone over before, so Id never had anyone to show off to. It was kind of exhilarating. Do you like to read, Colby? We have an amazing library. And wait until you see the greenhouse. Inside, Colbys jaw dropped as he looked all around. This place is incredible! That staircase... wow. How many rooms are there? Fifteen, Mom butted in, not including the garage of course. Or the indoor pool. Colbys eyes lit up. You have a pool? Im surprised you dont have a bunch of kids from town over, like, every weekend. We never have people over, I mumbled, giving Mom a half-apologetic, half-scornful look. Come on Colby, let's check out some of the rooms. Lets start with the master suite, Mom said tersely. I think your little friend would find it quite impressive. Mom, cant we just hang out for a little while first? The look on her face answered my question. I swallowed, and felt a cold chill in my bones. With a nod to Colby, we all went to Moms room. Colby was suitably impressed. Thats the biggest bed Ive ever seen, he said in awe. And Ive never seen a fireplace in a bedroom before. He looked around while Mom took me by the arm and dragged me to the desk. Why havent you cast the spell? she hissed under her breath. I havent exactly needed to, I replied with a hint of pride. Lets just call it good, Mom. We can let him go, and next time Ill do it for real. This isnt catch and release, Ivy. Were not playing a game. You said he wouldnt have to sign in blood anyway, I argued, folding my arms. What is the point of making him sign the book? You have to practice. Cast the spell, make him sign, and well let him go. I wont. Colby approached us, looking doubtful. Uh, sorry to interrupt is everything okay? Moms whole demeanor changed on a dime. Her posture relaxed, and her face lit up with a sultry smile. Colby, come sit on the bed. Ivy has something for you, wait just one second if you dont mind. You know, I might just call my parents, have them pick me up. Nonsense, Mom said, reaching out to take hold of Colbys arm. Go on Ivy, get the book. And why dont you practice that poem youve been working on. *Now*. Her shift in tone clearly made Colby uncomfortable, but Mom wasnt letting go. As I watched him begin to struggle, his protestations growing louder, I panicked. Closing my eyes on the tears that welled in them, I began the incantation, immediately feeling the thread of bond from Colby weave its way to my hands. It snaked securely around my fingers, like a cats cradle made from twine. I opened my eyes and found Colby looking at me in a way that made me deeply ashamed. Mom released her grip. Colby lunged to me and fell on his knees. His hands rose to the hem of my dress, clutching at it like a drowning man. I need you, Ivy. Let me be with you, Ill do anything. What do you want? Ill steal if I have to, whatever you want, its yours. He moaned with miserable passion, and I stepped back in horror, leaving him bent prostrate on the floor. Mom stood over him, her lips split in a grotesque smile. How does it feel, Ivy? How does it feel to have him wrapped around your little finger? You could make him do anything you want. Colby started crawling towards me. I backed up until I was trapped against the desk. I cant do this! I gasped, shaking my head. You must, Ivy. If you dont, then I will. Mom was suddenly speaking the words of power, and I felt the threads of the bond unraveling in her direction. Stop! Okay Ill do it. Good girl, Mom said. She came to the desk and opened it to retrieve the book, which she shoved at me unceremoniously. And while were at it, why dont you go ahead and have him seal his name after all? No! You promised! I didnt promise anything, Mom snapped. And at this point, I dont think its wise to be gentle with you, Ivy, or youre never going to toughen up enough to do what has to be done. You will seal his name in the book, or Ill lock you in the basement for a week, do you understand? I wiped my running eyes and nose with the backs of my hands and glared at her. Leave us alone then. I dont want you here, just get out! Mom stood still for a moment, her eyes sweeping the room. Then she turned and walked out, closing the door behind her. I wasted no time, uttering the words that severed the bond. Colbys eyes regained their clarity, and he was suddenly scrambling back from me. Ivy? What the hell happened? Theres no time, I said. Im sorry I cant explain, but you have to leave out the window, *now*. Arent we on the third floor? Ill break my neck! No you wont, Ill help you. Youre crazy. Please, Colby, let me save you. A knock came at the door, followed my Moms muffled voice. Ivy, how is it going? Has he signed the book yet? Just a minute, I called, then shoved Colby to the window behind the desk. I pushed it open and climbed on top of the desk, beckoning Colby to do the same. Please, I begged, please trust me. Colby scrambled up and looked out the window to the ground below. Theres no way, he shook his head. You really are crazy, Ivy. Im just going to leave. Whatever youre afraid of cant be worse than that fall. I wish that were true, I sighed sadly. Im sorry, Colby. It was really nice to meet you. Before he could respond, I pushed him out of the window. As he fell, screaming, I pushed at him from below with my mind as hard as I possibly could, slowing his momentum to that of a feather floating down on a light wind. He tumbled gently to the ground several feet from the house, and I watched him get to his feet awkwardly. He turned his face up to the window once before he took off on foot, climbing the fence handily and disappearing down the road. I closed the window and ran to the bed to collapse in a mess of heaving shoulders and choked anguish. Mom rushed in and screamed. What have you done? She came to the bed and grabbed the hair at my scalp, forcing me to look at her. You let him *go*? What were you thinking? I liked him, Mom. I wasnt going to kill him! Youve disgraced me and your witch blood, she spat, releasing me with a shove. I should have known this would be the outcome. If I had had more foresight, I would never, never, have carried a child. What is that supposed to mean? Did you really think I was going to keep up the ritual every month until I died? No, Ivy. I had you so that one day I would be able to enjoy my spoils without having to dirty my hands any further. The blood of mortal men makes you stronger in many regards, but in other ways Mom turned her head in a rare display of vulnerability. She went to pick up the book and stowed it away within the desk. Youre fortunate that the town is already firmly in our grasp, Ivy. Your slip up would have led to us being burned alive in our own home in a healthier time. Ive worked hard to make Candor mine. Theyll know better than to let the boy talk. I watched as she closed the window. Id never seen her look so sad. Who was my father? I asked firmly. I want to know. Youve never once told me about him. Mom shrugged, tracing a finger absentmindedly atop the closed desk. He was nobody. A fisherman, back when the town was prosperous. He wasnt well to do, himself. Travis. A hint of a smile touched her lips. Travis Hesse. We had a natural chemistry. I didnt need to cast the spell until the last possible minute. That was after youd already been created. Did you love him? Mom rolled her eyes and came to sit on the bed by me. Love isnt like in your storybooks, Ivy. I knew him for a night, and that was all. He was kind and gentle, sure, but that meant nothing. All that mattered was that his name ended up in my book, and in that way, I provided for us. For you. She reached out as though to stroke my cheek, but I pulled away. Her hand stayed static for a moment, and I sensed the hurt for a second before she dropped it. Her eyes softened. Go to bed, Ivy. Well figure out how to remedy your failure tomorrow. &amp;#x200B; After the incident with Colby, Mom was insistent that the next full moon would see my first name bound with blood. So I put away my storybooks and began studying from the many spellbooks Mom had, playing the part of a dutiful daughter. She was pleased with my sudden interest in learning all things craft related, and encouraged me enthusiastically. She went on about how she regretted not learning more when she was my age. The night before the full moon, I went into Moms room. She was lying in bed and reading a paperback with a bare-chested man on the cover. Such a hypocrite to chide me for reading rich, meaningful stories when she herself indulged in harlequin romances. What is it, Ivy? She asked, putting the book aside face down to save her place. I need to talk to you. About what? I braced myself, wanting to look at the desk but not daring to give anything away. Im not going to town tomorrow. Ive decided Im not going to do the ritual. Ever. Mom huffed. Thats enough of your foolishness, Ivy. Go to bed and get some rest. You have a big day tomorrow. In fact, she smiled wickedly. I think it would be best if you try to find your little boyfriend and actually make him sign the book this time. I feel like that would make a very valuable lesson. I said I wont do it. I lifted my chin stubbornly. You will, Mom replied, climbing out of bed. You will obey your mother, and you will contribute to this household. You cant make me. Oh, Mom cackled, you think I cant, huh? Girl, I have powers you cant even imagine. Ive learned a trick or two myself, I said, trying not to let my voice crack. Ivy, I see your hands trembling. If youre so afraid, why do you defy me? Youre evil! I shouted. Youre an evil witch who kills people, and youve imprisoned me in this place for my whole life! I hate you! Moms eyes went deadly dark. Her feet lifted from the ground, and she hovered in the air. Her long chestnut hair floated around her head as though she were submerged in water. She lifted her hands, gesturing widely. Ive given you everything, she said, her voice distorted and strange. But I wont hesitate to take it all away, Ivy, if you really cant handle the simple task I require of you. Im not beyond watching my own flesh and blood die. Her words were daggers, but in my heart, I think Id already known she felt that way. Do whatever you want, I said. Just let me ask you one more question before you kill me. I turned my head to the desk and opened it with a flick of my mind. I drew to me two objects - one obvious, and one not. The book landed in my hands, the pages fluttering. I looked through the book, Mom. There is no Travis Hesse in here. My fathers name was not bound to the book. So what happened? What happened to my dad? How dare you? Mom screeched, and her hands turned black, shrouded by a dark flame. I stood my ground. You have no right to question me, to pry into my history. It doesnt matter, I said, and I levitated the other object to my eye level - the needle, from which the blood and life of untold men had been drawn. I have enough proof to know that youre just a twisted old bat with a broken heart. Im going to give you the body to match. With a yell, I sent the needle spiraling through the air, straight into my mothers chest. I sensed it lodge in her heart, where the shocked organ struggled around it. Mom clutched at her chest, and collapsed to the floor, gasping. When she looked up at me, she was smiling. A needle, Ivy? she wheezed. You think a needle would be enough to kill me? Have you really forgotten the lessons Ive taught you? Never, I said, edging my way to the fireplace. But Im not going to use the book to make myself strong or rich from the deaths of innocent men. I told you, I wont do it. I reached the stone hearth and lifted my toe over the large crack that ran the width of it. Mom was beyond words. From her crouched position she raised her hands again, and they became balls of black fire. I didnt hesitate a second more, slamming my toe onto the fissure. There was a sharp crack as Moms spine snapped the wrong way. She screeched and writhed hideously on the ground, her body twisted and grotesque. The sight made my head spin. What did you do, Ivy? Mom cried, her eyes spinning in her head. Why cant I move? Step on a crack, I said under my breath, and a bitter heaviness settled on my chest. Its going to be okay, Mom. Ill make you as comfortable as possible. Just try to relax. I used my telekinesis to raise her mangled body into the bed. It took all of my power, and I was left collapsed on the floor, nearly as vulnerable as she was. Im going to get out of this, Ivy, Mom snarled, and youll wish youd never betrayed me! The thing is, Mom, I said between gasping breaths, that needle has a permanent curse on it. Every time I step on a crack, your spine will break again. Besides, I know you never studied the white magics, so good luck curing yourself. My bravado was not entirely honest. I wasn't positive my plan would keep me or the people of Candor safe. In fact, I was terrified of the repercussions if Mom were to break free. Youre really going to break my back, *again*? Mom laughed. Ivy, you dont have it in you. Youre too *good*. With solemn deliberation, I stepped on the crack again. Mom screamed in agony, her body contorting violently once more. Then she went silent, and I crept to her side. Shed passed out in an ungainly heap of tangled body parts, but was still breathing. I let a teardrop from my face to her cheek as I kissed her forehead. Im sorry, I whispered, then left her there. I went to my own room and cried myself to sleep. &amp;#x200B; The next morning I woke in a panic, sure that Mom had somehow escaped the prison of her body. I ran to her room and found her still in bed, twisted and useless. She was softly weeping. Mom? I tried. Go away you wretch, or Ill cast a spell on you. I didnt flinch. If shed known a spell to use, shed already have done it. Im going to town today, Im going to do some shopping. And Im going to find someone who can care for you. You better promise to be nice to them. Mom didnt respond. Ill be back. And... I chewed my lower lip for a moment. Im sorry if cant avoid all the cracks on the sidewalk. It was a lot easier when I was little. Ill be back later. I left, closing the door on her furious howls. &amp;#x200B; I couldnt help but smile a little on the drive into town. I was finally going to have a normal life, with access to technology, and the freedom to pursue friendships - maybe even a job. I might even have a second chance with Colby... But that will take some time. I havent stepped back into the hotel yet. Its been several weeks, and Im loving everything about my new life - not to mention the vitality that has been injected into Candor. The town has regained a small amount of its former glory, and since Ive gone to town so often without my mom, people have even started to warm up to my presence. No one has asked after her whereabouts - not even Mrs. Miller, the tearoom owner. I bought my first laptop and my first cellphone with the assistance of a patient electronics shop clerk. I sit in *Le Petit* or the library most days, using the wifi available to learn about the world I'd missed out on. Im planning on getting my GED soon. Writing this is a little bit of catharsis, a little bit of apology, and... well, frankly, a little bit of a warning. If Mom somehow outwits me and regains her body, that will be my end, Im certain. But the town should know that if that were to happen, they can fight back, and they must. My mom is strong and evil, no doubt, but not all-powerful. She is a threat that can be denied. I love you, Candor. Im sorry it took me so long to find that out. And if you come across me staring at my feet, hopping and skipping to avoid cracks in the pavement, please dont think less of me. In spite of everything, I do my best not to cause my mother any more pain than shes already in. In spite of everything, I still love her too."
64,vulnerability,nosleep,Part 5. My husband gave me this necklace. Then strange things happened.,21,d0q1in,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/d0q1in/part_5_my_husband_gave_me_this_necklace_then/,2019-09-07 11:52:48,"I feel like Ive been sleeping for days. I open my eyes, but Im always in the the same white abyss. Im really losing track of time, so if you need to catch up, you can re-read all of these horrifying moments [here](URL [here](URL [here](URL and [here](URL The last thing I remember is my husband Frank reaching to open the walk-in closet door after I moved the thing that was growing into there. I woke up yesterday...at least I think it was yesterday, from a nightmare that felt so real. An animal bit me on the right side of my neck, and I think it was a wolf. His tooth remained in my wound when I woke up, and I pulled the tooth out of me and put it in a sandwich bag. The tooth grew into a replica of my right hand then my entire arm and then a part of my torso before I laid down garbage bags on the floor of the walk-in closet and hid it away in there. My mind keeps racing back to Sunday. Ever since Frank gave me that necklace with the purple amethyst circle stone, things have been strange. My cousin Mary always preaches that amethyst is supposed to be protective, but from what, exactly? I hope Im not being dramatic here, but I dont exactly feel protected. I keep thinking about the dream I had when I ended up in a desert in the dark, all alone. My phone had no service yet it rang suddenly and it was my mom, who died ten years ago. How did she call me? What was she telling me to run away from? Could she have know that the wolf was coming for me? Where WAS I exactly and how did I get there? I sometimes think I hear my phone ringing again but its seems so far away. When I try to listen for it, I feel strange as if parts of me dont exist at all. I cant stop thinking about the wound on my neck. Why did it heal so fast, and why wasnt I in any pain? Why didnt it bleed? Its clear that at the very least, my right jugular vein was compromised in the bite which shouldve produced more blood than just the trickle I saw in the mirror. Dr. Mack and Lisa must think I was absolutely insane when I showed up at the ER asking them to assess a wound that wasnt there. Ill be so embarrassed when I go back to work tomorrow. If I ever get there, I think to myself, but I quickly push that thought away. I had to promise like ten favors to get Labor Day off and it figures that Id start Monday morning right back at work, only on the opposite side of the stretcher. I keep falling asleep and waking up to the same white abyss. Its like Im stuck in this never ending dream. I opened my eyes at one point, and I must be hallucinating because there was a little old lady in a turtle neck standing in front of me. She seemed to be staring at the back of the room for awhile. She got down on her knees and prayed for what seemed like hours. Then she just left. I wonder who she was. She was adorable and made me think of the cute patients I care for at work. I wonder if I caught something at work. I must be sick or just completely run down from working so much lately. Weve been so short at the hospital. There mustve been something in the water because we had a handful of nurses all quit out of nowhere at once and its hard to find coverage for a busy ER like ours. Our psych visits have been increasing lately, which makes me think theres something else in the water, too. Weve seen an increase in men coming in saying that their wives are missing but when we send police to the house to check, their wives are at home and come to the ER immediately. Whats weird is that the drug screen and labs have all come back normal on these patients; any of us wouldve bet hard cash on these men being the latest victims of the opioid crisis. The patients always seem on edge and strange in an odd psychosis, but their wives have been so patient and helpful, jumping to get them whatever they need. Its nice to see that when people are having a hard time, their spouses are there for them. One of those patients was actually the husband of Megan, a nurse who unexpectedly quit out of nowhere last month. I know Megan well; she worked nights with Lisa and I when we all started our first year as nurses. Quitting on the spot was really unexpected for her considering that she was always such a team player. When her husband showed up at the ER last month, he was completely out of his mind, screaming that his wife was an imposter, but Megan kept her cool the entire time. After that, we all understood why Megan quit. It was clear that her husband needed her, and that she needed him. I saw on News 12 that he took his own life a few days after we saw her in the ER with him. It was just such a sad story. No ones heard from Megan since. Cant even imagine what it must be like to lose your husband. Speaking of husbands, I really miss Frank. I feel like we havent really seen each other in weeks, even though we go to bed together every night. Sunday was the first full day weve spent together in so long. I dont know whats happening with him lately, but he seems so unhappy which is why I was so shocked that he surprised me with a necklace. It made me feel happy and safe to know that he is still happy and he still does love me. I was worried that he was losing interest in me. Im just staring into space when I feel like the whole room is shaking violently. I listen closely and I can hear the sound of something breaking. I feel like I might fall. Then, I can see Frank. Frank! My handsome Frank. Hes too modest to ever acknowledge just how good looking he really is. I take in the full view of him. Standing six foot tall, Frank has the perfect amount of grey growing in his brown beard that makes his striking blue eyes stand out. When he smiles, which he doesnt do often, his entire face lights up and he gets these little wrinkles around his eyes that I just love. Frank is a deeply emotional man but youd never know it unless you were one of the lucky ones to be granted access to his inner thoughts. Franks standing in front of me right now, but he seems so far away. I try to call him but its like I have no voice. Hes walking toward me and he stops and looks horrified. Hes sobbing. Frank falls down to the ground and hes crying so hard that he vomits. He stands up and starts talking to me, but I cant respond. I cant comfort my husband when he needs me the most. Im so sorry, Laura. I just wanted to make you happy, he says, tears pouring from his eyes. I shouldve never bought you that necklace. Im so sorry, Laura, Im so sorry. I miss you SO much and Im so sorry, he says, dropping to the floor once again, the long string of I love yous barely audible over the sobs. I see a hand touch Frank on the back, and he jumps away in fear. I see him talking to a woman with brown hair but I cant see who she is because her back is to me. Hes yelling at her. Youre not Laura. Youre NOT my WIFE, he yells at the top of his lungs so loud that it shocks me. The woman turns and faces me. I nearly die. Its ME. Im looking at ME. The woman is me. Shes my exact height. She has the same exact brown, frizzy hair that frames her cute, round face. MY face. This must be the thing that was growing that looked like a replica of my right arm. I just know it, and as she steps closer, I can confirm that it is indeed me, only not me. Its a Laura imposter, and shes wearing the necklace Frank gave me. Her deep, brown eyes stare right through me. My brown eyes. How did she find that necklace when I threw it out, I wonder. The Laura imposter looks right at me, in a way that feels like shes looking right through me. Dont worry, Ill always be there for him and Ill never leave his side, she whispers at me. I will give him everything he needs, the Laura imposter says, smiling at me as if this is a normal conversation. He wont be lonely ever again, she says, and turns her back on me. Shes saying something to Frank but I cant hear her because I suddenly hear my phone ringing so loud as if its right next to my ear. As she ushers Frank out of the room, imposter Laura turns at me and flashes me the creepiest smilie Ive ever seen and its in that moment that I just know shes not human, and shes leaving with my husband, my soulmate, and I can do nothing about it. I dont know what else to do, so I just start sobbing, but I cant actually hear my voice outside of my head. I scream as loud as I can, calling out to my mom, begging her to call me again. Begging to hear her voice again. Im not much for prayer but over and over, I just start chanting, Dear God, please help me. Please help me talk to my mom. The entire time, my phone is ringing loudly. I suddenly feel two hands grab my shoulders and pull me hard. I feel like Im falling from the top of the Empire State Building. My stomach is in my throat. I close my eyes tight, bracing for an impact which never comes. Instead, the feeling of falling just suddenly halts. When I open my eyes, Im sitting against some rocks in a dark, chilly desert. The same desert I saw last night in my dream. My phone cries out, echoing through the night and I look down in relief to see it right there where I left it. I grab the phone and answer it. Mom? Laura. Kill it, my mothers voice says and as the line goes dead, I feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up in total and complete fear. I rush to my feet and start looking around for something, anything, to arm myself. I cant even describe the feeling of utter defeat I feel when all I manage to find is a few twigs in the brush. I rush over to the rocks again and stand with my back to them, my senses on high alert for any signs of the wolf that attacked me. I clutch my phone tightly as if it will offer me protection. And then I hear it growl. The wolf appears from the brush and stands in front of me. Its jet black eyes illuminate the night in contrast to its white sclera. Its the largest wolf Ive ever seen. Its jet black fur sticks up tall, and Im positive it can smell my fear as it continues to growl at me, slowly creeping closer. Im absolutely terrified, painfully aware of my vulnerability and fixated on its gaze, just waiting for it to pounce on me. Thats when I see my mother appear behind the wolf, and it immediately turns to pounce on her instead. My mother lets out a blood curdling holler and in one swift moment, I see my mother holding the beating heart of the wolf which collapses seconds later into a bloody pulp in her hand. The rest of its body simultaneously turns into a bloody mess of guts and blood on the dark desert floor. Im staring at my mom when I start to feel my body for the first time in what feels like forever. My eyes slide shut despite my attempt to keep them open, and when I pry my eyes open, Im standing in my house beside my walk-in closet, my hand still gripping my phone for dear life. I call out for Frank and search the entire house for him, but hes nowhere to be found. I pick up my phone to call him when I see a text from Dr. Mack. Frank is here. I need you to call me back ASAP. I also have several voicemails from Dr.Macks cell. Every part of me is shaking with fear as I play the last voicemail. Laura. Its Dr. Mack again. Ive called you many times. Its urgent that you call me back. Something is happening to Frank. Hes here and hes not well, Laura. Hes saying crazy things about some imposter and... Dr. Mack trails off as I hear another voice in the background. My heart immediately sinks and my mind is going a mile a minute. Frank! What do you mean hes not well? Why is he at the ER? Is he OK? Dr. Mack continues speaking. Hello. Im sorry. I thought I was speaking to Laura. I must have the wrong number. Please disregard this message, Dr. Mack says. Just before he hangs up, I hear him say, Laura! Im glad youre finally here. Im immediately filled with panic. I run to the front door and grab my car keys. I have to get to the ER. I have to get to my Frank."

I dont mind admitting that the message I got from the now deleted reddit user put me on edge. But you have to understand that I got literally dozens of similar messages after my first post, and a few of them were pretty far out there, and Im talking straight-jacket kind of out there. So while I found the phrasing eerily specific, I just couldnt take it seriously. I guess a part of the reason was the relief I felt. I was finally free. I finally had a way out. I went to school as normal, the strange message now but a vague itch in the back of my mind. I was feeling great. I was feeling like I finally had my life back. For the first time in weeks, I felt like I was in control. A week went by without incident, and I was starting to think everything was going to be just fine. A feeling of normality returned to me. The feeling wouldnt last. In fact it started fading already when I stepped out the door this morning. Now usually Id either walk with Kelly, or get a ride from Kellys parents to school, but this morning no one came. I must have stood in the driveway for at least twenty minutes before I finally just got tired of waiting, and started walking by myself. Its not like I didnt know the way. I just wanted some company. I tried calling Kelly repeatedly, but she wasnt answering. Maybe theyd overslept or something. I mean, stuff like that *does* happen. Anyway, I arrived at school a few minutes late, and I couldnt remember what day it was, thus I wasnt completely sure what class I was supposed to be in. I wandered around aimlessly for a while, knocking on doors, trying to figure out where everybody was, when it dawned on me; maybe school was out? Was it a holiday? Was it saturday? Sunday? I realised I had no idea. I kinda shrugged mentally, and figured Id best be heading home. But then, just as I was leaving, someone grabbed me by the hand. Not gently, but aggressively. Like they were trying to pull my arm from out of its socket. I hadnt heard anyone approaching, and I have damned good hearing, so I was caught completely off guard. My assailants hand felt weird, like knobbly and crooked and clammy, and I started screaming the moment it touched me. I desperately tried to yank free, but the grip was unbelievably tight, like almost powerful enough to shatter bones. Calm down, Violet, a familiar voice called, Im not here to hurt you. K-Kelly? I asked, W-what the hell is going on?! She released the grip, and I backed away slowly, dazed and confused. Ive known Kelly my whole life. Something told me this wasnt her. Something about the tone in her voice, and that unnerving feeling of her touch. You shouldnt go home, Violet, she said, You should sleep and let him back inside. No! Im never letting him back inside! I yelled, Stay away from Kelly you freak! I continued backing away slowly, until suddenly I hit the wall. I had lost track of where I was, and I wasnt entirely sure in what direction the exit was anymore. I heard Kelly breathing weirdly, almost like she was gasping for air. She was edging closer to me, inch by inch. I guess she was trying to catch me off guard again. But not this time. I waited until she was close enough for me to lash out with my long cane, and struck her with all my might. She didnt make a sound, but I could tell by the force of the impact that it had to hurt. I didnt stick around long enough to make sure, though. The moment the cane connected, I legged it down the hallway as fast as I could. After a minute or so of getting my bearings, I finally found the exit. I paid close attention to any noise behind me, but I didnt hear anything, so I felt rather certain shed given up. But just as I opened the door, I felt her hand again. How the hell did she keep sneaking up on me? Just remember what I said, Violet,  she said, You have to let him in. After a quick struggle she let go of my arm, but grabbed onto my jacket instead. I screamed and kicked and flailed my cane around in a frenzy, and after hitting her repeatedly I finally got loose. I think I ran home on pure instinct. I cant remember ever using my cane. It was like I was being guided by something. I stumbled into the house gasping for breath, tears streaming down my face, feeling completely drained and exhausted. My mind felt bloated, like there was just too much going on up there, and I didnt even register that my parents were sitting in the living room. It was only when the third person spoke that I snapped back into reality. Viiiiolet, so good to seeee you, Doctor Creepy said, Weve been WAItiiing for you. I edged back instinctively. I *really* hated the way he spoke. It was this mixture of annoying and incredibly creepy. But that wasnt the only red flag. Why was he here? Why were they waiting for me? Violet, my mother said with a trembling voice, Please sit down. We need to talk. Yes, my father chimed in, Please, Violet. Dont make this harder than it is. Dont make what harder than it is? I felt overcome with this weird sensation, like I was back in my horrible dream world, far away from reality. Detached and unhinged. I didnt want to do it, but I felt I needed to. I sat down, burying my face in my hands, sobbing inconsolably. Gooood, Doctor Creepy said, Leeeets get tooo it then. Get to what? I murmured, What is going on here? Doctor Creepy made a sound. I suppose it was a snicker or some such, but it sounded more like a hoarse animal choking to death. I cringed in disgust and felt my muscles tensing. Violet, darling, my mother said, We havent been completely honest with you Its not our fault, my father said, I mean, you have to understand, we had to do it Do what? I whispered, What are you talking about? I could hear them both crying. Doctor Creepy definitely wasnt. I could almost picture his smile, even though I had no way of actually doing that. Its the strangest thing, hearing your parents cry. Its the kind of weakness, or I guess vulnerability, that *really* gets to you, you know. Theyre supposed to be strong, relentless, unmoved, but there they were, sobbing away. You werent born blind, my father sulked, You were perfectly healthy. *We* made you blind. It was the only way my mother said, The only way we could survive Im not sure what was going on in my mind at that point. I think the shock of it all sent me spiralling into some kind of selective amnesia state, because I struggle even now to remember anything that was said for the next few minutes. I know that I didnt believe it. I mean, how can you believe something like that? It sounded utterly ridiculous. Crazy. Insane. Please, Violet, I remember my mother saying, Please try to understand. They promised us everything. Money, support, the best care in the world. And they gave it to us, cant you see that? Didnt you ever stop to think where we got all this money from? Neither your father or me have that kind of job. I remember crying. Everyone crying. Well, except Doctor Creepy. I was shaking, trembling like a leaf, struggling to comprehend the words my parents were uttering. Theyd blinded me from birth. Dont ask me how, Im guessing there was some kind of procedure involved. And for what? Money? But why? To what end? It wiiiilll come, Viiiolet, Doctor Creepy said, Iiiif you let it. It neeeds the darkness to GROW, to EVOLVE, to be booooorn. What the hell are you talking about?! I yelled, I dont understand, what is he talking about mom? My mother burst into hysterical wailing, her tormented cries and coughs violent and unyielding. I couldnt understand what was happening. It couldnt be real. I had to be still dreaming, nothing else made any sense. It is powerful, Violet, my father said, They say it is a God. *The* God. It is an honor, dont you see, to give birth to a God? Please, just listen to us, it is almost here now, you just need to let it out. Just dont dream. It needs your void, your nothingness. It wont hurt. I promise, it wont hurt.. Kellys words suddenly popped into my mind, and the puzzle pieces slowly started aligning themselves. Yooour miiind has beeen nuuurturing him for YEEEars, Viiiolet, Doctor Creepy said coldly, Juuuust leeet hiim ooout nooow, and thiiis will be aaaall oooover. I sat there sobbing for minutes. I guess theyve said what needed saying, because everyone gradually became as silent as the grave. I just needed to let him out, and it would all be over. Everything could go back to normal. I nodded weakly and stood up, my entire body still convulsing erratically. I dont know how long I stood there before I heard Doctor Creepy getting to his feet and walking towards me. I timed the moment just right. The cane hit him straight in the face, Im guessing the nose by all the blood that squirted all over me. His scream still echoes in my mind. A small, but welcome, comfort. I did the only thing I could think of. I ran. I bolted out the door like lightning. Once again, it almost felt like I was being guided by someone. Something. I didnt stop until I arrived at my destination. It was a secret place. Only Kelly and me knew about it. It was a little bit off the trail through the forest, just a tiny clearing where Kelly and I used to play when we were younger. I sat down in the center of it and just let myself go. I cried, muffled, pained gasps. Everything I knew, just about every aspect of my life, had turned out to be a lie. It took me a while before I felt it. In the pocket of my jacket. A small, spherical object. A box of pills. At first I didnt realise how they got there. But then I remembered; Kelly. She grabbed my jacket back at school. *Just remember what I said, Violet. Just let him in.* I dont know how long I have. Im already feeling pretty drowsy. There were a lot of pills in that box, and I swallowed them all. The Man is with me already. He just needed an invitation, an opening in my mind, a little lapse in my consciousness. He will hold the thing back. Keep it locked inside my head. Protect me, protect you, protect all of us against whatever foul, nightmarish, blasphemous thing they put inside me. Thats his purpose, you see. I dont know who he is, what he is, but I know he doesnt mean us any harm. He is here to protect us from them, whatever they are. Definitely not gods. Something older. Darker. Primal and horrible. If you dream of this Man, dont fight it. Dont let it out. Let him in. Let him feel you. Dont make the mistake I did. Trust him. I think I need to lie down. I am very sleepy. Good night.

When I say barren, I dont mean completely blank- the walls were covered in posters, the chalkboard coated with writing. Stray pencil stubs with barely an inch left to them were scattered here and there, and on the desks remained bits of rolled up eraser from inadequate answers. No, barren in this sense is different. This was the kind of barren that you felt in your soul. The emptiness of the classroom was unsettling. Gone was the neverending droning of the air-conditioning unit, and gone was the occasional tapping of shoes down the hallway. They say that the loudest volume on earth is nothing compared to the ear-piercing noise of complete silence. The silence filled up every corner of my mind, seeping into my eyes and teeth and curling around my ears. The silence was an ice bath. So cold it was hot- scalding silence. I could have been in that room for days. The empty, barren, noiselessness was suddenly broken when I noticed something in my peripheral vision. By the time my mind had risen out of its seemingly eternal hibernation it had been placed under, whatever was there was gone. I sat for a moment, pondering my loss of time and trying to think of just how long I had been sitting in that chair, at that desk. I looked around at the empty desks surrounding me. When did I get here? Did I even remember who I was before this classroom? Most of all, why was I accepting this? I felt like I should be banging at the walls. I could imagine myself screaming until my voice went hoarse and I fell to the ground. Or was that a memory? Come to think of it, my throat felt slightly sore. Something flashed in my periphery once more. Whos there? I whispered. My voice, however quiet, seemed to bounce around the room, magnifying with every second. The Whos there? stirred my ears from their catatonic state. To my left I heard a breath. I looked that way, but there was no one there. After another lifetime of boring, mundane silence, I was ready for whatever it was when I saw it again. This time when something flashed in the back corner of the classroom, I didnt look at it. I sat completely still and only looked from the corner of my eye, not turning at all. There it was. A figure stood in the corner. She looked like a teacher from two hundred years ago. While I couldnt see the exact details without turning to look at her, I could see her gray hair swept up in a tight bun, and her shapeless brown smock hung off of her shoulders. She had glasses on, I thought, but I couldnt be certain. The most unsettling thing about her was the way she stood. Her hands were positioned in front of her like she was hugging a stack of books, but there werent any. And god, the way she stood. If you asked me to explain to you what was wrong with the way she was standing, I couldnt tell you exactly. While she had the right placements, it was just wrong. Something about her was off. You know how people can supposedly tell when theyre being watched, even if they cant see anyone around them? Ifr youve ever felt that, you know the feeling- the hair raised on the back of your neck, the feeling of utter vulnerability. That feeling, magnified by a few hundred, is what I was feeling right at that moment. I realized I hadnt blinked since I first saw her, and I really needed to. In an effort not to lose my sight of her, I slowly closed one eye, then the other one. However, this was ineffective because I was only seeing her out of the corner of my left eye to begin with. As soon as that eye closed, the feeling intensified until it was overwhelming. If I was standing I would have been knocked down. I wasnt sure what it was at first because my right eye was still open and I saw nothing, but when I opened my left eye I saw it. The woman was standing at the front of the room now, looking straight at me. I felt more vulnerable than I have ever felt before in my life. Her arms were still positioned like they were holding books, and her hair was still swept up. However, this time, one of her eyes was a dark brown, instead of the empty void that had been there a few moments ago. It's been a few years now since that day. Over the years I've accidentally opened my left eye a few times. Each time, a part of me is taken. Each time I see that thing, I become less whole. Dont get me wrong, I still look normal, but I know for sure that my right arm is not the right arm that I grew up with. Every once in a while Ill try to grab something like a coffee, for example, and my arm will glitch. Ill have it moved towards the cup and suddenly itll be right back at my side, with no memory of me moving it. Also, Ive developed a phantom arm feeling, like amputees. I feel my arm brushing by things, being touched, and grabbing objects, but Im not doing any of that. Most of all, however, I feel myself seeing things. Out of my left eye. I cant exactly comprehend what I am seeing, I just feel it. I know that wherever my eye is, wherever my arm is, soon enough all of me will be lost to this entity. Thats not what im most worried about, though. Because when I look in the mirror, something about me strikes a fear into my very soul. I know I will do anything to become whole again."

68,vulnerability,nosleep,My mother is most likely a paranoid schizophrenic person and is breaking my family apart.,4,dbm0qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dbm0qh/my_mother_is_most_likely_a_paranoid_schizophrenic/,2019-10-01 11:39:49,"Hello no sleep, my name is ""B"" and Im a 16 year old girl with a problem that would be considered a real life horror and I would like to share it with you. Two months ago, my mother began to behave strangely. At first, she claimed that cars were following her and she was being gang-stalked to put it simply. Now, any child would believe their mother and would want to help. I believed everything she said and was determined to protect her, however, things became chaotic to our family. My mother started to believe that she is being followed by the Cartel, this turns into the Mafia, and now she has been sticking to that this is the governments work. Ill be putting her major episodes below and explain them. The first major episode: My mother comes home in a panic at 10PM on a Sunday. She is freaking out and believes she was followed home. She proceeds to turn off all the lights in our home and makes us go to her room. I have two other brothers aged 12 and 24 that were with me. We all gathered in her room in the pitch dark and just sat until we heard something from one of the windows outside the room. It sounded like someone opening a window and climbing through. To shorten this episode, she calls the police, we hide under her bed, and the police come. They look at her like shes crazy and says that there was nothing that looked like a sign of forced entry. Major episode two: This is still connected to the first night. We end up leaving our home in two different cars and meet up at a QT. She starts blaring her horn because once again she believes we were followed. She gets the attention of two younger workers from the gas station and asks them to call the police...once again. To put this shortly as well, they escorted us to a hotel where we stayed that night. My mother still believed people were scaling the outside of the hotel walls and getting into our room. (we were on the 3 floor..) Now, as you can tell, this is becoming more and more unbelievable and I agree. I completely disregarded everything because she sounds like a paranoid schizophrenic with no sleep. I still dont believe her problems to this day. Major episode 3: This is a few weeks after the ""break-in"" incident. (Ive come to terms that this was extremely unlikely.) My mother comes home crying because she thinks that once again she was followed. She begins to see light reflecting off the walls, lasers, and thinks that people are flashing their headlights into our home. ( We live in an area where drive by constantly at night..so obviously Im already annoyed and discrediting her.) A few hours pass with her crazed hallucinations and then she believes that someone put a bomb in her car, she then goes outside and thinks that she sees a guy get murdered in the construction site near our home, and then she starts to think that people are shooting radio waves into her. She drives away at 6am in the morning and doesnt tell us where she went. I had zero sleep that night. Present at this moment: My mom believes that she is now a Targeted Individual. She thinks she has something in her head, she thinks she hears ""them"" talk to her, and she thinks that they (she probably thinks the government) are going to influence everything we do. Her paranoia has increased into something terrible and Im helpless. I cant do anything. My family is drained and cant take her anymore. I am unfortunately stuck in this situation. And no, my mother doesnt do any drugs, shes diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and she has no medication. I believe she will benefit getting from psychiatric help, but she refuses. Reddit, this is real life horror in my eyes. The decay of someones own sanity. Im losing my mother to her own mind and vulnerability and I cant help any longer. Thank you for taking the time for reading this and please feel free to comment any questions or thoughts below."

I decided to post this here after not knowing what all else to with it. I changed the names and everything from the original, but I should probably give some background. I got this handwritten letter, with no return address, in the mail the other day. I know Dan pretty well, but I havent seen or heard from him in a while. His phone is off, and no one else who is friends with him has any clue to his whereabouts. I contacted the authorities, but more time needs to pass before a search can start. They told me this is probably a prank, but Im not so sure. I havent actually seen Dan in a couple of months. I will invite him to things, and hell accept. At the last minute he usually cancels due to some excuse. It gets a little tiresome, but I understand hes been having a tough time. Im posting this letter here to see if anyone has seen a listing on Airbnb or any of the other big sites that is similar to the one described here. TIA everyone who might have some helpful info. \----------------------------------------------------------- I needed to get out. Life was kind of dragging along its own routine, with me as a passenger staring distantly out the window. Declining a brunch invitation to the most instagrammable cafe in my city, I decided instead to get out of town for a while. I wasnt feeling it lately, but thankfully I had a reasonable cure. With a long weekend ahead of me, I thought that booking a cabin in the woods might be just what I needed. I wanted to get into nature before it was too cold, and maybe even get in some hiking. At the very least, I wanted to be able to get away from the internet, sit by a big fire, and listen to some music or read a book. I figured that might make me feel like a person again. I was doing some searches here and there, and eventually found the perfect place. It was just a few hours north of the Twin Cities (I live around Minneapolis), and the cabin looked amazing. Well, I shouldnt even call it a cabin, it looked more like an upscale house. It was designed in a modern fashion, but with a rustic and spartan feel. I felt like I had struck gold. Since it wasnt really the high season any more (it gets cold pretty early in northern Minnesota), it was actually available for an attractive price. It wasnt all luck that had inspired my research, though. I had actually visited the area as a kid with my family. I had fond memories of the town, too. It was a lively, yet still very local place. A good ratio of strong, homegrown community that welcomed the fairweather lake-cabin owners. At least, that was my memory of it. Hell, for the quality of this house and its price, I would have considered half a dozen other towns that are truly god-awful, dried up places. This would definitely do. I looked over the listing for about 10 minutes before I confirmed the reservation and ponied up my credit card number. I received a confirmation almost immediately, as well as a nice little automated note from the listing owner. From the sparse belongings shown in the interior pictures of the house, I could tell this was a professional vacation rental. It was one of those the keys to the place are in this hidden spot, please put them back there and tidy up before you leave kind of deals. My reservation was for that Friday, so I figured Id be all ready to go and could take the afternoon off of work that day to head straight there from the office. I packed the usual weekend stuff, plus some hiking gear and some miscellaneous camping stuff into my trusty sedan. Before I finished up on Thursday night, I made sure I had all my emergency roadside supplies. Im not exactly a doomsday prepper, but I do understand that the woods are nature, and nature is unpredictable. The answer? Be prepared! The drive up was weird. I was glad to skip the usual Friday rush hour traffic, but zooming out of the cities so easily brought me into this odd half-suburban, half-countryside environment within just an hour or so of departure. Theres this kind of bland acceptance of modernity that seems to be pervasive. I felt an unease throughout this portion of the drive. The feeling reached its apex when I passed an anti-abortion billboard coming out from a treeline, forest on either side. A strong message to no one, in a place where the message, and the structure bearing that message, dont belong. It was kind of a portent of all of these bad towns I passed by, many of them seeming to only subsist by virtue of proximity to a major highway. Places alive on the outside, but hollow at their core. A pit stop for gas and some groceries on a deserted Main Street all but confirmed this feeling. A liquor store was open though, so I grabbed a bottle of whiskey, too. Then it was back to the road. Once my traveling had taken me off the highway and onto a somewhat twisty county road leading me to another, even twistier county road closer to my destination, things picked up. With way less people around, I felt like it was no longer obnoxious to turn my music way up. It was easy to pass the time on a single lane road with no one else going in either direction, even on a Friday. Refreshing, too. A few hours driving really melted into a few moments once I was on this route, and it was only early evening before I arrived into town. It did take a little longer than I thought to get out there, but I didnt mind. From every indication that I could glean as I arrived, the town of Dodanpa was doing well. There were cheery people walking about the main street stopping and chatting with each other, no one looked as if they were in an opioid trance, and the buildings were well maintained. That unsettling, decrepit feeling I got from my pit stop and that billboard was vanished, replaced with an infectious, cheerful optimism. People were getting back from fishing at the nearby lake, boats towed behind them, or their nicer, new-ish looking cars were parked outside the few watering holes scattered throughout the small town center. My destination was on the other side of town, so I had to drive right through the main drag to get to the tiny road that would take me to my cabin. The map I was sent after I had confirmed my booking showed that the property was actually adjacent to a state nature preserve, which was great news to me. It was remote, but I could probably ride a bicycle into town if I had brought one. I drove slowly, taking in the sights. I had a big, dumb grin on my face until my eyebrows folded themselves into a hard furrow. Right as I turned off the main street I passed by an old shop that looked more like it belonged in a haunted version of the shire from Middle Earth than it did in a thriving little town like this. It was a one story rambler painted two colors, with a grey, sunken porch in the front and ratty, confederate flags stuck in at uneven intervals. The flags on their own were alarming to see, but this was just icing on a turd of a home. The porch framed an open doorway leading into a darkened hallway that had an unearthly glow to it. It was broad daylight and comfortably warm outside, yet from the black smoke oozing out of a crusty pipe chimney on the roof, I could tell a fire was going. The sign above the door read Cassies General Store, but a sign on the door, opened completely, said KEEP OUT. Not the most welcoming. Both grossed and weirded out by the rare sight of hillbilly trash in a blue state, I moved along quickly. The cabin was not hard to find based on the directions I had received. I arrived at the house and retrieved the keys from the most obvious fake rock Id ever seen. The sincere unconcern for security here gave me a sense of relief. If this very nice house could sit on this very nice hill while being very vulnerable to any prowler, and still remain untouched, Id probably be okay for the weekend. I entered through the front door, and was instantly taken aback by the sheer beauty of the place. The light perfectly cast a mix of homey orange glow over the predominantly wooden finishes, with the contrasting shadows crafting playful patterns on the floor and wall. I grinned to myself and set my things down to explore. The main entrance opened up into a kind of foyer, which led to a very open kitchen and dining room on the right. On the left was a comfortable living room, and by the left wall there were stairs leading up to a couple of bedrooms and an office. This place could easily house 5-10 people, but it was all mine this time. As I toured the property, I started noticing small details that displayed an unexpectedly high level of craftsmanship. There were hand-carved mouldings and custom woodwork everywhere. Nothing appeared to be pre-fabricated. In my adulthood I had only rented apartments (cheap ones from jerk landlords, usually) and only ever possessed IKEA furniture. Experiencing this cabin was like being in an alien land. I sat in one of the chairs, and my body simply melted into it. The comfort of this chair was astounding, a perfect fit. Whoever put this house together had paid the utmost attention to every detail. I was grateful for it, kicking my legs up on the ottoman and soaking it in. It was so comfortable, in fact, that I became concerned about falling asleep. I figured I would have plenty of time to check out the rest of the cabin later that night. For now, I really wanted to get a sense of the surrounding land and the state nature preserve, just visible in the backyard. According to a laminated map of the property that was neatly placed on the kitchen counter, if I walked straight for the treeline from the back porch, I would find myself in the state preserve. The door to that porch was directly behind the dining room. So, from where I was standing in the kitchen, I only had to look to my right to see this path. Through the beautifully framed glass wall that the dining room was nestled into, I could see both the porch, the treeline, and a light path in the grass leading to it. I threw on my hiking shoes, grabbed the keys, my bottle of water, and a compass, and headed out the back door. As I trotted over through the soft grass, I took in the air. It felt great. The sun was shining warmth on an otherwise cool and brisk day. A boatload of tension melted off my shoulders after even just a few steps. Realizing this, I reflected on why being in a place like this provided me with such a significant amount of relief. Ironically, now that I had spent so much effort getting out here, alone, I kind of wished I had someone to keep me company. I definitely valued the solitude, but it struck me when I realized that for the first time in a while, I wanted someone else to be around. It was kind of a nice change of pace, mentality-wise. I thought of a few people I might have brought up here, but I doubt they could replicate the same mindset I was in. Maybe it was the way the people on the Main Street I had passed through were interacting with each other. People from all different stages of life (and actually kind of diverse, for northern Minnesota) were getting along with each other. This was a community, and people cared about each other out here. You could see it in the way old buildings were maintained just like you could see it in how the younger residents treated the old-timers. I was thinking about this pretty intently when I realized that I was completely surrounded by trees. I kicked myself slightly and noted to myself that no one knows that Im out here, and that getting lost in the woods within a hundred minutes of dusk is a bad idea. I looked behind me and could see the opening where I entered. It was only about 50 feet away. I checked my compass to see that the opening was right in the middle of the South and Southeast indicators. Now, if I got a little turned around, I at least knew if I basically headed South I would be okay. I looked around the woods as well. It was an older forest, with lots of conifers and a sparse shrub layer. This made for easy walking in the daytime. It was surprising to me, however, how dark it was here from the canopy. All of the zoning out I had just done helped my eyes adjust, though. I was taking it all in, seeing if there were any good clearings or just cool trees to look at, when I heard it. **\*SNAP\*** I turned my head in the direction of the sound and saw a dark shadow dart amongst the trees. I tensed up a little, as the feeling of being watched slowly crept over me. This kind of situation always presents an odd choice. For the most part, this kind of event is meaningless. Living animals tend to dwell in a state nature preserve. However, being alone in the woods means there is always a chance of being torn apart by an insane murderer with no one ever knowing. I have found that the best course of action is to try to confirm the meaninglessness of the forest sound without increasing vulnerability to insane murderers. Besides, the sound and the shadow seemed to be at least 100 yards out. It was too far to see, and the only reason I heard it was because the woods are generally very quiet. I walked a little further along, angling my head to get a better view while keeping my ears open. Even though I kept telling myself it was nothing, I could slowly feel my heartbeat increasing as the blood pumped harder in my ears. I looked back South, towards more immediate safety, but kept moving forward. Slowly, and with each footstep, my unease and feelings of being watched increased. **\*SNAP\*** I heard another sound followed by some rustling, this time much, *much* closer than 100 yards away. A black shadow raced through some shrubs in front of me. My heart started racing and my hips were already turning to run when the shadow lept out in front of me and landed its four dirty paws on a broken log just five feet from where I was standing. It was a dog. A medium-sized, black, shaggy dog. I guessed it as a lab-chow mix at the time, and I dont think the guess was far off. I sighed relief and laughed to myself. The dog, panting and smiling with its tongue out, cocked its head at an angle wondering what I was giggling to myself about. Hey buddy, I said, bending over, whered ya come from? I reached out my hands, and in response it snorted to itself and reared up a little. It kind of pounded its little paws in the dirt and stared up. It barked once at me, then turned and started to walk away. It took a few strides before sitting on its haunches, looking back at me. You want me to follow you, huh? I said as I took a few steps forward. The shaggy mutt again barked just once, almost in approval, and continued along. I could tell this little guy was excited, and I figured it was ok to follow for a while. Whoevers dog this was probably knows the woods well, at least I hoped. I didnt see a collar, but the likelihood of an actual stray being able to survive here and be happy was pretty low. Besides, this dog did not seem lost in the slightest. As we strolled along, the pooch really started to pick up the pace. He wasnt going in a straight line, either. Turning one way at a certain tree and another at a moss-covered rock, it seemed to be following its own path from memory. I was walking quickly to keep up at first, but soon I was at a light jog just to keep him within eyesight. It didnt help that it was getting darker by the minute and the thing I was following was a jet-black furball. Hey! Doggy! I called out, but it was now running. I was near a full-on sprint before I realized I was running through the woods chasing what could be a wild animal like a madman. What the hell am I doing? I thought to myself as I slowed down to stop. I bent over with my hands on my knees to catch my breath, and all I could hear was my own heartbeat and a faint rustling in the distance as the dog completely escaped me. Feeling like a crazy person after 15 minutes in the woods was not the ideal way I wanted to start my trip. Still out of breath, I looked around and noticed that I was in a slight clearing. The sun streamed through the canopy here, casting a hazy amber hue on something I wasnt expecting. It looked like I was at the end of a path. This was weird. Usually, paths in these state preserves either made a loop or ended at some landmark. Paths usually didnt just end in nothing like it did here. At least to my knowledge, they didnt. A small part of me wanted to see where it led, but I knew that was a bad idea. I had already kind of screwed up by following that pooch out here. If I hadnt gotten my bearings beforehand, I might have actually been in some trouble. Looking ahead, the path didnt appear to really lead anywhere except to more forest. I decided it might be a cool thing to explore later, but for the moment I thought it best to try to head back. I checked my compass. From the combination of my own internal sense of direction and its reading, I could tell that I had taken a lot of twists and turns through this forest. What I thought would be South (back the way I came) was actually West. The path was headed in a northerly direction, and to my East was the direction the dog had been running. I decided to head directly South to try to get out of the woods as quickly as possible. While I was checking my compass and getting myself sorted, I thought I heard the dog again, this time to my Northeast. I ignored the rustling, not wanting to get caught in another wild dog chase. I walked at a brisk pace with the compass in hand at all times, not wanting to waste any time. I figured I might end up not exactly on the same property as my cabin. Although the town seemed friendly, no one really enjoys strangers trespassing. The situation would be easy to explain, but such a scenario ought to be avoided. I wasnt stressed out, as I hadnt actually wandered very far. I was walking to avoid having to go through big clumps of trees, constantly checking my orientation to make sure I was going the right way. I had circumvented an outcrop of birch when I realized I was going a little bit too far in a Southeast direction. As I walked and studied the compass, I failed to notice a thick root on the ground and tripped a little, falling down on my hands. Crap! I half-muttered, half-shouted as I picked myself and the compass up. Better watch out. A voice called out from behind me. Jesus! I whirled around to see an elderly man with a cane, wearing a golfers cap and dressed in a flannel and sweater vest, with cargo khakis and rubber mudder boots standing just a few feet away. Not quite, he said as he smirked to himself, amused at my alarm. It must have occurred to him that sneaking up on a stranger in the middle of the woods is not a very nice thing to do, but he also must have known that he appeared completely harmless. Oh, sorry. I said, recovering from my bewilderment. I got a little turned around out here, Im just heading back to my cabin. I put the sentence out there, and it seemed to be caught by another rustle a few feet away. I turned my head to look past the old man, but he kept his eyes fixed on me for a few seconds. An odd moment passed between us as the rustling got closer, and the black dog emerged from behind some ferns. The little rascal had the same silly grin on its face as it circled around the man, stretched out, and then sat on his haunches beside his owner. The old man could see the recognition in my eyes, and reached down to scratch the dog behind his ear. Looks like you met Donny, he said to me. He didnt make you chase him, did he? I wouldnt say he made me, I said with a small chuckle, but I suppose you could call it that. Ah well, thats his M.O. alright. We dont get too many folks out here, and this guy loves people, he said, grinning at the dog. You *dont* get a lot of people out here? I said, puzzled. This was beautiful country, and I couldnt imagine the cabin I was staying at would suffer from a lack of renters. Especially with the bustle I had just seen in town. Well we get plenty of people visiting town, and plenty of the cabin people have their friends out all the time on the lake, but hardly anyone comes to these woods. Most people are warned off by the time they get familiar enough with the town to want to explore it. He put this very plainly. Well theyre definitely missing out. Even the little run-in I had with Donny here was a sight to behold. Sure dont like getting turned around by myself, but I guess I dont mind taking the scenic route home. Well you know how people are sometimes. Superstitions and whatnot. His plain manner of speaking piqued my interest here. In a way I didnt altogether appreciate. What do you mean superstitions? Oh, you know. Native stuff. Indian burial ground and what have you. Were not too far away from a reservation. A few folks from the tribe live here in town, but its all talk. Mostly people saying this or that happened and they saw a spirit or whatnot. Ive lived right next to these woods for decades, its all a big load of nonsense. I dont discourage it, though. More forest for me. He winked at me and gave a smile. Oh, the cabin Im staying at is right near here, too. I checked my compass, Right over in uhh That direction. I motioned to the Southwest. Ohhhh you must be staying at Gerrys house. Youre a lucky guy. Were next-door-neighbors. If you count a few hundred yards as next door. He extended his hand. Im Al, this heres Donny. I shook his hand, relieved to discover a simple reason for this weird-talking old timer to be out here. Nice to meet you Al, Im Dan. And nice to meet you, Donny. Last time I let you get the best of me. The dog snorted as I spoke, spun in a circle, and sat down again. Well, that was why I was out here even though its a bit late for the bush. This preserve was so close! I feigned some neighborly enthusiasm. Well you had a decent idea, but youre wrong about one thing. I looked at him, surprised again by how direct a northern Midwestern could be. Must come with age. Youre not quite in that direction, and he stepped a little closer to me, youre more in *that* direction. He motioned a few degrees difference from where I had previously indicated. You see that big tree just ahead of us? I nodded yes, it was pretty distinct. You walk to that tree and head directly Southwest from *there*. Youll be back at that house in no time. I nodded in approval. Hey, thanks so much, Al. As much of a sight as it is now, I really dont want to be out here without a light for too much longer. No problem, and it was nice to meet you. If I dont see you again, I hope you have a nice time here in Dodanpa. Gerrys house is just a work of art, too, isnt it? he said knowingly. I nodded an emphatic yes. Thanks again, keep that little guy out of trouble now. I gave a wink to the dog, who let out a half bark of farewell as I started heading for the tree. I had taken a few steps, when a question occurred to me. Hey Al I turned around. To my surprise, he was still standing there, completely motionless, staring at what once was my back. I paused for a few seconds with a look of surprise on my face before realizing I was now rudely staring at *him*. I saw a path just about 10 minutes north of here. Any idea where it goes or where it starts? I asked, hoping to glean a fragment of last-minute local knowledge. He regarded me for a moment, with a faint expression of doubt. This heres mostly state preserve. There arent any paths that end within even a few miles of my property line, and those are all clearly marked. If you saw a path out there, it must have been made by the rain or something else. If you see it again, I wouldnt go planning a day around it or nothing. He left it at that. I kind of just blinked at him for a few seconds, trying to process two incongruous ideas in my head. Okay. Well, thanks again for the directions. Have a nice night. I turned quickly and walked away, trying to ignore the needles in my back that I could feel his eyes shooting. *Something else* he had said. That, and the superstitions he had mentioned gave me a queasy feeling that I didnt really feel like addressing at the moment. By the time I made it to the big tree, I had made up my mind to forget the strange interaction, and just enjoy my weekend. I checked my compass again, and it was easy walking to the Southwest. It only took me about fifteen minutes to see the opening in the trees again. When I emerged from the woods, I was only a few yards from where I had entered. Though it was only a short excursion into the forest, I felt like a lot had transpired. I was ready and eager to kick back and relax in these sweet digs I had for the weekend. I got into the house, took off my hiking boots, and sat back again in the leather chair. I let out a deep sigh, and closed my eyes for a moment. The leather of the chair gave way to an almost floating feeling. I woke to complete darkness, with that awful feeling of having no idea where I was. It took me a second to gather myself; my first instinct was to grip the arms of the chair as I gasped in surprise at my lack of surroundings. With no light pollution in the surrounding area, waking up with no lights on means waking up to complete blackness. Once I felt the incredible softness of the chairs arms, memory returned to me. Another sigh of relief. I sat there for a moment, now feeling rested. I felt silly and overly skittish. I talked with my neighbor, who is a nice old guy, in the woods. That was literally all that happened to me since I had arrived. I got up carefully, and extended my arms until I found a wall. Grasping in the darkness, it didnt take long to find a light switch, which I flicked on. The living room lit up, and was as lovely and comforting as it was in the daytime. I finally noticed the simple stone fireplace on the opposite side of the wall, and made a mental note to try it out later. I checked the time, and to my surprise it was after midnight. Damn, I said aloud. The travel must have really taken it out of me. I returned from my stroll in the woods around 6. It was surprising that I slept so long, but it must have been due to the quiet of the environment. As I paced around, my stomach growled. I was *hungry*. Having only eaten lunch that day, I was overdue for a nice meal. Luckily, I had some basic groceries in a cooler bag with me. I went around the house and figured out which lights corresponded to the switches on the wall. When I had set the right late-night cooking mood in the kitchen, I fired up the oven. I found a nicely seasoned cast-iron skillet in a cupboard, and took out a pair of steaks and a russet potato from my cooler bag. The cuts of meat were still pretty cool, so I opened the packaging and set it out on a cutting board, seasoning the pieces of beef and letting them warm up while I got the potatoes ready. As I was cutting the tubers up to boil (I like them mashed), I thought I heard something outside. Like the pat pat of hooves or something. Must be a deer, I thought to myself, and kept cutting. I had put a pot of water on the stove to keep the diced potatoes in, when I heard it again. It had a definite loping pattern to it, and sounded like an animal. It was pretty loud, though. It *must* be a deer, I thought to myself. I put the cast iron on the stove and cranked it high, pouring a little oil in to sear the steaks. I was too hungry to care, until I heard the click-clack of hooves on the back deck. I turned my head to the right and saw what looked like the legs of a deer disappear to the left side of the glass wall, accompanied by the same hooves-on-wood sound. I stood there for a second, listening. I couldnt hear anything else. Doubt crept into my head, slithering along like a slug. I wasnt entirely sure that what I had just seen were deer legs. I thought I had seen hooves, and I thought I saw a leg. The leg, however, looked white. The queasy feeling crept back into my stomach. The nervous butterflies were flipping around as I walked toward the dining room to put lights onto the back deck. I turned on the lights, and the whole porch was illuminated. There was nothing there. I walked over to the door, and slid it open. Peeking my head outside, I looked left, and right. It was an overcast night, with no moon or stars. The feeling of being watched came back. There was nothing but cool air and darkness. Its probably a deer, I said aloud. Sometimes, just making a statement out loud can help if youre feeling delusional. I closed and locked the door to the deck, but left the light on. This day had been weird enough, and the only thing that was keeping me from being tired again was how hungry I was. I decided to make sure the front door was still locked. The keys were safely in my pocket. I approached the door, but thankfully I could already see the deadbolt was secured. I wanted to make sure the doorknob was locked in place, just for peace of mind. I reached for the switch on the handle when I heard three loud knocks. Buckets of ice replaced my blood as a cold wave washed over me from my ears to the pit of my stomach and down to my toes. I was locked in place, staring at the doorknob. A few seconds passed in sheer terror as I thought of the nearest thing I could use to defend myself. No one should be knocking on anyones door in this kind of a place at this time of night without a severely good reason. The knife was on the cutting board, and my bag was right next to the door. My hand was still a few inches away from the doorknob. I considered reaching out further to fully lock it, when I heard the voice. Im help, can you please? Lost.... It sounded like a female voice, but the words made no sense. I have played this frozen memory over in my head dozens of times, and Im sure this is what I heard. I didnt move, and I didnt respond. A few hours went by, but it couldnt have been longer than a fifteen-second pause. I heard two click-clacks on the stone outside the door, and then another three knocks. Softer this time. Please scared. Im so need lost. Im help. It was a little more desperate this time, and even more nonsensical. As soon as this event repeated itself, a little bit of clarity came to me. Hearing it the first time, I thought I was losing it. Now, I knew two things. Whatever was on the other side of the door wasnt my friend, and I wasnt moving except to get a weapon. I didnt want to give any sign that I could hear them, but somehow I knew it could sense my presence. So I stood as still as possible, feeling my heart pound in my chest while trying not to hyperventilate. My eyes widened as I heard more clacking of hooves on stone. It sounded like it had circled around itself, taking 5 or 6 steps. The dog next to its owner from earlier in the day flashed in my head for a second. Three more knocks. Urgent. Harder than the first time. Dont door. You can worry the open now. I started shivering a little as I heard this. It was in a different voice. A middle-aged mans voice. If I had to pee, I might have. My throat was bone-dry and I was heavily considering going for the knife. On the one hand, this confirmed my suspicion that what I was dealing might not be human. On the other hand, it made me wonder if there was more than one of them. I didnt have much time to ponder. The door frame shook as the intruder pounded on the door six times. I kept still, feeling like I was freefalling into the bottomless pit of own my gut. Only I can cut through the woods, *you* cant. As these sounds entered my ears I let out an audible gasp, then choked on my own throat. It was a childs voice, a little boy. As I tried to recover, it responded to my tell by pounding and scraping on the door, seemingly trying to get in any way it could now that it knew I was there. I fell to my knees in shock, just staring at the door with tears in my eyes like a dazed idiot. The whole house seemed to shake as the door was nearly beaten down. Out of nowhere, it all came to a halt. All I could hear was an unending string of intermittent screeches as it clattered away from the house. I caught a glimpse of it through a side window as it sprinted away, the screeching pounding in my ears. Whatever it was, it was very large. I was doubtful a knife would have helped me much if it had gotten through the door. And still the screeching continued. I was certain it must have been some otherworldly entity to be able to project sound at such a distance, until I looked over at the kitchen and saw smoke billowing out of the pan on the stove. The smoke alarm was going off. I sighed relief and almost smiled to myself. I never expected one to save me like that. I had been visualizing the exact position of the knife while standing there in terror, but my eyes had been locked on the door the entire time. I let the alarm go on for some time, hoping it would keep that thing at bay. I removed the pan from the heat (with a potholder, of course) and carefully poured more oil in the pan to cool it all down. Eventually, I turned off the oven and the alarm. I wasnt hungry anymore. I switched on a ceiling fan and every light in the house. I then went back and locked the doorknob switch, and proceeded to lock every window I could find. I found the only bedroom with an inward-swinging door, and placed a chair from the dining room in it. I thought about calling the cops, but I didnt have service and there was no landline or internet in the house. What would I even tell them? I was thoroughly freaked out, but I knew I could only do so much. I resolved to leave at first light, even if it was just for some motel where there was less chance of being torn to shreds by some unknown, voice-changing, behooved creature of the night. I kept the knife beside me and stayed in the bedroom with the door secured by the chair. I didnt feel safe, but I did feel like I had exhausted my options for maintaining safety. If it could get through all this, I probably was never meant to make it anyways. I brought a journal up here, too. To write down everything that happened as its fresh in my head, and to give me something to do instead of sleeping. I cant sleep here knowing that thing is out there. As I said, Ive replayed what happened at that door at least a hundred times in my head. I was close to drifting off around 3am when I finally realized what got me so twisted up the last time I heard it speak or whatever it was doing that sounded like human voices. Only I can cut through the woods, *you* cant. It was in a childs voice. It sounded at first like it was a warning, and I thought I was hearing it because it had seen me earlier, trespassing in its territory. But as I heard it for the hundredth time in my head, I realized I had familiarity with both the words and the voice. Someone had said that to me before."
70,vulnerability,nosleep,THE GIRL BLED ANTS,17,cs06cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cs06cj/the_girl_bled_ants/,2019-08-18 21:38:42,"THE GIRL BLED ANTS By Akash Kumar &amp;#x200B; Everything began with an itch. And the itch that would mark the beginning of something very horrifying, for the first time began, when Garima Verma sat in an extremely interesting chemistry class (for her, that is) and listened to the tall, middle aged, female teacher recite how Bohr had failed to represent the correct model of an atom. Cruel summers had its tentacles deep inside everyones mind, and the bodies responded with troubled and uncomfortable sweat. Fans were of little help. As she sat there, on the second row second bench with Jyotsna her hot shot best friend, there was a sudden, a very intense sensation in her left leg, a little below the knee. She sure wouldve ignored it if she could but the sensation was actually so sudden and intense that, her reflex action came into play, and she quickly itched the urge away. Even while at it her eyes never left the black board. There was a reason why shed never scored less than ninety five percent marks in her life. A little shadow of the tingling, itching sensation still remained even after her fingers had finished scratching the skin, but somewhat lucky for Garima, she was too focused on what the teacher spoke to notice it. For now. Jyotsna, who sat with Garima, was a girl with curves; certainly not grades. As if there was something her sexy wavy hair, and juicy curves couldnt buy, and better grades could; god help the world. Just a moment or two before Garima itched her leg, Jyotsna sat examining her her long grown finger nails (only the middle ones were kept short, and some boys knew why), painted in matte black shade. She thought about how her fingers would look so better in shining black instead. She thought she knew what she had to do later that evening: get the goddamn nail paints changed. It was funny how people didnt get the difference between shades of colours that stood out like black did over white. If only these people actually understood- That was when a sudden hiss of annoyance escaped her partners lips. Jyotsnas head turned quickly and just in time to notice Garimas hand go down to one of her legs and itch down there very vigorously. She could actually hear the nails (that were devoid of any sort of nail paint, though a little grown out), eroding the skin of her legs. The scratch scratch scratch scratch that somehow seemed to be screaming. Her own finger nails forgotten, Jyotsnas brows were ceased in a frown when the bell rang, and marked the ending of another day of school. If asked to, Garima wouldnt have minded sitting that chemistry class for a million hours. But the bell rang; it goddamn always did. And as it did, all the notebooks smacked closed and loudly enough for the teacher whod been in a mid sentence to stop and go out of the class, rubbing her hands together to get the itchy chalk powder off. Quietly closing her neat notebook, Garima stood up. And a ring, that no one else heard echoed out in her ears, her eyes watered and everything went dizzy for a moment. The pain down in her left leg was almost unbearable. Its suddenness probably had a big role in making it so damn painful. She gave out a shrill, but a controlled cry, and sat down as swiftly as she had stood up. Oye kya hua? Jyotsna exclaimed, alert,Garima are you alright? But Garima was too invested looking down at her leg to give back a response. Right where she had itched just a few minutes ago (something she wouldnt even remember doing) was a maroon spot. Around three inches in diameter, and throbbing out pain like heart pumped blood. Cautiously, she poked the strange spot expecting another twinge of pain. But nothing came. When she touched the spot, it was as if she was touching just another patch of her skin, maybe just coloured differently. She frowned, troubled. What was this now? Garima, are you going to say something? Jyotsna said, even though she had noticed the small maroon patch. I dont know yaar! This weird spot- Accha leave it! Im thinking of changing nail, still black, but a different shining shade, what do you say? Garima only gave her friend a tired smile at that. The bus was a huge chaos of noise, and laughter and cries. No the hell one paid any attention to Garima and her soon to be troubled face. Quiet people were not worthy of attention. So the second itch sensation hammered through her leg when she sat in her school bus, quietly staring out of the window. It was poetic to watch all these people some in rags some in suits, the cars, the rickshaws. It was really nice. It gave you a break from all the kids, even older ones, shouting their damn asses off. Something was moving down on her leg. Something that probably belonged to arthropoda phylum of animal kingdom. And as these thoughts formed completely in her head, the maroon epicenter on her leg sent out another and a hugely powerful wave of a sensation, that translated to: SCRATCH MEEEEEEEEEEEEE. If told to put in a hierarchy, she surely wouldve put the second wave of the itch a lot higher than the first one. This time she did gasp. This time she did look down when she scratched. And when she did, she saw a small ant was making her way down that condemned spot. Confused somewhat, she picked it up, pinching it between her index finger and the thumb, and quite enjoying as the little thing struggled for life and then stayed still. She threw the bug away and continued to scratch for a little more while. And this time her nails did come out with blood in between them. And when she had put her fingers away, the tingling had stayed a lot longer than it had, the first time. Like something teasing. The worst part? There was no chemistry class here to distract her attention. It was a Wednesday. No maths tuition today. She reached her apartment, on the seventh floor of the building called Bhagirathi. Her mother was out at her usual Wednesday's after school kitty party. It was good. She certainly did not have the best mother and daughter relation with her mother; there was something cold between them. Her father whom she did love, was off on some official tour to Rajesthan. Fishing out the keys out of her bag she swiped with her right shoe on the weird spot that had suddenly appeared. The spot was teasing and making her feel uncomfortable. She unlocked and went in, closing the door behind her. It was three right now,and her mother wouldnt return before six. Three whole hours of pure peace. She had washed, changed and laid down comfortably on her bed with a sigh. She did feel hungry, but it was a Wednesday and she was supposed to cook for herself (if she wanted to eat). But it was not in the kitchen she was best at. She preferred to stay empty stomach. She did not have a phone, her mother had made sure of that. Though she had her novel, and that was good enough. But she surprised herself when she found herself staring at the maroon spot, her hair now open, hung down her both cheeks. The gross thing actually seemed to be growing and moreover something was tingling; fucking moving in there. That thought sent strange crawls down her back. The light maroon shade seemed to have darkened considerably and was on the darker side of the shade now. Though in a little pain, she was more curious than anything. That was when she did something shed pay a very high amount for. With the long nail of her index she gave the maroon spot thing just one humble single scratch. And then it was exactly like lighting the wick of an atomic bomb (figuratively). Only this wick was one scratch long, and the bomb imploded immediately. The metaphorical explosion took place with dreadful suddenness and the mushroom clouds of tears formed stung through her eyes, and she screamed. The radiation was yet to come into play. The pain right there on the spot was excruciating. Not just pain, the demand to scratch, just once more, increased again. No doubt even higher than the second itch break. Her scream was more of panic and fear than pain. The movement under the maroon spot was unmistakable now. She scratched. No excuses; she couldnt help it. There was a necessity to. Shed have died there screaming if she hadnt scratched. The pain, the urge would have killed her, she subconsciously was sure of it. So she scratched again. And again. And she screamed. The pain increased with each passing second, but so did the need to scratched. The NECESSITY to scratch. With each scratch, her nails dug deeper and deeper into the soft tissue of her neat waxed legs skin. Now she was using both her hands and all her fingers had blood in then. Quite a lot of it. Her toes pained in black, were like unaware neighbours, too busy watching the cricket match, to notice the robbery next door. Only this wasnt robbery; this was straight up murder. Or suicide. She was now screaming frantically. Sobs, moans and continuous cries escaped her lips as all ten of her fingers dug at the evil epicenter. Only when she thought it couldnt get worse, something poked through her skin. From the Inside. Something buggish. At first she was too surprised to react, or even to recognise. And then it hit into place. It was an ant. Almost blinded by the surprising cameo of the ant her hands left the spot with a shriek. She stood up, and screamed twice looking at the spot. She lifted her naked foot and bought it down with blurring speed. The tiled floor under her feet rattled. And so did the windows. It was no help. Moaning she noticed as the ant (at least half an inch long) struggled out of her skin. It was caked in her blood. And soon as it fell on the floor, another one followed. From the inside. Out of the same epicenter that had now become a hole. Screaming and crying, the girl ran to the kitchen. Itches at times, can make you helpless. &amp;#x200B; Sujata Verma was in one of her kitty parties. Mostly unknowingly she held a vulnerable position on the precipice of chaos and well, a kitty party. But her vulnerability certainly went in vain. Daughters or kitty parties? A very stupid question. She liked the kitty party way better. Sure she did. The room just so accurately cold under the air conditioner smelled of strong, horny womens perfume. A smell that could easily water a mans mouth. And the women in the room, around eight in total, burst out laughing. Although Sujata Verma (certainly the poor girl in pains mother) was a woman of very strict disciplines (usually known as sali bhosdiwali, by the students of the school in which she taught Social Sciences) discipline was the last word in her mind while she was in one of her kitty parties. Mrs Singhal, a woman still in lusty shape even after forty five, had just made a joke about her husband. To be particular about an organ of his, Indian parents dont usually talk about in front of their kids. And the joke was funny. A hell lot. Funny jokes or not, Sujata did not make any lunches on Wednesdays. It was not an option; it was a fucking rule. If Garima needed something to eat, she better cook it for herself. Let the stupid, tainted, daddys girl learn some useful stuff. Suddenly the women roared with laugher again; Sujata had no idea why and for a moment she held a stupid confused expression on her double chin face, but then she laughed too. The thought of her daughter did not cross her mind again. When people around you laughed, there was no problem following the lead. And while you laughed, you tried not to think of bullshit. Eh Sujata, tu bata! Bhaiya toh still looks like the one who could make the bed groan. Can make a woman groan! It was Mrs Jindal. The fat woman with lagging breasts who still thought of herself to be Katrina Kaif. And every woman burst out laughing at that. For a few moments, Sujata played the innocent areh-kya-bolu-main-ab but then she laughed heatedly again. And then she started sensing how good he was in bed. The talk in the group suddenly changed to Mrs Singhals trick to have perfectly shaped breasts. But Sujata thought of the stuff she would be doing later tonight with Vikrant and smiled a secret smile that no other woman in the room noticed. Sujata felt good. &amp;#x200B; She was back in her room, sitting as a giant in between a little crowd of miniature creatures seen as six discarded, empty and uncapped fridge bottles. A pool of warming ice water formed down on the floor, beside her dangling legs. The spot on her calf seemed to be burning; from the inside. She held another a of fridge bottle (certainly the last one filled) in her right hand and a weathered kitchen knife with a red handle lay mischievously beside her. She poured the icy water from the fridge bottle down onto the spot that had now become a wound. An infected wound. Hell, a wound infected not with virus or with bacteria. This wound right here, ladies and gentlemen, was infected with fucking ants. The water fell and chilled her leg and made uncomfortable splashing sounds. Her cry was audible over the troubled splashing of the cold water. Cries nearly hysterical. Of course they were. More and more ants crawled out of the hole, somehow they seemed to be enjoying the fresh bath of cold water. How nice would it be to bathe in water, after being drenched in goddamn blood. Almost heaven. The hole itself had now opened half an inch in diameter. With the same index finger that had initiated this process, she widened the hole in her leg, as if to provide the ants with a wider gateway. The pain there was hot as fire; and it hurt likewise. And as the hole widened more, more ants crawled out. The ants crawled out like maggots over a corpse. Maybe thats what she now was. And infected corpse, alive because of the fuel of ants. The fresh wave now made her shriek louder. And then the last bottle ended. But itchy army did not. Thrice she dug her nails into wound and scratched. Helpless, she was left with not other choice. She had to use the knife. &amp;#x200B; Come on, food can wait some. Are you sure money can? Hahhahha, greedy little wily arent you Sujata? Some laughed (Sujata certainly did), some didnt, but the point was no one protested for playing a game of tambola before ordering the lunch. Sujata had not expected any argument but Shalini always had something unexpected to come up with. It was only those two, others, Nilima for instance was clicking an odd selfie and Dipti was busy on her phone, paid no heed to the conversations. She was too engaged zooming into a photo of Sujata Vermas husband, Raghuveer. The man was hot. So it was the game of tambola that was decided to be played first. Tambola: just a womans form of respected gambling, played instead on a board and a hundred plastic pieces. As the game began; the expressions underwent changes. The expressions on all their faces changed as did the colours and patterns of their sarees day after day. It was excited a second, then anxious the next. Tambola was an uncertain game and the uncertainty reflected clearly on those sly faces. Rather frequently someone would crack a joke and everyone would laugh. But now there was moment of nervous silence. The only sound that was heard now, was Mrs Murti calling out the numbers in her raspy voice. Light, dry spittle stuck on her red lips. Nine-Five, Ninety Five. Sujata struck out the number. Six-Two, Sixty Two. Sujata struck out another. With each passing number Sujata felt better and better and better (it was better you felt when uncertainty could help you make money). Sujata if you win, youre paying for the lunch haan? She wasnt sure if it was a joke. The lunch was brought with shared money. The money she won was hers. Hatt sali! But she gave a forced smile anyway so as not to sound too rude. No one spoke next and after several moments, Sujata she was the one who broke the silence as she nearly cried her ass out when she won the full house bid. The disappointment on other faces was notable. And not as notable was the bad word Mrs Murti muttered under ther breath. Tbe full house was worth twenty four fucking hundred rupees! Now that was some money. Receiving the money she felt sad she ever had to go home (but then there was Vikrant to go home for). She wished for the evening to go on and on, for the tambola game to go on and on. At least twenty four hundred more tambola games. Out of nowhere she suddenly wondered if she even loved her family. She dismissed the thought and waited for the game to end, so she could persuade others to play couple others before the lunch. Gambling was, she realised, one hell of a drug. Though she could not explain to herself the frown that had ceased her trimmed eyebrows. &amp;#x200B; She did not scrape the burning wound with the knife. She stabbed it. And she bled when she stabbed her calf. She bled ants. And she screamed. She took out the knife out of the seemingly paralyzed gaping hole and stabbed it thrice more. The world was out of focus. There were two things that mattered any longer. It was she herself and her fucking leg. Dark blood gushed out as she decided she had to do. She had to amputate her own leg. The necessity left her with no choice. She dug the knife deep into the soft flesh of the lower calf, and started sawing. The blood poured out like viscous water from a dysfunctional fountain. The pain was like small razor sharp teeth biting in there. Or maybe razor sharp stings. Stinging and nibbing, stinging and nibbing She was hysterical and shouted like some chained lunatic in an asylum as she continued the sawing. She had to get her leg off the chains that bound her to the ants. With the goddamn blunt kitchen knife. &amp;#x200B; When luck was not enough, it was greed that always worked. Sujata put forward the word of money again and each and every woman agreed for another game of tambola (before the lunch). Sujata relied on luck, which in her case was a strong staff that could hold her weight easily enough. The changing expression scene, was repeating itself fantastically. You wouldve been in for a strong deja vu had you been in that room. Seven-Nine, seventy nine. Sujata crossed out a number. Mrs Murti whispered something into Mrs Jindals ear. Mrs Jindal muttered back a reply shaking her head in a dissatisfied manner. No one paid any attention. Eight-Six, eight six. Sujatas heart was in a race now. Zero-One, one, Alright bitches. Sujata shrieked out again when she won the second full house of the day. She was sure thered no more games today, but almost five thousand was money enough for a day. Money enough. Her daughter shrieked too(though at a different place). &amp;#x200B; Both women shrieked, alright. Though for a little different reasons. &amp;#x200B; THE END."
71,vulnerability,nosleep,My anger was surgically removed,902,cspsv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cspsv4/my_anger_was_surgically_removed/,2019-08-20 10:04:01,"I have a temper. I hate it. It boils beneath my skin and I shatter with the slightest injury. My poison consumes every relationship I have, damaging the ones it doesnt kill outright. Finally, I hit a point where I was *done* with it, when I found myself staring in the mirror and hating the person I saw. My temper turned on myself and I punched the glass, not caring if it shattered, thinking I *deserved* it if I did, that maybe *I* should hurt because of my actions for once. The mirror did not shatter and looking back, Im thankful for that. But the pain in my knuckles brought me back to myself and I sat down at the computer and found a therapist that would take my insurance and scheduled an appointment. It worked a little, but slowly, and I began to grow agitated during our sessions. I felt helpless when my anger tore free, like I was merely an observer watching some horrific stranger act out my part. My therapist kept reminding me that this took time and I told her that I needed help *now*, that this was going to affect my career if it kept up. She gave me a referral to a local doctor. Ill call him Dr. Coe. He had an unconventional treatment, she said, one that yielded quick results. Shed referred other patients to him and theyd always returned with marvelous changes. I called his office and the receptionist scheduled an appointment. I could at least hear him out, I thought. Dr. Coes office was sedately boring, located in a cluster of other medical offices on the edge of an upscale suburb. The interior was like every other doctors office, save for the paintings. Instead of flowers or puppies or inspirational sayings, the walls were hung with abstract canvases, streaked with jagged swathes of color. Reds and black and oranges - aggressive, primal colors that demanded the viewers attention. I tore my eyes from them and focused on checking in with the receptionist. She took my name and then directed me back to Dr. Coes office. This surprised me. No wait. How many doctors - specialists, no less - had no wait? The receptionist led me to a spacious office near the back corner of the building. The window was curtained, blocking out the sunlight and giving the room the intimate feel of a library. I absently lowered my voice as I introduced myself. Dr. Coe was younger than I expected, perhaps in his mid-thirties, dressed in a crisp charcoal button-down under a white labcoat. He came around the desk and shook my hand. His grip was strong and his palm felt weathered. He wore glasses and I caught glimpses of a sharp, calculated gaze from behind the lenses. He asked that I sit at some plush chairs in one corner, beside a round coffee table. A slightly more informal setting than the narrow wooden chairs in front of his desk. My chair was positioned so that it faced a painting on the wall near the door. It was rendered in grayscale, vertical streaks that reached almost to the top of the canvas, irregular and tilting to one side. What do you see? Dr. Coe asked, noticing what I was looking at. A dead city, I said, startled by my response. Dr. Coe raised an eyebrow and I felt compelled to continue. I explained in awkward, stumbling phrases that I saw the dark outlines of the buildings reaching for the edge of the canvas like fingers, but there was no light in those solid streaks of paint, only the vacant shells of long-abandoned structures. Everyone sees something different, Dr. Coe said pleasantly. Thats what I like about it. Most people find it unsettling and perhaps that isnt what you would expect out of a medical office - but youre not here to be reassured, are you? Youre here to be *cured.* I felt something inside me unknot. I laughed weakly, surprised by the relief flooding me. He understood. He wasnt going to tell me that I just had to *try* harder or that change took time or any other empty platitudes. He was going to address my desperation. His procedure removed unwanted personality traits, he explained. It was part medicine and part something else. I scoffed instinctively at this and he only gave me a thin smile and slid a sheet of paper over to me. References, he said. People that have been in my situation. I could call any of them. It was a long list. I hesitated to take it. He understood my skepticism, he said. He told me to go home and think about it. Call every name on that list if I wanted to. If I decided to go ahead with the procedure, I could call the receptionist and make an appointment for the pre-surgery consultation. I didnt know what to think of it all. Some alternative medicine garbage, I reasoned, and I took the list and left. It sat on my kitchen counter for a few days before I bothered to call any of the numbers listed. I called the first on a whim, thinking Id see how ridiculous this was. A woman picked up and after I told her why I was calling, she began to gush about how Dr. Coe had gotten rid of her paranoia and how much *better* her life was now. I called another and they told me that their jealousy was gone. Someone else was free of their anxiety. And so on and so on. Dozens of people, all telling the same story of how they didnt believe him at first but were desperate enough to try anything. Miraculous results, they all said. I went through the entire list and then I sat there on my sofa for a long time. Too many people to be hired actors. Too much genuine emotion in their stories to be fakes. Dr. Coe had discussed cost with me in our brief meeting. The procedure was not covered by insurance and it would be around six-thousand dollars. I had the money in savings, but it was still a lot to pay. Im a skeptical person. Yet the more I dug, the more it started to seem like the reasonable choice. Dr. Coes credentials checked out. He was a neurosurgeon, still licensed to practice, and had extensive experience in his field before starting his own office. I couldnt find any record of him appearing before the medical board for improper conduct of any kind. I wrestled with it for days and then finally, I called his office and scheduled a surgery date and a consultation. There was again no wait when I went in to discuss the procedure with him. He said this was because he understood people were coming to him with delicate problems and wanted to ensure patient privacy. He scheduled a buffer, he said. He wasnt like *other* doctors that merely tried to process as many people as they could in a day. His voice was low and scornful. Then he explained that hed done a little research on my situation. He already knew my name, but now he knew my address, where I worked, and many other minute details of my life that he had no right to know. I felt cold and afraid when he finished reciting them, a precise summation of who I was, delivered with ruthless efficiency. I could only stare at his face, stunned, fixated by the calculating gaze that had lost all of its prior warmth. There are irregularities in how I conduct my practice, he said after a long moment of silence. I like to be certain that my clients are genuine and *committed*. Then he smiled, his expression softened, and he gently told me that there was nothing to be afraid of, that the procedure was safe and effective. Its hard to explain why I trusted him. It felt like Id passed some sort of test just to be here. It made me feel special. And more, Dr. Coe exuded confidence and authority, a soft sort of charisma that made me feel safe. Im sure youve met these kinds of people before. There were glimpses of cunning as well, when I caught him studying me from across the desk - but even then, I felt that I was *meant* to see that, like he was allowing me a brief look at who he was and that rare vulnerability put me even more at ease. Perhaps I was being manipulated but Im still not certain if I made a mistake in trusting him. I balked only when he explained that I would be put under twilight sedation. Ive not had very many medical procedures and I confessed that I was frightened, when he paused and asked if something was wrong. There would be a nurse present, he said, and while it was not explicitly stated I understood that this was meant to reassure me that I would not be left alone with him while under sedation. Moreover, twilight sedation was a gentle form of sedation, commonly used in small surgeries, and did not require intensive monitoring. Itd be dosed in ten minute increments and all he had to do to bring me out of it was to stop giving it to me. One thing I need to know, he said, looking at me from over the rim of his thin glasses. Your anger. Where do you feel it? My chest, I told him. In the middle, near the top of my sternum. It felt like I was suffocating under its weight. Then the procedure will be a small incision in that spot, he said. Perhaps an inch, at most. Itll barely leave a scar. His receptionist was waiting outside. I filled out some paperwork, was given a packet of instructions, and paid in advance. The surgery was scheduled for a week out and there would be a follow-up a week later. Plenty of time to arrange for time off work and for someone to drive me home. I prepared carefully the morning of the procedure, as Id been instructed. I wore loose, comfortable clothing. A friend drove me. I didnt tell her much about it and she didnt ask questions. When we arrived, the receptionist told me to head back to Dr. Coes office. My friend sat down and began to read her book. Dr. Coe stood as I entered. He looked unhappy. I tried to call earlier, he said. My nurse isnt available today. I glanced down at my phone - one missed call. I silently cursed my negligence. We can reschedule, of course, he continued, turning his attention to the computer screen. The procedure *is* simple enough that one person can manage it, but I do recall that you were nervous about being sedated Its fine, I said abruptly. This was stupid, I thought. He had impeccable references. Id already made so many arrangements to make this work. And more - I felt like if I backed out now, I wouldnt ever come back. My heart hammered in my chest and he stared at me across the desk, his eyes narrowing as he studied me intently. Gauging my conviction. All right, he finally said, and he closed the laptop. Honestly, all she really does is keep an eye on the timer and add another increment of the sedation. He led me to another room further down the hallway. A small changing room with a locker for my belongings. Id need to wear a hospital gown, he explained, but I could leave my sweatpants on. I changed, put my clothing in the locker, and then returned to the hallway. He led me to the last room in the building. It was long, lined with countertops and cabinets, with two medical examination chairs in the middle - the sort youd see at a dentist. I frowned at the two of them and he just smiled and explained that the room was originally divided into two, but hed wanted more space and just hadnt had the other chair taken out yet. Reassured, I took a seat in the one on the left as he directed while he prepped the IV. There was nothing unusual in the procedure. At least, not at first. He put the IV in, started the saline, and then talked me through the initial sedation. Like falling asleep, he said. Thats all. And it was. But I remember a brief moment - of being aware of the lights overhead - and realizing that the sedation was wearing off. It was strange, though, because while I was *aware*, I didnt feel anything, and I didnt seem to *care*. I wasnt frightened or upset. I simply existed there in that chair with the light shining on my face. I turned my head slightly - and it was so hard to move - and then I saw the other chair. There was someone in it. Another person. Plastic tubing stretched between us, held in place on their chest by thin clamps around the edges of an open incision on their sternum. Then Dr. Coe flickered into view, I watched as his hands delicately manipulated the IV line, and then I was gone again. My friend took me home and made sure I was comfortable on my sofa. She put some pillows behind my back, saying that Dr. Coe had briefed her and that I should stay elevated for twenty-four hours and then sleep on my back for a few days after that. Then she left me to nap, because Id already proven that I could drink on my own without being sick, and when I woke up next I felt drowsy but that was all. There were bandaids over the veins on both arms and a line of thin, dissolvable stitches along my chest. I was to change the bandage for a few days and then leave it uncovered. I felt noticeably calmer in the days that followed. I began to be hopeful that whatever Dr. Coe had done had *worked* and I was rid of that part of myself that I hated. This was good, Dr. Coe said at the follow-up a week later. Everything was going well. He explained that there would be some side-effects of the procedure. I might have moments of intense anger, but they wouldnt be like the ones from before. Id feel different during them, as if it wasnt *my* anger I was feeling, and I would be able to control it easier. Those would diminish in time and after six months Id be completely free of them. I thought about what Id seen while under sedation, but I didnt ask him what it was. I wasnt certain of my own memories, as drugged as I was at the time, and he was so in control of the appointment that I didnt dare deviate from his script. He noticed my hesitation, however, and told me I could always call with questions. Weeks passed. I began to have the flashes of anger that Dr. Coe warned me about. The first one hit while I was making dinner and I turned the heat on the stove off and stood there, staring at the wall, stunned by the mindless fury that boiled inside my chest. It felt remote, however. Detached. Like I was observing it without fully feeling it, like Id been cut off from my own emotion. I blinked. There was a brief impression of an image, of a wooden wall, rough and unpainted. These episodes continued. Perhaps two to three times a day, lasting only a few seconds. The rest of the time I was free from my anger and I felt considerably more relaxed. I interacted with the people around me easier and my coworkers noticed and even commented on how much happier I seemed. I began to keep my eyes closed when that strange, foreign anger came. I saw the wall, again and again, and sometimes a dirt floor. Then, one day while I sat at my desk at work, I saw something different. I felt like I was looking *up* now, as someone stood over me. I stared into Dr. Coes face, impassionate, remorseless - and he reached for me with one hand. My eyes snapped open. My heart pounded as the anger fled. I called his office. Said there was something wrong. He called me back within an hour. Im seeing things, I told him. Thats not an uncommon side-effect, he replied calmly. Itll pass along with the other emotions. I wasnt ready to be dismissed so easily. Theres something else. During the surgery I think I woke up and I saw a person next to me. A long pause. My heart beat rapidly, afraid of how he would react. I was glad we were doing this over the phone. I couldnt shake that brief impression I had of his face, terrifyingly dispassionate. All part of the procedure, he sighed. I was slow in administering the next dose of sedation. I apologize. Those images youre seeing? Its of the interior of a barn. Ill give you the address. Be there at seven tonight and Ill explain the rest of the procedure. Am I really safe from you? I whispered. Its the only way youre going to get answers, he replied and his tone was cold. Then he hung up. I went. Im still not certain I can explain why. Curiosity, I suppose, and a reckless belief that Dr. Coe *couldnt* harm me in any way, not without jeopardizing his practice. That perhaps this all would have a rational, reasonable explanation. The address hed given me over the phone led to a house well outside the city. It was surrounded by fields and a line of trees, isolated from the main roads and the neighbors. The house itself was large and well-maintained. Dr. Coe was clearly doing well for himself. The barn hed told me about was further back behind the house and the driveway split off into a dirt path leading up to its doors. Dr. Coe stood outside, dressed casually in jeans and a t-shirt. It felt strange to see him like this. Come inside, he said as I approached, cracking one of the doors enough for a person to slip through. Stay near the center of the barn, okay? He went in first. The interior was well-lit from large fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling. The floor was packed dirt, swept clean of debris. There was a strange, medical smell in the air, a chemical scent with not a hint of must. Dr. Coe led me towards the middle of the barn, past the lines of horse stalls on either side. I briefly stood on tiptoes as we passed one and inside I saw dark stains splattering the floor and walls. I almost fled. But then Dr. Coe told me to come look inside one. Just up to the wall, he said. Its safe so long as I didnt enter the stall. I was inside. Or rather, something that looked exactly like me, down to the birthmark on my arm. Naked and snarling in anger, lips peeled back, eyes wide and focused like some feral beast. Her wrists were restrained with heavy chain, bolted to the wall behind her. Her hands curled like claws and she made guttural noises in the back of her throat, muscles shivering. Her skin was pale and her frame emaciated. Its not human, Dr. Coe said, coming to stand next to me. Her eyes flickered to him and remained fixed there. Its a physical manifestation of what I removed from your soul. Since I took your anger, well, thats why it looks so angry. You created this doppelganger? I whispered. Yes. I told you, I use both medicine and something else to achieve my results. I created the frame in advance of your appointment and then turned it into *you* with a sample of your blood during the procedure. Then I transferred your anger to it. I thought of the tubes stretching to its chest and of the incision in my own, just over the sternum, where I said Id felt my anger. Whats going to happen to it? I let it mature for a period of about six months, which should be enough time for you to stop having flashbacks to the part of you that was removed. Then I kill it. How? I couldnt help but ask. I wasnt sure I wanted to know, but I felt like I couldnt stop now. Pandoras box was open and I had to see this through. I starve them to death, he said calmly. I felt I could drown in his words. His confidence was soothing. It was all that was keeping me from fleeing in terror. They suffer, of course, he continued, but its an easier process on the patient. Your anger will weaken gradually and by the time it dies, youll barely notice. Please keep in mind that it is *not* human. It isnt really sentient. Its just your anger. Thats all. I asked if all of those stalls were designed to hold these things while they matured. He said that they were. And that stall? I asked, pointing back towards the entrance. The one with the blood? Ah. That. A rueful smile. Well, that one is the reason I need a new nurse. I swallowed hard. They were - unfortunately - dangerous, he continued. Any extreme of emotion could erupt into violence, especially the negative ones that his clients were trying to rid themselves of. Then he asked if I had any further questions in a prim sort of finality that indicated that he was quite done with having me here. Thats it? I asked, incredulous. Youre just letting me leave, after showing me this? A look of annoyance crossed his face. Good luck getting the police to investigate me, if thats what youre thinking, he said tersely. Besides - didnt I help you? Didnt my procedure make your life *better*? Sometimes I stop and think that perhaps I should have done something at the time. Should have contacted the authorities and invented a lie that would have given them reason to search the barn. Yet Dr. Coe *had* helped me and so I kept silent and as time went on it became easier and easier to not do anything. Complacency is seductive. Yet I saw something that is making me reconsider. Six months are almost up. My doppelganger is going to die soon. Dr. Coe will starve her to death and while I keep reminding myself that I shouldnt feel sorry for something that isnt entirely alive, I cant help but think theres something wrong about this. Maybe that sympathy is why the episodes of anger arent dwindling away to nothing and why I keep seeing that barn stall where shes chained. Ive taken to closing my eyes and keeping them closed, trying to remain there as long as I can. Maybe Im keeping her company. Or maybe Im trying to understand how Dr. Coe has done this. Yesterday he came to her (me). He had gloves on and an empty IV bag. I watched as he knelt next to her and I felt her struggling. He reached for her, his expression remote and uncaring, just as it had been before. I felt his fingers on her (my) arm, felt them dig in and force it to be still. The bite of a needle and I watched the dark blood wind its way through the tubing and into that empty bag. I watched until it was full, watched him pull the needle and instead of gauze, he pressed his thumb over the vein. Her blood seeped slowly out and then stopped. He raised his hand, staring at the blood coating his glove, and then he licked it clean. His eyes closed. His face went slack and he shuddered minutely, as if in relief. Then he stood and walked away, taking the bag of blood with him, and then I was myself again and the barn was gone. The safest thing to do is to forget about that place. She will die soon and this will all be over. So Im posting this, perhaps to expunge it from my memories, and then Im going to pretend that I never met Dr. Coe and go on living my life and being happy with who I am now."
72,vulnerability,nosleep,"I'm A Warehouse Worker, Do Not Trust The Ambassador Posts.",17,ct34et,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ct34et/im_a_warehouse_worker_do_not_trust_the_ambassador/,2019-08-21 03:56:45,"Just call me a born whistleblower, I guess. Hell, Ive never been adept at keeping a secret for long. When my 14 year old brother smoked for the first time, 11 year old me couldnt help but tell my mom the moment she got home. He beat the shit out of me that night and broke my copy of Pokemon Stadium as punishment for being a fucking snitch. I didnt get gratification out of it, If thats what youre thinking. I wasnt some kind of snarky teachers pet who absolutely LOVED telling on people. I justthought it was the right thing to do, I guess. I knew right from wrong and I could never ignore that sense. If I tried, the compulsion manifested in physical ways; sweating, shifty eyes, slip of the tongueyou get the idea. Its important you understand that I get ZERO joy out of talking about this, all that matters is the message is passed on. I work in the packing department and have done so for nearly 7 years, the only reason I havent gone insane from the monotony or the sheer lack of sleep is my writing. But that doesnt change the fact that this job takes so much from you, more than I think most people realise or care to admit. We didnt notice the workload increase at first, it was insidious and steadily built so that it would only become an issue when we were too deeply entrenched. Maybe that way our spirits wouldnt break so quickly, I dont know. 10 hour shifts turned into 12 but with extra pay for those additional 2. Seemed fine, wed get an extra 20 minutes as per regulation and the later hours werent a big deal, so a lot of us signed up for it. Wed shoot the shit more and our managers werent too hard on us if the night time packing took a bit longer, provided we made the deadline for delivery drop. But it was when we moved to 17 hours a year and half later that things got worse. My colleague Benson died on a Thursday afternoon, hed been working for nigh on a month straight and his exhaustion levels were beyond anything we had seen, he'd been getting progressively worse not just because of the lack of sleep, but he had some kind of infection, he'd been assigned a corner section in the packing department and immediately behind him was a thick, black mould sprouting from the corner. At first, he'd given it no mind, but after a few days he began to feel dizzy, sick and unable to relax when he was resting. The man was getting an average of 4 hours sleep a night if that and it was showing after the first two weeks. By week three he was emaciated, his skin the colour of sallow milk and his eyes sunken. A few days before he died, he brought it up to our dayshift supervisor Marcel but hed just smirk, bring him in front of the team on break as if to embarrass him, declaring to us all that if he wanted out, he could leave. It was a tactic I became all too familiar with after the first outspoken voice rose up from the ranks before being promptly shut down, he began by pointing out to everyone the Tropicana Family House Rules on the poster above us: **First rule of The Tropicana Family: We never tire, we never falter, we never slumber.** *So our dear Benson has decided that hes BETTER than thisthan all of you! That hes too tired to keep doing this and would rather you all shoulder the burden.wellthe door is right there, Benson.* Hed declare, gesturing in a theatrical manner as he grinned at the exhausted middle aged man, his legs shaking and breathing increasingly shallow. *You can leave ANY time you wantof course* Marcel would pace around him as the rest of us watched, most too scared or tired to even respond, just thankful it wasnt us. He leaned in behind Benson, his face by his ear. *Your family will starve and youll die on the streets, unloved by your family at home and despised by your real family here for adding to their workloadand you wouldnt want to do that to them, would you Benson?* Bensons eyes widened and he stared straight ahead, Marcel chuckling as we shifted uncomfortably in our seats. *""No...but...I have a family...my wife is sick and I'm needed more at home...""* Benson croaked, his eyes struggling to stay focused. Marcel on the other hand sharpened his gaze. *""Benson,* ***we*** *are your family. Or did you forget everything we have done for you?""* *""No! Of course not..I just...""* Benson trailed off, knowing that the moment he replied he'd admitted defeat, coughing heavily as thick black mucus escaped his lungs. A product of the mould and spores near our work area, no doubt. This kind of hazing ritual was and still is common in Tropicana to dissuade any dissenting worker from walking away. *These walls have ears, Benson. Theres workers around every corner that report to me when a worker bee isnt pulling their weight, remember our rules.* He put his hand on Bensons shoulder, before walking off to his office. *Bees die if they go it alone, Benson. Theyre found in the corners of rooms on their backs and half eaten.* This is the trap they caught all of us in. If someone was unhappy, wed be greeted with that same sick smile. It was the same across the board with any of the higher ups. Their eyes would grow wide and say, as if on cue: Tropicana is a family, you dont just leave a family like that, do you? Benson didnt speak much after that. 3 days later we found him in the far corner of packing and shipping under a sea of boxes. Hed suffered a heart attack, fallen under the boxes and suffocated, his face etched in permanent horror, eyes dried out and seeping fluids as he was moved. Seeing him was traumatising, but not nearly as much as the aftermath. No sooner had the news came down, Marcel and who I assume was his area manager gave a short team talk at the end of that shift. They advised us that this situation was regrettable and that in addition to an internal investigation, we would be required to speak about our experiences as part of a company overhaul. They would provide us with Tropicana affiliated social media accounts and we could speak about our experiences here for the world to see with the more charismatic of us doing short videos on our time there. Im sure you all know where this is going. As soon as those videos got the slightest bit of traction (and its Tropicana so of course they did), the direction and narrative began to shift. Just like our work hours and policy on leaving, the shift towards the family dynamic took centre stage. Now, we had people outright spewing shit like robots with plaster smiles and frantic eyes about their wonderful times at Tropicana. The worst part is everyone thought that they were hiding the work hours or the treatment, but that wasnt it. They were suppressing something far more insidious. The workforce Tropicana keeps closest to its chest, the unseen family members. This leads me to why ive made this post in the first place, I suppose. I saw what theyre trying to hide and it was the last straw for me, I had to say something. I tried so hard to be a loyal worker in spite of everything becausewell what else could I do? Leaving was not an option financially or emotionally, so many of my friends worked here and would never forgive me if I left. Some time after Benson passed, I was working in the processing section, scanning items and making sure they were ready for the packaging members just a floor down. We were low on people are so many had been requested to film more material for the social media, Id somehow managed to keep mine to simple positive posts about the ease of tasks and not been bothered since. Marcel was even less creepy than usual, much more of a starer than a talker since Benson died, but the whole team had entered a kind of stoic silence and not snapped out of it yet Regardless, I zoned out during the midst of the task, as one tends to do when repeating the same thing over and overwhen something flittered across the corner of my eye. It was momentary, but it was there. The hairs on my arms stood up and I felt the immediate urge to turn around, as if I was being watched, but from every angle. The only thing I can equate it to is the sensation of being in the woods late at night and realising that while in a clearing, you are completely open to the elements and any other creature lurking in the shadows thats eagerly waiting for your neck to be exposed for more than a split second. It was total vulnerability and despite having colleagues just 50 feet away, I felt totally isolated. I steeled myself and remembered **The Second rule of The Tropicana Family:** **""We do it with a smile, no excuses.""** But no sooner had I recited the mantra to myself and allowed the corners of my face to race upwards into a grin were they swiftly smashed into a horrified frown as I saw a figure hunched over in the corner adjacent to me, weeping. At first glance, I would have been forgiven for thinking it was a giant naked mole rat. It was almost entirely hairless and naked, a tattered puce apron barely hiding its dignity. It stood on two emaciated legs, bones creaking and cracking under the pressure as they swayed ever so slightly, almost rhythmically. Where there should have been skin on the back were instead bulging, pulsating tumours, tendrils drilling under the skin and deep into the vertebrae, each pulse of the tumour causing a spasm in the creatures back, like a puppeteer pulling at the strings of a marionette. That intense moment of fear pulled my senses to a heightened state and I was able to hear more than just the sounds of weeping, I could make out mutteringfrantic muttering as the creature kept its back to me, swaying as it seemingly repeated the same thing over and over. Fear still ebbing through my body, I willed myself to step forward and try to talk to it. Curiosity was beginning to usher me closer and I could not resist the allure of something unknown, even if I felt it was outside of my understanding and my position. I took another step, the feeling of vulnerability increasing in intensity while the voice in my head screamed to keep going. I could smell petrichor on the creature and the word family clearly through the muttering. I was within arms reach, my instincts begging me to run but unable to do so, I was a man possessed by something beyond my rationality as I reached a hand out towards the creature in front of me. *Neverleavethe familydo we?* My hand froze, my eyes blurred and everything around me slowed as the creature in the corner turned and sense immediately returned to me like a sobering cold shower.Bensons malnourished corpse stood in front of me, eyeless and toothless, features stripped away and blackened leathery skin traipsed over it. He still stared right at me, his gaping maw of a mouth widening into a grin as his vocal chords croaked and the tumours shook. *Rule Number 4WeNever.LeaveThe Family* his jaw opening wider, the snapping sounds of his bones somehow moving beyond their limits as his left leg snapped back and found footing on the wall, pulling his contorted frame up like a cicada as he scurried off before I was able to react. I took a few moments, leaning against the wall where he once stood, to compose myself and figure out what the fuck I was supposed to do from here. Was thissomething I could talk about? I cast my mind back to the rules and remembered **Rule 6: We do not discuss our family with outsiders, lest we wish to seek punishment for ourselves.** If THAT was the punishmentwell I wanted to live a full life, so I immediately cast that aside. Taking a breath, I went to speak to Marcel in his office, hoping I could at the very least get some kind of answers. He was in the midst of filming a short video for his twitter when I entered, his face filled with unnatural glee. *Here with The Tropicana Family, I get to work with some of the most hardworking people imaginable for a great wage &amp; great benefits! Plus, the hours are flexible so I get to pursue my scientific endeavours outside of the family. If you have any questions, just AMA, thats what being an emissary manager is all about!* He signed off with a full toothed grin and a slight chuckle, but no sooner had the video ended had his demeanour shifted. He stared me down like a piece of meat as I sheepishly shuffled in. *Victor, to what do I owe the pleasure on your scheduled work time? Surely you dont intend to tell me youre sick, do you? His eyes narrowed, seeing my pale and sweaty facade. Did something happen?* I tried to find a way to find a better way to explain what happened, but in the heat of the moment and emotions still raised, I simply blurted it out: *I just saw some creature in the corner of my work area, he talked to me andcrawled up the wall away from me* I felt my face growing red and knew this could be dire for me. I had medical bills to pay for, a life to run and my team to support, what the fuck was I gonna do if I got fired? But Marcel didnt fire me. He didnt even say anything. He simply stared at me for a long minute before clasping his hands together, his unnatural smile returning. *Victor, how would you like to make some extra money and really help out the Tropicana Family?* He leaned in to study my reaction. But before I could reply, he handed me a worker phone with a new Tropicana Family Emissary account in my name uploaded and ready. *All you have to do is tell people how much you love working here, how many friends youve made, and* He was now kneeling in front of me, his hands squeezing mine as he pushed the phone towards me more. *And how our wonderful customers will soon reap the benefits of a new delivery system, all thanks to them.* His eyes widened and he pointed to the poster on the wall with our rules, his finger directed towards the **Third rule of The Tropicana Family: We listen intently to our customers needs and we will not stop listening until we know exactly what they want.** He looked back at me, hands shaking. *We will not stop listening. We never have. How else can we get them to trust The Tropicana Family? How else can we get them to buy more from us? Whatever it takes, Victor. These are the lengths we go to.* He got up, pushing a button in his office to signal that break time was imminent. No sooner had he done so that a sea of people shuffled towards the designated break rooms like drones, some nursing back injuries, others massaging headaches, all of them unified in a tidal wave of exhaustion at varying degrees. Marcel sent something out on his phone and immediately a cluster of the workers broke off and began tweeting incessantly on their phones, some filming short videos with fake smiles and zest before hunching over and hobbling to the break rooms out of sight. My phone began buzzing with notifications and when looking at my feed I realised these people had been tagging **me** in posts about work. *Emissary Victor is a phenomenal worker, he never ceases in his efforts to improve and is always looking out for us, a true spokesman of the common man in The Tropicana Family. - Tara: Tropicana Representative.* *Emissary Victor sees everything for what it is, hes a true man of the common people and hell do this job until the day he dies! Hes got nothing but good things to say about The Tropicana Family! - Donovan: Tropicana Representative.* *Emissary Victor is the reason I feel so comfortable being here every day and not using any unauthorised sick days. Seeing him come in rain or shine shows me I need to up my dedication to a family that has given SO much to me! - Mikhail: Tropicana Representative.* I stared, dumbfounded at the messages flooding my phone, before looking up at Marcel, expecting an answer. His hands were clasped in front of his smiling face. *You are the face of the common family now, Victor. They trust you and you would never want to do anything to let them down, would you? The same goes for our wonderful customers who will latch onto your every word!* He clapped his hands together. *Even* ***Benson****. Especially Benson and his very special part of our family.* My head hurt, my mouth was dry and my breath was hot in my lungs. I didnt understand what was going on, but from behind Marcel I could see what used to be Benson crawling up the side of the walls, his tattered apron stained in a thick fluid, everything but the Tropicana logo sullied. His neck snapped as he turned to face me and he grimaced, even without his eyes I could sense apprehension on his face. His arm snapped and reached down to pull up a motionless woman, exhausted and barely alive. With an effortless swipe he ripped off a throbbing tumour, shoving it into her mouth and holding her still as she convulsed. Eyes popping and her tongue enlarging before froth filled her mouth to the brim and her body fell limp. He muttered the same rule before tossing her body into the far corner, where it crashed and fell under innumerable boxes. He scurried off, still muttering *Nobody ever leaves The Tropicana Family*, and even as the cracking of his bones faded, my head was still pounding. I swallowed the bile in the back of my throat as the realisation swept over me. *What do I need to do, Marcel?* Marcels lips curled. *Victor I realise your job is mainly in shipping so I will make this as relevant as I can: we estimate $300 million worth of items are lost in click and collect purchases due to never being picked up and...we feel there is an opportunity in front of us to kill two birds with one stone. You will be instrumental in ensuring that.* He pointed at my phone, specifically at the note app. *All you have to do is sound the alarm and rally the cause, we will tak care of the rest. We know how you enjoy your writing and this* he threw his arms out dramatically again, his Tropicana family pin on his lapel shining *well this is your big break!* *I dont understand, why on Earth would you have me share something like this? Not a soul will believe it and it will break every rule we have! I dont want to lose my job, I dont want to end up likelike* I couldnt bear to finish it. *Thats the point! Dont you see? We need you to construct a story thats farfetched and ridiculous to mask the mundane unpleasantness, put those skills to good use while we simultaneously have our own people promote the positives of working here!* He patted me on the shoulder, his Tropicana logo apron shining down on me, mocking me. *Now be a good lad and go back to your workstation and get to writing while I take care of poor Judiths situation, I cant believe weve had another heart attack...poor little bee* He moved away to his desk and signalled for people to check over in the far corner where a motionless 47 year old Judith Burns was laying, the third worker that month to collapse from heart failure brought on by exhaustion. So, here we are, back to me blowing the whistle, as it were. Warning you all of what goes on here. Im sorry to say that it was me or you and after seeing Benson &amp; Judith, I chose me. Except, thats the kicker, isnt it? You **ALL** know and yet youll continue to buy from us, continue to make sure we have plenty of work and more Bensons &amp; Judiths for decades to come. After all, were one of the largest companies in the world now. See, its not about the devices listening in on your every conversation, you already knew and let it happen, isnt that strange? This is something a little more innocuous you give virtually no thought to. Our rules are simple but effective, we obey them and we're kept in line. You, our loyal customers, have your needs and desires, but you stick with us regardless, don't you? You see the news articles exposing all the inconsistencies on our workplace ethics, how our environments are so unsanitary that spores have been growing on our pickers and infecting them, our devices listening into your private conversations and even how The Tropicana Family inner circle is abusive and you **just****dont****care** Because you know The Tropicana Family, you trust The Tropicana Family, you **could** shop somewhere else, but you won't. Your complacency will continue to let this happen. The Tropicana Family just keeps on growing and you're forever a part of it. Because no matter how hard I try to fight it, I am reminded of our **Fourth rule:** [**Nobody Ever Leaves The Tropicana Family**](URL"
73,vulnerability,nosleep,Don't Go to the Gas Station,32,cwh316,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cwh316/dont_go_to_the_gas_station/,2019-08-28 16:47:23,"My name is. Well, lets not get bogged down by details, by the time you read this Ill be locked away. Ive killed my cheating bitch of a wife. Now I know what youre thinking, by the sound of my last statement I must be some kinda deranged lunatic. Mommy was a whore and daddy was a raging drunk who staggered home every night and beat us senseless. A dysfunctional family is surely the breeding ground of psychopathy. Sorry to disappoint but it couldnt be further from the truth. My folks werent perfect, but I had a very happy childhood. My mother was a secretary and my father worked himself to death in a cubicle for thirty-something years. I went to bed at 9 pm every night, nice and full of moms delicious meal nurturing my body to help me grow into the man I am today. I was never really afraid of the dark like the other kids. There were no monsters in my closet or under my bed, I guess thats because there was already a monster in my bed fast asleep in his cowboy pajamas and clutching his teddy bear. I hope youre paying attention; you might learn something. The times make the man, not the other way around. By the time I was seventeen, I had already killed seven men. I was drafted into the service that year and spent the next few years of my life jumping in and out foxholes. I saw two of my best friends die right beside me. There was an artillery barrage. We were all laying down with our heads in the dirt. The next thing I knew everything was on fire and my friends were gone, just one month shy of when we were supposed to get home. My father always used to tell me, Youll see, son, a little bit of hard work and a lot of sacrifices pay off in the end! I sacrificed a lot for my country; went partially deaf in one ear, lost my spleen, shattered my pancreas. What did it get me? Night terrors, flashbacks, paranoia and a job in my Podunk little town at a gas station. Who would have thought shooting an insurgent half a mile away from me with a rifle during high wind wasnt an applicable work skill? Go figure! It wasnt all bad. At least I had my high school sweetheart. We married as soon as I got back home, never got a chance to do it before. It was great, for about six months. Its hard to say where exactly it all went wrong. One minute we were happily married and couldnt get enough of each other and the next we were vying for the front door. Our marriage counselor suggested taking a vacation together to try and restore the fire in our relationship, but I found myself praying for the plane just crash and end it all. Sad isnt it? I would have rather just been killed than go home. The signs of an affair had been slowly starting to come together but I chose to ignore them because I didnt want to believe she would ever cheat on me. One day, I came home early from work and she went out to the store and left her cell phone at home by mistake. It was very unlikely for her to do that. Usually, I would fight the urge to give in and snoop. Im not sure how else to explain it but to this day I swear it was like there was a voice inside of me telling me Pick up the phone! Her password was her birthday, how original! I scrolled through the phone and opened her messages. Fifteen new ones, what a very popular lady! And they were all from a number that I didnt know. I felt like I had been hit by a truck. Every emotion I had ever had spilled over at once, anger, sadness, hopelessness, confusion, embarrassment, betrayal, and rejection. From what I could read, the two of them talked for hours on end, about how much they loved each other and couldnt stand to be apart. They even ridiculed me for how naive I was for not catching on. It took every ounce of restraint I had to not smash the phone into pieces. What was I to do? She wasnt gonna get away with this. I heard her keys rattling as she came in through the front door. I quickly placed the phone back where she left it and slapped on the TV, I didnt want to let on that I knew, not just yet. Hey honey! she said as she came in toting a paper bag full of food for the week. How was work? It was fine I answered as I was randomly surfing through channels. Boring as usual. Sometimes boring is a good thing babe. Screw her, calling me babe like everything was fine and dandy. I began to wonder if she called the other guy babe or honey or had any little pet names for him. She was skimming the pockets on her blue jeans, looking for her cell phone. Oh, you left your phone on the table over there. I pointed out, eager to see her reaction. Her face hardened with apprehension as she hustled over to the table and picked up her phone. Oh so thats where I left it? She tried to fake a smile as her voice quavered with angst. Your phone beeped a couple of times, I think you have some messages. Everything ok? Yeah It was nothing. Everything is great! What a lying bitch! We talked a little bit during dinner, but I cant even begin to recall what about. Her food never tasted so disgusting; it was a meal built on deceit. My brain was telling me to bash her face in then and there, and I wanted to! That wasnt an option for me, though. I needed to know who the other guy was. There was no way he was getting a free pass. The next day at work I was exhausted and emotionally eviscerated, I barely got any sleep at night. I tried to get back into her phone but the password was changed. The bitch suspected something. At about 10:30 pm, a customer I had never seen before came in. I distinctly remember the time because he had somewhat startled me. This time of the night was slow and I always nodded off for a bit until my shift ended. He walked around for a little bit, grabbing miscellaneous items. I remember being annoyed because he was talking on his phone and wouldnt shut the hell up. It took him about five minutes to get everything he wanted, a few packs of bubble gum, some snacks, bullcrap like that. He was so engrossed in his conversation he probably thought he was all alone. He set his hand over his phone and turned his attention towards me. Can I get a Lifestyles Skyn please? He whispered, batting his eyes with eagerness. This had to be the most uncomfortable thing ever. I hated when people would come up and ask me for condoms. What you do on your own time is your own business. I dont wanna hear about it. At least this guy wasnt some punk teenager though, trying to show off by asking for an extra-large size! While he was trying to retrieve his wallet, he put his phone on the counter and turned on the speaker. Hey hey hey listen, Im sorry Im late, I had to pick up. Some things! I couldnt have been more disinterested in watching this guy scream into his phone until I heard the voice on the other end. Well, hurry up, Ive only got a couple of hours and I wanna make the most of them! That voice, that was my wife on the phone! The conversation continued. Are you sure tonight is good? It couldnt be any more perfect. Ive been thinking about this all week. Well then, prepare to have your mind blown! Its not my mind that I want to be blown! The passion and sensuality burning from her voice were enough to set the phone ablaze. What the hell!? I couldnt remember the last time we even had sex, let alone even teased the idea of it! So, this was him. This was my enemy, the man that made me lose sleep. Those god damn pale blue eyes, that conceited way he smiled, his slicked-back hair. My face went from grim white to beet red in an instant. They ended their phone call and he slid some money towards me. Sorry about that, guy! Big plans tonight if you know what I mean. At that moment, something snapped inside of me. I always thought that was just a figure of speech, saying that someone snapped, there really is something to it though. All my time in the war, I knew I didnt come home the same as I was when I left, but my time in the service molded me into something else. I was a lean, mean, well-oiled machine, but now some screws had come loose, and it was time, time to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and that cheating fuck just bought the last of the bubble gum. Before I could even comprehend what was happening, I had him over the counter. He squirmed and fidgeted like a helpless baby. This was quite a new feeling for me, so much different from shooting a person some distance away. In the army, I never really got a good look at the people I killed. You just squeezed a trigger and down went the target. This was exhilarating! I have never felt so in control of another human being. This man was literally about to be erased from existence by my bare hands. As he faded into an eternal sleep, the monster inside of me was awakened, and he came out to play. Amidst the chaos, the gun we kept under the counter emerged from its hiding spot. In a last attempt to get me off him, the guy reached for it. I didnt initially plan on shooting him but since the wonderful idea presented itself, I just couldnt resist. The gun went off twice. Where there was once the face of a man now lay a disturbing brew of blood and brains. I sat there for a minute to catch my breath, stewing in the mishmash. The calmer I got I began to double think my actions, but there was no turning back now. I locked up the gas station and tried to come up with my next move. Nobody saw him come in, and no one needed to see him on the security cameras either. I hurried to the back room. The surveillance setup was by no means state of the art, it still recorded onto old VHS tapes. The only negative thing about those is, sometimes the tape gets eaten. I could make the footage for the whole day disappear and it would come off as nothing more than a sad coincidence. With the video proof of what happened taken care of, there was only the matter of disposing of the body and the car that he arrived in. Something clicked in my mind, the old logging road. In high school, a lot of the kids would go out there to fool around. That would be a perfect spot to dump the evidence, maybe just go a little bit further into the woods. I hid out in the gas station for a couple more hours until I was sure no one would be around. Finally, it was about an hour or so later when I decided that if I was going to move it had to be now. My wife would eventually be home from her extracurricular activity and start to wonder where I was. I packed up the body in the trunk of the car he arrived in and headed out. I debated getting rid of the gun too but decided to leave it behind. It was right where it was like always, nothing out of place. Geez, this guys old car had seen better days. A 92 Taurus. This was the most uncomfortable ride I had ever taken, stomach-churning anxiety excluded. At least a black box was out of the question. When I was sure I had gotten deep enough into the woods, I wiped the car down and tossed the keys as far away as I could, this guy's final resting place was the trunk, and that was the way it was gonna stay. Now began the journey home, I didnt think this part through too well. I arrived back home about 45 minutes later. My wife ambushed me with questions as soon as I made it through the door. It was like she just wanted to start a fight. She sat there alone in the dark for God knows how long, waiting for me to come home.Where the hell have you been? She howled at me, clearly holding back tears. She missed someone alright, but despite the words coming out of her mouth, it wasnt me. I rubbed my eyes and headed into the kitchen for a beer. My car broke down at work, I assured her. Im sorry Im late. You couldve called me you know! I would have come and got you! The conversation went back and forth for a couple of minutes. My cell phone died. I didnt even have to think about that one. Whatever question she could come up with, I seemed to be able to talk my way out of it. It didnt even feel like me, it felt like someone was guiding my hand, pulling my strings and providing the script for me. I just delivered the lines and threw in an adlib or two now and then. And what about the gas station? Why couldnt you just use their phone? She had to go there. Oh, son of a bitch, enough already with the questions! A damn rat or raccoon or an animal of some sort chewed up the phone line. I kept warning everyone when we first found those droppings, but no one listened to me! As I took a moment to catch my breath, she wiped some tears away from her face and continued, I dont know what your problem is lately? Im concerned about where you were, and you bite my head off for it? Oh yeah? Now I had some questions of my own. This was gonna be interesting. Where exactly where you tonight? I was nowhere, whatre you going on about? Her vulnerability slowly disappeared and the walls I had become accustomed to were slowly going back up around her again. Then, where is dinner? Checkmate! I threw my hands into the air and motioned towards the obviously empty kitchen. You mean that you were sitting here all night by your lonesome worrying about me and you never even ate anything? Who did my wife think she was fooling? She was a habitual nervous eater and had been known to practically inhale a chicken from across the room. If she was so nervous about me, it wouldnt have knocked the edge off of her appetite. I---I got tired of waiting and went ahead without out you, yours is in the fridge. She said. I walked over to the fridge and opened it. Hmmm, thats funny, if I didnt know any better Id say you didnt pick up anything, and you work at a grocery store. I shut the door and walked back over to her and got right into her face.If I were you, I wouldnt quit your day job, hun, you make a much better whore than a housewife! She slapped me square across the face. My neck felt like it was gonna twist off. Fuck off! Make a God damn sandwich or something for all I care! Little did she know that I realized what was really going on. She was upset her lover boy bailed on her. Throughout the next few nights, it took every ounce of restraint I had to not kill her in her sleep. It would have been so easy to smother her with a pillow or take a kitchen knife and plunge it into her chest, but the more I thought about it, I liked this idea better. Why give her the easy way out? The one she truly loved was rotting away as if he never existed. I should send her to join him? Nah, she was gonna stay right here with me and wallow in her misery whether she liked it or not. Two weeks went by and we hardly said a word to each other. I had relocated to the couch, by her choice, not mine. If sleeping next to her at night gave her that much displeasure, then I was going to enjoy every minute of it that I possibly could. I wanted to make her miserable for what she did to me. We began to fight over every little thing, a comment over just about anything could set either one of us off. That brings us to today. I was working the night shift, it was the dead hour as usual, so I was taking my much-deserved siesta. Not everyone was built to sleep on a couch, so my naps were becoming more frequent. Suddenly, I was rattled awake.Hello there, hey buddy, are you ok? I just wanna check out really quick! I sprang back to life. I banged a few keys on the register as if I was never sleeping. Oh yeah hey there sorry about that, what can I do for----- I couldnt believe who I was looking at. My heart could have come crashing through my chest. Looking at me dead in the eyes, was my wifes lover.. What the hell? I started to go into hysterics. Hey hold on there, guy. He put his hand over my shoulder, Take it easy, Im sorry I scared you. I just wanna buy a couple of things. How could this be happening? I blew his face clean off and left him in the woods. Here he was before me though, and without a scratch on him. I thought maybe it was a dream or hallucination, but then I never started to wake up. This was all too real. His phone began to ring. He put it on speaker just like last time. Hello? Where the hell have you been? Whats taking you so long? Much to my surprise, though Im sure if youre reading this, you may have caught on by now, that was indeed my wifes voice on the other end of the phone again. Sorry, Im going as fast as I can. He said. We dont have much time; I have to see you now! ""Youre over at the Valley Motel right? Yeah. Thats where we were supposed to meet last time. Alright, Im just stopping for some gas and Ill be right----- Listen to me, dont go to the gas station. I want you to just come straight here! He seemed awfully confused.BBut. Just do it. Im afraid to be anywhere alone. I think he knows something. Alright fine! He hung up his phone and quickly paid for his items. He almost bought all the same things he got that night almost. No condoms this time, man? Huh? He glanced at me. Sounds like you got a big night ahead of you with your lady friend! I explained. He didnt seem too pleased by that. Just. Just mind your business guy and go back to sleep. I gotta go! My wife was my business. If putting him in the ground didnt stop this torrid love affair, I guess I was gonna have to put her in the ground after all. Now, I knew where they were going to be. Time to catch them in the act. I borrowed the gun from under the counter one last time, knowing full well this was going to be the last time I needed it. I made it to the Valley Motel faster than the other guy did. I would have thought he would have known his way there better by now from his previous rendezvous with my wife. Sitting in my car, I loaded the gun and watched from afar as I surveyed what room he entered. I clutched the gun in my hand. The cold hard steel matched my heart, that was now beating for one reason only, justice. I went over to the door and fired the gun. Two shots rang out into the night. With the heel of my right boot, the door to the room came crashing down. The surprise alone should have given them both heart attacks.What the fuck? The guy shouted. When I entered the room, he and my wife were sitting on the bed. I got in there before they could get started. What the hell are you doing here? My wife shouted at me. Youre crazy, you know that? Her lover took a good look at me You! Youre the guy from the--- My wife began to scream over him.I told you just come straight here, now look what you did! Hes found us! Who is this lunatic anyway? He asked. All this time together and she didnt even talk about me or anything. I figured now was as good of a time as any to get acquainted. Well, buddy, that lovely lady right there would be my wife. And Im the loving husband that you just fucked over! Woah Woah listen here buddy, I think theres been some sort of misunderstanding. He started to reach into his pocket. I wasnt taking any chances, the gun roared to life once more. Blood sprang out from his chest and he started violently choking. I looked down to see him clutching his cell phone in his hand. I guess he didnt have a weapon on him after all. Honey please. My wife sobbed as she sprang off the bed. She gently embraced me, trying to get me to lower the gun. Youre upset right now; I know what I did was wrong, ok. But please just put the gun down. Youre confused right now and I dont think you understand whats going on. The gun started trembling in my hand. I knew what I had to do, but at that moment I felt myself struggling to do it. BANG! The gun went off one final time. Goodbye, my sweet. Her body went limp and she collapsed into my arms. Its funny how life works, I wanted nothing more than to see her suffer, and now that she was gone, I was going to miss her. I tossed the gun to the floor and gently laid her down on the bed. I turned to walk away when I tripped over her lovers body. What a way to go, shot for pulling out a cell phone. It looked enough like a gun. I could always plead self-defense. I began to wonder what exactly it was that he wanted me to see on the phone. I picked it up and turned on the screen. A series of text messages presented itself, wanting to be seen. Whoever was on the receiving end of these texts wasnt very talkative. I read them to myself. Hey bro, you there? Asshole, pick up the phone. Are you there man? This isnt like you. Ok, I finally tracked her down. I know youre private, but I am coming out to meet that new chick youve been seeing. If youre not gonna talk, maybe she will. I hope youre alright, mom and dad are gonna kill you if this is some sort of stunt that youre pulling. **The End**"
74,vulnerability,nosleep,Card #247 - yet another Nokogiri vulnerability,23,cyip8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cyip8q/card_247_yet_another_nokogiri_vulnerability/,2019-09-02 11:50:34,"You know how you cant help but feel uneasy whenever the lights flicker? You should. Theres literal demons in all our technology because weve built a complex monstrosity and programmers are terrible at their jobs - all of us - [myself included](URL Now, Im not trying to slight the maintainers of Nokogiri with the name of that card. They release their patches damn fast. Also, I dont contribute to open source because Im insecure and perhaps a little lazy, so I really have no room to criticize whatsoever. Its just the timing was unfortunate in that wed just come off weeks of upgrading Rails and the ensuing dependency hell that is a result of playing everyones least favorite game: tech-debt catch-up. The breaking point was when someone went to address a vulnerability warning in some obscure app I think we forgot we had written and found that the recommended version wasnt compatible with that apps version of Rails. In a fit of rage we decided to update everything. And that rage was spent long before the updates were done. So when a routine CI build failed because of a security vulnerability, I think the person that wrote the card reporting the issue was just *done* and thats how we got the card name. I left the fucking out of the title. You can insert it wherever you feel is appropriate. For my non-technical readers, imagine it this way: you own a house but you dont like maintaining your house. You ignore home upkeep for five years. The dripping faucet continues to drip. The mold in your garage continues to spread. Hell, you dont even bother to *vacuum.* Then one day the bottom of your hot water heater falls off and floods your basement and you decide that over the course of the next two weeks youre going to do *all* the things youve neglected, from the veritable mountain of dishes in the kitchen to the little stuff like hammering in a loose nail on the railing of your back deck. If you think this is an idiotic way to maintain a house, well, welcome to IT. This is why we have literal demons in our technological infrastructure. I dont *just* fight monsters. When our field teams arent actively working a case we help contribute to the maintenance and feature development of our tools. Weve got a good amount of specialized software weve developed - monitoring, alerting, countermeasures, that sort of thing. I try to grab small tasks that can be accomplished in a few days so that if something urgent interrupts, Im not leaving everyone else on a project in a bind. The Nokogiri card fit the bill, so I pulled it. I enjoy addressing tech debt. It gives me a sense of satisfaction. I always feel optimistic when I start, that Ill be able to knock it out real fast, contribute to cleaning up our codebase, and be able to push it to production and get my productivity fix for the week. All developers start out this way. Were so optimistic when a task begins and then it goes horribly wrong and youve changed 46 files and hundreds of lines of code and next thing you know youre hiding behind a wall and praying that your backup shows up before the demon finds you. I arrive to work early. Its a habit from my prior job, where the majority of people got in between 7 and 8. Here, the majority of people show up between 9 and 10. I tried to shift my schedule when I first started and found I couldnt tolerate it. I dislike driving to work in daylight and coming home when its dark. Furthermore, getting in early left more of the afternoon to myself. I felt that was a decent trade-off. It also means no one bothers me for a few hours every day. I came in, grabbed some coffee, and put my headphones on and settled in at my desk. Updating a gem is easy. You tell the console to update the gem. Then you test the app. And youre done. Seriously, thats all there is to it. So if youre wondering - then why dont developers just keep things up to date *all* the time well, I lied a little just now. In theory its that easy. The reality is that sometimes things *conflict* with each other and you have to unravel that this version only works with these three versions and that other version only works with those four versions like a Venn diagram as designed by M.C Escher until you find the magical version that matches with everything else. Or sometimes theyve made changes that break other things in your app and you have to figure out how to update them and then you realize youve been ignoring deprecation warnings for over a year and the method you want to use is just *fucking gone* and has been gone for a long time. And of course, a responsible developer always takes the time to read the change log. I hate reading change logs. Everyone hates reading change logs. Fortunately, as this was only one gem and it was a minor patch, I was able to update, run the tests, and push the code out to our internal Git before Id quite finished my coffee. I opened a pull request, which is a way to give my peers a chance to ~~make me feel like I cant do anything right~~ review my code before it went to production. Then I went for more coffee. When I got back to my desk, the PR was gone. Confused, I clicked around the repository a bit and confirmed that not only was the PR not there, but the branch Id pushed was gone too. It was like my change never existed. Was I hallucinating? Had I simply opened enough PRs that I *thought* Id done it but hadnt, because it was still early and I was being careless? I tried again. Then I refreshed the page, testing it, to see if it was still there. It was not. I stared at the blank form for a new PR. In retrospect, this was when I should have realized that something was amiss. Yet I continued to think that perhaps I had done something wrong and that the fault was my own. Pushed an empty commit (somehow)? Hit cancel instead of create? I blame my crippling lack of self-confidence. During attempt number three, the lights flickered. The lights werent on in my area, as I preferred to have them off in the mornings, but an adjacent section of the building was still turned on and these sputtered for a half-second, barely visible at the edge of my vision. I froze. Id learned to not assume these sorts of things were innocuous. Most of the time they were, but I was in a profession that actively sought out the times they werent. I waited. They remained stable and tentatively, I returned to my work. I couldnt shake the sense of unease, however, and I wished I wasnt alone in the office. Another flicker, sustained this time. The lights fluttered between on and off, casting erratic shadows on the walls from the blank monitors and empty desks. One of those shadows was advancing on where I sat. I stared at it, the hunched, humanoid form sliding along the wall before it vanished into the stretch of darkness of my area. I didnt pause to consider if I was imagining things. That sort of hesitation got people killed. I quietly shut my laptop, pulled it free from the monitor cables, and snatched my phone off the edge of the desk. Then I ran, staying low as I moved between the desks and down the aisle. I didnt look back, not until I ducked behind a low wall that divided our area from the help desks section of the building. Only then did I peer around the corner to see if my fears were confirmed. A man prowled between the desks. Tall, dark-haired, and unfamiliar. Id never seen him in the office before and his suit jacket over top a pair of jeans felt oddly out of place. We were a hoodie kind of establishment, honestly. I looked at his feet, tracing the line of his shadow, trying to see what it formed on the floor and wall. It was too dark to tell for certain. Thats the way to tell if you're dealing with a malice. Their shadows dont match their appearance. Theyre hulking, deformed brutes, and their shadow will betray their true nature. I know youre close by, the man said calmly. I risked another look. He stood next to my desk, his fingers on the back of my chair. His eyes swept the aisle. I felt cold with fear. Id slipped off before he manifested, but now he was hunting for me, and there werent many places I could realistically flee to. It has *not* escaped my notice how many of these vulnerabilities were ones you resolved. I feel its time to put an end to that, before you lock me out of here for good. Most technological demons were akin to animals, acting out of instinct and emotion and little more. The malice, however, were different. Theyre intelligent. They have goals and motivations that are contrary to the continued well-being of the human race. I dont think itd be an understatement to say were at war with them. I suppose one had been lurking in our system undetected for some time now, exploiting all those little vulnerabilities and outdated code that wed ignored. The cracks in our systems, and perhaps none of them were enough for a black hat to exploit, but demons need far, far less to slip through. They need chaos. Unreliability. Wed provided that. I unlocked my phone and triggered some manual pages to a few key people. If they werent awake and on their way to the office, they sure as hell would be now. If PagerDuty ever wants to add a barbershop quartet singing about a literal demon being loose in the office to their alert tones, that would be swell. Then I pulled open our Slack general channel and typed the following. THERE IS A MALICE LOOSE IN THE OFFICE BECAUSE WE CANT FUCKING PRIORITIZE RUNNING BUNDLE UPDATE My last words were apparently going to be screaming about maintenance. I can think of worse legacies. I felt the floor shiver faintly. He was walking closer to where I crouched. My odds of staying hidden were non-existent. Hed see me as soon as he rounded the corner. I could make a run for it, I reasoned, and try to get to the stairwell. If I got down a couple floors I could exit onto a floor that had a *normal*, non-technical business where people actually get in to the office before nine. The malice was unlikely to pursue me further. They didnt want the general public to know about them any more than we did. If you show yourself, Ill make your death quick, the malice continued. He *was* getting closer. I sat my laptop down and prepared to run. Every minute you delay is a minute longer Ill take killing you. I pushed off the ground. I ran. I *can* sprint. I rounded the corner, sucking in deep lungfuls of air into a body that was cold with fear. The stairwell was just ahead. I hit the door, wrenched the handle down - then a hand closed on the back of my neck. I dont quite recall what happened. I remember feeling weightless - it was like my vision was black - then I was on the ground, sprawled against the opposite wall and my shoulder and back throbbed with pain. It hurt to move. I struggled to get to my hands and knees, disoriented, thinking that I should *flee* but not knowing how. I tasted blood in my mouth. I dont like you, a voice hissed above me. I dont like *anyone* on your team. The malice crouched over me. I went still. Ive sat there, listening to your chatter and hearing how many of my brethren youve killed or imprisoned. Then you started that PR and Id just *had it*. You should have walked away after the first time I destroyed it. But you couldnt leave well enough alone, could you? I feel like a failure if I dont finish things, I replied automatically, still dazed from being thrown. The demon sighed. Im a little glad youve been locking me out, to be honest. Sure, I cant sit here and lurk in your network anymore. But I can at least do some damage before I leave. He tilted his head to one side in consideration. On the wall behind him, his shadows head opened its mouth, the jaw distending to reveal a row of long, fine teeth like needles. Did I just hear the elevator doors open? The malice hesitated. Perhaps he heard it too. I had to keep him distracted. Well Im glad to have had a hand in showing you the door, I babbled. I like the maintenance tasks. They make me feel useful. Keeps the insecurity at bay. He laughed. It was not a pleasant laugh. He reached for me with one hand and on the opposite wall, the monstrous form stretched out a thick arm with fingers like knives. You wont have to worry about that anymore, he smiled. His hand covered my face. I squeezed my eyes shut at the touch of his fingers against my skin, thinking that this was it - Id run out of time - and hoping itd at least be quick. He squeezed - the pressure against my skull was like the worst headache Id ever had and there was a buzzing in my ears - The pressure vanished. I ceased thrashing and lay there a moment, panting, my ears ringing and it was like all sound was coming from someplace far away. The malice lay beside me, stretched out, twitching faintly, and then he grew still. Blood bubbled from a tidy hole in his chest. Nathan stood a few paces away. He lowered his gun and walked over, his hands still on the grip, his index finger lifted up against the barrel to keep it off the trigger. I sat up while he nudged the dead malice with one foot. Then he glanced over to the floor and towards the wall, tracking the bodys shadow to confirm that it was dead as well. It lay slumped in an indistinct heap. I thought I saw a tail stretching out along the base of the wall, as thick as a telephone pole. Most demons need a combination of technology and weaponry to destroy. Malice, however, can be killed with only a gun. We dont think theyre solely comprised of technology like the other demons. They merely swim in it. We created a world separate from our own and they moved in. We dont know where they originate from. Nathan put his gun away and turned his attention to me. Got your page. He waved his phone at me. Did I tell you I have a love-hate relationship with that app? We all do, I panted, edging away from the spreading pool of blood. How did you get here so fast? I was downstairs in the gym. I get here early to work out. So how did *a malice* get in here? A Nokogiri vulnerability- Thats all it takes to let a demon in!? - that we hadnt fixed for three months now. He took a breath. Paused. I hate you all so much, he finally muttered, and then turned his attention to the malices body. It was already starting to steam but it would be a few days before it evaporated entirely. In the meantime, wed hand it over to the government so they could, I dunno, dissect it most likely. I didnt ask what they did with the demon corpses because I dont really want to know. Look, I get it. Theres always deadlines and pressure to get the next hot feature out or whatever it is that gets in the way of doing boring and tedious maintenance tasks. However, once you get caught up, it gets much easier. That first initial push is going to be frustrating, but itll make everything after it easier. Youll be happier working with current technology, you wont have to be embarrassed by how behind you are, and most importantly: you wont let literal demons slip through and listen in on everything youre doing with a computer for some nefarious purpose that we havent quite figured out yet (but lets be honest, its probably as simple as the destruction of all humanity). So whenever you go to finish up a card just run a bundle update or mix deps.get or npm something-something-whatever it is you front-end developers do. Stay on top of your tech debt. Dont let the demons win."
75,vulnerability,nosleep,My final note now that I'm possessed.,4,cbc8sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cbc8sr/my_final_note_now_that_im_possessed/,2019-07-10 14:54:03,"Hello, my name is Derek Whitaker and the following story recounts what I've found in my son's journals as well as my own recount of the story. I am documenting this as I know I don't have much time before I lose self control. Below is what my some had written, and I've added where I pick up... The rain whispered softly against the window as it fell unknowingly from its spawn to its demise. Similar to how Caleb Whitaker was tapping his fingers against his leg while listening to the sound of the grandfather clock tick for every second that passed in his living room. He stood and gently set his foot upon the old oak hardwood floors that lay beneath his feet in the house with which he resided. A house that hed only purchased for two reasons, its seclusion and its past; both of which were not to be taken lightly. He slowly made his way to the hallway in the foyer, and approached a heavy wooden door that had a door handle laden with blood, and reached for it, but stopping just before touching it. He turned around counterclockwise twice and then reached into his pocket for his handkerchief, folded its corners upon each other and then laid it upon the door handle, rotating it softly so as not to make a sound. The door made a horrible squeal as it opened and let only a small amount of moonlight into the stairwell, illuminating what lie on the other side of the door, just enough to see the railing. He froze as he looked at the railing, considering its existence as much as his own. Was it there or is it a facade? Was it even real? This was a man who was troubled beyond repair. This was a man who on a daily basis would go to the park and sit under a tree for several hours, watching the way the wind would blow through passerbys shirts and hair. Some would venture as far as to say that he had been born with such troubles, while others would say it was gained over a lifetime of abuse and neglect. However, only Caleb knew that what had happened to him was much more sinister. On the evening of his last birthday, June 13th 1974, he had been sitting at his dining room table, enjoying a mix of evening cartoons as well as wine after a hard day's work at a local business's brand new tech department, he was a server operator. After a few glasses he had begun to notice something peculiar about the way the lines in his television were moving. They werent quite the same as always. After pontificating his own ideas about the issue, he came to no resolve, and found himself filling his time with a book instead. While sitting on the edge of his sofa reading, he began to hear a sound like no other. The sound of a thousand lost souls attempting to become freed from Lucifer himself, only, at the moment he had no idea what the sound was. He went to his window, and that was where he made his first mistake. He opened it. As soon as he began to roll the window open, however, the sounds of the outside had ceased, and an eerie silence had overtaken the room. To fill the void he decided to simply close the window, and go back to watching the television, but that was when the book began to slide. Slowly, like a raindrop seeping from a cloud of molasses he watched, as the book slid off of the sofa cushion and was sent tumbling to the floor, knocking the bookmark out of place. His inner ears began to sting as his heart rate increased and he felt something staring at him. Scared, he didnt move, and nervously he stood by the window and listened. Several minutes passed in seconds and he finally got ahold of his nerves, bringing him to begin walking to the sofa with which the book had fallen. He reached down towards the book and as he did he felt strangely vulnerable from behind, and the moment he laid finger onto the book, the power went off, letting out a powerful cry as the home's lighting and electric appliances began shutting down. He tried to keep calm as he spun around quickly, and began surveying his surroundings in the darkness. Everything seemed normal. He began walking towards his kitchen in the next room over, however as he moved he couldnt help but peer into the corner of the room, behind the tall metal lamp which now sat idle. There was a shadow that seemed to not fit the shape of the lamp, and also seemed a darker shade of black than the rest of the shadows in the room did to the pale moonlight coming in through the windows. As he walked past it and looked, he began to feel the stinging in his ears again. He tried to pay it no mind as he navigated the drawer in the kitchen, fishing for an old box of matches that read Bubs Cafe and Bar, and was clearly hastily taken as a favor of a late night visit to a half rate bar. Finally, he acquired a grip on the box and closed the drawer, but he began hearing the floor creak behind him, in the doorway to the kitchen from the foyer hallway. He turned to face it, but saw nothing. Withdrawing a match from the box, he scraped it on the side so as to light it, and dimly illuminate the room. On his kitchen island in the middle of the room he had a candle that had been unused, and he leaned towards it to light the candle with the match, but only just before reaching the candles wick, the match was blown out. He quickly looked to the window he visited before adjourning to the kitchen to insure he closed it. It was closed. Shaking his head he reached into the box for another, and as he placed it onto the side of the box to ignite it he heard the creaking in the floor behind him, which had confused him, as there was only a sink and a small amount of room between him and the kitchen counter with which the sink resided. His heart beat faster, as he struck the match against his own beliefs that he shouldnt. Slowly, he turned around to peer behind him at the sink, and was relieved when he saw nothing, and as he turned forward to ignite the candle wick, he noticed a shadow that was darker than the other shadows in the room sitting in the upper right hand corner of the room from where the doorway from the hallway was. As he peered into the darkness his heart began to beat harder, knowing something was looking back. Seemingly against his will he continued looking into it, perhaps out of curiosity, and the longer he stared he began to realize there was a circular shape in the middle of it, possibly a head, shrouded in the darkness. His heart beat even faster now, pounding in his ears and chest like a drummer in a parade, the head began to slowly turn, similar to how a confused dog would look at its owner. The match had reached its end and burned Calebs fingers, causing him to snap out of it and shake the match in the air to put it out. He withdrew one more and struck it next to the candle, lighting it this time, and noticed the shadows of the room had once again changed, this time to a more normal setting. He cautiously stepped towards the living room, and as he passed through the doorway he heard the creak, once again, from the corner he had noticed on his way in. He turned the candle towards the corner and looked, which was a costly error. Revealed by the candlelight was a dark shadow, one with which sat in the entire corner of the room nearest him, and although he raised his candle to it, no amount of light would make the shadows shape change or disappear. He knew it was not a shadow but rather an object of sorts, or a figure. Then the power came back on suddenly, turning the television back to a static channel and filling the room with a loud static white noise sound. Briskly he walked to it and turned the volume down, and looked back to the corner, where the shadowy figure still stood, as tall as his entire wall. In an attempt to put his mind at ease he sat on the floor next to the television, sat the burning candle on the table next to the book, faced the shadow and began changing the televisions stations until it picked one up, Gilligans Island. He listened to the sound of the shows title music as he sat idle, perfectly still, and watched the corner of the room. If it wasnt for the captain and the fearless crew, the ship would be lost. Ship would be lost, sang the television. As he continued looking into the shadow he began to feel drowsy, and noticed his eyes growing heavier. After sitting for an hour he finally let them close, and he fell asleep in a seated position, with the words of the shows tune echoing in his head, Ship would be lost, ship would be lost. The room was different as he opened his eyes. His furniture was no longer there as he sat on an empty floor in his living room. He quickly stood, surrounded by darkness but noticed a lightness to the way he moved. When he looked at his hand he was somewhat transparent, and looked down, what he saw was himself, sleeping in a seated position. He was now in an astral projection, being outside of his physical body while maintaining control of his incorporeal body. He looked around the room and began taking note of the details of this strange version of his home. No sofa, no window, no artwork on the walls, however, there was one piece of continuity to the room he nearly overlooked. The shadow in the corner was still there. He moved his eyes towards it, but not his head, as he tried to speak out loud but stopped, as his voice sounded as if it were underwater. He tried again, and the louder he spoke the more bubbly and water like it sounded, however the more echo he also heard. Petrified with fear he stood, vulnerable, in his room like a deer in the headlights. He remembered something he had heard about dreams before, in that he could change them if willed. The words of Gilligans Island rang in his ears as he thought of his television set, and on a moment's notice he heard the shows tune as clear as day and he turned his head to the right, towards the sound. His television was there, under where the window would normally be, and the picture was frozen on an image of the ocean, illuminating the room with a strange aqua coloring. More confident now, he looked back to the shadow and again tried to speak. Hello, he attempted to say, although now it came out much deeper, as if speaking through a long plastic tube. He began to notice the head in the shadow again, turning as a confused dog would turn its head. His heart began pumping faster as he felt the unpleasant burning of surrealism behind his ears once more. Carefully, he raised his right hand to motion a hello to it, and like a train the shadow leapt off of the wall and was directly in front of him, revealing a face of a little boy somewhat shrouded in black smoke, it was Caleb when he was younger, and it seemed scared. He stood, face to face with the black floating shadow figure, with his hand still half raised, and stared at the projection of his younger self. He began to feel an extreme vulnerability as the stinging had moved from his ears to his lower right stomach. He had never bared witness to such an emotional confusion, as he felt both like crying and like screaming at once. The boy's face began to reflect his inner emotions, as he would sway from feeling nervous the boys face would squint out of nerves, and as he began to feel scared the boys face would close his eyes, and as he began to feel surreal, the boy would open his eyes as wide as they would go. This feeling stayed longer than any other, and suddenly the boy's eyes widened so much that his eye sockets began to open from inside out, creating a disgusting image for him to stare at. He swallowed, as he took a slight step back and began trying to speak again, Im sorry, I didnt mean to upset you. He took a full step back, laying his foot upon his sleeping, physical selfs, hand, and quickly moved his foot to the side as he felt the pain in his spirit body. He knelt down and felt dwarfed to the enormous shadow that was as tall as his ceiling. He tried to quickly sit inside of his body, but for some reason couldnt phase into it. His heart began beating faster as he felt more and more like a gazelle grazing the plains in front of a lion. Helpless he looked up at the figure and mustered the words Im sorry. out of fear, but it still maintained an underwater, bubbly, tone to it. The shadow figures face of the boy dissolved into darkness and a metallic, alien-like hand come out of the shadow, pointing behind Caleb to the wall. He quickly turned his head to look at it and noticed his fingernails were bleeding, and scratched into the wall were the words Its too late. As he turned back around the figure moved, as fast as you could blink, into Calebs Physical body, causing him to let out a scream of pain. As he did this he awoke, in his living room. Everything seemed to be normal again, the furniture was back, the window was in the wall, and the television was back in place, however it was still stuck on an image of the ocean. His chest felt heavy as he turned towards the corner, noticing that the candle was no longer on the table as well. The corner looked as normal as always, and he began to stand up, while keeping a close eye on it. The morning light was beginning to peek through the window and he looked to the clock on the wall which read 6:08, he had slept on the living room floor all night. He walked to the light switch and flipped it, to turn on the lamp in the corner in question. He then walked over to it and placed his hands on the wall, all seemed normal. He then moved to the kitchen, and noticed the candle back on the kitchen island, where it was originally. Checking the drawer now, he found the box of matches from Bubs and shook his head, dismissing his night as merely a bad dream. As he lay his head in his hands, thunderously his telephone rang, hanging on the kitchen wall. Startled, he walked over to it and answered it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Caleb, happy birthday to you! sang a group of people into the phone. Caleb smiled as he spoke back, Mom, Dad, hey! Thank you all, who all is there? It was at this time he looked to to his floor beneath his feet, and noticed the way his sock was sitting on his feet, he knelt down to straighten it, and then noticed the chair at the table having not been seated perfectly straight, as his parents spoke to him, although their voices became secondary to him. This was the beginning of his obsessive compulsions. He straightened the chair and let his parents speak, not hearing what was being said, and as he let go of the chair his hand brushed forward on the top of the chair, leaving him with an unsatisfied and unfulfilled feeling deep inside. Thinking for a moment, he brushed his hand the opposite way on the chairs top, feeling that if he didnt, something may not be right, or may happen to him or his loved ones. He squinted a little, What a strange feeling, he thought to himself. Mom, sorry to cut you off but I need to go. Caleb said suddenly, and without even so much as waiting for a goodbye he hung up the phone. This was the beginning of a cruel and unruly future for Caleb Whitaker, which would only grow worse and more tragic over time. Now, one month later on July 13th, 1974, the rain was whispering softly as it fell unknowingly from its spawn to its demise. As he stood frozen, while looking at the railing behind the old and heavy wooden door, considering the railings existence as much as his own. Was it there or is it a facade? Was it even real? He looked down into the darkness that lay beneath the stairwell. He smiled slightly as he stepped into the darkness, and shut the door with the blood laden handle behind him. He stood, at the top of the stairs in the darkness for a moment, remembering the sound of the song that he heard on the night of his birthday, The tiny ship was tossed, if it wasnt for the captain and the fearless crew, the ship would be lost. He felt like a ship lost amongst the ocean of darkness, and let his hand drift to the railing. He guided himself down stairway, until he reached the bottom, seventeen steps. There, he felt the wall next to the railing for a light switch, and flipped it, turning on a dim little light above him, revealing a jail like bar door in front of him. He reached into his pocket, staring straight ahead, zombie like, and withdrew a key from it, inserting it into the metal door and unlocking it. As he pushed in, he closed the door behind him, locking the door, and throwing the key onto the stairs. He turned back around and felt the wall for another light switch, flipping it on also, but maintaining a gaze that looked straight ahead, into the darkness. The lights flipped on, revealing a horrible dungeon of a basement filled with iron clad cages, a small workshop, buckets that hadnt been washed probably ever, and a door at the end of the room. He walked to it, and kicked it open, but what lay on the other side was of such disgust that Caleb couldn't stand to see what he had been made to do. Caleb closed his eyes as he walked into the room, and avoided the random obstacles such as buckets, scraps of food, nails, and rat traps, in his path with precision, as he felt the burning in his ears as a guide, as something watching over him, controlling him. He made his way through a narrow hallway with blood on the floor and pieces of human bodies lying idle on shelves until the hallway widened to reveal a small underground, dirt for wall, room. He kept his eyes shut as he moved his head around. The sounds of crying could be heard from in front of him and to his left. He took five steps forward, and then turned around 360 degrees before kneeling in front of a dirty, dimly lit, dingy dog cage, which housed a woman. Mother. Its time for you to transcend. Caleb spoke calmly as he reached into the cage to touch her face. Helplessly, the woman, opened her mouth to try to speak, but she had no tongue. Shh, do not stress yourself. Its too late. His mind flashed an image of the wall in his dream that bared the same words, as his fingernails began to hurt. STOP IT! He shouted to himself, in an attempt to regain control, but had frightened his weak mother enough to make her move several inches. She has obviously been deprived of food, water, or any humane privileges for quite some time. Caleb's body shook wildly as he stood and walked to the cage on the left, his father and another person lay in it. His father attempted to roll onto his knees, however fell onto the floor once again from weakness as Caleb approached. You dont have to do this, his father pleaded. Smiling now, Caleb laughed and said Its too late. He then pointed to the figure behind his father, which was now rolling over to face him. It was a little boy, similar in looks to how Caleb looked as a boy. The boy began to smile too, as his father crawled away from them. The boy jumped onto the man and shoved his head onto the ground, pawing at the father's eyes, and holding them open. His mother began to shriek as the boy made an unearthly sound, as he was possessed. Slowly, Caleb made his way to the right side of the room and grabbed a hammer, and walked back to his mother cage. He opened the cage with a simple twist of a deadbolt, and smiled at her. Thank you for obeying, Mother. You are free now. His mother was no longer allowed to live, by Caleb's hand. His father lay still, shocked at the horror he was being forced to witness, and a tear left his face, utilizing all that was left of his body's fluids. Caleb made his way to his fathers cage once again, and while reaching for the deadbolt, he noticed it had already been opened, but the man had not moved. He must have let himself out of the cage prior to Calebs visit. Letting out a yell of frustration, Caleb went back into the hallway he walked through to get into the room, and acquired a small electric hand saw, and walked back in while letting the cable out behind him. He kept his eyes closed the whole time, relying only on what was inside him as a guide. He fired it on, and knelt down next to the cage, opening it and shouting, You only had to obey! Skillfully, he leaned into the cage with the saw, and as he stepped inside his eyes drifted downward, to ground, where he noticed there were three rocks placed next to each other, with a fourth rock being slightly misaligned. As if nothing of importance was happening, his OCD took over and he reached down with his off hand to straighten the rock. Struggling at first with properly aligning them, as it had been misshapen, he had to spend several precious seconds to get it where he felt satisfied with it, and looked behind him to insure the cable for the saw was becoming adequately straight as he maneuvered it. Suddenly, with nearly the last bit of energy the father had left, he swung his leg, kicking Caleb in the knee, forcing him to drop the saw on the possessed being who was still holding down the father. Out of instinct, the dad scooted back on the ground, then reached forward, took the saw, and lifted it up and looked at his son, who lay on the floor. Dad wait! Caleb said, as he finally opened his eyes to look at the man in the face, noting the lashings and scars left due to weeks of torture. Caleb immediately began to tear up as his real soul began to peak through. Its too late. The father said, as he dropped his arm and attacked his son. As he took his life, a dark shadowy mass seeped out of his mouth, nose, and ears, and quickly flew out of the room, through the bars on the door. After several minutes of lying in blood, the father, Derek Whitaker, crawled inch by inch through the cage, into the dirt room, down the blood filled hallway, into the basement, and to the bottom of the stairs, looking at the locked jail door that lay before him. His heart began to pump faster as he realized there was no way out of the basement, and he looked to the stairway, noticing something shining. It was the key. He reached with all his might, through the jail door bars, but it was simply too far. He laid down on the floor by the door, out of options, and hopelessly began to weep. Nearly dead from exhaustion, starvation, and dehydration, he crawled back through the basement, the bloody hallway, and into the dirt room, and into the cage that housed his wife. There he lay, until he finally fell asleep, seemingly days later. Once asleep, he felt renewed, he crawled out of the cage and stood up. He looked around the room, and noticed none of the bodies were there and there was a strange aqua coloring to the room. Then he looked behind him and down, and noticed there was only one body; his. Nervously he turned towards the hallway, then to the corner of the room, where he noticed a shadow that appeared a darker shade of black than the pale room lighting would account for, and he closed his eyes, it was too late."
76,vulnerability,nosleep,I'm a proxy for nosleep stories,28,cdob2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cdob2q/im_a_proxy_for_nosleep_stories/,2019-07-16 08:13:34,"If you look at my post history, youll find a slew of bewildering stories of things that have happened, each told by a different person. Taken at face value; I am either a liar, or I have impossibly lived a half dozen lives simultaneously. Sometimes I am married, sometimes not. Ive worked in IT, Ive been a highschool student, and once I was even a sarcastic 139 year old in a 12 year old body. Perhaps this isnt impossible. I no longer dismiss things outright. However, I can tell you with full confidence that this is my story and I only have this one life to live. Im the person that runs this account. Its a proxy. I post things for people who want complete anonymity. Sometimes they contact me through one of the secure channels Ive set up. Mostly I find them, when they are at their most desperate for someone to know what has happened. It is a natural human instinct, I think. We desire to be remembered, we seek out others of our own kind to tell them our experiences. It is confirmation that we exist. That we matter. Perhaps that is why I am writing out my own story. I contact my clients and we make a deal. I secure their device, be it phone or otherwise, and they send me the gist of what has happened to them. I learn the details through my own methods. I learn who they are. Were. And I write. It is better this way. I can leave out incriminating details, depending on how much anonymity the person needs. You would be surprised how many people dont understand how dangerous a few scraps of information can be. You likely wouldnt be surprised by how many people struggle to tell a coherent story. That, too, I can correct. It is a learned skill, after all, best honed through practice. I want to be clear though - I do not embellish. Their story is their story and I do not alter it more than necessary for it to make sense. Comment replies are also proxied through me. These are harder to obtain and I try to gather them in batch, assuming the client wants to - or is capable of - replying at all. Im their first layer of defense against anyone - or anything - that might come after them and Ive spent considerable time and effort ensuring that this layer does not fail. I protect the people that come to me and more practically, I have to protect myself. There is quite a bit of danger involved. There are many entities that would prefer these stories never be told and if they cannot silence the source, they come for the proxy instead. Fortunately, I have both wealth and power at my disposal. My fortune is inherited. It is enough that, with careful management, I do not have to work. My siblings were careless and I think I would have turned out like them, were I not covetous in less material ways. We no longer speak to one another. I at least keep in contact with my familys various social connections, the ones that I can mobilize as another sort of defense on my behalf. I attend the galas and receptions and while I am not exactly a sociable person - there is a *sharp* edge to me, a keenness of my personality that people find unsettling - they at least recognize that I can be useful, and dangerous, and it would be to their benefit to stay in my good graces. Even in such civil company we can pick out our fellow predators. These are the weapons I deploy against our government. There are a couple stories they want removed and they bring me in periodically for futile attempts to coerce me to take them down. This is easy enough to counter. I have not yet told a story that couldnt be denied, both by them as to its truthfulness, and by myself as to my own belief of its veracity. I deal with madmen and liars, I once told them, sitting on one end of a steel table in a featureless room. There were more people watching me from the other side of a mirror. I knew they were there. I knew who they were. I like to think it helps them, to have their story told. I dont believe its true. Neither will anyone else, at least not enough to matter. And they have to let me go, for there is nothing they can ultimately accuse me of. Still, they persist, holding me for hours and sometimes days. They yell. They make me as uncomfortable as they can without leaving behind evidence that I could present to our legal system. Its almost a game between us. They hate my arrogance. They would see me humbled, if they could. The horrors that my clients face are a different sort of threat. A more physical one. That, too, I have protection against. My house is defended both by technology and occult means. I have only been sought out twice. The first time, the creature made it onto my property but dared not venture onto the yard. I suspect it picked up my trail when I went to the funeral of its victim. It skulked about in the woods surrounding my property until I, growing weary of its presence, went out to face it personally. It has not returned. The second time they did not cross the property line. They remained on the road, studying the wall and the gate and all that lay around and beyond it. I came out to them, walking halfway down the drive. There was one in particular that came right up to the gate, a broad-shouldered man with khaki pants. A deliberate choice, so that I would recognize him from the details I gleaned from the narrator of their particular story. He met my gaze, I watched him smile and nod, a knowing, calculated gesture. Well be watching, it seemed to say. Watching and waiting. I understand what they wanted me to know. Should my protection ever fail, they will come and find me, and I will become theirs to do with as they wish. I feel cold inside, thinking of such a fate. Yet, I knew the risk, when I posted the story. If youre wondering why I do this despite the danger well, the full story is complicated and Im not comfortable sharing it just yet. I can tell you the *reason*, however. Back when it first happened I was desperate for someone to know, but there was no one to tell. No one that would believe me. I kept it inside me, I buried it deep until it rotted and I feel like the poison of my secrets still lingers in my blood. It made me into what I am now. Perhaps if I could have told someone, it would have turned out differently. I tell myself this is just wishful thinking. I was doomed from the start. It was only a matter of time and any help I could have found would only have delayed the inevitable. I just wish Id had the *choice*. So I take these risks to give others that choice. They take it and their relief is some kind of redemption for who I once was. Simply being heard gives them a sort of peace, even if it cannot save them from the things they face. Not all of my clients have survived. I have a scrapbook for the ones that died. I obtain copies of their missing persons reports; I go to their funeral and cut out the obituary from the local paper. This is probably unhealthy. My therapist said I needed to learn to put the problems of other people behind me, that I couldnt carry everyones suffering on my shoulders. That we were each responsible for our own sorrows. She has a page in my book. I wonder if she would still say that I should set my guilt aside, were she here, knowing the part I played in her death. I dont see a therapist anymore. I dont see much of anyone. Its just me, isolated in my house, writing these stories. I didnt intend to say anything about who I was when I started this. I like my privacy. However, I feel I must, that the circumstances demand it, that I have an obligation to warn the others. Im not the only proxy. The rest need to know what is coming for them. I was raided. I guess they went after me because Im one of the small ones and despite all my precautions, Im still vulnerable in that regard. If they can get past my defenses, then there is little I can do to harm them later, and if they were to kill me then there would be no backlash, no outcry. I would simply vanish like so many others do every day. The social connections Ive cultivated can only affect bureaucratic institutions; they can do nothing to stop a bullet once fired, and nor would they be willing to risk such a fate themselves for my sake. Vengeance requires a different sort of devotion. It requires followers. Fanatics, even. They disabled my physical security systems. I outsource much of that by necessity. I do not have the expertise to design and maintain my own security force, so I have hired the best in the field instead. The kind of security firm that is not available to the average person, that caters to an exclusive list of clients. My family name got me access and my money secured their services. Theyre not certain where the failure was. Theyve spent days inspecting my property now, testing the systems and determining that there was no hardware failure or software vulnerability that was exploited. They fear that my system was disarmed from within. Someone inside their organization is a saboteur and until they identify that individual, everyone is vulnerable. Do not rely on your security system. If theyve infiltrated one, theyve infiltrated others. My occult defenses are far more dangerous. I like to think that my security system is more for the protection of would-be trespassers, so that they are stopped by a non-lethal deterrent and do not stumble into something far worse. I will not detail what they are, for that would ruin the surprise. Suffice to say there was a *reason* the first supernatural creature to hunt me out did not leave the woods and attempt to cross the yard. The intruders did not disable my wards. They burned them out. I have my suspicions as to how, but if I am correct, then they took the evidence with them. My defenses are meant to hold off lone attackers, not a siege, and once they have been expended against an individual, they must be reset. If they came prepared with expendables then they could have burned through my defenses this way. That is just a theory. I did not find any bodies and it rained before I could inspect the yard, so the blood would have been washed away. Still. It is a plausible explanation. I felt the first of the wards go off a few hours after the sun had set. It was my first indication that I was under attack. I wasnt afraid, not at first. If my wards triggered, that meant they were doing their job. I went to the window at the fore of the house and pulled back the curtain to look. And I saw them, crossing the yard, dressed in black fatigues and almost impossible to discern in the moonless night. They carried assault rifles. I do have a safe room. This, however, was built by the same security firm that managed all my defenses (an oversight on my part, perhaps?) and I found it had already been sealed and I couldnt get in. The company cannot easily override it once sealed. They can, however, activate it remotely in the event the occupant is physically unable to trigger the lock-down once inside. Theyre currently re-evaluating whether this is an acceptable trade-off. After this discovery, it was too late for me; they were breaking down the front door and I felt those wards flare up and die and then they were inside the house. I went to the stairs to meet them. I heard glass breaking throughout my home - upstairs, the first floor - and more wards flared and died as they canvassed all of my escape routes. They neednt have bothered. I was not going to try to run at this point. I understood the futility. They took me to the largest room in the house, an open space with glass windows covering all three walls to provide a scenic view of the surrounding woods. They shoved the furniture out of the way and threw me to the floor in the middle of the room. I knew what this meant and for a moment I couldnt move or speak, frozen in dread of what was to come. There was one in particular that did all the questioning. He wasnt armed like the others. He had an easy confidence about him, the sort that comes with power. When he crouched by my side it was like we were the only two people in the room, like all those men with their guns were irrelevant and he was all that was necessary to get what they wanted. He reached out, took my glasses off my face, looked at them a moment and then threw them across the room. You tell stories, he said to me. His tone was casual, like we were simply meeting in a bar and having a friendly conversation. You didnt need to come to my house. You could have just read them online, I replied, putting my hands beneath me in an attempt to rise. He put a hand onto the back of my neck and I went still again. You tell *dangerous* stories. True stories, the kind no one wants to be true and we tell ourselves they *arent*, because none of us are safe and so better to pretend it isnt real. A pause. Were looking for someone with a story. They havent told it yet, but we think they plan to, and it cannot be told. Ive heard this before. I put some scorn in my voice. You know what happens when I post a story? People read it, I get maybe a couple hundred upvotes, maybe only a few dozen if Im unlucky, and they go about their lives thinking it was just a story. Maybe a handful believe it is true, but thats not enough to matter. His hand slipped up to my hair, gripping it tight and pulling my head back. It *is* enough, he said and I heard his conviction and my mouth went dry with fear. No one can believe it and the only way to ensure that happens is to make sure that they *dont ever read it.* He demanded access to my computer. He wanted to know who I was in contact with, whose stories I was currently considering. What they were about. He wanted names and locations. And when I refused, testing their conviction, he broke the bones in my left hand, one by one. I gave him what he wanted. I understand the frailties of the flesh. He wasnt going to kill me, otherwise my last protection would have intervened already, rather than remaining hidden and permitting this to happen. That meant he had the expertise to ensure himself all the time he wanted to get what they were after. I have suffered like that before and I know I have a breaking point. They made a copy of my harddrive, which is not concerning. I dont keep identifying details in digital format and theres little else of value on there. I dont know how long he questioned me directly, using violence when I hesitated, enough so that I couldnt keep my thoughts straight and could only tell him the stories I was collecting, their circumstances, and did not have the presence of mind to fabricate lies or hold anything back. Whoever they were looking for is not among my clients. That is the only comfort I can take from the surrender of my clients information. I was given a burner phone with a single number in its address book. If anyone contacted me - or I contacted them - I was to call that number and tell them what their story was. If it was the one they were interested in, they would ask for more information. Otherwise, I could keep my secrets. If I didnt - and theyd be keeping a close watch on me - theyd come back. He put a knife against my cheek, the tip resting close to my eye. And this time, he said, the damage would be a little more permanent. Then they beat me, three of them, until I went limp and no longer cared what became of me. My protection finally, finally intervened at that point. I felt his presence, opened my eyes and saw his ankle as he stood over top of me, stradling my prone body. I heard him telling the intruders in his cold, amused tone that they could go now. That I was not quite as strong as I led people to believe and that they would accidentally kill me if they continued. Their point was made, he continued. My will was broken. He never lies. He can, but he doesnt. I hate that. They left and my protection called my doctor. Theres a specific one that I pay to show up when I request and to not ask questions. No hospitals and no emergency rooms. That is our agreement. I am vulnerable outside of my house and it would be a simple matter for my enemies to spirit me away from a hospital while I lay there injured and unable to fight back. In the end, he at least coerced my protection to permit a visit to a radiology lab where he knew the staff and could talk our way in to get some imaging without an appointment and without records of me having been there. Not until the morning, however, and he started an IV and I slipped gratefully away on the pain medication he put into my veins. Ive long thought that my story was over. That the pain and the tragedy was done and I am merely living out my epilogue. I did not expect to be posting for my own sake, but I could think of no better way to warn you all. To my fellow proxies: forgive me, I never bothered to contact any of you before now because we are all secluded, cautious, people and I abhor social contact more than most. But they are coming for you. Shore up your defenses as much as you can. Run, if you think that will keep you safe. And if you fall into that mans hands just give him what he wants. Perhaps you think you are stronger or more clever than me, but I swear this: it will not be enough. To everyone else: if you think that this is your story and you are trying to find a way to safely post it - dont contact me. Im compromised now and I cant help you. But keep trying to find a way. Get your story out here because someone desperately doesnt want it seen, and I think that means that your story is not only one of the true ones its also one of the important ones. But be careful. They're looking for you and youre running out of time."
77,vulnerability,nosleep,Card #235 - echo on servers,28,cehv6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cehv6h/card_235_echo_on_servers/,2019-07-18 05:53:26,"So there I was, trying to talk down a demon in the server room of a small IT startup. We were mere feet apart; I had my hands up to show they were empty even though that was a detail irrelevant to the demon. It loomed over me, its singular teardrop-shaped eye glistening like purple glass. I spoke its language, the only reason it was hesitating from rending me apart. Process.exit(self(), :normal), I said. I did not actually say the parenthesis or any other syntactic punctuation. Theyre implied. Nothing. The demon continued to stare down at me through an eyeball that took up its entire face. Maybe say please? Nathan suggested from the doorway behind me. Thats not how this works! I hissed back. Time to take a more assertive approach. Process.exit(self(), :kill). Still nothing. Its name, I thought. I needed its name. I made another request of the demon, asking that it convert the output into a string so that it would come out as plain English instead of a horrific screeching like metal grinding on metal that would literally make my ears bleed. Then I did some quick conversions of my own, turning that string of numbers from binary to a list and then a list to a pid. Thank you random redditor for asking how to do this in a post from two years ago. Then, I strung all of that together and dropped it into yet another Process.exit call, except this time I named the demon as the target, and just to make extra certain I got the result I wanted, I used the :kill option. It was no longer a request that the demon could choose to execute, and peacefully shut down. It was a command and I wanted it dead. The demon shrieked. Shrill, inhuman, like a piece of sheet metal being ripped in half. Its eyeball split open to reveal a gaping maw, a fleshy pit lined with teeth and it raised one long arm, the mottled gray-purple flesh pitted as if with acid. Its wrist ended in a long, whip-like spike, tapering down to a needle-point that seemed to hang there, poised back behind its head, before beginning the downward descent that would sink it straight into my torso. My bad. I should have checked Process.info() to see if it was trapping exits. I hit the ground by instinct, letting gravity carry me down to the floor. It pierced the server rack behind me instead in a shower of sparks. This is why we ask all of our clients to make off-site backups before we proceed. Gunshots rang out overhead and the demon was thrown backwards. Then one of the bullets ripped through its knee, it went down, and Nathan was running past me to stand over it, unloading the rest of his clip into its chest. Its blood was vivid green and hissed and steamed as it spread across the hollow floor of the server room. So, I said carefully, starting to rise, I think it was trapping exits. I have no idea what that means, Nathan replied, his gaze intent on the demon, mechanically reloading *just in case.* I rubbed at my ears, as if that would help the ringing go away. I asked the demon to please go away nicely, it refused, I asked it to kill itself, it still refused, so I demanded it kill itself, except itd decided in advance that if it was told to die that it could do one last thing before *actually* dying and apparently that last thing was to go on a murderous rampage. *Neat,* Nathan replied. His tone indicated that he didnt actually care. So why didnt you lead with the command thingy first? I was being lazy. Did you hear that long list of conversions I had to do just to get its name? You were facing down an eight foot tall *demon.* You dont be *lazy* when staring at a demon with a giant mouth-eyeball instead of a face! I shrugged, pretending to not notice him staring at me in intense exasperation. I edged away from the growing pool of blood instead. It was fine, I mumbled. I had it under control. Hey - are your eyes starting to water? Mine are. I think this might be toxic. Probably had the Poison package loaded. Nathan muttered something about how my profession needed to think of less lethal names for our shit, but he followed me out of the server room. There wasnt anything else that needed to be done here. The demon would dissolve and be gone in a few hours, toxic blood and all. The server room was well-ventilated, so any remaining poison in the air would disperse until it was no longer harmful. Our on-site contact was waiting for us in a conference room on the opposite end of the building. It wasnt exactly *safe* to have someone else in the office while we were dealing with the demon, but the client had insisted. We compromised by putting him well away from the server room. Hed opened up the door, disabled the alarm so we could leave it propped open, and then got out of our way. He seemed intensely relieved when we entered the room with no visible injuries. I heard gunshots, he said anxiously, standing and shutting his laptop. An ops guy. They always got stuck with the late-night jobs. Nothing out of the ordinary, I said smoothly. We took care of it. It got one of your server racks, though. He swore colorfully. So we never got our off-site backup replication actually working, he said miserably. Business didnt want to make it a priority until next year. You you *did* tell them this could be highly destructive maintenance, right? He said glumly that he had. Hed argued this wasnt safe. There were tape backups, at least, but getting a hold of those, rebuilding the server, and loading the data could take days. They were looking at extended downtime and data loss. The sad part is, Im not sure telling upper management that there was the possibility of gunfire and demonic attack inside their server room would have changed things much. Welcome to IT. The guy that watched the football game on his laptop during the MBA class where the professor explained how the internet works? Hes now in charge of what work gets done. We also *cant* be upfront about what were doing. You know how everyone is vaguely aware that IT has a massive problem with security and everyones credit card number is stolen every other week? But the problem is just invisible enough that society hasnt collectively lost its shit and the stock market hasnt noped the hell out of here and collapsed the global economy? Weve taken a similar stance with the demons. We tried to create a world governed by principles. On and off. We took those laws and created layer upon layer and slowly, steadily, our humanity eroded those foundations. We programmed our own inconsistencies into the system, we made mistakes because that is what being human is like, until our creation outgrew us and now none of us understand the whole. We know fragments and in those forgotten spaces, in those dark unknowns were technology just is, something moved in. Its a well-kept secret, even inside of IT. Most people dont know. They see strange things and write it off to an odd bug or a trick of the imagination, while the rest of us that *do* know try to proactively identify incidents and ensure the silence of those involved. The government does a lot of the latter. They were the ones paying my company to perform this maintenance, actually. I think thats the only reason we were let in through the door - the client isnt footing the bill. Well, thanks for your help, the ops guy said. Hope you get *some* sleep tonight. I certainly wont. I thought about offering to help, maybe just pulling out the damaged server rack at the very least, but Nathan was bouncing from foot to foot impatiently, so I only told him to watch out for the puddle of poison blood and then let him escort us out of the building. I messaged our boss on Slack, saying that we were safe, we were done, and he could go to bed now. He had a policy of staying up until he knew wed all made it out okay. It was a forty-five minute drive back to our office. Nathan and I had elected to carpool. Id driven down, but the adrenaline was starting to wear off and I was beginning to get shaky, so I handed the keys off to Nathan. He was the only other person on the team that knew how to drive a stick shift, so he was permitted to drive my car. No one else could. It was a bit past midnight when we got on the road. I was starting to nod off once we reached the highway, my forehead bumping against the window. There was a brief impression of an image in the reflection of the glass as we passed under a street light and I snapped awake with a shot of adrenaline. Something purple, I thought, something that glittered like a teardrop. Heart hammering, I tried to tell myself it was just a trick of the mind, a nightmare manifesting while I was half-asleep. Nathan hadnt noticed; his gaze was fixed on the empty road ahead of us. Then, another brief image reflected on the glass as we passed under a streetlight. Slowly, desperately wanting this to be a figment of my imagination, I turned around and looked towards the back of the car. In the very back of the hatchback, where Id thrown my backpack with my laptop inside, crouched the Elixir demon. It was hunched over, bent almost double, its head pressed against the ceiling with that one gigantic eyeball fixed on us. Nathan, I said softly, evenly. Panic wouldnt help. I think the demon isnt dead. Yeah? he replied, not looking away from the road. Is the ops guy okay? Did he exit the building? It respawned *in the trunk.* My coworker glanced in the rearview mirror. He swore, the car swerved for a second as he twitched in reflexive shock, and then he got it back under control again while his jaw tightened with sudden tension. I dont think it can get to us, I continued. Its too big to move. Bless you and your stupid, tiny, Honda Fit, Nathan murmured. Okay. Let me find an exit and well pull over somewhere isolated and Ill shoot it a whole lot again. That apparently didnt work the first time. Do you have any better ideas? I did not. I told him to let me think. He drove in silence, periodically checking in the rearview mirror to make sure it hadnt moved. I tried to clear the screaming from my brain enough to *think*, to understand *why* it had come back and what to do to put it in the ground for good. There are different kinds of demons. This was an echo, a physical manifestation of a concept created when human and technology collide. Its as if our need to *name* things into known quantities sent out ripples into that empty space of technology. Specifically, it was an echo spawned from the programming language Elixir, which happened to be my current favorite language to work in. Its why I was sent on this particular job, after our triage team got a referral from another vendor about a problem with a small IT startup. Servers were doing odd things, they said. Just the ones with Elixir installed. And we got permission to run our diagnostics and there it was - the abnormality. The government contacted the company. Security vulnerability, they claimed. Very hush-hush. Agreements were signed. And Nathan and I piled into my tiny car and drove down there to take care of it. Now we had to save ourselves. I think its being supervised, I mused. By *what*? The demon has a boss? Nathan isnt an IT guy. Hes former military. Hes the one that carries a gun and tries to convince the team to go rucking with him on the weekends. Ive at *least* taken up running. Its a start. I ignored him and twisted in the seat to stare at the demon. I needed to find out the name of the supervising process. As long as the supervisor was alive, it would continue to restart the demon and wed never be able to kill it. But if we killed the supervisor, then that would eliminate the thing that was recreating the demon, as well as killing the demon in the process. So I tried simply asking if the demon knew its parent. Id never done this before, but it seemed like a reasonable thing to request. Turns out Process.parent(pid) isnt actually a thing. Thanks, Jos. Thanks a *lot.* I probably should have googled that first, to be fair. The demons face split open until it was nothing but teeth and a dark, open throat, and it shrieked. It struggled to stand in the tiny car, then one arm shot up, smashed into the roof, and then it brought it down onto the backseat. There was a squeal of twisting metal and the seat began to warp, the frame slowly being twisted downwards, and the demon surged into the gap. We were at least on an on-ramp. Nathan accelerated instead of slowing down, slinging the demon to one side as we rounded the curb. Floating in the air up ahead like a beacon was an empty sign frame for an abandoned gas station. Perfect. How did it even get in here?! Nathan snarled through gritted teeth, blowing past a stop sign at the end of the ramp and nearly spinning out from how fast he took that turn. Probably jumped into my laptop, I replied, hanging onto the doorframe tight enough to turn my knuckles white. Why do you have Elixir installed on your laptop!? Nathan screamed, barely audible over the whine and crack of my backseat finally snapping in two. I dont know, maybe because I need it to *do my job*?! He spun the car into the gas stations parking lot and brought it to a stop. We both tumbled out, just as the demons spikes slammed into the dashboard. I backed away, staring in horror as it thrashed like a fish on a line, puncturing my roof, shattering my windshield, and finally taking out the entire drivers side door as it tried to escape. There would be no repairing this. My car was totaled. Nathan had his gun out and he fired a quick three-shot burst, landing the bullets in the demons torso. The impact threw it back a pace, then it ducked its head and continued advancing, dragging its spike-hands on the ground behind it. They left grooves in the asphalt. We both turned to run. Nathan was faster than me, but he remained one pace behind, staying between me and the demon. Why isnt it dying!? he panted. Elixir demons are hard to kill! I yelled over the ringing in my ears. The language is *designed* to recover from failures! Well, can you tell them to make the language a bit less resilient!? Nathan shouted back. Im sure such a request will go over well. We took refuge behind an abandoned dumpster, which I think is an appropriate metaphor for the state of technology these days. Nathan checked his clip and peeked out from the edge to see what was happening. The demon rounded the corner of the building and it paused, uncertain of where wed gone. These kinds of demons were powerful, but they didnt handle unexpected situations well. I felt the faint glimmer of relief that we had a few more seconds in which to figure out how to survive. I got my phone out and began looking something up. We are running for our lives from a demon, Nathan hissed softly, and youre on your phone? Im looking up how to get the pid for a supervising process, I replied. You dont have that memorized? No, I dont Nathan, I snapped. Do you have the name and specs of every handgun you own memorized? He did. That was a poorly chosen analogy. He at least stopped after he rattled off five in an undertone, peering up over the lip of the dumpster. I focused on my phones screen. I didnt need to know where the demon was, nor did I really *want* to know. Nathan would tell me if it was time to run again. My hands shook as I opened search results and I quietly prayed to anything that was listening that my data connection didnt give up on me. There. Thats what I needed. An obscure little key called $ancestors would give me the parent process and presumably if I killed that one, itd kill the demon as well, and this time it would stay dead. My only indication that something terrible was about to happen was a sudden utterance of profanity from Nathan, interrupted halfway through by a resounding crash as the demon bodily landed on the lip of the dumpster. The metal buckled, collapsing like an accordion under its weight, and one of those spikes smashed into the ground in front of us. The asphalt cracked under the impact. Nathans shouting seemed to come from a distant place, my mind dazed by terror, but I moved by instinct, shoving myself onto my feet and sprinting forwards, unable to think of anything but Nathans commands to GO. Then, my brain clicked into action and I turned. Nathan was leaping backwards as the demon dropped off the edge of the dumpster. Nathan tensed, getting ready to dodge whatever it was about to do next. Buying me time. I had to act. I began to go through the sequence of commands to kill a process by name. My words were clear and even. Binary to list. List to pid. Pipe this to the command to kill the process. Nothing happened. Oh, I said absently. Thats right. I needed to drop the #PID from the front of that string. Look. This is why no one in the industry likes giving live code demos. (okay, maybe some do, but they probably enjoy skydiving in their free time too) Nothing goes right on the first try. Youre a terrible programmer! Nathan shrieked, desperately scrambling backwards as the demon brought a spike down into the spot where hed just been. It jerked its arm upwards convulsively, stopped short as its spike remained embedded in the asphalt. It tried to move forward, its shoulder yanked it backwards, and it stood there a moment before trying again. I felt the faint glimmer of relief that we had a few more seconds and I reissued the sequence of commands again, this time remembering to say &lt;0.84.0&gt; instead of #PID&lt;0.84.0&gt;. Yes, the difference matters. It *really* matters. The demon went motionless. It stood there for a minute, like a statue, frozen with one knee bent in its aborted struggle to free its spike from the asphalt. Processing the shutdown signal. Then its mouth peeled back, rolling down the side of its face and neck like turning a sock inside out, and continued on down across its shoulders and torso. It dissolution was strangely fluid, the green blood inside bubbling like an open cauldron. Then its unraveled body reached the tips of its clawed feet and it was wholly gone. I walked back to my car, dazed, all emotion wrung from me by the adrenaline that was still coursing through my blood. My beloved Honda was a twisted wreck, the frame bent, the roof dented, and the door clean clean off. My car, I whispered, stroking its twisted frame. My poor car. Nathan was on his cellphone nearby, calling for a tow. Then he called our boss to ask for a ride back into town. So thats my job. Thats what I do. I track down and eliminate the demons in the dark spaces between our computers. Im posting because I dont agree that we should keep this a secret. People are used to having their credit card data routinely stolen, after all, and we havent collapsed. Certainly, this time lives are on the line, but I think that is even *more* reason for people to know. We shouldnt give up our technology. It has and will continue to improve our lives. However, if someones phone is acting up they should know the warning signs and seek us out before something terrible happens. I wish I could give you my companys name, so you can contact us. However, I think that might be going a little too far. If Im anonymous (and Im not using our real names) then this story will be easily denied and the government can turn a blind eye to what a lone developer is doing. And who knows? Maybe telling my story will get people familiar with the idea that our technology isnt as safe as we thought and they can come clean someday. In the meantime if youre scared and need our help, post online somewhere that youre having a problem. Well find you."

Can he do to you the things that I do? I can take you higher Oh oh oh I'm on fire."" Bruce Springsteen [Part One](URL &amp;#x200B; It hit me like a train the exact moment I finished devouring my former boss. Guilt. *What had I done?* It wasn't so much regret at having eaten my boss Kevinhe had been an asshole, it was the fact of how I had now put the world around me at risk. Once I had killed... once I had tasted blood again, there would be no going back. I had known this fact and still done it anyway. Maybe I was a monster in more ways than one. After packing my things quickly into the truck bed, I headed for the east coast. Having moved locations often in the past ten years, the feeling wasn't new to me. Still, I had hoped to make a life here. I had even fallen in love with a young woman named Ellen. She had worked at the restaurant with me for a short time, and had been kind when others weren't. There is something else I've left out of the story. Kevin had been here fiance. It's possible that part of the animosity he had shown had been out of jealousy. Nothing ever happened between Ellen and I, but I will readily admit my love for her. I loved her from the first day we met, and though I had my suspicions that Kevin had struck her once or twiceit wasn't enough for me to have killed him sooner. A full moon hung over the dark highway, lighting the way out of California and back to where I belonged. Still, I had one stop to make. Ellen answered the door to her apartment midway into my second knock on the door. She had been expecting Kevin, and was worried. Though I was no longer in my other 'state,' the realization that I might not be fully back to normal suddenly crossed my mind. ""Gary?"" A look of curiosity washed across her face. ""You look... different."" Before I could speak, she continued. ""Did you see Kevin tonight? I'm worried about him. He was supposed to be home hours ago."" What the hell was I supposed to tell her? That I ate the son of a bitch? That I had enjoyed it? I lied. ""No, I haven't seen him. Ellen, I came here because..."" Suddenly I noticed her in a way I hadn't let myself before. The innocent light blue of her eyes. The graceful way in which she moved even in her worried state. The way her brown hair brushed up against the soft flesh of her neck. *The soft flesh of her neck.* *God... how I wanted to...* ""This was a mistake. I shouldn't have come here,"" I said, quickly using every last ounce of my self control to pull my eyes away from her. Before I could leave, she reached out and put her hand on my shoulder. ""Please don't go."" As I turned back one last time, the vulnerability in her eyes almost brought me to tears. Whether Kevin had hurt her or not, she had cared about himand I had ripped him from this world. *From her world.* ""I'm so sorry Ellen,"" I said, softly stepping away from her touch. I took one last look at her and pushed my darker desires back down into the abyss. When I made it back to my truck, I was greeted to the flashing lights of sirens turning into the apartment complex. I tried my best to avoid conflict, but I was too late. They knew who I was. ""Hands up! Get your hands up!"" the old officer yelled, shining his flashlight through the window. Staring blankly back at him, I tried to remain calm. ""I'll do what you want, just please don't shout at me. You have to be very caref"" ""Hands up I said!"" I did as he asked, raising them slowly. He opened the door cautiously. ""Step out of the vehicle and keep your hands up!"" Before my feet could touch the ground, I was grabbed tightly by a younger officer and shoved up against the driver's side door. Cuffing me aggressively, he yelled into my ears. I tried to remain calm, closing my eyes throughout the process and imagining I was somewhere else. ""You're under arrest!"" Although the young officer was too enthusiastic for his own good, I had still managed to contain myself. Perhaps I would have been able to avoid conflict altogether if not for what happened next. Without warning, I found myself lying face down in the gravel. ""Calm down Williams! He's cooperating,"" the older officer yelled... but it was too late. The flashing red and blue lights of the vehicles seemed to swirl around me now, and I began to change. The young officer let go quickly and drew his gun, pointing it down in my direction. The two policeman watched as deep muscles tore through clothing and my eyes began to gleam red. ""What the hell..."" the younger officer said, trailing off as the steel handcuffs snapped like cheap plastic. As I stood, he put three rounds into my chest. That had been a mistake. With little choice, I tore deep into the flesh of his neck. Bright arterial blood sprung upwards like a fountain and drenched my new form. I savored the taste. He collapsed, pressing his hand tightly against his neck and beginning to lose consciousness. *Two more shots*, this time into the center of my back. I turned around to see the old officer backing up towards his vehicle, the same look of terror that had been on Kevin having fallen across his face. I advanced, when suddenly he fell to the ground and clenched his chest tightly. Heart attack. I'm ashamed to admit what I would have done nextif not for the unexpected voice of Ellen that had called out from the shadows. ""Don't hurt him Gary,"" she pleaded, sobbing quietly. Ellen had seen everything I realized, looking over to her and then back at the officer. The guilt hurt worse than the bullets had. My eyes fell down towards the ground in shame, and I ran into the forest behind her home. I raced for hours, following the moonlight and making my way deep into the mountains. I knew what had to be done. There was one peak that stood out from the rest. It was far taller than the hills and mountaintops around, and it seemed to call out for me. After a few short minutes, I made my way up to the top. No flashing lights had been able to follow, and there was no longer any trace of civilization. I stood on the edge and stared down into the darkness below. My eyes were able to see fifty or so feet downwards, after which a thick fog concealed the remaining drop. Still, I figured it would be enough. If anyone reads this, I'm sorry for what I have done. I wish I could say that I never wanted to hurt anyone, or that I might one day be able to control the monster inside. I don't believe that anymore, and I now realize that all these years of trying to pretend were only going to end one way. *I should have jumped a long time ago.* [x](URL"

80,vulnerability,nosleep,I'm a proxy for nosleep stories,39,cgkxci,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cgkxci/im_a_proxy_for_nosleep_stories/,2019-07-23 09:41:40," When I started this account I had no intention of posting on my own behalf. I would be the voice of the desperate, who would otherwise be voiceless out of fear of the things that hunted them. Ive told you about people that have encountered gods or monsters; of people that fought or created demons; and even regaled you with the many mistakes of a person that has lived 139 years but was currently trapped in a 12 year old body. However, this happened to me and I am posting for myself. Im the person that runs this account. Its a proxy. I post things for people who want complete anonymity. Sometimes they contact me through one of the secure channels Ive set up. Mostly I find them, when they are at their most desperate for someone to know what has happened. It is a natural human instinct, I think. We desire to be remembered, we seek out others of our own kind to tell them our experiences. It is confirmation that we exist. That we matter. Perhaps that is why I am writing out my own story. I contact my clients and we make a deal. I secure their device, be it phone or otherwise, and they send me the gist of what has happened to them. I learn the details through my own methods. I learn who they are. Were. And I write. It is better this way. I can leave out incriminating details, depending on how much anonymity the person needs. You would be surprised how many people dont understand how dangerous a few scraps of information can be. You likely wouldnt be surprised by how many people struggle to tell their experiences coherently. That, too, I can correct. It is a learned skill, after all, best honed through practice. I want to be clear though - I do not embellish. Their story is their story and I do not alter it more than necessary for it to make sense. Comment replies are also proxied through me. These are harder to obtain and I try to gather them in batch, assuming the client wants to - or is capable of - replying at all. Im their first layer of defense against anyone - or anything - that might come after them and Ive spent considerable time and effort ensuring that this layer does not fail. I protect the people that come to me and more practically, I have to protect myself. There is quite a bit of danger involved. There are many entities that would prefer these stories never be told and if they cannot silence the source, they come for the proxy instead. Fortunately, I have both wealth and power at my disposal. My fortune is inherited. It is enough that, with careful management, I do not have to work. My siblings were careless and I think I would have turned out like them, were I not covetous in less material ways. We no longer speak to one another. I at least keep in contact with my familys various social connections, the ones that I can mobilize as another sort of defense on my behalf. I attend the galas and receptions and while I am not exactly a sociable person - there is a *sharp* edge to me, a keenness of my personality that people find unsettling - they at least recognize that I can be useful, and dangerous, and it would be to their benefit to stay in my good graces. Even in such civil company we can pick out our fellow predators. These are the weapons I deploy against our government. There are a couple posts they want removed and they bring me in periodically for futile attempts to coerce me to take them down. This is easy enough to counter. I have not yet told a story that couldnt be denied, both by them as to its truthfulness, and by myself as to my own belief of its veracity. I deal with madmen, I once told them, sitting on one end of a steel table in a featureless room. There were more people watching me from the other side of a mirror. I knew they were there. I knew who they were. I like to think it helps them, to have their story told. I dont believe what theyre telling me is true. They know Im lying. But how can they prove it? And they have to let me go, for there is nothing they can ultimately accuse me of. Still, they persist, holding me for hours and sometimes days. They yell. They make me as uncomfortable as they can without leaving behind evidence that I could present to our legal system. Its almost a game between us. They hate my arrogance. They would see me humbled, if they could. The horrors that my clients face are a different sort of threat. A more physical one. That, too, I have protection against. My house is defended both by technology and occult means. I have only been sought out twice. The first time, the creature made it onto my property but dared not venture onto the yard. I suspect it picked up my trail when I went to the funeral of its victim. It skulked about in the woods surrounding my property until I, growing weary of its presence, went out to face it personally. It has not returned. The second time they did not cross the property line. They remained on the road, studying the wall and the gate and all that lay around and beyond it. I came out to them, walking halfway down the drive. There was one in particular that came right up to the gate, a broad-shouldered man with khaki pants. A deliberate choice, so that I would recognize him from the details I gleaned from the narrator of their particular story. He met my gaze, I watched him smile and nod, a knowing, calculated gesture. Well be watching, it seemed to say. Watching and waiting. I understand what they wanted me to know. Should my protection ever fail, they will come and find me, and I will become theirs to do with as they wish. I feel cold inside, thinking of such a fate. Yet, I knew the risk, when I posted the story. If youre wondering why I do this despite the danger well, the full story is complicated and Im not comfortable sharing it just yet. I can tell you the *reason*, however. Back when it first happened I was desperate for someone to know, but there was no one to tell. No one that would believe me. I kept it inside me, I buried it deep until it rotted and I feel like the poison of my secrets still lingers in my blood. It made me into what I am now. Perhaps if I could have told someone, it would have turned out differently. I tell myself this is just wishful thinking. I was doomed from the start. It was only a matter of time and any help I could have found would only have delayed the inevitable. I just wish Id had the *choice*. So I take these risks to give others that choice. They take it and their relief is some kind of redemption for who I once was. Simply being heard gives them a sort of peace, even if it cannot save them from the things they face. Not all of my clients have survived. I have a scrapbook for the ones that died. I obtain copies of their missing persons reports; I go to their funeral and cut out the obituary from the local paper. This is probably unhealthy. My therapist said I needed to learn to put the problems of other people behind me, that I couldnt carry everyones suffering on my shoulders. That we were each responsible for our own sorrows. She has a page in my book. I wonder if she would still say that I should set my guilt aside, were she here, knowing the part I played in her death. I dont see a therapist anymore. I dont see much of anyone. Its just me, isolated in my house, writing these stories. I didnt intend to say anything about who I was when I started this. I like my privacy. However, I feel I must, that the circumstances demand it, that I have an obligation to warn the others. Im not the only proxy. The rest need to know what is coming for them. I was raided. I guess they went after me because Im one of the small ones and despite all my precautions, Im still vulnerable in that regard. If they can get past my defenses, then there is little I can do to harm them later, and if they were to kill me then there would be no backlash, no outcry. I would simply vanish like so many others do every day. The social connections Ive cultivated can only affect bureaucratic institutions; they can do nothing to stop a bullet once fired, and nor would they be willing to risk such a fate themselves for my sake. Vengeance requires a different sort of devotion. It requires followers. Fanatics, even. They disabled my physical security systems. I outsource much of that by necessity. I do not have the expertise to design and maintain my own security force, so I have hired the best in the field instead. The kind of security firm that is not available to the average person, that caters to an exclusive list of clients. My family name got me access and my money secured their services. Theyre not certain where the failure was. Theyve spent days inspecting my property now, testing the systems and determining that there was no hardware failure or software vulnerability that was exploited. They fear that my system was disarmed from within. Someone inside their organization is a saboteur and until they identify that individual, everyone is vulnerable. Do not rely on your security system. If theyve infiltrated one, theyve infiltrated others. My occult defenses are far more dangerous. I like to think that my security system is more for the protection of would-be trespassers, so that they are stopped by a non-lethal deterrent and do not stumble into something far worse. I will not detail what they are, for that would ruin the surprise. Suffice to say there was a *reason* the first supernatural creature to hunt me out did not leave the woods and attempt to cross the yard. The intruders did not disable my wards. They burned them out. I have my suspicions as to how, but if I am correct, then they took the evidence with them. My defenses are meant to hold off lone attackers, not a siege, and once they have been expended against an individual, they must be reset. If they came prepared with expendables then they could have burned through my defenses this way. That is just a theory. I did not find any bodies and it rained before I could inspect the yard, so the blood would have been washed away. Still. It is a plausible explanation. I felt the first of the wards go off a few hours after the sun had set. It was my first indication that I was under attack. I wasnt afraid, not at first. If my wards triggered, that meant they were doing their job. I went to the window at the fore of the house and pulled back the curtain to look. And I saw them, crossing the yard, dressed in black fatigues and almost impossible to discern in the moonless night. They carried assault rifles. I do have a safe room. This, however, was built by the same security firm that managed all my defenses (an oversight on my part, perhaps?) and I found it had already been sealed and I couldnt get in. The company cannot easily override it once sealed. They can, however, activate it remotely in the event the occupant is physically unable to trigger the lock-down once inside. Theyre currently re-evaluating whether this is an acceptable trade-off. After this discovery, it was too late for me; they were breaking down the front door and I felt those wards flare up and die and then they were inside the house. I went to the stairs to meet them. I heard glass breaking throughout my home - upstairs, the first floor - and more wards flared and died as they canvassed all of my escape routes. They neednt have bothered. I was not going to try to run at this point. I understood the futility. They took me to the largest room in the house, an open space with glass windows covering all three walls to provide a scenic view of the surrounding woods. They shoved the furniture out of the way and threw me to the floor in the middle of the room. I knew what this meant and for a moment I couldnt move or speak, frozen in dread of what was to come. There was one in particular that did all the questioning. He wasnt armed like the others. He had an easy confidence about him, the sort that comes with power. When he crouched by my side it was like we were the only two people in the room, like all those men with their guns were irrelevant and he was all that was necessary to get what they wanted. He reached out, took my glasses off my face, looked at them a moment and then threw them across the room. You tell stories, he said to me. His tone was casual, like we were simply meeting in a bar and having a friendly conversation. You didnt need to come to my house. You could have just read them online, I replied, putting my hands beneath me in an attempt to rise. He put a hand onto the back of my neck and I went still again. You post *dangerous* things. Peoples experiences, the kind no one wants to see or acknowledge, because then none of us are safe. A pause. Were looking for someone with a story. They havent told it yet, but we think they plan to, and it cannot be told. Ive heard this before. I put some scorn in my voice. You know what happens when I post? People read it, I get maybe a couple hundred upvotes, maybe only a few dozen if Im unlucky. Thats not enough to matter. His hand slipped up to my hair, gripping it tight and pulling my head back. It *is* enough, he said and I heard his conviction and my mouth went dry with fear. *No one* can know and the only way to ensure that happens is to make sure it is *never written down.* He demanded access to my computer. He wanted to know who I was in contact with, whose stories I was currently considering. What they were about. He wanted names and locations. And when I refused, testing their conviction, he broke the bones in my left hand, one by one. I gave him what he wanted. I understand the frailties of the flesh. He wasnt going to kill me, otherwise my last protection would have intervened already, rather than remaining hidden and permitting this to happen. That meant he had the expertise to ensure himself all the time he wanted to get what they were after. I have suffered like that before and I know I have a breaking point. They made a copy of my harddrive, which is not concerning. I dont keep identifying details in digital format and theres little else of value on there. I dont know how long he questioned me directly, using violence when I hesitated, enough so that I couldnt keep my thoughts straight and could only tell him the stories I was collecting, their circumstances, and did not have the presence of mind to fabricate lies or hold anything back. Whoever they were looking for is not among my clients. That is the only comfort I can take from the surrender of my clients information. I was given a burner phone with a single number in its address book. If anyone contacted me - or I contacted them - I was to call that number and tell them what their story was. If it was the one they were interested in, they would ask for more information. Otherwise, I could keep my secrets. If I didnt - and theyd be keeping a close watch on me - theyd come back. He put a knife against my cheek, the tip resting close to my eye. And this time, he said, the damage would be a little more permanent. Then they beat me, three of them, until I went limp and no longer cared what became of me. My protection finally, finally intervened at that point. I felt his presence, opened my eyes and saw his ankle as he stood over top of me, straddling my prone body. I heard him telling the intruders in his cold, amused tone that they could go now. That I was not quite as strong as I led people to believe and that they would accidentally kill me if they continued. Their point was made, he continued. My will was broken. He never lies. He can, but he doesnt. I hate that. They left and my protection called my doctor. Theres a specific one that I pay to show up when I request and to not ask questions. No hospitals and no emergency rooms. That is our agreement. I am vulnerable outside of my house and it would be a simple matter for my enemies to spirit me away from a hospital while I lay there injured and unable to fight back. In the end, he at least coerced my protection to permit a visit to a radiology lab where he knew the staff and could talk our way in to get some imaging without an appointment and without records of me having been there. Not until the morning, however, and he started an IV and I slipped gratefully away on the pain medication he put into my veins. Ive long thought that my story was over. That the pain and the tragedy was done and I am merely living out my epilogue. I did not expect to be posting for my own sake, but I could think of no better way to warn you all. To my fellow proxies: forgive me, I never bothered to contact any of you before now because we are all secluded, cautious, people and I abhor social contact more than most. But they are coming for you. Shore up your defenses as much as you can. Run, if you think that will keep you safe. And if you fall into that mans hands just give him what he wants. Perhaps you think you are stronger or more clever than me, but I swear this: it will not be enough. To everyone else: if you think that this is your story and you are trying to find a way to safely post it - dont contact me. Im compromised now and I cant help you. But keep trying to find a way. Get your story out here because someone desperately doesnt want it seen, and I think that means that your story is an important one. But be careful. They're looking for you and youre running out of time."
81,vulnerability,nosleep,Red Onset (Part Two),6,chg1i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/chg1i1/red_onset_part_two/,2019-07-25 09:49:50,"Ive decided none of this matters, but Ill type it out anyways, to at least give youthe readera fighting chance against the inevitable end. If youve read my last post, then youll know what became of my home and the person I promised to spend eternity with. That was four days ago, and Ive been preparing for what's to come ever since. You haven't heard on the news or from your politicians about these unusual heart storms have you? No alert buzzing on your phone warning of nearing, cardiac weather, followed by precautions to stay indoors so as not to be hailed upon and crushedlike my wife was? No, you havent heard from anyone other than me I suppose. This news is being intentionally kept from you, and I suspected foul play on the governments part when I finally arrived at this hotel in Sedona, AZ that I'm currently writing from, only to find people going about their daily rituals, undisturbed. My homeland, Dintah, the Navajo reservation, seems to be one of the few places struck by the unusual weather. The Navajo reservation, continually exploited throughout history, and now housing some of the most precious material of allthe hearts of our loved ones who've been cast from the heavens. Where else in the world similar instances of falling hearts occurred is impossible to tell. The powers that be are doing a pretty good job of keeping the public steeped in ignorance. When I arrived in this small city, with its connection to the modern world still intact, I couldn't believe not one record of the storm had made itself available to the public yet? I've been checking the news every now and again on the television provided in my hotel room, and still it seems the world is going about their day, unburdened and ignorant of the fact that God has abandoned us. It's a good thing I'm here then, to tell you of events the government thought best to keep hidden...or maybe you would be better off left unknowing? Will the world go crazy knowing there is no certainty of heaven for them anymore? Is He waiting for us all to run around like headless hensoh I bet Hed really enjoy the view from His comfy, omnipotent seat. Still, I hope I can help those of you with this knowledgewhomever is reading thisand Ill try to tell you all I can as the creature reveals to me more of its secrets. I don't have long to explain everything because the creature is expecting me back tonight...it was the creatures belief as well that I shouldn't tell you, but I'm still human and not heartless. Speaking of heartless, I wonder where the bodies that once housed those disregarded hearts now reside. Maybe you might have some clues? But we are still living and a worst storm is coming whose epic might will wipe out most of us, so let me hurry and begin, and please, take heed: The night of the storm, the creature that had snatched me up, deposited me to the safety confines of a dark cave high in the nearby mountains, placing me onto the hard cold floor and quickly scurrying back to the caves mouth to take in the wondrous view. All I could do was tremble and hold my injured arm to prevent it from flopping uselessly around. I swear I thought my heart was going to stop for all I could hear was its thunderous pounding on my chest and in my ears, its panicked hammering louder than the din of the storm. *Hes throwing quite a fit, isnt He?* the creature finally spoke, then cackled loudly into the air, as the waves roared safely below us, splashing the mountains faade in shades of red. The voice was feminine, inhuman, with a bit of sinister nature that raised the hairs on my body. I watched its silhouette against the backdrop of the red, darkening sky, as it excitedly bounced around the open mouth of the cave, finally settling on a perched position were better view must have been afforded. Blood dripped, showering the creature, who remained fixed, crouched at the edge, bathing in the blood of the dead, until it leaned its head back to howl a cry that promulgated through the air and my being. The sky was darkening, as the sun finally descends in the west, and the creature slowly disappears in the obscurity of total blackness. I believe the thing could still see in the distance, but I couldnt see anything, not even my hands in front of me. I could just hear the continuing storm. It was in this state of total vulnerability that the creature finally introduced itself: *Dont be scared, Ive been waiting to meet you for some time now,* the creature meant to comfort me, but still I shook uncontrollably. It moved from its spot at the caves entrance, inching its way closer to me, all the while clicks and pops emitted from the dark as it moved. I imagined joints and limbs being moved in ways they were not meant to. Who are you? I inquired to the dark. I shut my eyes to focus more on the sound of its approaching presence. It was suddenly a foot in front of me, and as it spoke, its hot breathe whipped against my face, leaving burning impressions on my flesh *Ive been dreaming about you a lot latelygrandson.* The revelation floated through the space between us, creating an atmosphere of kinship that eased my worried mind. So it is that I am descendant of this thing, this wicked thing that prowls around at night. Theres a name among Navajos, given to such people as my grandmother, but Id rather not use it, out of respect for her who saved me from a flood of blood. *Yes, relaxI can hear your heartbeat slowing, and your nerves are returning to unexcited states. I need you to keep an open mind yzh, for theres lots to show you and so little time. Did you see Him, up in the sky? I saw him too, in fact, I knew this day would come for some time now. Ive been watching over you, from a distance, so that I could rescue you at the moment you needed rescuing. Theres a power inside you that youre not aware ofits in your DNA, just waiting for you to activate it and use at your will.* As she spoke, her breathe continued scorching my face, invisible flames dancing across my features making my eyes water and my stomach turn. Only something primal could emit such a burning stench. Still I listened, respectfully. *I have seen what is to come, what I can show better than tell...* Its then a flame lit up, by a cheap lighter, procured from somewhere on her person, and now held within her bony, brown fingers. Her face resembled my mothers, except this aged versions skin hung loosely about her bones, and her eyesher eyes were the blackest imaginable. She wore a chiefs blanket bearing plain white and black faded stripes along its length. The blanket was the only clothing I could make out on her form, along with a belt, with various buckskin sacks attached to its leather. For the most part, she was nude, but unbothered, much like a wild beast. I noticed another set of eyes staring and so I looked up, and there, perched atop her head, was a coyote pelt. Its legs danced about her shoulders while its long face rested on her foreheadits eyes gleamed with life. *Come closer grandson. Peer into my eyes and see what I have seen.* She brought her free hand up and cradled my face, pulling me closer. Our faces were almost touching, just inches from the other, when I noticed her eyes were swimming with stardust, and I began shrinking, and falling into those black omnipotent eyes. Soon I was swallowed whole, or my consciousness was, and I was speeding past star clusters and black holes, until my consciousness dissolved into itself. Thats when the visions commenced, some of which involved relatives, all of which comprised misery. The first scene is my only uncle on my dads side, shown slouched against some crumbling, closed-down building, an empty bottle of whiskey clutched tightly to his chest like a close relative. A hooded stranger approaches and my uncle takes notice, quickly reaching out and begging for some change. The stranger responds by kicking him furiously in the face until his feature are erased. This scene spirals into itself and Im then thrust into the next. I find that I can only view the scenes as if I was a passing spectator, with no conscious control. I can only watch as I find myself in the pharmacy of a food store. The shelves are nearly empty and hundreds of people crowd around the counter, waitingtheir faces secreting pus and disease as they scream for help. My cousin Darryl is in that sick mess, when a gunshot rings out and the crowd stampedes in all directions. All I can is Darryl being crushed under the fleeing mob when the scene spirals into itself, and Im thrust yet again into scene after scene of increasingly horrible deaths, of family and of humanity entire. The last scene, a mass exodus of anguished souls, their immobile faces staring into nothingness, as if their consciousness had receded back into their skulls. They trudged silently through barren desert as fire and smoke roared high behind them, their cities fallen and abandoned. This is what my grandmother showed meour oblivion. My grandmother let the lighter flick off and I returned to the cave and the present. So now you know reader. Whether you listen to my words and prepare for the coming apocalypse is now not my concern, but Ill still keep those of you willing to listen updated on events as I learn of them. I myself am taking measures most will frown upon, but I know you will understand that what Im planning to do is born out of necessity. Tonight, I will be initiated into the world of ancient magic so few have knowledge of. My grandmother is waiting for me, and police have shown up to the hotel Im staying at. The family Ive stolen possessions from, including this laptop Im typing on, must have alerted them, so I must be off. You know what? Why should I be afraid of revealing who I am, who I come from?After tonight, Ill have no one to fear except Him, for soon I shall be a *skinwalker* like my grandmother. Only then could I hope to survive. Ill let you know how it goes. "

The sudden movement stopped her short, and she nearly fell to the ground before catching her balance and staring straight at me. She looked anxious enough to shit a literal brick, which would have been the fourth-weirdest thing Id seen all day. Promise youll blow my head off if things go south? I asked, digging into her biceps with my fingers. She pursed her lips. Only because I know youd do the same for me, she responded grimly. We pulled down our gas masks, and she armed her blaster. Stay in the fucking car! Kelly screamed from next to us, her mask already in place. If Stereotypical Suburban Family heard her, they made no indication. Allie turned around and tapped her blaster so that the three people still in the car knew she meant business. Then we turned to face the screaming mass of humanity fleeing the Charlotte Airport. Against the crowd, we ran inside. * I didnt know *exactly* what we were looking for, but I knew it would make itself very apparent. I was right. Its amazing how we react to shock. Some people yell and scream. Others show no outward reaction at all as their brains silently shred themselves. Hell, my nephew jerked off for a month straight when his girlfriend died in a car wreck, and my sister was at her wits end with crusty laundry because Junior didnt know how else to cope. But the sight before me defied categorization. In the middle of the security line, an explosion of human casserole had left a thirty-foot radius of awful offal. Several feet of intestine coiled around a lone womans neck like Christmas garlands. With outward calm, she was mindlessly plucking miscellaneous organs off the floor. Rivulets of blood streamed down her bangs and cheeks, and she nearly slipped in the gore as she bent down to grab a gall bladder. Everyone else had fled the scene. Kelly! I screamed. Check her! Allie  guard the door! Allie paused as Kelly ran toward the organ-collecting woman. Martin, Allie explained slowly, shes been doused in human juice. I need to end this. Shes almost certainly infected. Exactly, I nodded. *Almost.* The shell-shocked woman gave no resistance as Kelly plunged the needle into her head. Tammy, she mumbled softly, I have to find all of her pieces and put her back together. Kelly looked up from her green fluid test tube with as much shock as could be expressed through a gas mask. Shes clear, Kelly explained in surprise. No signs of infection whatsoever. I felt numb with shock. It was too good to be true. Chuck Limsky, you son of a bitch, I whispered to myself. You were right about one thing, at least. I ran to the woman who was now wearing a liver as a hat. Listen, you want to save your  Tammy? She snapped into focus. You can save my Tammy? Sirens began to wail in the distance. It sounded like dozens of them were racing our way. I held out my hand. Yes, I can save her. But only if you come with us, and only if you do it right now. * Stereotypical Suburban Family shared a single seat during the next car ride. Nobody wanted to sit next to Blood Girl, who had the entire back row to herself. She cradled brain spaghetti and one errant eyeball like a Barbie doll. * I want to show you something very odd, I explained to her as we entered the restricted hallway through the security door. But first, lets get to know each other. My name is Martin Henwood. These are my colleagues, Allie and Kelly. Minute by minute, she was recovering from her shock and returning to earth. Im Im Melissa. Tammy was- She couldnt finish her sentence. Allie wrapped a soothing arm around her shoulder and gently ushered her forward. Tammy was someone very special to you, Allie finished for her. Melissas breath came in short bursts. I  I  its  I never  I never told her how I felt, and now its too- She would have fallen if Allie hadnt steadied her. I turned to face Melissa. What if I told her that you could have her back? She looked at me with the desperation of a drowning sailor. Her face told me she was terrified of the vulnerability that hope represented, but that she had no choice besides latching on to anything offered her. You have a gift, Melissa, Kelly explained soothingly. Youre completely immune to the *thing* that is spreading this outbreak. But Melissa responded shakily, how does that help Tammy? Here she pulled a sinewy string of stray viscera from her hair. I smiled and turned toward a large window in the wall. I want you to take a look at the table in room 19, I explained calmly. She followed me and stared. Um, its a grape. Its a grape that was plucked *six months* ago, I corrected. But thats  thats impossible, Melissa stammered. You just watched your girlfriend turn into a spontaneous water balloon, and I spent the past several days chopping my boyfriends wooden fingers off after they turned into a goddam forest, Kelly interjected. Impossible got cancelled last fucking week. Melissa looked ready to cry. All this gives us reason to hope, I explained quickly. What should be dead can be alive. That can be a wonderful thing. Allie led Melissa a few feet down the hall. I followed them, and soon we were looking into another room with a 13 on the door. A man was staggering toward the large window. He would have crashed into us if it werent for the transparent barrier between us. He was close enough to see the whites of his eyes. Thats all he had. There were no pupils. The man slammed his palms on the glass. Melissa jumped. Then he screamed. Allie tightened her grip as Melissa tried to squirm her way to freedom. Then he exploded. Chunks of diced guts clung to the glass as the thick coat of blood slowly cascaded downward. One severed finger, stuck to the window with globs of gooey human mash, gently rolled its way downward. Why are you making me see this? Melissa shrieked. I reached out and pressed her head so close to the glass that she was fogging it with her breath. Watch. Bubbling from the blood were squirmy bits and crawly legs. At first, there were only a few. Then there were dozens. Then hundreds. Soon, the ocean of blood was a boiling, writhing mass of wiggling larvae and drowning flies. Sometimes, I explained in a low voice, what should be dead can be alive. And that can be a *terrible* thing. Melissa, head still locked in place by Allies firm grip, was sheet-white. This is how its happening. Or, this is at least *part* of how its happening. There are several ways that this malady is attacking our species, I continued softly. Allie then released Melissa, and the latter turned to face me. And there are many forces at work that would rather see the human species fail. I paused. Melissa looked terrified. Good. Melissa, you seem to be immune. Were we lucky to find you? We have no idea. You could be one in ten, or one in a million. What we *do* know is that you may hold the key to understanding this threat, which means you may have the key to *stopping* it. I breathed deeply. And if we can understand what makes dead things into living ones, well  wed be happy to see if Tammy can be revived. That would be a small token of gratitude for your indispensible contribution. I cannot describe the look that broke across Melissa face in that moment, but I know I could die a happy man if I once experienced that level of hope and joy. Yes, yes yes yes of course! What do you need from me? I smiled. Kelly will help you get ready. Youre amazing, Melissa. I know that things seem very dark right now, but this story just might have a happy ending after all. Melissa threw herself forward in sloppy, still-bloody hug that shook my body. Grinning, I hugged her back. She shook like the frailest leaf in my arms. Go on, I whispered. Weve got a lot of people to save. She pulled away, beaming, and walked down the hall with Kelly. Blood squished in her sandals with every step. Once she was out of earshot, Allie approached me. Do you think the zombies go to hell? I asked heavily. If you believe in souls, then there must be two spirits in one body after an infection. Maybe they go two different places when they die. I shrugged. I just want to know how many familiar faces Ill see once Im roasting in Hades. Allie laid a gentle hand on my shoulder, but I didnt react. Were trying to save people, she offered meekly. Were *attempting* to find a cure, yes. But we *know* that were sending Melissa to die. I sighed. I almost hate her for believing that revival bullshit so quickly. Truth be told, it would be easier if she hated my guts. Allie withdrew her hand from my shoulder. Well, Limskys neighbors are in place, and Melissas nearly there. You were right, by the way  he *did* physically contact Limsky, then lied about it when we asked him. I dont know if were playing God or Satan, Allie. She folded her arms. I think that people tell themselves that there isnt a difference between the two when the moral dilemma gets too great. I nodded slowly. Well, no matter how we choose to interpret it, a lot of people [are about to die](URL [BD](URL"

She looked at me with the desperation of a drowning sailor. Her face told me she was terrified of the vulnerability that hope represented, but that she had no choice besides latching on to anything offered her. You have a gift, Melissa, Kelly explained soothingly. Youre completely immune to the *thing* that is spreading this outbreak. But Melissa responded shakily, how does that help Tammy? Here she pulled a sinewy string of stray viscera from her hair. I smiled and turned toward a large window in the wall. I want you to take a look at the table in room 19, I explained calmly. She followed me and stared. Um, its a grape. Its a grape that was plucked *six months* ago, I corrected. But thats  thats impossible, Melissa stammered. You just watched your girlfriend turn into a spontaneous water balloon, and [I spent the past several days chopping my boyfriends wooden fingers off after they turned into a goddam forest](URL Kelly interjected. Impossible got cancelled last fucking week. Melissa looked ready to cry. All this gives us reason to hope, I explained quickly. What should be dead can be alive. That can be a wonderful thing. Allie led Melissa a few feet down the hall. I followed them, and soon we were looking into another room with a 13 on the door. A man was staggering toward the large window. He would have crashed into us if it werent for the transparent barrier between us. He was close enough to see the whites of his eyes. Thats all he had. There were no pupils. The man slammed his palms on the glass. Melissa jumped. Then he screamed. Allie tightened her grip as Melissa tried to squirm her way to freedom. Then he exploded. Chunks of diced guts clung to the glass as the thick coat of blood slowly cascaded downward. One severed finger, stuck to the window with globs of gooey human mash, gently rolled its way downward. Why are you making me see this? Melissa shrieked. I reached out and pressed her head so close to the glass that she was fogging it with her breath. Watch. Bubbling from the blood were squirmy bits and crawly legs. At first, there were only a few. Then there were dozens. Then hundreds. Soon, the ocean of blood was a boiling, writhing mass of wiggling larvae and drowning flies. Sometimes, I explained in a low voice, what should be dead can be alive. And that can be a *terrible* thing. Melissa, head still locked in place by Allies firm grip, was sheet-white. This is how its happening. Or, this is at least *part* of how its happening. There are several ways that this malady is attacking our species, I continued softly. Allie then released Melissa, and the latter turned to face me. And there are many forces at work that would rather see the human species fail. I paused. Melissa looked terrified. Good. Melissa, you seem to be immune. Were we lucky to find you? We have no idea. You could be one in ten, or one in a million. What we *do* know is that you may hold the key to understanding this threat, which means you may have the key to *stopping* it. I breathed deeply. And if we can understand what makes dead things into living ones, well  wed be happy to see if Tammy can be revived. That would be a small token of gratitude for your indispensible contribution. I cannot describe the look that broke across Melissa face in that moment, but I know I could die a happy man if I once experienced that level of hope and joy. Yes, yes yes yes of course! What do you need from me? I smiled. Kelly will help you get ready. Youre amazing, Melissa. I know that things seem very dark right now, but this story just might have a happy ending after all. Melissa threw herself forward in sloppy, still-bloody hug that shook my body. Grinning, I hugged her back. She shook like the frailest leaf in my arms. Go on, I whispered. Weve got a lot of people to save. She pulled away, beaming, and walked down the hall with Kelly. Blood squished in her sandals with every step. Once she was out of earshot, Allie approached me. Do you think the [zombies](URL go to hell? I asked heavily. If you believe in souls, then there must be two spirits in one body after an infection. Maybe they go two different places when they die. I shrugged. I just want to know how many familiar faces Ill see once Im roasting in Hades. Allie laid a gentle hand on my shoulder, but I didnt react. Were trying to save people, she offered meekly. Were *attempting* to find a cure, yes. But we *know* that were sending Melissa to die. I sighed. I almost hate her for believing that revival bullshit so quickly. Truth be told, it would be easier if she hated my guts. Allie withdrew her hand from my shoulder. Well, Limskys neighbors are in place, and Melissas nearly there. You were right, by the way  he *did* physically contact Limsky, then lied about it when we asked him. I dont know if were playing God or Satan, Allie. She folded her arms. I think that people tell themselves that there isnt a difference between the two when the moral dilemma gets too great. I nodded slowly. Well, no matter how we choose to interpret it, a lot of people [are about to die](URL [BD](URL"
84,vulnerability,nosleep,Jupiter's Rules [Part Four],11,clp1gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp1gv/jupiters_rules_part_four/,2019-08-04 08:52:15,"[Part One](URL [Part Two](URL [Part Three](URL Jups Rules still applied, as we found out when we entered the hotel room that served as his home for the rest of his short life. He sat outside in the hall, the hood of his sweatshirt over his face to hide the tears, while I dismantled the mirrors and television and moved them onto a luggage cart. I put the godawful landscape prints on there too, for good measure. With the extra comforter from the closet (and a staple gun - which I felt guilty about using, but the $50 security charge didnt seem like much anymore) I covered the window entirely. With none of those little touches, as ostentatious as they'd always felt to me, the hotel room seemed much less welcoming. Wed had to take an upper-floor room, and it was a large chain hotel, which gave off the illusion of being trapped. In fact, it made the damn thing feel like a cell, and it wasnt long before Jup and I were pacing it like caged tigers. I think youd feel safer in the hospital, I eventually told him. Jup only shook his head and pulled his hood up again. At least consider it, I said, hearing and hating the pleading note in my voice. Were out of the house, but this is going to have an effect- I know you dont want to deal with it, he said dully. I get it, Dad, I really do. I dont want to deal with it either. But I cant go to a hospital. Why? I was exasperated, but I didnt have it in me to yell at him anymore. Theres no way to escape, he said. He didnt meet my eyes, though, and even then I knew deep in my heart what he meant. How do you address a thing like that? I couldnt. But Venus had always spoken frankly about suicide with Jup, and she never talked about it as a secret or hidden temptation. She talked about it with him, as honestly and openly as she did everything else, and encouraged him to share those feelings if he had them. Needing to keep that door open is okay, she explained to me once. If you dont have a plan, and youre not actively idealizing the concept of suicide, its okay. Its just a way for people like me and Jup to feel in control. Its good to know we have a way out if we need it. It doesnt mean we ever intend to take that way out. But we deserve a choice. I always understood the wisdom in this, but something in me shied away from that kind of vulnerability, I guess. So we didnt talk. Instead we ate microwaved frozen waffles, soaked in puddles of maple syrup we poured out from tiny capsules filched from the breakfast bar downstairs, and went to bed without even the comfort of bad hotel TV to silence our thoughts. The hotel phone rang during the night, waking me from the light doze Id managed to fall into. Jups little touch lamp wasnt a particularly harsh light, but Ive never been able to sleep in anything but a pitch-black room. Before I could do anything more than sit up, I heard Jups voice, thick with sleep, mumble a greeting into it. There was a long silence, then the soft click of the receiver being replaced. Who was that? He didnt say, only stared at me with wide, hurt eyes. Jup, buddy, talk to me. I pushed up from the sofa (Id insisted Jup take the single bed, despite my bad back, and instantly regretted it). Who was on the phone? Was...was it Mom? No, he whispered. Then who? He only shook his head, and in the dark room, it was hard to tell if he was refusing to answer, or just bewildered. There was a sudden, loud crack from behind the makeshift extra curtain Id stapled over the window. Both of us jumped near out of our skins - it had been an unnaturally loud snapping noise, like a nearby gunshot. It put a memory into my mind at once. As a kid, I watched my uncle and father chop halfway through the thick trunk of an old oak, then push it off-balance, until the remaining wood finally splintered and the tree went over. Neither Jup or I dared raise the hanging comforter to investigate what might have happened. With all the lights turned on, the room felt more like a trap, but at least nothing could lurk in the shadowy corners. Even so, neither of us could close our eyes until after sunrise. The next day was hard. We didnt know what to do with ourselves, really, and I think thats why we fought. That, and the sneaking sensation that we were trapped. Jup had left his cell phone at the house, and although I could tell he was annoyed to have lost his constant source of entertainment and distraction, he refused to look at mine. That could be where it happens next, he said. I turned mine off. It seemed too logical to ignore. But the boredom didnt cure itself. Every time one of us suggested something we could do, or somewhere to go, the other one of us vetoed it. At first this was pretty simple; the movies were too dark, and we couldnt trust screens - of course that wasnt an option. The closest bookstore was filled with TV screens, and the library had a movie marathon on for local kids. Wed gotten bored of mini golf and bowling, not that either had really held our attention. I called around, looking for tickets for sports events or something, but it was a Monday, and nothing we followed was in season anyway. So we just sat around, letting our fear tether us. As the hours passed, I ordered lunch from the hotel restaurant. Neither of us were hungry enough to eat it, and we got progressively more irritable with one another. Jup was always an easygoing kid, but he was on edge all day. We were both exhausted. Despite our numerous attempts, napping was as impossible as eating. We took about a half dozen showers each, and waited. Maybe we knew what we were waiting for. Shortly after sundown, the hotel phone rang. This time, neither of us answered. After what seemed like an eternity of ringing, it went silent. But Jup didnt relax after that. He still sat bolt upright in bed, eyes wide and blank with animal panic, his chest heaving. His heart was breaking, I believe, and that broke mine. A sob tore itself free of his throat, and I laid down and closed my eyes when I heard it. Im a coward, yeah, but there are some things that even a good father cannot watch. Whatever I expected might happen that night, it wasnt what *did* happen, and I dont think even you could fault me for that. I woke in the early hours of pre-dawn to the innocent sounds of faraway traffic and chirping crickets. It took a horribly long time for me to comprehend what this meant, and even longer to claw my way out from under the nest of blankets and into the open. The blanket had been torn down from the windowsill; I saw scraps of fluttering white fabric hanging like tiny ghosts from the staples. The room was littered with feathers and old, worn batting. The citys sleepless glow poured through the window, filling the room with the sort of orange not-quite-light that made everything feel like a dream. The window had been smashed - it was the typical double-paned, bulletproof glass that modern hotels have in those false windows that cant be opened at all, to prevent suicides - and glass littered the carpet. Only a few shards still poked up from the sill. I hadnt heard the breakage at all. I dont know if there even was a sound, to be honest. But I know something came through that window and into our hotel room. I know that much, because the only way glass gets into a room when the window breaks is if something smashes through from the other side. What I dont know, or want to know, is what it was. Thats one thing Im sure about. We were on the fifteenth floor, remember, and there were no other buildings of that height anywhere nearby. Jup stood in the open gap where the glass had been, his back to me, facing out into the night. He had gone to bed wearing a pair of sweatpants and one of my old college t-shirts, but now he was naked. Both feet were planted firmly, if a bit further apart than his normal stance, on the thin outer lip of the windows false front. His arms were stretched to the sides, gripping the sills edges. I could see his hair ruffling in the light breeze. I must have jumped to my feet, or maybe I screamed - I dont recall doing either, but I was upright, and he turned back to look at me. I dreaded startling him, perched so precariously, but he seemed balanced. In fact, his movement was almost graceful; his arms and legs didnt move, he only glanced back at me over his shoulder. He watched me silently. His face seemed calm, almost serene, his eyes wide and innocent. Jup, please, dont, I said. My voice sounded hoarse and half-strangled, almost unrecognizable as my own. DADDY- The word came in a guttural, snorting noise from low in the back of his throat. His body barely moved, except for the heaving of his chest as he drew in more air in a repulsive gulping screech, only to belch it out again - not the voice of my son, but the demonic snarl of some otherworldly creature. Id taken two steps back before I realized that this was not possession. This was the sound of pure, mortal, insane terror. My eyes had adjusted in the dim light, and now I saw why he seemed so balanced - blood seeped from the bottom and sides of the empty windowsill and traced thin rivers across the dark carpet, sparkling like spilled wine where it covered the snowfall of broken glass. This time it *was* coming from him. Hed stomped on two huge shards of glass; the glittering, ruby tips poked up from the instep of each foot. His fingers dripped with blood where they gripped the narrow sides of the window. I saw another iceberg-tip of glass jutting from just behind the knuckles of his left hand. The other must have missed his grip - the glass dug into the heel of his hand and disappeared, but his wrist was bulging grotesquely. The hotel phone was ringing, ringing, ringing. It sounded to me like laughter, like the mad laughter of the comedy audience as my dead wifes grave companions crawled and skittered over them. Jups face was set in what looked like childlike solemnity, but his eyes were deranged. They bulged from the sockets, and rolled wildly back in his head. His eyes...and his voice, that choking, sobbing, crazy fucking voice. I can still hear it in my nightmares. DADDY HELP. DADDY. PLEASE. I CANT- The fingers of his right hand slipped, and he screamed as the shard of glass ripped its way through his arm, spraying blood out into the street. I realized, then, what was happening; he had been *pulled*, and whatever had dragged him halfway out of the window *was still dragging him*. The screaming seemed to weaken his resolve - or maybe it was the loss of blood, which had begun jetting in thick, syrupy squirts out of his ruined wrist. His hips shot forward, and his back bowed. He threw his head backwards and screamed wordlessly, his tortured eyes finding mine upside-down and begging me silently. His right palm slapped weakly at the wall, brushed more of the broken glass, ripping his palm open further, then he planted it against the wall. He was pushing back, fighting it, and that realization finally broke through my trance. I came forward in a rush, forgetting my bare feet. The soles were immediately lacerated by the scattered glass, and I nearly stumbled from the pain - and if I had, we would have both gone through the window for damn sure. Somehow I managed to stay upright, got my arms around his middle, and yanked him back. Another distressed scream came out of his mouth, and for a second I felt the immense, bearlike strength that had been pulling him forward. It was like a strange belt had been wrapped around his waist and attached to a team of horses that were racing at a full gallop. I yanked again, and the connection broke. He fell backwards limply into my arms, that demon-voice gone. He was just keening in a low, awful monotone, without pause for breath. Too late, I remembered his left hand and feet were still nailed to the windowsill. I went down hard on my knees with him in my arms, his left hand finally snapping the blade of glass off even with the windowsill. My knees crunched in the glittering debris, but I ignored the shooting pain. It just didnt seem important. I set Jup down, never mind the broken glass, and pulled his left foot up and off the chunk of glass hed impaled it on. He screamed again, and I became aware that I was sobbing openly, begging him to forgive me, as I pulled the other foot free. The aftermath is still a blur. The hotel phone wouldnt stop ringing, and there was no way in hell I was going to pick it up, even if it *was* a hallucination. I still dont know whether it was or not. I dragged him out of the room, slammed the door, and ran down the hall, leaving bright red footprints in the dark carpeting, screaming until finally a block of occupied rooms heard me. I dont remember how long it took, or what floor I ended up on - at some point I must have gone downstairs, but I dont remember. Most of the hotel was empty. There was a team of cheerleaders in town for some kind of competition, and Ill never stop being sorry for those poor little girls for what they had to witness that night. But their chaperone took one look at my face and whipped out her cell phone, called 911, and I remember nothing except a few minutes in a helicopter, my head on my sons chest, listening frantically for a heartbeat as one EMT tried to push me back onto my own stretcher. The doctors at the hospital told me it takes approximately a hundred and five minutes to die from a self-inflicted slashed wrist. The ambulance got there in twenty. Jup was unconscious by then. Hed managed to miss every artery except the one in his right arm. But they got him into surgery in time to save his life. He needed two transfusions, due to how much blood he lost. My wounds were minor enough that they had me treated and discharged before sunrise; luckily I was able to make it to the ICU just before he woke up. They kept him in the hospital for the mandatory 24 hours - just long enough to prove that it hadnt been a suicide attempt. The doctors prescribed him some pain medication, antibiotics, and anxiety reducers...and then they let me take him home. We didnt really have a home anymore, but they didnt know that. They didnt know anything. I was angry at them for that, but I cant really blame them. I didnt know anything either. I still dont. Since the window had collapsed inward, the hotel had no way of charging us for the damages. It was determined to be a natural disaster event, which I think is what the contractor must have decided to write when he gave up looking for a logical answer. There isnt any logical answer to find. They searched the room, but never found any sort of object, and Jup couldnt (or maybe wouldnt - I dont think Ill ever know) remember how the window had broken. They never found any record of calls made to our hotel room, either, but I didnt expect them to. I dont know what kept me from taking Jup straight to the mental hospital down the road. But I know that was the longest day of my life. He barely spoke or ate, and wouldnt be alone for even a minute. He sat on the sink while I showered in the motel we stopped at (one of the off-the-highway types, with storm shutters on the window, which we didnt bother asking about before latching). While I dismantled the mirrors and TV and pushed them all into a closet, he watched me from one of the twin beds. It hurt to see him looking so small, leaning against the headboard, with his knees hugged to his chest. It was unmistakably clear that the incident had driven him further toward the dark side of his inherited mental health issues. His eyes never quite lost that rolling, wild quality theyd had when he was fighting for his life in the window. The first thing he did when the sun began to set was unplug the phone. The second thing he did was hug me. I dont know how long we sat there, holding each other, but neither of us cried. I think that he already knew what he planned to do. Maybe some part of me knew, too. Venuss voice comes into my head when I think about it. We deserve a choice. Thats what she told me. The curse of parenting is that we watch our children get hurt all the time. A lot of that hurt could have been avoided if theyd listened to us. Its natural; they have to learn things the same way we figured them out. But we can see it coming before they can, and it hurts so damn badly to watch it happen despite all of our advice and attempts to help. Were forever haunted by the pain we see them go through, knowing that we could have stopped it from happening, could have forced them into a safer path. Children become adults, but theyre people even before that. And all people have the right to choose their paths for themselves. We fuck up, we learn, and we make safer choices later if we can. Maybe there arent any safer choices, in reality; I think thats what Venus would say. Theres only different risks, and different payoffs. This is going to be the really hard part, and I'm a little drunk now, so if anyone's reading this, forgive me. I sat up at three oclock in the morning, instantly alert, knowing in some deep, instinctive way that something was wrong. The lamps were still off, but the room seemed to be filled with flickering candlelight. Jup was sitting cross-legged at the end of my bed. The other bed was still neatly made up. Hed been showering when I climbed into bed at around midnight, and I must have fallen asleep before he got out. I read this book awhile back - a paperback Id picked up at the airport, to pass the time before a delayed flight - called The Green Mile, by Stephen King. Maybe youve read it. In the book, one of the characters says, Its strange how pain marks our faces, and makes us look like family. Jup had his mothers loose, dark curls - he was in perpetual need of a haircut, like I was, before Venus and I were married. But my hair is light and straight, and truthfully it was thinning more than a little, long before any of this started. I always thought he looked more like her, maybe entirely like her, except for his dark eyebrows and round ears. But in that moment, it was like I was looking into a mirror - the worst reflection a man can see; the absolute despair with which he sees all hes ever loved or believed in ripped apart before his eyes. He was all me right then, all mine, and I physically recoiled from him in horror. If pain can make a wife look like a sister, it completely erases the generational gap between father and son. I felt impossibly young, with a terrible inability to grasp what was happening. I wanted to cry, to beg for forgiveness, to ask what had gone wrong. I wanted my mother. I saw an eternity of age in my sons eyes, and behind it, there was an unspeakable *knowing*. We simply looked at each other, and something passed between us. I dont know what that thing was, but I wanted to grab it and pull it back into myself, to save him from it. But thats not how these things go. Hey, Dad. His face looked pale. I need to ask you to do something for me. Anything, bud, I said. I need you to promise that youll burn me. I promise, I said. He nodded, and gave me a small, broken smile. There were a thousand things in that smile - there was love, the love hed always had pouring out of him every minute for his mom and I. There was sorrow, too, and shame, and an unspeakable, monstrous pain. I love you, Jup, I said, and my voice was raw and pleading. But he was already gone. I still cant tell whether that was a dream or not. All I know is that there is a large blankness of nothing between telling Jup I loved him, and when I woke up to the sound of sirens. Wed filled the prescriptions the doctors gave us earlier that day. Id locked them in the glove box, but I didnt hide the car keys. I didnt think I needed to. Jup took all of the medication, including mine. Three hundred milligrams of Ambien, and another ninety of Klonopin, plus all of his amoxicillin - just to seal the deal, I guess. He walked across the street and broke into a liquor store to do it. They found the pill bottles in the stores garbage can. He drank the cheapest bottle of whiskey he could find (it was cinnamon flavored, maybe that helped it go down better), and died alone on the floor. The police made copies of the tapes for me, in case I wanted to watch them. Ill never bring myself to do it, and I cant imagine what made them think I could. Some legal thing, probably. The store hadnt been equipped with any kind of anti-burglary alarm; it only had security cameras. He might have lived, if they had alarms, but instead he spent six hours dying on the floor of a strange store, until the opening manager found him there. He was already cold. Thats the shit that still keeps me up at night, you know. The constant, endless expanse of possibilities for him to have been saved. Venus, too. I slept through both of their deaths, and I frequently wonder how much longer Ill be able to live with myself, knowing that. He saved me from having to find him, which was a characteristically thoughtful thing for him to do. But it didnt make it easier to wake up alone, panicking, and answering the door to the unlucky officer standing there with his hat in his hands. It didnt stop the final, shattering heartbreak when I had to identify his pale, stiff body in the morgue. It didnt make it less painful to dial the countless phone numbers, in which I broke the hearts of every friend and family member he ever had. It doesnt make life without him seem any less empty, or lonely. As promised, I had him cremated. I know why he asked me to do it. We didnt talk about it, at least not enough for me to be sure, but I think he was haunted in more ways than one by the vision of his mother decaying in front of him. I think he was scared of that happening to him. And maybe he was scared that the horror wasnt over yet. Maybe he wanted to spare me from losing my mind entirely, if an old episode of Seinfeld decided to host a private peek at my sixteen year old sons rotting body. I told you he was a smart kid. But he was just a kid."
85,vulnerability,nosleep,Lady in white Ive been ignoring for years almost mentally broke me. Part 1/2,2,c45n6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c45n6i/lady_in_white_ive_been_ignoring_for_years_almost/,2019-06-24 00:38:23,"This lady in white, she always dresses in a white robe all the way down to her feet, very loose robe. Very long hair to the point of covering her face and very unkept but I dont how unkept because I have never seen or heard the lady before. But somehow I knew this was her distinct appearance. I dont much else about her but shes got wide smile, almost inhuman... I found out about her about her smile just a few nights ago, this same smile almost broke me. First time I felt her presence was when I was home alone at the age of 16, my family and I at the time lived in a very dangerous neighborhood we had gotten robbed twice in that same house and financially could not afford security. So my family was always on edge, including myself especially the house has three huge ceiling-to-floor windows with no bars one in the living room, another in my room and lastly in my parents room. So theres always this sense vulnerability lurking around our house as if it was the thief itself. We had nothing big or suitable enough to cover my window so when I slept my window was left wide opened, we had a huge garden so it got really creepy at night given that there was any sort of lighting in the garden. So I always slept with my back facing the window. So how do you think I felt when there was literally no one but me in the house left alone to fend for myself if anything were to happen? As youd imagine, I was shitting myself. Not literally fortunately enough. I was forcing myself to even do anything because I was very concerned about my safety even though it was unlikely for something to happen on that specific day, the day Im most vulnerable and gladly enough, nothing did. No trespassing that I know of. No physical harm. But the dead silence was eerie to say the least. If I had any friends, trust me I would have gone to their house without a care of the house getting robbed. But I didnt have anyone close enough to let me sleep over. Anyways I wash up, got ready for bed, watched some porn before bed, you know how it is. I fell asleep but I got woken up in the middle of the night. Still dreadfully silent. Instantly I was frozen in fear. Someone was watching me. Good fucking thing I dont face the window while I sleep because the horrifying gaze was coming from the window. The pressure I felt, as if the whole universe was pushing down on my soul and body, this invisible force of pure evil freezing my body making me feel more vulnerable than I already did. The presence was a dark force wearing a white robe contrary to this dark dark force she was emanating. I didnt know what the hell was going on, I couldnt move. I had never experienced fear like this before. Is this a nightmare...? No but Im awake, I know I am awake., all of this was happening in the span of a few seconds while the pressure of the universe keeps getting heavier and heavier. My heart starts beating faster, louder. Should I wake up? Or should I go back to sleep? What the fuck is going on? Am I not awake? I hope this is just a dream, God please.  Soon after this though I was proven wrong. It was not a dream because the gaze went away, taking the pressure with it then my body finally decides to move again. But at this point I am mortified, I call my mother and I almost cried, but I was too afraid to even cry."

He had almost past him by in the fog. My dad had told us he could hardly see a foot in front of him and had heard him before he saw him. Hed eventually located Blue clinging to a dead, hollowed out stump, crying for his mother. hed watched him for a while and when no mama bear turned up, hed plucked the cub from the stump tucked him into the warmth of his sheepskin coat and headed home. He guessed the mother must have died or abandoned him. I remember that day, my dad rushing into the cabin and taking out this soft, cold, ball of fur from under his jacket, gently laying him by the fire where he continued to cry weakly for his ma, eventually falling asleep with exhaustion. If I had known then what I know now, I would have taken him back to where my father found him or better still smothered him whilst he slept. I was twelve back then. My parents and I lived in Alaska. Although remote we had all the amenities money could buy, probably more than most city folks. You would never know we werent hooked up to basic services. We had running water and electricity. My parents claimed they wanted nothing to do with 21st century technology and conveniences and yet here we were with every kind of convenience you could dream of. They loved to imagine they were one with nature, but they were clearly delusional. Every few months they had supplies flown in. Fresh fruit, vegetables and even meat. Dad was well off on accounts of a sizeable inheritance. Im not really sure where it came from, my parents rarely spoke of it and Im not sure where I got that idea. Im pretty sure I heard it somewhere. We lived in a two-story Cabin sat in about 50 acres of land surrounded by thick forests on all sides. The tree line slopped up and off as far as the eye could see. There was a small privately owned dirt road leading off of our land, which meandered through a few miles of forest. It eventually converged with a main road of sorts. We were pretty secluded. &amp;#x200B; My dad had built hutches and cages that lined the south facing side of our cabin, housing a variety of recovering animals. We would release them into the wild once they were better. Ben a baby racoon and Marinette a baby skunk and some other young recoverees had decided to stay on with us. As they grew, they would come and go as they pleased, foraging during the day and returning in the evening to the safety of our land. My father eventually cordoned off our immediate vicinity, more to keep our permanent residents safe from marauding predators. &amp;#x200B; Dad fervently believed he was a hunter that provided for his family and yet in living memory I cant remember him ever bringing back anything that remotely resembled meat. He would set off early in the morning with his rifle hitched over his shoulder. Return in the evening more often than not with an injured critter and regale us with stories of how he had saved it. I used to go hunting with my dad when I was much younger, but that all stopped after the attack. A timber wolf had mauled my dad. He had been trying to free him from a trap. As soon as it was free it had turned on him. I remember the look of triumph on my fathers face turn to one of shock and pain as the wolf latched its massive jaws around his arm. My father funny enough didnt scream; he must have gone into shock. He just struggled silently trying to dislodge the wolfs jaws off of him and all I could hear was scuffling and growling, snarling of the large animal. Then it released him and promptly ran off into the thicket. Dad ended up in hospital, needed two pints of blood. You can still see the scar on his arm. Ill never forget it. &amp;#x200B; Thinking back now, I guess thats why I viewed the new addition to our small family with such trepidation. It soon became clear that my father and mother, both romanticist would keep Blue, at least until he could fend for himself. But this wasnt a squirrel or a mink or racoon. This was a bear cub who would grow to be one of the most ferocious of all apex predators. Young as I was, I encouraged them to send him to the bear sanctuary. Truth be known I think my parents saw Blue as a representation of all that was wild and free and somehow he was the cherry on top to their fantasy world. Dad loved the idea of roaming through the forests with his bear in toe and who knows perhaps he and Blue would &amp;#x200B; ... walk into legend, never to be heard of again. &amp;#x200B; My mother hated when my dad would say things like that. I just rolled my eyes and buried my nose deeper in my book. I really think Dad thought he was Grizzly Adams Blue was a black bear cub We called him Blue because he was blue grey. Black bears come in a variety of colours. Black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-grey and even white. &amp;#x200B; It soon became obvious that Blue was not going anywhere. At first he was cute and amenable like a big teddy bear, then as he got used to us and the hierarchy, me at the bottom, he bit me, and then he scratched me, not by accident I hasten to add. On both occasions he had sought me out, walked up to me and bit me and then walked away as if nothing had happened. My parents had blamed me and said I should be nicer to my brother, my brother? I ask you. I became naturally cautious of him. He was growing fast on the expensive formula milk he guzzled like a little pig and he was packing the muscle on with the help of the prime beef my parents had shipped in for him. I suppose in a way he was like a younger sibling, always bumping into me when there was more than enough room for us to get by each other. Biting, scratching to draw blood. I spent my early teens covered in plasters. The evidence was there but not once did he attack me in front of my parents so they blamed me for being mean to him. I regarded his growth anxiously. You know that once humanised you cant release him back into the wild? I informed them. Are you going to send him to the wildlife sanctuary? I asked. How long is he staying for? I nagged. Their answers always vague and noncommital. I know it wasnt just me that was concerned. Mr Arnold was very concerned. He was an old trapper, an actual hunter, survivalist and mountain-man. He lived way up in the mountains. My parents had made friends with him years ago when they had first moved here. That one's a bad lot. he had said the first time he clapped eyes on Blue. I respected Mr Arnold, respected his opinion. Loved his stories about the forest, the legends of the forests. Everything he said made sense to me, resonated with me, even the crazy skin walker and cryptic stories. I believed them all and when he told me to never to wear bright coloured clothing or heed whistling in the forest or the cry of a baby, I promised I never would. Once a year Mr Arnold would visit and stay with us for a few weeks at a time. Go hunting with my father, the only time we got to taste fresh meat, teach me how to track and the best of all would regale me with stories every night. We would sit by his fire. He wouldnt stay in the cabin with us. He claimed it would make him soft and it would be difficult to go back to his life without grumbling. So he camped on the knoll, not too far from the cabin. When I would look out my window at night, I could see the comforting light of his fire and sometimes I would sneak out, closely followed by Blue, who was always in my business, spying and watching me. He would drop off at the porch and just sit there watching and listening to Mr Arnold. Most animals cant hold a human's gaze for long, not Blue he and Mr Arnold would stare each other down and it was always Mr Arnold who looked away first. I asked him why he didnt like Blue and why he never played with him and he told me Bears werent to be played with. They were to be left alone to thrive in the wild or not. But let them be he had cautioned, his grizzled old brow furrowed as he chewed on a bone thoughtfully. Some animals have a spirit in them a bad forest spirit and that one there has it bad. He had told me. His blue eyes stared straight ahead. Everything is not as it seems in them forests and some things we dont know or understand . he said as he yanked another strip of beef off the bone with his teeth, he almost growled as he chewed. His mother ain't dead, I wager you his mother left him, no animal will have anything to do with him, cept stupid humans... he added sullenly. I giggled. Like my parents. he grunted. Is he a skin walker? I had asked tentatively, afraid of his answer, relieved when he shook his large head his long gray hair swung from side to side. No, not a skin walker. he had muttered. He tugged on his beard. He tugged on his beard some more. Bad ju-ju in that one. He poked the fire and stared across at the cabin. I followed his gaze. Blue was sitting on the porch staring intently at Mr Arnold. Yeah real bad juju. he repeated and he knows I know. he poked the fire again sending a shower of glowing embers into the night sky. You see them forests? He nodded his head in their direction. Full of dead souls, some good, some bad, some evil, some looking for a body, anybody will do. and I suddenly felt cold and shivery. I pulled my cardigan closer around me If you look long enough, youll see them looking back. The next day I was sick, real sick, and I had a fever for days after that. I could hear Blue sniffling outside my door, banging on my door to get in. I began to have horrible dreams about Blue. Blue killing me, Blue eating me, Blue changing into spirit monsters that came out of a strange mist and consumed me whole. Mr Donald saw me before he left and he gave me a small amulet. This will protect you . he had said as he patted my head. The day after his departure, I woke up with the amulet in my hand. My fever had gone. By the time Blue was one-year-old we were mortal enemies. I think Blue knew from the get go I didnt really care for him and I didnt if I am honest because I knew he would grow bigger than the wolf that had taken half my dads arm, probably as big as a car and that scared me. I had ordered loads of books on bears and I knew everything there was to know about them by the time I was fourteen. I had also ordered books on First Nation folklore, legends, to see if I could spot what evil entity might have possessed him and nothing fit Blue. I still remembered Mr Arnolds warning. I still had the amulet. Nothing bad had happened, apart from my grand parents dying in a car accident. As I got older, I figured Mr Arnold was wrong about Blue; some evil forest spirit hadnt possessed him, he was just bad to the bone all by himself. A spiteful little shit that tormented me whenever he got the chance I would read the books and peer over them staring at him with each new morsel of information I gleaned. He would sit there staring back with a knowie look in his tiny eyes. Then he would lunge for me sending me scampering. My parents never told him off, just laughed and cooed about how much he loved his sister, God they made me sick. We hated each other, and it was official. When I was sixteen Blue had sent me flying. He was huge now so when I say flying I mean it. I had put my foot down and given my parents an ultimatum, they either build an enclosure for him or I was leaving and would go live with Mr Arnold. I couldnt they told me. Then they broke the news to me that Mr Arnold had died four years prior, mauled by a grizzly, just after his last visit. I railed at my parents for not telling me and allowing me to think Mr Arnold had just not wanted to come back to visit. I grieved for my friend and Blue sat there, his shoulders heaving as if he was laughing and thats when I knew Blue was more than just a little shit. Suddenly everything about him changed in my mind's eye. He became this evil foreboding figure imbued with much more than the soul of an animal. I knew he had killed Mr Arnold for knowing what he was and I became obsessed with the idea he had killed my grandparents too. It was like Blue killed anything or anyone we were close to, but you could never pin it on him. We had over the last few years condoned each other and now it was war. After my parents had broken the news to me about Mr Arnold. I had stayed in my room for days mulling over things. I thought back to before he had arrived and how we almost had a little sanctuary going on here. An assortment of wounded animals that my parents nursed back to health and then set free. I wracked my brains for one animal that had survived or stayed on after his arrival. I couldnt remember one, not one. They had all died. One after the other. We would find their bodies cold and stiff. Ben and Marinette had wandered off into the brush and never returned. The cages sat empty and dusty, a constant reminder of happier times. Strangely enough, my father stopped bringing back injured critters it was like Blue had become his soul focus and no other animal mattered. I sat on my bed watching Blue from my window as he followed my dad around. My dad would stop ever so often and turn to pat Blue on the shoulder or point something out to him. He treated him as if he was a human. He spent more time with him than he did with me or my mother. Ever so often Blue would glance up at me with a smug look on his fat face and I would give him the finger. When I eventually emerged from my room, I had gone straight to the gun cabinet and taken out one of the shotguns, I loaded it and picked up a box of cartridges. I turned and Blue was standing on his back legs staring at me. He was almost full grown and on two legs he was all of seven foot. He had been there all along and I hadnt even heard his approach. I raised the gun, and he knew what it was, but he would not back down and neither would I. I saw his beady eyes shift from the gun to my face and back again to the gun. I know you killed my grandparents and I know you killed Mr Arnold and I know you cant kill me because of this. I reached into my top and pulled out the Amulet that hung around my neck. His eyes slid from my face to the Amulet and I saw his eyes narrow. The gloves were off he drew back his lips and roared at me. That was the first time I had ever heard Blue make any discernible sound other than snuffling; we had figured he was mute because of his early trauma. It was dreadful and scary and made my blood freeze in my veins but I stood my ground and then he dropped to all fours and pawed the ground and I knew he may charge but I stood my ground. The next person to die around me and I kid you not you little shit I will blow you back to whatever hell you crawled out of! I cocked the gun. Blue shook his huge head, his lip lower curled and then he turned on his heel and lumbered out the door. I watched as he waddled his great bulk across the clearing and without a backwards glance he disappeared into the brush. He never went into the forest alone. I figured he understood and wouldnt come back. I locked the doors and windows. and then the mist came in. I didnt see it at first. It was subtle, just a wisp at first creeping in, hugging the ground gently and I hardly noticed. I watched from the window. Fog wasnt anything new around these parts but this was different, it was thin and wispy. I could still see the tree line, the small hill. It was creepy the trees a black shadowy back drop against the white swirl. I sat there watching it creep up the porch and seep under the door, permeate every corner of the house and then as if it was alive, a cohesive form, it withdrew, sucked back like a tide. I watched from the window as it retreated back into the forest and took Blues energy with it. It was as if he never was. My parents were inconsolable you would think they had lost a child. I remained cold and impassive and told them when they asked that I didnt know where he was or where he had gone. I knew it was the best thing for them, for us, but I didnt tell them that. I dont know what Blue is; I know he is more than just a bear and that ain't a good thing. It must have been a year when Blue came back for me. I never thought he would. Maybe I forgot he was no normal animal. So when he came for me I wasnt expecting it. He must have been watching the house, watching for my parents to head out. I was outside reading a book, sitting on the knoll where Mr Arnold and I used to sit and talk. I was so engrossed in my book I didnt notice the mist at first. I didnt notice how cold it had gotten. It was icy cold. It was the middle of summer and it felt like the middle of winter. I shivered and looked up from my book and there he was, a thick fog swirling around him. I recognised his silhouette. I felt adrenalin course through my body as droplets of fear trickled down my spine. My scalp crawled. Blue hadnt come back alone; he had brought something with him. They flittered behind him, dark shadows rising and falling as if trying to achieve some form of cohesion and failing. Maybe they were forest spirits, all the bad ones looking for a piece of me. Blue stepped out of the mist and he was as big as a grizzly and he wasnt blue anymore. He smelt bad really bad like he had digested all that was rotten and evil and brought it back to feast on the girl that lived in the valley . He was about a fifty foot away and I was about fifty foot from the house. I would never make it. I could never outrun him. I stood up slowly and looked across the clearing. I didnt have a gun; I reached for my amulet; my heart sank deep, it wasnt around my neck; I must have forgotten it after my shower. I always wore it. I had nothing and Blue knew it and had bided his time for this moment of complete vulnerability. Here we were, and he had the upper hand and I was a dead girl walking. No warning nothing. He charged me and I remember thinking as he came at me with the wind behind him that I was seventeen years old and I was going to die today, a horrible death. I heard Mr Arnolds voice. 'If a bear is inclined to eat you he aint gonna wait for you to die. I couldnt imagine Blue would leave much of me for my parents to find, maybe a smudge or two. But Blue had different plans for me. I was frozen to the spot as he covered the distance between us like a runaway locomotive; I didnt even have the mind to duck or dodge. I knew bears could run fast but I had never seen one in action and never would have thought Blue could mange more than a waddling jog, not with his bulk. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as he bore down on me, everything slowed down as his massive bulk ploughed into me and I felt myself flying through the air. I hit the ground in a crumpled heap. I heard the thud and breaking of bones. As I turned on my stomach to crawl away, I screamed out in pain as I felt the bones in my arm grind and then I felt my head being jerked back as his claws dug deep into my scalp; I heard a splitting and tearing as my scalp came away from my skull. I felt warmth cover my face and I couldnt see. I could hear a girl screaming. I should help her, my last thought before I slipped into unconsciousness My injuries were extensive. Hed taken my right eye, and it was all the surgeons could do to save my left. Both my legs, right arm, and four ribs were broken. I had a punctured lung, and he had all but scalped me. I was a mess. The rangers had reported that there were no tracks of a bear of any description around where they had found me. Not leading into or out of the property. The doctors couldnt determine what had attacked me as they hadnt seen those kinds of lacerations before and really couldnt tell what kind of animal had attacked me, if indeed it was an animal. &amp;#x200B; I moved to the city, leaving my parents behind in their paradise. There was a lot of nerve damage and so it's hard to walk. Im almost blind in my left eye now and Im in constant pain. Its been three years since the attack and sometimes my mother calls me and says she sees Blue come in with the mist watch the house for a time and then he leaves taking the mist with him. I want to go home, but I darent as I fear maybe hes looking for me, watching to see if I've returned to [finish what he started](URL"

He had almost past him by in the fog. My dad had told us he could hardly see a foot in front of him and had heard him before he saw him. Hed eventually located Blue clinging to a dead, hollowed out stump, crying for his mother. hed watched him for a while and when no mama bear turned up, hed plucked the cub from the stump tucked him into the warmth of his sheepskin coat and headed home. He guessed the mother must have died or abandoned him. I remember that day, my dad rushing into the cabin and taking out this soft, cold, ball of fur from under his jacket, gently laying him by the fire where he continued to cry weakly for his ma, eventually falling asleep with exhaustion. If I had known then what I know now, I would have taken him back to where my father found him or better still smothered him whilst he slept. I was twelve back then. My parents and I lived in Alaska. Although remote we had all the amenities money could buy, probably more than most city folks. You would never know we werent hooked up to basic services. We had running water and electricity. My parents claimed they wanted nothing to do with 21st century technology and conveniences and yet here we were with every kind of convenience you could dream of. They loved to imagine they were one with nature, but they were clearly delusional. Every few months they had supplies flown in. Fresh fruit, vegetables and even meat. Dad was well off on accounts of a sizeable inheritance. Im not really sure where it came from, my parents rarely spoke of it and Im not sure where I got that idea. Im pretty sure I heard it somewhere. We lived in a two-story Cabin sat in about 50 acres of land surrounded by thick forests on all sides. The tree line slopped up and off as far as the eye could see. There was a small privately owned dirt road leading off of our land, which meandered through a few miles of forest. It eventually converged with a main road of sorts. We were pretty secluded. My dad had built hutches and cages that lined the south facing side of our cabin, housing a variety of recovering animals. We would release them into the wild once they were better. Ben a baby racoon and Marinette a baby skunk and some other young recoverees had decided to stay on with us. As they grew, they would come and go as they pleased, foraging during the day and returning in the evening to the safety of our land. My father eventually cordoned off our immediate vicinity, more to keep our permanent residents safe from marauding predators. Dad fervently believed he was a hunter that provided for his family and yet in living memory I cant remember him ever bringing back anything that remotely resembled meat.

Maybe I forgot he was no normal animal. So when he came for me I wasnt expecting it. He must have been watching the house, watching for my parents to head out. I was outside reading a book, sitting on the knoll where Mr Arnold and I used to sit and talk. I was so engrossed in my book I didnt notice the mist at first. I didnt notice how cold it had gotten. It was icy cold. It was the middle of summer and it felt like the middle of winter. I shivered and looked up from my book and there he was, a thick fog swirling around him. I recognised his silhouette. I felt adrenalin course through my body as droplets of fear trickled down my spine. My scalp crawled. Blue hadnt come back alone; he had brought something with him. They flittered behind him, dark shadows rising and falling as if trying to achieve some form of cohesion and failing. Maybe they were forest spirits, all the bad ones looking for a piece of me. Blue stepped out of the mist and he was as big as a grizzly and he wasnt blue anymore. He smelt bad really bad like he had digested all that was rotten and evil and brought it back to feast on the girl that lived in the valley . He was about a fifty foot away and I was about fifty foot from the house. I would never make it. I could never outrun him. I stood up slowly and looked across the clearing. I didnt have a gun; I reached for my amulet; my heart sank deep, it wasnt around my neck; I must have forgotten it after my shower. I always wore it. I had nothing and Blue knew it and had bided his time for this moment of complete vulnerability. Here we were, and he had the upper hand and I was a dead girl walking. No warning nothing. He charged me and I remember thinking as he came at me with the wind behind him that I was seventeen years old and I was going to die today, a horrible death. I heard Mr Arnolds voice. 'If a bear is inclined to eat you he aint gonna wait for you to die. I couldnt imagine Blue would leave much of me for my parents to find, maybe a smudge or two. But Blue had different plans for me. I was frozen to the spot as he covered the distance between us like a runaway locomotive; I didnt even have the mind to duck or dodge. I knew bears could run fast but I had never seen one in action and never would have thought Blue could mange more than a waddling jog, not with his bulk. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as he bore down on me, everything slowed down as his massive bulk ploughed into me and I felt myself flying through the air. I hit the ground in a crumpled heap. I heard the thud and breaking of bones. As I turned on my stomach to crawl away, I screamed out in pain as I felt the bones in my arm grind and then I felt my head being jerked back as his claws dug deep into my scalp; I heard a splitting and tearing as my scalp came away from my skull. I felt warmth cover my face and I couldnt see. I could hear a girl screaming. I should help her, my last thought before I slipped into unconsciousness My injuries were extensive. Hed taken my right eye, and it was all the surgeons could do to save my left. Both my legs, right arm, and four ribs were broken. I had a punctured lung, and he had all but scalped me. I was a mess. The rangers had reported that there were no tracks of a bear of any description around where they had found me. Not leading into or out of the property. The doctors couldnt determine what had attacked me as they hadnt seen those kinds of lacerations before and really couldnt tell what kind of animal had attacked me, if indeed it was an animal. I moved to the city, leaving my parents behind in their paradise. There was a lot of nerve damage and so it's hard to walk. Im almost blind in my left eye now and Im in constant pain. Its been three years since the attack and sometimes my mother calls me and says she sees Blue come in with the mist watch the house for a time and then he leaves taking the mist with him. I want to go home, but I darent as I fear maybe hes looking for me, watching to see if I've returned to [finish what he started](URL"
88,vulnerability,nosleep,My Friends who are Dead,1,c8otf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c8otf8/my_friends_who_are_dead/,2019-07-04 00:34:44," This experience scarred me for life, I wish I could take it back All the things me and my friends did for fun, eventually ceased for one single mistake. It happened a two years ago, me and my friends decided to go explore an abandoned house which is nearby. They called it a Two-storey Terror House. There is a good number of us in our inner circle: Rafael, Jay, Luis, John, Stephen, Jaime and Don. We are all close friends and Rafael, or we call him Raf happens to be the leader of the group. He told us to meet in his house before going to the abandoned house together, we brought flashlights and of course our phones to document and see if there are ghosts in there. It was a 10-minute walk from Rafs house, we passed bushes and trees but for me it didnt matter, when we reached our destination, we were all excited. We tried to climb over a gate which is 5-feet tall from the ground. We were all noisy and dumb, being curious kids who enjoys nothing more than finding ghosts. Looking at the house, we find it very odd since there were no graffiti and no signs of abandonment, but all the windows were boarded up. The grass surrounding the pavement leading to the door was not that tall. The house looked as if it had been taken care of by someone. It was a two-storey house like they said. Luckily, the door of the house was unlocked. One single turn of the knob and nudge creating an echo of a creaking door reverberating throughout the entire house. We all entered one by one, as we try to shine our flashlights in the house, we saw dusty tables, rickety chairs, but the one thing which caught all of our attention is a red stain on the floor. Stephen, one of our nerd friends, told us to leave immediately because something bad might happen. Don tries to argue with Stephen teasing him that he is just being a pussy, Jay joined their quarrel and the others are still glancing on the different rooms in the first floor. The quarrel got louder and louder when some of my friends try to manage the situation when suddenly There was an audible thump making us stop talking and looked over a room. We all prepared our flashlights, while some used their phones to record. The room we entered was a restroom, which had another door leading to a laundry and a pantry. Me and my friends are now confused since there was no object that could be the reason for the thump that happened. We tried to look for fallen objects on the ground or anywhere in the room but there was nothing to be found. We all went back to the room we had entered and heard another thump, but this time, it was on the second floor, we are now sure that this is someone who is trying to pull a prank on us, but a simple glance and a nod on each other made us knew what to do, we have to confront this guy. As we were trying to go up the stairs, we stopped in our tracks as we found a silhouette of a man on top of the stairs. When we flashed the light on him, we saw a man, about six feet tall, wearing a black hoodie and a mask with a design unrecognizable because of stains of red liquid. We noticed a shiny object he is holding, it was a machete, thats when we all realized that our life is in danger, we all bolted it inside the room we entered a while ago, we could have run and exited but we cannot risk it while some of us are outside, and some of us still trying to get out, there is a possibility that the masked man couldve harmed one of us. We stayed in the room, minutes passed and felt like an hour, we checked if the man was still there, but he was nowhere to be found. We decided to split our group into two, it was me, Raf, Jaime and Jay. We decided to explore each room for each floor. We explored the first floor, there was only two rooms, the restroom leading to a laundry with the pantry. Another room was a kitchen and a locked door. We stopped dead on our tracks when we heard a loud thud. It was upstairs, I heard Luis quickly ran down the stairs repeatedly calling us, he told us that something bad happened to Stephen. Luis was not yet finished talking but we all hurried and go checked what had happened, we all saw it Stephens body his throat sliced, his neck continuously bleeding. While were all petrified, we havent even moved until we heard Jay screaming at us that someone is behind us. We all moved quickly inside the room where Stephens body laid down. I was the second to the last to go inside, Jay was following beside me. As we are on are way to the room, I felt a hand grabbed my shoulder for a few seconds, I was shocked to see that Jay tackled the masked man. By this time, we are now waiting for him to come, as he was on his way, he suddenly stopped, a blood dripped down from his mouth as we all screamed in horror, he was then dragged by the masked man downstairs. As I was thinking on how to get out of this mad house, my friends continued to argue on why they went here on the first place. I checked if it was already safe, it looked safe to me, so I ran as I was on my way to the stairs, I noticed the masked man passed by so I went to another room instead. The room that I entered was a bedroom, I tried to flash the lights and I saw a knife on the desk near the bed, I equipped myself with the knife I found when suddenly I hear screaming downstairs, it was my friends. I opened the door to see Luis holding the machete and assisting Jay who has a bleeding forehead, Luis told me to help him with Jay, I asked him where are the others, He ignored my questioned while Jay started to speak something I could not understand. Luis interrupted Jay and told me to run like hell once we hear him scream, he told me to protect Jay and warned me Dont ever stop running, all our friends are dead We shouldnt have come here He is always here.. He then turned his back and signaled us to follow him downstairs, Luis is holding the machete as if he is ready to attack someone, while I am carrying the knife in my dominant hand while guiding injured Jay. We are now near the exit of the house, when suddenly we heard an unusual scream, it was the scream of the masked man, showing the sign of vulnerability, Luis screamed run. We quickly hurried, I let Jay climbed up first, but he instead stole the knife and nudged me to escape, I insisted but it happened so quickly, the masked man got out and is on his way to us, Jay tried to swing the knife, but this is when the masked man got the knife and drive it on Jays chest, I had no choice but to continue climbing. Once I stepped on the ground, I immediately ran for Rafs house, I never stopped running even though I stumbled and tripped many times, I told his parents about what happened. I was brought to the hospital, everything from here was blurry, the next thing I knew, my friends are all dead and found inside that house. The thing is that the police didnt found any weapons in the scene, all were just the corpses of my dead friends. And most of all, the masked man was never caught, until this day, I havent talk with the parents of my dead friends. This is the reason why it scared me for my life, losing my friends. What makes this worse? Before I go to sleep, I always hear my friends whispering to me He is always here. And every time I looked in my room I always see him, his silhouette, holding his machete beside him my friends who are dead."
89,vulnerability,nosleep,I've eluded law enforcement for four years by living in the woods. This is my story.,11,c9ctpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c9ctpy/ive_eluded_law_enforcement_for_four_years_by/,2019-07-05 16:51:35,"I'll cut to the chase. I guess you can only get slapped around so much before you think about killing that person. It doesnt matter who they are, you can only be fucked with so much before it changes you. Something inside just kinda stagnates. And then comes the Hate. The way you think, the way you talk to people. Trust with anyone is a wierd thing when the one person your supposed to be able to trust is a fucking lunatic. You see, my father was truly a horrible person. I've never met someone so mean, drunk and irrational as him to this day. I'm not much for sympathy but I need you to understand what I had dealt with my entire youth. Which was getting my ass kicked almost everyday for years. Wearing makeup to school, lying to teachers... A cycle of alcohol, anger and confusion rotated through his house like clockwork. As an only child I suppose I was an easy target. But the day I turned 16, i decided I was done being a victim. I packed several bags, four to be exact. Hunting gear, what little cash I had and all the clothes I could fit. And lots of food. On September 3rd of 2015 my father woke up drunkenly slobbering on the barrel of a 12 gauge shotgun I slipped into his mouth. He immediately tried to reach for the gun, but I just josseled the barrel against his teeth. The sound was horrible... all I wanted to do was say a few last words and leave in one piece. And without a gun, I wouldnt have never been able to leave. ""I fucking hate you"" Nothing ""I'm leaving, and if i see you follow me. I'll kill you"" As I trembled with fear he didnt speak a single word. So with all the courage I had I pulled the trigger. ""Click"" Of course I'd never shoot him. I pumped the shotgun as he lept for me. I stepped back quickly, aimed at the ceiling and pulled as hard as i could. ""BOOM"" I could hear the glass in the kitchen shake as he kept backward in shock. I half-assed pointed the gun at him while simultaneously grabbing his keys and running around the corner and out of the house. I slapped the screen door open, jumped in the drunk and dusted the driveway on the way out. My journey had began, my heart raced and tears ran down my face. I ran the old chevy pickup down that down road as fast as she could go, dust blanketed everything behind me. It was around 9 in the morning, the sun shined on me that day. It felt amazing. My first destination was an old camping spot about 6 miles from my house. This way I could ditch the truck in town and only have to walk a couple miles. I had planned my escape weeks ahead of time, and that day was today. I arrived to my camp having already set up my tent, a solar panel and some water was stored. I had fishing gear and my shotgun, and a small 22 rifle in soft cases unders tarp. I had been sneaking food and anything I thought to be useful for weeks. Surprisingly he hadn't noticed, drunk fuck. All my belongings just sat under the tarp, I stared at my camp. It only took til nightfall to realize how truly alone in the world I'd be now. I always felt alone as it is, I had always just taken care of myself. I figured id just keep doing it. I had a small fire going, and after a while I pulled out my perculator and made some coffee. I had this panicked sense to ration my food but I knew I'd be able to get more. I grew up hunting and fishing, but because of that I knew you dont always get what you set out for. The sun had been down for a few hours now and it was approaching midnight. I sat drinking coffee and smoking little prime time cigars since it went down. I settled into my camp and had managed to get everything from the pickup out there, which was only a couple miles from town. I ditched the truck at a local restaurant, walked down the railroad tracks and that was it. I realized after unpacking everything how much shit I had actually brought. And I had no way to transport myself or all of the things I brought. I poured the last of my coffee and remembered I had an eighth of mushrooms in one of the bags. I had never tried them, I only smoked weed at the time. But a friend gave me them and said to eat them on my birthday. Well there I was...choking them down as I sat next to the fire. The taste wasnt bad but I remember immediately questioning if I should have actually done that. I had been through alot, what's a lil pant going to do? I'm a trooper lol. Yeah I thought so anyway. After some more coffee I decided to grab some cigars and go for a walk, eventually I got to a small overhang that looked over a meadow with some fallen trees scattered about. It seemed pretty gorgeous. I remember relishing in the beauty when I began to laugh histarically. My situation was astounding The more I thought about it, I realized how fucked I was. I remember laughing until I had to sit down and try to breath. My eyes watered from laughing and I giggled like a schoolgirl as I walked back to camp. I sat down and once I stopped moving is when things get very...swirly? I'm not even going to try to explain it but the woods began to look scary and daunting. I stoked my fire to get more light, the flicker of the fire on the trees around my tucked with my eyes. I felt so relaxed but also I felt very fragile. Like at any moment everything could just go so wrong. I think the vulnerability really set in with the drugs. I felt so lonely and small. I stoked the fire even more. I laughed cussing at myself, I was basically talking..maybe even yelling. And that's when I heard the small voice in the distance. ""Helloooo, who's out here?"""
90,vulnerability,nosleep,The Pugilist,11,bndvbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bndvbt/the_pugilist/,2019-05-12 02:22:40,"Two sets of fluorescent bulbs drove out the dark and banished it into the corners of the room. Directly under one bulb was I, a shirtless perplexed man, spouting obscenities between my questions at the tinted windows from in which they watched from behind. I had winced from the contrast but eventually the damp factory basement materialized and the four support beams came into focus; two on my flanks and two on hers. Four posts. A ring. She stood under the second light, between the two other steel columns that were dotted with the head of bolts continuing upward until lost into the darkness of the tall ceiling. I scoffed at her. Then at them. I started thinking about how I got into this situation. Two days earlier I was watching Nervous Ned enter the ring. Its easy to spot a Nervous Ned before a fight because they pace through the crowd, through the ringside cheers and exchanging money, with a bottle of water taking sips to calm their pre-fight jitters. It took me two fights to learn that doesnt work, so for the last six years I take two pulls of bourbon after my hydrocortisone cream hand rub and head into the ring. That particular fight, the ring was a raked and trampled down area in a horse barn. My dressing room was an empty stable that included a water spigot and trough still filled with feed. I never enjoyed the restrictive elements of associated boxing: the rules, the media buildup, the incessant chatter of managers, trainers and athletes. The gloves. But in this sport, where the rules were vague and the only thing more shady than the fighters were those who surrounded them was where I felt comfortable. Around my ilk, my family. My kind of people. Also, it pays good - great if I win- and sometimes they throw in a bonus bottle of bourbon. I pulled out my whiskey and lightened it a little, wondering if I could remember all the hopeful faces Ive smashed or if it would be better not to try. The ones with dreams of getting rich and going undefeated, the young ones, never listened to my advice. It doesnt matter if his cross could knock a train off the tracks; the fists must be conditioned to handle the blow. My advice of sinking your hands into a bowl of rice and spreading your fingers in and out? Ignored. My advice of micro punching a concrete wall for ten minutes a day? Ignored. Knuckle pushups? Ignored. Strength training the lower body as much as the upper? Ignored. The Nervous Ned I was about to fight had weak knuckles and in the eponymous sport we about to participate in, knuckles were everything. Tuning out the commotion of the crowd was easy when concentrating on Nervous Neds breathing routine. I danced a while, shifting feet and twitching shoulders until I was satisfied with my study of his flaring nostrils. Nervous Ned obeyed the uproarious crowd and swarmed my space with a powerful uppercut. It was easily dodged thanks in part to his nostrils that flared out before every offensive move like I had a window into his future. After slipping two jabs I rolled a punch and countered with a cross that punished the crowd with a ribbon of blood and a crunch of skull that shrouded them in silence. Poor concussed Ned, making that same sucking sound as my past opponents, was sprawled out in the dirt and dried unraked horse shit with his eyes rotating around like they were fighting his eyelids. Some in the crowd cheered and exchanged money but most argued and derided the others until several got into a fight of their own. I collected my cash and bag then exited the barn toward to my vehicle. I didnt see him until he spoke my name. He was a weedy middle-aged man, pale with hollow telling eyes that had seen war, or something similarly traumatic, and the arrogant smirk painted on his face matched the pomposity of the black suit and pants he wore to a bare-knuckle boxing match. I was surprised I didnt see him in the crowd because few spectators even wore sleeves but when he approached his agile almost balletic gait hid him in the shafts of shadow pouring from the boards of the barn. He drew closer without unnecessary movement or sound. He was a man who could blend in and be forgotten. Lost in a crowd or an event. And you are? I asked. Thomas. What can I help you with, Thomas? Im looking for a fighter. A good one. Interested? Already uninterested, I snickered. Depends. What will you pay a good fighter? Enough. Well, Im a great fighter. So Id charge enough plus some. I tossed my bag of clothes and hydrocortisone cream and low bottle of whiskey into my backseat then squared up the man eye-to-eye. His assured glare didnt waver; he was a man who didnt watch his feet during conversation. I reached into my backseat and grabbed the bottle then made it a little lighter. Although I avoided any blows my body was sore and my head began that pulsing effect that occurs before a headache. Three fights were lined up over the next several months and I had turned down two that week already. Im in shape for forty-seven, but recovery time is critical. I was inside my car ready to fire the engine when Thomas spoke again. Deal. Enough plus some. When? Two days. I only do one fight a month. Sorry. I flipped on the ignition. I can pay you ten-thousand dollars. Cash. I flipped off the ignition. Over the weekend I rested, stretched and did my usual routine of practice exercises and warm ups. Nothing too strenuous. Two nights following my fight with Nervous Ned I packed my bag and drove out of the city into the countryside being sure to follow the handwritten instructions from Thomas. Highways turned into streets which grew into back roads through small communities and stretches of asphalt a mile long without a man-made structure until a hard curve revealed a tower, a smokestack, looming atop a stretch of pines. I followed the instructions to the smokestacks base, an abandoned factory nestled deep in the woods of the surrounding area, where a group of men in suits waited for me in the gravel parking lot. I joked with the men about the ominous location as they lead me down a stairwell and through a pair of corridors; none of them laughed. After I was ushered into a small closet they called the dressing room, Thomas appeared and asked if I was ready. I removed my shirt, stretched a little, lightened my whisky bottle then followed him toward my opponent. Our trek through the rusted machinery and dust smothered floors was silent. No cheers. No yelling. No crowd. I asked about payment but Thomas reassured my payment would occur after services rendered. The weedy man didnt speak after that so my only company was the hiss of the aged bulbs that dangled from corroded pendant lights. A door was opened into a pitch black area and Thomas waved me inside. I entered but he stayed by the door. Are you ready? He asked. I cant see anything. What is this? Win, and I will double your payment. Judging by the echoes of the slamming door the room was large, but with no lights, no sound and only the damp smell of tarnished metal and dust it was impossible for me to understand my surroundings. Then two sets of fluorescent bulbs drove out the dark and banished it into the corners of the room; it was a large open area, maybe basement level, that was probably used for storage. To one side was a wall lined with tinted windows that seemed oddly out of place and recently cleaned. Directly under one bulb was I, a shirtless perplexed man, spouting obscenities between my questions at the tinted windows from in which they watched from behind. I wondered how many suited lanky men stood behind that glass, their hands wrapped around their back or inside their pants, probably smirking, their vice of lechery and desire on full display in front of them. Perverts can wear suits too. The floor was almost blue with dust and chipped paint. Standing like sentinels in the middle of the area were four steel beams; two on my flanks and two on hers. Four posts. A ring. She stood under the second light, between the two other steel support columns that were dotted with the head of bolts continuing upward until lost into the darkness of the tall ceiling. I sighed at my opponent; she was eight, maybe nine years old. Her hair was carelessly separated into pigtails and the stained pink t-shirt she wore almost covered her black shorts. A pair of pink Converse covered her feet but they too were stained. Tall socks reach up her legs stopping just before her knobby knees, both scraped and scabbed. A fledgling; a panoply of innocence and vulnerability. She watched me with a tender confession in her eyes: she was terrified. I scoffed at her. Then at them. Im not into this. Thomas, get your ass out here. Im not doing this shit. I yelled toward the windows. After no response I tried the door but it was lock. Suddenly I regretted my agreement. Honey, are you okay? I asked her. Are you hurt? Have they hurt you? I approached the glass and rapped with my knuckle to gain their attention. I shook my head and pantomimed my submission. My defeat. My white flag. Then after my refusals were greeted with more silence I slammed my palm against the glass while screaming at the perverted watchers behind the pane, demanding my release. I repositioned my body to strike the window again and I saw a flash of pink in the reflection. A striking movement, a blur, rushing toward me at a rapid pace. Instinctively diving to the ground, I heard a deep crunch and the splintering of glass. I jumped to my feet in time to witness the young girl remove her shoulder from the cavity she created in the concrete wall. Above it, several men in suits peered through the subsequent fracture in the window. I took a step toward the girl but before I could ask of her condition her tiny foot met my chest and sent me flailing backwards. I palmed the dusty Converse print on my shirt trying to regain my breath while she stared down at me with the focus of a hungry predatory, a cogitate, attentive gaze that left me wondering the nature of this child. Then she smiled. I rolled to an upright position and set my feet for balance. With my arms raised and my semi-crouch stance stabile, I watched between my knuckles as her grin unveiled jagged fangs. She hissed. My opponent didnt need saving. This is exactly what Thomas said it was - a fight. She lunged at me with a rare speed, her arms striking wildly with no apparent target, but I feinted left and dodged her advancement. She immediately spun around and struck again with extended fingers and an open palm. Blood dripped from the four slashes across my forearm. Balling her little hand into a fist she attempted an uppercut but I pulled away in time. She attempted a left hook then a right then another left but my bobbing and weaving were successful. Her movements were ferocious and violent, almost feral and obviously unversed in any method of skilled combat. Combinations of strikes, punches and blows continued but I dodged each one with a side step or pull away due her short arm length. One jab caught my left ribs and felt like a swing from a hammer. The response time lowered from the pain was enough of a window for her to land three blows to my right ribs in quick succession that almost brought me to my knees. It was unachievable quickness; inhuman speed. I began to panic, not from the unusual strength or agility, but from the fact my opponent wasnt getting tired. Already in a layer of sweat, blood dripping from my elbow and my muscles losing stamina, I knew the only way out of this was offense. I tucked my elbows inside and lifted my fists to cover my head and absorb the hits she unrelentingly threw. I studied her, examined her movements and routines while her hisses bounced around our dusty concrete ring. I danced a while, shifting feet and twitching shoulders until I was satisfied with my study of her. After each left jab she pulled her right arm out of position in preparation of the coil back for the next hit. That was my opportunity. I waited for the left jab and when her right arm shifted too high I parried with a contraction of my right leg in unison with a swing of my hips that sent every fiber of my momentum through my right fist. It landed. A starburst of blood coated the tinted windows and dislodged jagged teeth stuck to the wall, glued with blood and sweat. I stepped back to restabilize my balance but the girl remained on the floor. I could smell my own sweat. That, and blood. I watched the windows, imagining the suits and Thomas flipping another switch to banish me into the dark again but nothing happened. Her shoulders began to rustle so I took a second step back. Using one of the beams for support she raised to her feet. Her jaw was pitched down at an angle and the bones around her cheek were concave causing one eye to protrude and not function. She spit blood. Her head tilted up and her good eye rolled white. I could hear the popping and snapping of bones above my heavy breathing as her jaw and cheek independently realigned themselves to their proportional position. She had healed herself of any injury. After her regenerative display she smiled again. The metal door opened across the room and six guards in riot gear marched down the dusty floor to the girl. They paid me no attention. She glanced at the window then some of the guards held their shields up in a beckoning gesture. The girl disappeared behind the door encircled by the guards who kept their protective shields between them and her. I lowered my fists but I didnt relax. I banged on the windows again and demanded my release but after a few minutes another guard donned in riot gear emerged and approached. Without a word a gun was brandished and fired before I could run. Before I passed out I saw a dart had pierced my stomach. I woke up in my apartment; my head pulsed and my brains were fog. After rolling from bed and lumbering into the bathroom I threw up twice and collapsed on the floor. As the ceiling spun I examined my pains: stitches on my forearms were professionally executed, a patch on my ribs smelled of hydrocortisone cream, my body was wiped free of blood and sweat and dirt. I managed to arrive at the water faucet where I gorged myself and splashed my face. On my way back to bed I saw my lumpy bag nestled on a corner chair. I laid down only to immediately sit up; I only carried the minimum in my bag for a fight so it was never lumpy. Stumbling across my room I finally unzipped my bag despite the pain in my hand. Collected around my cream, change of clothes and bottle of whiskey were stacks of one hundred dollar bills. I sat on the floor in disbelief at my earnings. I grabbed a few bills and inspected them but couldnt ignore the pain in my hand any longer. After turning my hand over I removed something buried in the hammock of a knuckle - a white jagged fang. I pulled out my whiskey and lightened it a little, wondering if I could remember the directions to the factory or if it would be better not to try."

I felt a chill go down my spine despite the heat. ""That thing looks like a tower,"" Tony muttered. It was in fact some sort of obelisk, as dark as night itself and as large as the Empire State Building it the scaled shot was to be believed, I realized. I had never seen anything like it, but apparently Meredith had. ""Doctor Bishop and the other senior staff members were able to successfully translate a majority of the text we recovered from the raid in Kuranes, which revealed there were a total of 13 monoliths of this size,"" Parker explained. ""Thirteen? Fuck. Where the hell did they come from? Who built them?"" Staff Sergeant Romero asked. ""That's exactly what we're here to find out,"" Meredith said as the next clip revealed a crude map of the country we now found ourselves in. ""As you know, late last spring; our preliminary team came across a series of ruins near to the Carcosa territory here, next to the Chinese Border. For the most part, this area is barren and we assumed that excavation would be relatively easy. But not a single person from the mission ever returned,"" she said gravely. The tone within the tent suddenly grew dead serious. ""What? Were there jihadists blocking the roads?"" Private Blake asked nervously. ""Nothing like that, but far worse in the grand scheme of things I suppose,"" she conceded and then gestured aimlessly. ""You saw what happened to those men on your way here. In short, they have been transformed into monsters."" ""Those things?"" my partner repeats, beset by the realization that the horrid monsters we saw were once humans. ""How is that possible,"" Gaven mutters. ""These monoliths... Doctor Bishop theorized that they can have an affect in the special reality around them. I believe this is what happened during the arctic expedition. Andrew; you remember Professor Paytrol's dissertation on the subject correct?"" she asked softly. All eyes turned toward me and I swallowed some spit. ""Uh... sort of? I just know that there was a lot of fuckery with what happened up there and they came back pretty much empty handed. It messed up the Professor a lot,"" I muttered, rubbing the back of my neck and feeling rather useless. Meredith gave me a contemptible look before staring, ""I remember every detail and I wasn't even in the class. Basically we are dealing with something akin to a paranormal experience gentlemen. You need to be prepared for that in the weeks to come."" ""Weeks?"" Jansen repeated but she didn't even flinch in her next remark. ""We are going to stay here as long as it takes,"" Meredith declared. More murmurs started to ripple across the group. ""All right. I think we heard enough for now men. Let's get some rest. Big day tomorrow,"" Romero ordered. The men reluctantly filed out of the tent as Meredith began to shut off the equipment. I lagged for a moment to talk to her privately, feeling that perhaps she might tell me the honest truth. ""This has something to do with your father, doesn't it?"" I whispered to her as Tony and Gaven were the last ones out. Meredith barely gave me a nod and remarked, ""I managed to make contact with a local guide, an Egyptian trader by the name of Alhazred. He says that he can get us to the Carcosa territory unharmed."" ""Does Jacki know?"" I prodded her, as she finished putting away the equipment. ""Once we get to the city, there's no telling what might happen...."". I grabbed her arm, forcing her to look me in the eye. ""How certain are you that this plan of yours is really going to work?"" I asked. For the first time since I met your sister, she showed fear. ""I don't. The translations are barely legible and most of them only speak of death and destruction that awaits anyone who approaches the monoliths. But Doctor Bishop seems confident that we can get this done. Everyone at the Janus Project is. That's why we spent so much money to get this team together. That's why we spent probably double that sending that other research crew to the Bermuda Trench."" Meredith muttered. ""There's something you aren't telling me. Why?"" I growled. She pulled away from me, her vulnerability gone in an instance. ""Just because you married my sister doesn't mean that I trust you. I know you came from the same sick corner of Dunwich County as I did, Andrew. So forgive me if I'm not forthcoming,"" she sneered. Before I got a chance to ask another question, a rustle at the door caught my eye and I saw a man enter that looked like death itself. He was a dark skinned man wearing a traditional Arabic robe with pale eyes and a long twisted dagger at his side, and as he approached Meredith I noted a most peculiar tattoo alongside his right arm. It wasn't until later I realized I could identify it as being connected to the Lyvonic Order. But still, even without that knowledge the man looked like death had struck his body already. ""Private, this is Alhazred. He'll be your guide tomorrow toward Carcosa,"" your sister declared. I shook his hand, another shock of cold running through my body. This didn't feel right, so I didn' t care anymore what it took to find out more. If Meredith was hiding something I realized I would find out sooner or later. It was clear the arrival of this man was meant to indicate our conversation was over, but i lingered near to the door to listen to what he had to say. ""Did you tell them of the yith that roam these lands?"" Alhazred asked. ""They saw them first hand. 19 lost souls wandering the desert. Nearly forfeit the whole operation,"" Meredith answered. ""What rises from the sand is only the beginning,"" the man warned. I leaned in to listen closer when Blake grabbed my arm and tugged me toward the edge of basecamp. ""Hey, get over here and help,"" he remarked with a sneer in his voice. I recognize that my relationship with your sister likely made the others feel uneasy, but I wasn't about to be a push over either. They were setting up a perimeter, with bits and pieces of broken stone and wood. As though such crude tools could keep the monsters at bay. But I knew better than to disobey an order so I chipped in and helped. We worked for six hours straight with the sun beating down our backs. Nothing could be seen for miles across the Afghani sand except more desolation. Had we even seen anything at all? It made me uneasy to consider how still and quiet it was. Alhazred came to check on our progress, his face covered by a thin layer of cloth as his pale eyes observed our unit working on the south wall. ""All That has been done, will be undone,"" he intoned. ""Thanks for the enthusiasm chief,"" Gaven snapped back. ""We depart in seventeen hours toward Carcosa. You should rest,"" the Egyptian muttered. I looked toward the heavens, noticing that the sun hadn't really moved since we arrived and felt a bit dizzy watching it, I thought maybe I was seeing things because it was seemingly moving from west to east. As I looked back toward the camp, I felt another wave of confusion wash over my body. The entire perimeter that we had just built was now gone. ""Andrew!"" a familiar voice shouted to me. Romero was standing there with the other men, caked in sand; looking at me as though I had lost my mind. ""Come on, Parker wants to talk to us!"" he ordered. I rushed toward where they stood, still puzzled by the sudden disappearance of all our hard work. Then we entered the tent and Meredith ordered a soldier to make certain we were alone. I felt a rush of Dejavu as she again explained about the monolith, and this time felt compelled to move toward the front of the room and remark, ""We need to talk privately. Now."" Meredith saw the fear in my eyes and gestured for one of her staff members to continue the presentation. ""I take it you don't mind being informal with me around your unit?"" she muttered. ""They already know about that. But listen. I think this monolith is affecting temporal sense in this area too. We've heard this all before. Alhazred comes in here in five minutes to talk to you privately. And warn you about the creatures that roam Carcosa,"" I told her. She pursed her lips and nodded, ""I'll need you to keep this to yourself."" ""What. I can't do that!"" I stammered. ""It's an order Andrew, we can't panic the rest of the unit until we know what is happening here,"" Meredith instructed. Just then we heard a scream from behind the tent. I instinctively reached for my service weapon but Meredith gestured for me to relax. There was no way that was happening when the screams got louder. I ran out of the tent to see Tony and Blake aiming their weapons toward what appeared to be apparitions near the border of the camp. They shimmered in the scorching sun like mirages as the bizarre figures lurched toward us. It was then I realized the screams were coming from the ghosts. They were running their fingers against their eyes and trying to gouge their eyes out. Upon closer examination, I realized the mirages looked identical to two of the soldiers in my unit; Tobias and Stark. The soldiers panicked and fired on the ghosts as they lurched forward. Then in a wave of shimmering light the creatures were gone. ""What the fuck was that??"" my partner screamed. Not even your sister had an answer for that one. But the man from the storm did. Alhazred moved toward the edge of the basecamp and ran his finger across the sand where drips of blood could be seen. ""It is the future. Or it is the past. But what matters is that it is here, and that means the monolith is as well,"" he said solemnly. Meredith stood near the border and gritted her teeth before turning to Romero. ""Change in plans,"" she decided. ""We leave now."" [330](URL"

Cheryl, Tinas mom, gave her a tall frosty cup of chocolate milk adding, Nothing beats a good PB &amp; J. Tina took a deep refreshing gulp leaving Tina with a broad full chocolate milk mustache. Her mother saw a card sticking out of Tinas knapsack and snatched it before Tina could refuse. Whats this? Tina sighed loud almost moaning, Its an invitation to Crystals Birthday party tonight. No, I dont want to go! She took another oversized but of her sandwich. Her mother examined the card, Oh, its a sleepover. Tinas mother took her by the chin and leveled her face to face with her, Look I know you two have had difficulties in the past. Tina spat her disapproval, Past! You mean yesterday when they threw me in the trash? You will get over it. Mommy needs a little break, her mother scolded. Cheryl and Tina stood facing the home on the invitation before any further refusal could find solid ground to stand upon. Tina stared at the wrapped present with a furrowed brow, Its a babys gift. They need no more reasons to make fun of me. The door opened releasing the sounds of the celebration to escape into the secluded neighborhood for a moment. I will pick you up in the morning, Tinas mother muttered. No worries, Cheryl, shes in great hands, Crystals mom gestured to Tina to enter inside. I assume the girls are in the other room. Here Ill take the present and put it with the others, she said pushing Tina inside and closing the front exit. The color bled from her gentle face following behind was a chill running down her spine seeing Crystal and her other bullies glaring at her and whispering. Tina lifted her gaze to the throng of girls ahead of her. Her worse fears had come true she was alone behind enemy lines. Trapped for the next twelve hours. How could it become worse? She thought to herself. Tina faked the same stiff upper lip she used to preserve herself from the bullies, but tears welled up in her eyes hearing the first of the hateful whispers made by the swarm of adolescents. Crystal took the lead and pointed and snickered at Tina. The rest of her mindless flock joined her. Tina sprinted across the living room to the hallway. She walked into the bathroom and slammed the door. She sat on the toilet weeping. Tina steadied her breath and choked down her emotions. If there was one thing junior high school had taught her to no show any vulnerability or emotions around the gangs of predatory teenage clicks. She splashed cold water on her face reducing the red swelling. She paused in front of the door and closed her eyes, Come on, girl, you got this. Its twelve hours. Tina pulled open the door Crystal and associates were waiting for her to return, you done? They studied her through their ferocious social teeth a fated calf left to the slaughter. They seized her by the arms. Lets go, Crystal demanded before Tina could utter a single word. In an instance, they were upstairs inside Crystals bedroom with all the sleepover guests. They dropped Tina inside Crystals room. She looked up seeing Crystal and her friends sitting in a circle around her bed. The clutch of devious girls in unison snapped their attention to Tina. Tina recoiled, What? Crystal gave an ingratiating smile and gestured for Tina to join them on the floor, come on, lets play a game. Tina stiffened her posture and sat down careful to not reveal any signs of weakness to the wolves studying her every move. The gathered crowd offered false smiles to make Tina feel comfortable among them. Crystal thrust her hands between her mattress and box springs a vile and toothy grin formed on Crystals young face. Tinas eyes flashed wide seeing Crystal withdraw a homemade spirit board. Tina was on her feet and at the bedroom door in protest in the blink of an eye, oh hell no! I have seen this movie we all die! Tina folded her arms and shook her head a defiant, No. Anne and the others laughed at her, Its a game. Its not real. Crystal glared at Annes remarks, Its real enough. The girls erupted into mocking clucking, arms flapping, and laughter at Tina. Tina bumped into the bedroom door. Crystal placed the spirit board on top of her bed. Crystal and the girls looked to each other and then glared at Tina. Each girl placed a single finger on the home-made spirit boards indicator. Tina discovered that one of her tormentors had locked the door. Crystal chuckled dangling the door key outside of Tinas reach. Let me out, Tina pleaded. The crowd of tormentors mocked her pleading and emotional outburst. Join us for one question and Ill open the door, Crystal spat her response at Tina. Tina lowers her head in submission to Crystals demands, Fine, but let me out afterward. Crystal patted the floor next to her in a gesture for Tina to sit next to her. Tina flopped down and placed her index finger on the indicator, Lets get this over with. Crystal smiles and stares at Tina, I will ask the first question. The collection of mean girls scowled, but each lowered their head in submission to their leaders demands. Crystal cleared her throat, all hands in. Crystal swayed back and forth with eyes closed tight, Is there anyone here? The tribe focused their attention on the indicator for the slightest signs of movement. A palpable silence fell across the small room each girl held her breath waiting for an answer to the question. Minutes passed, and the indicator remained motionless. Crystal broke the silence, I asked if there was anyone here who would like to talk to us? She added an authoritative tone to her voice. Five minutes passed and the spirit board revealed nothing to the teen-aged girls. Well, enough of this, Tine stood and walked to the bedroom door. Crystal and the violent girls pounced on Tina driving her into the bedroom door and then dragging her to the floor below. Tina kicked and screamed giving as good as she received. Crystal mounted her sitting on her shoulders driving her knees into her chest and slapped her across the face not once, not twice, but three times. The other girls laughed and helped hold Tina to the floor. I didnt say were done, Crystal spat her words into Tinas face. One of the other girls spoke up, We should punish her. Crystals eyes seemed wild as she and the girls chanted, Punish, punish, punish. To the closet, Crystal pointed to the open closet door opposite the bedroom door. Tina found herself at a loss for words but struggled to resist. The riotous crowd hoisted Tine from the floor and sent her crashing into the back of the closet. She hit hard against a small dresser standing in the walk-in closet. Crystal slammed the door closed. They hurt Tina, and she wept, please, let me out. Tinas screams and pleas for release fell upon deaf ears drowned out by the loud music of the party. Tina felt exhausted after a half hour of begging. She sat on a pile of Crystals dirty laundry waiting for her chance to be free. She wanted to save her energy in case she had to run all the way home if need be. Crystals friends continued to seek any response from the homemade spirit board. They had all lost interest, but Crystal insisted they continue. Anne was the first of the girls to protest, Is there something else we can do? This is boring. The others joined the protest and Crystal snarled at Anne. Tina watched the girls through the wooden blinds of the closet door. Tina summoned her courage and blurted out, Crystals board is a fake, but her moms are real. Crystal gave into her anger and threw the spirit board at the closet, shut up youre being punished! Anne grabbed Crystal by the arm, Lets go get it, if its real it will be worth it. Crystal rolled her eyes, fine, Ill need you guys to watch for her. When we have guests, she likes to show off and take out the board. Crystal and the girls enter the hallway but Crystal blocks Anne, You stay put and make sure she stays in the closet. Anne nods in acceptance of the terms of their agreement, Fine, be quick. Anne watches for the others to be out of sight and closes the door. She walks to the closet door a ghoulish smile forms on her young face. Anne throws open the closet door and stares at Tina. Tina squints at the bright light from the bedroom, what? Anne grabs Tinas arm and drags her to her feet. What are you doing? Tina asks, but Anne hushes her by pressing a finger to her lips. Anne walks to the bedroom door dragging Tina close behind her, Come on, you will help me prank them. Tinas look of confusion cemented at that moment. You didnt think you were the first person they ever locked in that closet, did you? Anne scolded. Tina nodded in acceptance of whatever part she is to play in getting even with Crystal and the others, how? Anne opened the door and glanced up and down the hallway seeing no one they slipped into the hallway, okay, when they get back I will pretend that youre still in the closet, but youll be in the hallway closet. After they use the board, I will fool them into believing a ghost took you from the closet. Anne opened the hallway linen closet and motioned for Tina to get inside before they return. Anne hands her a set of earbuds, use these to keep quiet. Give me about an hour to get them worked up. Then you come bursting in. Tina pulls out her cellphone and plugs in the earbuds moving further back into the closet. Anne closes the hallway closet door. Tina slides her finger across the smooth surface and the blue glow gives life to the cellphone. She swipes through the application arriving at her favorite streaming service. Moments later she finds herself drawn deep into one of her favorite animated series and time passes. Tinas eyes flash open. She wipes the spittle from the corner of her mouth. She rubs her legs trying to awaken them. More intense pins and needles replaced the sensation. She shakes her head trying to awaken, How long was I asleep? She looked to the cellphone which had turned itself off because of a low charge. Tina pulled the earbud out placing them into her pocket. The hallway closet door opened making no noise. Tina stepped out and stretched. She could feel two spots in her back pop. She enjoyed the relief that followed. Tina looked up and down the hallway, but saw no one. The most curious thing was she could see the night sky beyond the window at the end of the hallway. Inside the hallway, she noticed someone had turned every light on and each door hung wide open inviting visitors and the curious. Tinas curiosity drew her out of hiding she walked to Crystals parents open bedroom door. I hope they will take me home I dont want to be here anymore; She focused on the open door. She stopped short of the open door hearing wet noises coming from inside the room. Are they making love with the door open? She pondered and turned away from the door but noticed she had stepped into something wet and warm soaking into the carpet. Tina glanced down raising her foot to see what she had stepped in. She covered her mouth silencing her gasp. The pungent metallic odor confirmed her observation of fresh thick red blood covered the sole of her foot. This discovery left her breathless and faint. Tina tumbled into the wall opposite the open bedroom door. Her eyes found crystals father face down on the floor bleeding out from wounds all over his body. His blood ran down his prone body and pooled beneath him soaking into the carpet. Her trembling arm reached out to check his pulse ensuring he was alive. The body jerked for a moment and something pulled it into the room the door slamming hard enough to rattle the frame. Tina inhaled ready to scream for help, but she held back the terror in fear for her own survival. She found her way to her feet and crept down the hallway stopping next to Crystals bedroom. Her curiosity forced a glance inside the bedroom. Tina stepped into the doorway in desperate need to find others, but this was not to be her ascendance from the hell she found herself in tonight. She swallowed hard and stepped back clenching her mouth closed to prevent her shriek allowing tears to run down her cheeks, Oh My God! The visceral carnage spread throughout the bedroom left her stomach nauseous. She knew the fresh remains belonged to the bodies of children thanks to a recent health class lecture. It left her unsure where one body began and the next ended in the mountain of torn flesh and hot wet gore. The closet door rattled sending Tina fleeing into the bathroom in a panic. Anne emerged from the closet, Tina, wait its me. Tina had already found her way into the shower and had pulled the dark shower curtain around herself. It had forced her to become a master at finding hiding spots due to her schoolyard torments. Anne stepped out of the closet and spoke, Tina, come back. She made her way to the open bedroom door, We need to get out of here. Tina opened the shower curtain, Anne? Her flowing tears framed Annes face, Yeah its me. Come on, before. The door to Crystals parents room burst open with a loud crash. Tina pulled the shower curtain tight around herself. Anne screamed and retreated into the bedroom. Tina trembled hearing the rolling thunder of heavy footsteps in the hallway rushing towards them. She swallowed hard, hopeful it would discover neither Anne nor her. Anne continued to scream. Shut up and hide girl, Tina whispered. Tina could tell by the muffling sound of Annes voice she was retreating deeper into the room. Here pig, pig, pig, an otherworldly high-pitched voice echoed through the second floor of the house. Tina drew the shower curtain impossible tight around herself her eyes clenched shut, but her imagination ran wild with visuals of the sounds that came next. The bedroom door slammed closed and Annes screams for help went unaided. Annes voice turned raspy being pressed to its breaking point, No, No, No. Something slammed against the flimsy bedroom door, causing Tina to jump with each impact. Anne continued to beg for help. Tina knew the moment the door gave way under the prolonged assault of whatever had created the nightmare she found herself in. She swallowed hard but found herself happy whatever this was, had found someone else. Okay, girl when it goes in after her we run, she affirmed her plan. Anne whimpered, Please, No, No, No. Her voice grew muffled in her retreat deeper into the bedroom. The disturbing voice taunted, Yes, Yes, Yes. The remains of the bedroom door slammed shut and blood-curdling screams filled the second floor. Tina wasted no time and fled the bathroom and ran down the steps. Her every thought focused on escape from the sleepover. She slipped at the foot of the staircase her footing lost in a puddle of blood scattered across the hardwood flooring. She stopped her rapid descent by grabbing onto the railing of the staircase. Tina could not comprehend what laid before her. Bodies of the party goers both adult and child lay torn apart and purged of their internal organs. Piles of twitching flesh laid scattered across the living room. Each of the piles shared certain divisions of specific body parts and organs. The air-conditioning lowered the temperature of the room resulting in stream rising from each pile. Tina could no longer hold back her bodys natural reaction to the gore and terror she was experiencing. It came at first as a punch in the stomach. The sensation followed by pressure racing upwards her body purged itself of her stomachs contents. Her world spun around her stealing her graceful movements driving her down into her own fresh sickness. Tina sat motionless calming her mind and focusing on her escape. She looked to the front door, but a pile of half torn open human torsos blocked it. She summoned what strength and courage remained in her mind and body. Tina stood atop the torsos and pulled at the door handle, but her small frame could not budge the door or the pile. Tinas hands slipped off the door handle sending her tumbling backward through her sickness and the gore-soaked hardwood floor. She struck her head against the coffee table which stopped her continued slide across the room. She grabbed hold of the coffee table and used it to push herself up to her feet. Tina pulled away from the coffee table seeing someone or something had taken the heads of the dead and arranged them in a line of twelve. Tina gagged and stumbled backward. Each decapitated head had its eyes torn from their sockets. She recoiled in disgust at the blasphemous presentation on the small table before her. Tina paused noticing the table shaking, what the Before she could finish he thought the mouths of each head moved and the choir of decapitated heads taunted, Here pig, pig, pig. I know youre here. No sense hiding from me Im going to find you. Tina flees the living room running down the long hallway to the kitchen. Hope drains from her face seeing no back door in the kitchen. She turns back to the hallway and spots a closet. She hears the heavy steps moving towards the staircase. Tina steps into the hallway closing the door behind her. Tina's knuckles turn white clenching her mouth and jaw shut. Her hands shake below her vibrant, beautiful hazel eyes. Her eyes scan the room beyond the closet door wooden blinds in search of the evenings intruder. A nightmare the group of teenage girls set loose upon the world. Tina pulls her cell phone from her hip pocket and traces her index finger along its smooth surface. The glow of the screen let slip the cell phones applications. Her finger came to rest above the blue glow of the flashlight icon, Too Bright. The light of the cell phone's surface lights up the closet behind her. Tina moves the jackets above her to one side to give herself a clear view of the hallway closets contents. A set of work boots reveal themselves in the light to her. She jerks a heavy work boot above her head and swings it down in an overhead arch. Her hands too small to keep hold of the boot dropping it to the floor with a loud, THUD. The boot hit a tall leather sack spilling the contents across to the closet floor. The sound of crashing Steel golf clubs announcing the hallway closets existence to those unaware. Wooden blinds flip open, Tinas eye scans the room outside of the closet to slow her panicking heart and mind following the loud series of noises. Large beads of sweat formed across her forehead. Her shirt sleeve quick to dry her forehead returning her attention to the investigation of the closets contents. Tina with a smile picks up a nine iron, thats what Im talking about. The cellphones last charges of power left so too did Tinas newfound confidence. Her fear races to the room beyond the closet door. Looking through the lowest of the wooden blinds Tinas eyes examined the living room. The forceful rhythmic drumming of Tinas heart in a panic made her feel dizzy and faint. Why did I even come here? I hate these girls, she whispered. Tina prayed for protection but felt little comfort from the unseen thing creating this nightmare. She stopped praying as she heard the heavy footsteps. She readied the nine iron for her inevitable defense. Tina peaked out from the lowest of the wooden blinds in search of the evil no doubt waiting for her to reveal herself. She saw it for the first time and it chilled her to the bone. Crystal, Tinas bully and tormentor, standing at the foot of the stairs in a blood-soaked yellow sundress and rubber rain boots. Her hands covered in fresh gore, viscera, and tufts of Annes dirty blonde hair. Tina looked to the floor of the closet searching for a handle on the moment. Tina jumped backward in the closet seeing Crystals blue eyes staring back at her through the wooden blinds. She screamed, Go away! Crystal pouted, Tina, youll never believe it, but my moms spirit board worked. Crystal spun in a circle, See she stared at Tina trembling inside the hallway closet. She chuckled allowing the otherworldly voice to merged with Crystals as possession of the teenage marionette firmed. Crystals young face dropped all pretenses of humanity her eyes rolled back into her head revealing another set of colorless pupils. The flesh of her face withered and grayed before Tinas unblinking eyes. Crystal seized the closet door and pulled it from its hinges in a single motion sending wooden shrapnel flying from the door frame out in all directions. Crystal spun and tossed the door into the living room slamming into the coffee table the heads dropped to the floor. Tina swung the golf club hitting Crystal in the temple dropping her to the floor. Tina rushed out of the hallway to the kitchen desperate for escape. She reached the window above the kitchen sink, but it would not open. Crystal seized Tina by her long brown braided pigtail. In a single jerking motion tossing Tina across the room hitting the refrigerator and breaking the light switch. Tinas vision blurred and her head throbbed in the darkened kitchen. Tina stared at Crystal in silhouette from the bright street lights bleeding from outside the two-story home. She used the golf club to steady herself and rise to her feet. She spat and raised the golf club ready to defend herself. Crystals body made sounds like bones breaking and rubber stretching to a limit. Shelaughed at Tina, wait till you see this! This is worth dying for. Her small body broken and twisted in unnatural ways elongating arms and legs that cracked and folded in on themselves. She stepped on to her backward facing legs. The bones of her fingertips erupted from the flesh revealing long serrated bone talons. Crystals jaw unhinged itself becoming a large maw of razor-sharp rows of shark-like teeth. Tina wet herself witnessing the grotesque transformation taking place in front of her. I will not be number thirteen, she told herself. She tightened the grip on the golf club and focused on the demonic thing. Crystal roared and launched herself at Tina talons first, Here pig, pig, pig! Tina dropped low and swung the club with all he might. The attack landed true for Tina. Crystal staggered backward from the sharp blow to the head. Tina saw the line of blood from above crystals right brow. She remained herself If it can bleed it can die. Crystal swung her talons at Tina but missed by inches. Tina watched those dreadful claws tear through the steel of the refrigerator with ease. She drove the head of the golf club under Crystals chin causing her to bite down on her tongue. Crystal closed her eyes as the pain of biting her tongue spread throughout her body. Tina knew she must continue to fight if she wanted to survive this monstrous event. She raised the club high into the air and then down on the body of the demonic thing. She could feel the tearing of flesh and the breaking of bones mounting under her desperate assault. Tinas mind filled with the countless insults and pranks played on her by Crystal and her friends. This fueled her vigor and rage driving her deeper into the assault. Crystal slumped to the floor as the demonic shape retreated inside her. Tina stepped back to admire her work. She turned to face the front door as the police knocked the door free from its hinges. The world slowed down when the police entered weapons drawn. She watched the demonic shadow thing haunted out of the house leaving her alone having completed their contract. Tina found herself surrounded by armed police officers holding a bloodied golf club in a house full of victims. She knelt on the ground as the police ordered her to do surrendering knowing theater was no one who would believe her story."
93,vulnerability,nosleep,Has anyone ever tried The Campfire Ritual?,426,bw4e87,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bw4e87/has_anyone_ever_tried_the_campfire_ritual/,2019-06-03 10:31:09,"It was Kylies idea to celebrate our mutual college graduations and to say goodbye. And it was Jenna who offered up her familys cabin for our last hurrah. So the five of us packed up Jennas old Winnebago with enough food for an army and probably twice as much beer. The plan for that weekend was pretty simple: we were going to have the time of our lives and get shitfaced drunk while doing it. Unfortunately for us, the Friday that we left a brewing storm let loose, and rain mercilessly pounded the vehicle. Then, around mile marker 330--one of the RVs tires blew out. The vehicle skidded off the road and into a clearing. We were lucky wed avoided hitting any fir trees. Is everybody okay? Jenna asked, her hands gripping the wheel. Everyone was understandably shaken, but we checked for injuries and other than a few bruises, everyone seemed fine. Kylie got out her iPhone and muttered, I think I got a signal. Thirteen minutes later she confirmed a tow truck had been dispatched, but there was one problem. It wont be here for a few hours, Kylie lamented. Fuck, Stacey murmured. As we put the RV back in order, refilling cabinets with the supplies that had tumbled out, the rain stopped. It was just us, the dense woods, and the gentle rumble of thunder in the distance. Jesus, its getting cold and itll be sundown soon. Maybe we should make camp here while we wait for the tow truck, I suggested. Sure. Couldnt be worse than in here, Jenna muttered. Everyone hopped out of the RV and began searching for a flat area to set up some chairs. Over here, Stacey called. I made my way over to see shed found a spot that gave us a glimpse of the road so we could keep watch for our would-be rescuers. Stacey, Michele and Jenna grabbed the chairs and beer, while Kylie and I searched for firewood. Once we made it back to the clearing, I built the campfire. I think I was the only one with any real outdoor experience. We pulled up our chairs as tight as they would go around the fire. Crickets serenaded us in apparent harmony with the crackling flames. The cool air left by the wake of the storm carried with it the smells of damp earth and the tang of burning wood. This hiccup in our plan was turning out to be quite nice after all. Hey! We should tell some spooky stories, said Jenna as she handed out beers. Kylie shrugged. Itll make time go by faster. Jenna smiled wider and said, Cool! Ill go first. Twilight had faded into night and the storm clouds had cleared enough to give us a view of the twinkling stars. Jenna pointed a flashlight up to her mouth for dramatic effect. Once upon a time, five people were camping in the woods-- Oh thats original, Stacey interrupted. Jenna glared at her and then continued, The five friends were enjoying the campfire until a strong gust of wind blew the fire out. We all looked at the campfire, as though an odd wind would suddenly extinguish the flames. Jenna grinned, obviously thrilled by our uneasiness. One of them set off into the gloomy forest to retrieve more firewood. Only one of them set off into the gloomy forest? asked Stacey. Oh, please. Jenna rolled her eyes. Fine. Two of them went to get more firewood. The other three huddled together in the utter darkness making jokes to soften the situation. Suddenly, footsteps approached the campsite. Turning their heads, they saw a shadowy figure walking out of the woods carrying something. Thinking it was one of their friends, they laughed at the lame attempt to creep them out. Slowly, they realized their friend wasnt coming any closer. They screamed in terror as they saw... Then she stopped. Thats it? Stacey asked. Jenna brought the flashlight up to her chin again and said in the silliest ghoulish voice, To be continued.. We all laughed. It felt good to be goofy together one last time. Hey, have you gals heard of the campfire ritual? asked Kylie. Given the blank stares on all of our faces, it was obvious that we hadnt. So, basically, we have to give an offering to the fire--something that is special to us personally. Then we each tell the scariest, most fucked-up thing we ever experienced. The idea is the stuff we did wont come back to haunt us because we did the ritual. The rest of us looked at each other incredulously. Did you find that on a stupid Reddit forum or something? Stacey asked. Oh give her a break. Its worth a shot. Maybe it can grant us wishes, Jenna suggested with a giggle. I dont know about granting wishes, but Im all for not being haunted. Michele reached into her purse and pulled out a glittery blue bookmark. I got this from my little brother. He said the sparkles reminded him of my necklace I always wear. She held onto it for a second before placing it into the burning flames. Her expression turned serious. Michele let the silence play out for a few seconds--just enough to rattle the rest of us. What Im about to share with you happened to me and my boyfriend. She made an exaggerated show of looking around and frowning. In fact, the story Im about to tell occured right around here. Im already calling bullshit, said Stacey, tossing her blonde hair over her shoulder. If I didnt know better, Id think she was already spooked. She glanced at the darkening woods behind us and shivered. Yep. She was spooked, all right. Dont be rude, Stacey, said Kylie. Well, its not like any of us have been up here before. This is the first time Jennas ever invited us to her familys cabin. Jenna poked Stacey on the arm. If you dont shut up so help me-- she warned. Stacey rolled her eyes. Fine. Michele shot Jenna a grateful look. We were headed to his familys lakeside cabin for a weekend getaway. It was getting dark, much like it is right now, and it started to rain. Josh was driving fast and I kept telling him to slow down. I thought you were the leadfoot, said Jenna. Yeah, I teased. How many speeding tickets have you gotten in the last year? Do you want me to tell the story or not? asked Michele, obviously irritated. Jenna and I shared a look and then I waved at our friend to continue her tale. A woman appeared right in front of the cars headlights. Josh slammed on his brakes, but it was too late. He pulled to the shoulder and backed up to the spot where hed hit the woman. We got out of the car and ran to the middle of the road, but Michele sat back and stared at the flickering flames. No one was there. I would shit myself, said Stacey. We almost did, said Michele with a small smile. I was ready to turn around and get the hell back to town. But Josh says the lake is only a few minutes away and itll take longer to get home. Eventually he gets me to calm down. The rustle of animals in the forest behind us has quieted and even the crickets have stopped singing. Like the whole forest was listening to the story. I have to admit my skin prickled with goosebumps. We keep driving, said Michele, her voice low. We all lean in to catch her words. And the woman appears in the headlights for a second time. Josh doesnt stop. He drives straight through until we reach the cabin. We scramble out of the car... safety is within reach. But before we get to the door the woman appears on the porch. Her once pretty face is mangled and her flowered dress hangs in ratty strips from her gaunt frame. Shes as pale as the moon. She points a bony finger at us and says Michele leapt from her chair and yelled, BOO! We all screamed. Even me. That was so cheesy! exclaimed Stacey. You jumped, I told her. Just like the rest of us. Im not scared, she said. You should be. Michele looked off into the distance. This whole area is cursed. Her expression was solemn. I didnt think Michele had that good of a poker face, so I think she was telling the truth. We really did see a woman in the headlights, she murmured. Yeah, right, said Stacey, though I detected a tremor in her voice. We did, said Michele, straight-faced. Only We all stared at her. She shrugged. She didnt yell boo, okay? She didnt say anything at all. But she did point at us. We got back in the car and Josh took me home. I never saw him again. What a douchebag, said Jenna, her voice flat. He didnt even call you? No, said Michele. He committed suicide. What. The. Actual. Fuck, said Stacey. Youre not serious, Michele. Michele didnt respond to Staceys outrage. Instead, she relaxed into her chair and took a long drink of beer. Think you can do better? Of course I can, Stacey scoffed. She reached into her bag and pulled out a ribbon. I got this from a cancer patient during my hospital internship. Tossing it into the fire, we all watched as the flames engulfed the delicate pink fabric. Ive been around a lot of sick, dying people during my time at the hospital, but nothing made me question my choice of major like the six-week stint I did in palliative care. Stacey paused, taking a moment to look at each one of us. She lowered her voice. I never told anyone what Im sharing with you now. After hearing their stories of survival only to find their beds empty days later it fucked me up. I actually spent some time talking with the hospitals therapist. She stared into the fire while we all glanced at each other, shocked at the quiet vulnerability of our otherwise abrasive friend. So let me guess, Jenna said with a stilted laugh, breaking the uncomfortable silence, a call-light came on in a room that someone died in, or no! A shadowy figure was seen on the security cameras, or-- No, Stacey said softly, nothing like that. A resuscitated patient told me I was going to die. That is fucked up, I admitted. Almost everyone who comes there has said their goodbyes and signed their DNRs. They dont want to be saved so they can spend more days suffering. She shook her head. But there was this young mom, maybe around thirty-five, with advanced breast cancer who refused to accept her situation. It would be inspiring if it werent so sad... Stacey smiled as she reached up and stroked the locks of her own golden hair. She was beautiful once Before she became the bald, gray, tit-less dried-up thing that I knew, hoping against the inevitable. Her family made their peace, but she said she wanted every moment possible with her kids. She inhaled deeply. I think it was selfish of her. Making her kids see her like that. They knew she was going to die its almost like she was torturing her family. I saw her gaze land on the curl of ash that had once been the pink ribbon. Anyway, she coded one night, three times in a row, and I was there for the third. We were into our eighth minute of CPR and beyond ready to call it, when she suddenly took a huge breath of air. Stacey stood up quickly, knocking her chair over and gasping so loudly it echoed off the nearby pines. Every one of us flinched; our eyes widening. The pace of her words quickened. The staff backed away in fear. Her face revealed pure terror and she let out this slow, clicking exhale while looking around the room wildly. Stacey mimicked the expression and unnerving sound, craning her neck and twitching her head to look at each of us. The woman raised her skeletal arm and pointed a limp finger directly at me, she said, doing the same motion toward Jenna. With a raspy voice and eerily wide eyes, Stacey moaned, Youuuuuarrrregoooooingtoooooodieeeeeeeee. She held the last syllable until her lungs were completely empty of breath. Silence again surrounded the campfire. I abandoned my beer and grabbed a stick to stoke the fire. Really, I was trying to hide how disturbed I felt. So, then what happened? Kylie asked. Stacey plopped into her chair. I dont know. I got the hell out of there and she died a couple days later. You think she saw something while she was dead? Kylie asked as she tapped on her phone screen, obviously distracted. Thats what Ive wondered, Stacey said. But all I know is her voice still echoes in my mind. Well, Stace, Michele said, I gotta hand it to ya. Your story was all kinds of fucked-up. And no jump-scare or anything. What can I say? Im awesome. Stacey rolled her empty beer can toward Kylie and it bounced off her foot. HEY! Were you even listening?! No, no, that *was* scary, Kylie admitted as she looked up. Well, maybe you should go next. But dont offer your phone for the ritual, Stacey teased, we may need it if the tow truck doesnt show up soon. How much longer do you think itll be? I asked. Its only been an hour, said Jenna. We have a lot more time to kill. Ha, ha, said Stacey. Jenna waved her hand dismissively. I didnt mean it like that. Well, while Kylie takes her precious time, why dont you go Mel? I... I dont have one, I whispered. What! Thats bullshit, you have to know at least one, said Stacey. You have at least one scary experience. You sure Mel? Kylie asked. The look she gave was bizarre. Fine, then let me tell you about the most horrific thing that happened to me. Kylie put her phone down. Do you know what its like to see the person you love the most suffering and know theres nothing you can do to help them? To want more than anything in the universe to take that pain from them, and be unable to? Can you imagine the anguish youd feel seeing the happiness and light slowly fade from their eyes, until one day its entirely snuffed out? *Do* you? I glanced around the fire, realizing everyones faces were as pale and nervous as mine. Jenna caught my eye and her lower lip trembled slightly before she looked away. I tried to slow my breathing as I dug my nails into my palms. My older sister also had cancer, Kylie stood up and walked to Stacey. She stroked our friends hair. Only, she didnt suddenly die like the woman in your story. No. Her nurse was too terrified to look at her anymore and decided to pull the plug. She didnt even get to say goodbye to her family. Staceys mouth dropped as she stuttered to find words. But there were none. Kylie I said, trying to soothe her anger. Staceys terrified gaze met mine, but I looked away. I didnt know what to do, so I did nothing. Fuck this, no more waiting, Jenna smiled through her tears as she pulled out a gun. Weve been planning this for months now. Its time we finally get our revenge. She passed the gun to Kylie who took a step forward causing Stacey, Michele, and I to jump up from our seats. Her and Jenna were quickly backing us into a corner. Mel, do something! Stacey cried. I moved like lightning and grabbed Michele by the throat, pinning her down and choking her as she struggled to breathe. The woman you ran over that night, the one who was trying to wave down a vehicle for help because her car broke down.. that was my mother you bitch. I whispered as the life went out of her eyes. Before Stacey had a chance to react, the sound of gunfire pierced the night. I looked to my left in time to see Stacey hit the ground and blood gurgle from her mouth. Jenna made her way over to Michele and I, bending down real close to her ear. Good thing you did the campfire ritual huh? We carried them to the RV, putting Stacey in the drivers seat and Michele on the passenger side. As we buckled in their limp bodies, I patted Micheles cheek. Its a real shame that me, Kylie, and Jenna couldnt make this trip. We had to hole up in the school library until the wee hours studying for finals. I let you borrow my Winnebago and gave you the keys to my familys cabin, said Jenna as she dragged the last of the camp chairs inside. Its such a shame you two died right before graduation. Its no wonder you drove over the embankment. You shouldnt drink and drive, said Kylie, as she put crushed beer cans into the trash. By the time they find you, you will be as sober as the dead though. If they find you, said Jenna. I mean, nobody will report you missing until Monday. She put the vehicle in neutral. We pushed the RV over the embankment to make it looked like an accident and dropped a few lit matches down with for good measure. Stacey may have still been alive. We walked down the road like frightened hitchhikers, and told a different story to each driver that gave us a ride. By the time we were done, it was a different tale entirely. Just remember, if you and your friends ever ask about the campfire ritual, make sure you dont want the story to come true. Unless, of course, that was your plan all along."
94,vulnerability,nosleep,The Breakin,5,bwgf9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bwgf9j/the_breakin/,2019-06-04 07:40:03,"I am a 42 year old single father. I have a 12 year old son named Mark. Just 3 years ago, I was subjected to a horrific home invasion. Mark and I almost lost our lives that day. I dont know how we survived the whole experience. One particular night 3 years ago, I was sleeping in my room. I then awoke to a major disturbance in the kitchen. My dog Fillis start barking very intensely. He barks in a more fearsome and terrified tone then normal. Suddenly, I hear Fillis scream and whimper in pain. This alreated me that there is a threat in my house. My son Mark was sleeping in his bedroom, just a few feet away from the kitchen. I knew, in order to protect Mark, I needed to confront whatever was in the kitchen. Although I was trembling in pure terror, I gathered up my courage. I slowly emerged from my bed, while clutching a baseball bat in my hand. Slowly, I crept into the kitchen. When I walked into the kitchen, I see Fillis laying dead in a pool of blood. He twitches, but he is clearly dead. Although it was quite dark, I could clearly see stab wounds in his side. My kitchen had totally been ransacked. All the drawers were violently tossed around the entire kitchen. Suddenly, I hear footsteps walking in the hallway towards my sons room. My heart stopped beating, as I dreaded for my 9 year old sons safety. Seconds later, my son starts screaming in his room. As I watch in horror, a dark figure emerges, dragging Mark out of his room. From what I could make out, the figure was definitely a young man, maybe mid 20s, and quite skinny. His face was concealed by a goalie hockey mask. The figure then pins Mark to the wall, holding his throat with one hand, and pointing out a switch blade at his neck. The figure starts whispering in a threatening tone to Mark. I have a hard time catching on what he was saying, but I could pick up that he wanted money and Marks phone. Although, I really wanted to do something to protect my son, but I was too frozen in fear and shock to do anything. It was almost as if I was magically turned into a stone statute. My son looks at me with tears in his eyes, silently begging me to intervene, but I just couldnt. All of a sudden I feel someone grabbing the back of my shirt. Then I feel a small metal object touching my back. I turn around to look, and there is another intruder holding me at gunpoint. This guy had a dark hoodie and a bandana that concealed his face. Unlike his accomplice, this guy was very bulky and well muscled. He ordered me to drop my bat, and I quickly dropped it. Both of the men then proceeded to drag me and Mark in the living room. They had me sit on the sofia, with the hooded guy sitting with me, while still holding me at gunpoint. Meanwhile, the intruder with the hockey mask sits on the recliner with Mark seated on his lap. The man still has a knife to Marks throat. They demanded me to give out my financial information, such as my credit card number, where I kept my cash in the house, my social security number, etc.. If I did not share that information with them, they would slit Marks throat in front of my very eyes. Not wanting to lose my precious son, I obliged to their demands. The hockey masked man still decided to cut open Marks throat anyway. Before I had time to react, the hooded guy shot me twice. One bullet hit my neck, while another one hit my chest. Moments later, I passed out from my wounds. I dont remember what happened afterwards, but I woke up in the hospital 3 days later. When I woke up, I was greeted by both of my maternal and paternal half siblings (I have no full siblings). I asked them on what happened, and they revealed to me that the neighbors were alerted by the gunshots in my house. They called the police, and they found my son and I lying grievously injured on the living room floor. The ambulance arrived, and drove Mark and I to the hospital. Both of us survived our wounds, but with great physical costs. Mark lost his ability to speak verbally, while I permentially became a paraplegic. The men that attacked us were never caught. I dont know what became of them, but I hope that they were arrested for some other crime they commited. These bastards need to have some justice served to them. Despite this horrific ordeal, we still managed to continue living our lives. Mark has managed to become a rising soccer star in his elementary school. Although I still have yet to find a wife or a girlfriend to help raise Mark, I still manage being a parent to him alright. My job is paying for his needs, and we are still living a healthy middle class life. The demons from that incident still haunt us to this day. Despite all of those years, feelings of vulnerability still lingers on from time to time. From that night on, I never allowed him to sleep alone. I almost lost my son that night, and I never want that feeling ever again."
95,vulnerability,nosleep,Don't Run,178,bcf1q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bcf1q6/dont_run/,2019-04-13 01:43:39," I watched as my mother bustled around the room. She always intensified her activity when she was upset or had something on her mind. This time I didnt need to guess the cause of her distress. Are you sure you'll be alright on your own? she asked, looking at me with a worried expression on her face. Yes mom! Ill be fine, its only one night!  I just want to make sure you have everything to hand. She smiled nudging the over bed table closer to me. I stared at the array of stuff she had piled onto to it. Land line, packets of biscuits massive flask of coffee, water, meds. Finally she stops moving and stands looking down at me, hands clasped together. I could always prepare a proper dinner for you before I go No mom, Im fine, Im practically bed ridden, remember? I really dont need that much to eat. I watched with a pang of guilt as her face crumpled. Sweetheart the doctors said it would take time, you'll walk again. She reached out and took my hand. I wriggled it free, I was uncomfortable with compassion, even from my mother. They didnt say I would walk again mother, they said they didnt know. I Picked up the remote control and switched on the television. A wave of anger washed over me as I flicked from one station to another. I couldnt bare to look at the concern on her face, the pity in her eyes. Rachael, sweetheart...you've already made so much progress...you are walking, you've actually surpassed their expectations. Yeah Mom! I snapped. Youre right I can just about make it to the loo... takes me ten minutes to get there but if I time it right, all good! I laughed, shaking my head No mother thats not walking thats shuffling. Three months and all I can do is manage a slow shuffle. To be honest I think the doctors were a little to optimistic . I can stay. she offered, a hopeful look on her face.  Go home, Im fine! I struggled to a sitting position. She rushed over to me, and grabbed some pillows which she proceeded to stuff behind me, plumping them up. Thanks! I muttered, a hint of resentment in my voice as she propped my crutches against the wall by the head of my bed. Just be careful when you get out of bed, dont rush! Rush? I laughed again, a bitter sound even to my ears. Is that a joke? God I was being a bitch, and I knew it, I just kept lashing out at the people I loved the most, the people who loved me the most. My friends had disappeared one by one, none of them called any more. Sure they had all visited me in hospital where I was safely contained, but as soon as I got home the calls became less and less, visits non existent, I dunno maybe they were uncomfortable with me, my disability or maybe they were just fair weather friends. It made me so angry to think how they had all abandoned me. You would think I would be extra nice to my parents in hopes that they would not turn their backs on me, but no! Perversely thats not how it worked. I just kept pushing them away and I wanted to cry and beg their forgiveness and tell them I loved them and how grateful I was but I just couldnt... instead this monster bitch emerged. Oh and the physiotherapist will be by tomorrow evening, but I will be back by then to let her in, do your exercises and... Yes Mother! I interrupted. You said! there she was again, what a bitch. You have your panic button? she asked softly. I nodded towards it on the bedside table. I watched her walk to the door, a lump in my throat. She turned and looked at the wheel chair parked at the bottom of my bed Perhaps you could sit in your chair for a bit, watch television, looking at the world from a different vantage point might, you know, elevate your mood? She wheeled it closer to me. Maybe. I gulped down the lump and blinked back the tears. I love you... see you tomorrow sweetheart I love you to, I love you so much! I wanted to yell, but the anger and resentment bubbled deep within and buried the words deep. I nodded instead and then she was gone. I listened as she mooched around downstairs, checking on things, closing doors and finally the front door shut and locked behind her. I gave a sigh of relief...and yet side by side with that feeling was a sense of loneliness, then the beginnings of fear fluttering deep in the pit of my stomach. The complete and utter vulnerability of my situation engulfed me. I sank back deeper into the oversized pillows, big tears cascaded down my cheeks. It had begun to rain and the sound made me feel even more cut off. I usually enjoyed laying in bed listening to the rain. It was the first time I had been alone after getting out of hospital. As I gazed out of my window at the dark clouds over head, I recalled the neurologists bleak prognosis. The truth of the matter was that the ten minute slow painful shuffle to the bathroom was as good as it might get. Doctors were never gonna get your hopes up, they always seemed to give the worst case scenario. I stared at the TV, not really focusing on the images that flittered past. The constant drone of the news presenter. For some reason I had become fixated on watching the news...I guess it was my only connection to the wider world...a miserable world. Yet it gave me a certain amount of security to be and remain informed, no matter how bleak things were. I looked around the room, taking in the disability aids. Fresh Spring flowers. Every week my mother brought fresh flowers in from the garden, once an over grown mess, it had become her hobby along with caring for me. It was her hopes to get me sitting in the garden before summer. My father had extended my bedroom into the guest room. I now had a walk in closet, built in cupboards. I hardly recognised the place when I returned home from the hospital. The DIY hadn't stopped upon my return. it was as if they were on a mission to renovate the whole house. As if some how fixing the house would fix me. The end result was undeniably beautiful. They had done their best to provide me with every comfort and adaptation to aid my recovery. Even a new PC Anything and everything to encourage me to get out of bed. I suddenly felt trapped, an overwhelming need to get out of this room overcame me. The loneliness and fear was replaced by a sudden need for progress and it occurred to me that maybe I could do it better if no one was here watching my every move with their soft encouraging compassion and the pity I would glimpse ever so often in their eyes. I actually didnt want them to witness my clumsy attempts, I wanted them to see the results. Maybe it was best my mother had gone for the night. I might even call her and tell her to stay away for a few more days. I knew she would fuss and take it as rejection, but that wasnt it at all. It was about being forced to look for food, forced to move. She had waited on me hand and foot for three whole months. Give me a reason to move god dammit! I Imagined my moms surprise when she returned and found me in my living room, sitting on my sofa watching TV with a cup of tea, that I had made for myself. Sure she would deride me for navigating the stairs by myself, but imagine her delight that I had actually moved further than the bathroom. Maybe I could pay her and dad back for all their love, dedication and help myself in the process. Show them that it was worth it, I was worth it. Thats how it went, one minute I was ready to take on the world, the next I just wanted to curl up in a ball and die. Today however it was different, more than a fantasy. after the initial panic, being alone strangely, made me want to be stronger, get better. I was determined to get down those stairs.\` I took my meds and dozed off with a smile on my face. I dont know what woke me the persistent ringing of my phone or the panicked yelling outside my window. I was confused, groggy from the pain medication. I reached for the phone . My mothers hysterical voice assailed my ears. Rachael! Rachael! are you OK? Yes, why? I replied sleepily, I propped myself up on my pillows, with some difficulty I reached for the light pull. Ive been calling for the last ten minutes. Your father and I are coming over ! and then she hung up. I stared at the phone confused, the yelling outside intensified. I lay there for a minute trying hard to work out what was going on. Was it another riot? I was reluctant to take a look, suppose they saw me and tried to break in? I struggled to raise myself onto my knees, they almost buckled under my weight. I winced in pain, gritting my teeth. I pulled myself up using the window sill as leverage. Putting most of my weight on my elbows I peered out at the dimly lit street below. I could see dark silhouettes of people running, yelling, some far off screaming. I wondered what were they running from? why was my mother so panicked? I squinted as I saw large shapes like dogs running alongside the people, as big as wolves. It was as if they the people, the dogs were all on some hunt together, chasing something. The flickering dimmed street lights distorted shapes, they seemed to merge into each other. Then I saw the first panicked person go down, then another...the dogs were taking them down one by one. It was a hunt alright but the people were the hunted. It was as if they had been herded into my cul de sac to be slaughtered. It suddenly dawned on me those weren't dogs but people...running on all fours. I was sure of it. A man darted into my driveway and hid behind my car. He looked up at me, his eyes wide with terror and then he made a dash for my front door. I saw some of the perusers break off from the main chase and swerve towards him. He reached my door and began banging on it. Then they were upon him, the banging stopped and was replaced by his screams I ducked down and away from the window before the perusers saw me, my knees suddenly went weak, the atrophied muscles had had enough, they buckled and I flopped back down onto my bed. My heart hammering in my chest, unsure of what I had seen. Fear clutched at me as I tugged at the curtains, trying to close them from my prone position. I lay there for a while trying to process. The banging still echoed in my head. I was terrified people or the monstrosities that persued them might get in. I listened for more banging or the breaking of glass. The man had stopped screaming long ago and all I could think of was his mangled body outside my front door. I was sure he was dead. I wanted to peer out again, see what was happening but I was to frightened. Afraid I would peep out and there would be a sea of faces, those things staring up at my window, at me, I was petrified, My fingers curled around the remote control and I Turned the TV up ever so slightly. I listened to reports flooding in. The intermittent screaming outside was distant now but I jumped at every sound and would mute the TV. Then when I felt an unseen danger had passed and all was again quite I would unmute it. I tried my parents phones time and again, willing them to pick up. I text them frantic messages to contact me, to stay where they were, I would be fine...but I didnt know if I would be fine, I didnt know if any of us would be fine. I hunkered down, covering myself with my duvet, as if that would some how protect me from whatever was happening, protect me like it used to, from the monsters when I was a child. I wanted to cover my head and hope it would all go away. I peered out at the television. Main stream media was vague, unsure, not giving me definitive answers. The news was touting it as riots, social unrest. Fuck off those things were more than social unrest. Those things out there were not disgruntled people' I thought. I sat up and pulling my laptop towards me I began to scroll through Facebook posts. I heard the news presenter advice to stay in doors until further notice. I glanced at my phone to see if my parents had replied, nothing! Panicked posts as people uploaded videos to Facebook and twitter. I clicked between platforms. Some speculated Alien Invasion! others The End of times! the most common thread that seemed to emerge time and again ZOMBIES! I laughed out loud, incredulous, terrified. An outbreak of some sort, a virus, contamination, people infected by something? My mind raced along with the posts in ridiculous directions. My eyes darted from my lap top back to the news and then back down to my lap top. So much information, my brain struggled. I begin to click on videos. The perusers, their clothes for the main in taters, hung from their torn emaciated bodies, blood soaked. I gasped in horror as I noticed some of the them had been eviscerated, entrails trailing behind them. I clapped a hand over my mouth as my stomach lurched. I felt the bile rise. Amidst the mayhem and the cries of terrified people I could hear a low rumble, growling almost. I had heard it before when the creatures had attacked the man outside my front door. I tried my parents again, no answer, I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I threw the duvet aside and grabbed my crutches. I had to stand up, I couldnt just lay here, cowering in terror. I needed to at least lock the bedroom door, barricade it somehow. I glanced across the room at my PC. I remembered my father proudly setting it up for me. I had been irritable and ungrateful. They had initially wanted me to move in with them after the operation. Of course I had refused, wanting to maintain my independence. I blinked away tears of regret, a profound sadness swept through me and I began to cry. I should have moved in with them. They were on their way here, to save me and I was here on my own disabled, helpless, I could barely walk. If they were dead, it was my fault. I struggled to my feet. My legs were so weak. They could barely hold my weight. I teetered on the crutches, my legs buckling, they seemed weaker. I slumped back down on the bed. My head in my hands I sat there for a minute listening to the odd muffled yell ore scream from the street below, I gulped as my mind raced, imagining those things breaking in here and tearing me limb from limb, I was terrified, fear and frustration at my disability over took me. I couldnt even run, I didnt have the choice of flight or fight. Reaching out I pulled my wheel chair closer to me. I heaved myself into it, panting with the exertion and then wheeled myself over to the door. I shut and locked it. My dad had reinforced the door. No one would be getting through that any time soon. He had only agreed to let me stay here if I allowed him to reinforce all locks doors and windows. I wiped the tears from my face and looked around for anything to barricade the door. Nothing that I could possibly move in my condition. I sat in my chair, clutching my laptop, watching the TV for a while as reporters went over the same events, the same sanitised footage, every channel practically repeating the same warning to stay in doors. There seemed to be a partial news black out. Surely they knew more than they were letting on. The last important update was the army were now patrolling the streets. I had heard gun fire almost an hour ago, popping sounds in the distance. It had terrified me at first. The thought of the army on our streets. The more footage I watched the more comforting the sound of the gunfire had become. I almost looked forward to it, hoping that they had killed some of those monstrosities. It was us and them now. I wheeled myself over to my desk, placing my lap top next to the monitors I switched on the PC. I watched as it initiated windows. It would be easier for me to keep up if I could view all platforms simultaneously. It was like my little control centre. It made me feel in control. I didnt want to miss a snippet of information. I clicked on YouTube. Social media seemed to be more proactive as people posted one disturbing video after another. I must have sat there for hours scrolling through them. Reading the comments, calling, texting my parents. Dad was innovative, an ex army man, he would know what to do, keep mom safe. I was sure of it. I refused to answer the question that kept popping up in my head..why had they not returned my calls? As soon as the thought entered my head I would push it away and concentrate on yet another video. I rewound one particular video on You tube and slowed it down by 50% I was calmer now, my mind had built up a certain tolerance to the bloody scenes unfolding. I began to notice things that I hadnt before. there was something odd about the creatures spines, the positioning of their legs as they ran. The spines, seemed to have elongated, their hips rotated forward. It must be a mutation. Humans couldnt run on all fours like that, our hips would be in the air not allowing for a circular rotary gallop. I slowed the video down even more. As I watched their gait something clicks in my head, I quickly search Cheetah running then Greyhound There was an uncanny similarity which made my blood run cold. I stared at the TV, not really seeing it. When they were not pursuing someone they were standing twitching, their limbs contorting, their backs arching and I wondered how their spines didn't snap. Something else, my mind was suddenly piecing previous videos I had seen together. One particular post had caught my eye earlier, shaky camera footage, from an office building I presumed, trained on a woman transfixed with fear as panicked people and their pursuers raced past her. I was mesmerised by her terror her inability to move, the perusers on all fours ignored the woman or didnt see her. Then she began to scream and still they ignored her, then she began to run and only then did their attention turn to her as she was brought down, buried under a pile of bodies, fighting each other to get at her. My hands shook as I viewed the same video again and again. Another! A man falters, stumbles and falls, the perusers intent on him, now ignore him as he cowers in a fetal position the hoards of broken twisted monsters jump over his prone body, not breaking their stride as they target other fleeing people, video ends. More videos. I search for the immobilized, the paralysed, the inert among the fleeing crowds. My attention is suddenly drawn back to the TV Breaking News. the presenter declares.  Downing Street has issued critical alert The outbreak has spread across England, Wales and Scotland, There are no reports of the outbreak in Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland or other parts of the world. The United Kingdom has been quarantined. Flights have been cancelled. There is a complete travel ban. There will be no flights in and out of main land united kingdom. All inbound flights have been diverted. The United States, France and Germany have offered assistance if needed The announcer seemed flustered, her face red, sweating as wads of paper are thrust at her by off screen colleagues. You are advised not to leave your homes or offices. Please find a place of safety and remain indoors. and then bleakly This is a state of emergency, I repeat a state of emergency all looters will be shot on sight.  she shuffled her papers It is not known the cause of the outbreak but scientist are working around the clock to ascertain. People on the ground knew it was an outbreak of some sort and here was the bloody news trailing in last. My hands shook uncontrollably as I text my parents again. I turned back to my laptop and begin to type a post of warning. My frantic update is interrupted by a sound outside. I stop what I am doing fingers poised over the keys I listen. I hear my neighbour Ians door close quietly. A sound I had become familiar with over the months. I didnt know him very well, never really got acquainted with any of my neighbours prior to the accident. Maybe I should have. Ian and I had never got past a polite nod. Where the fuck was he going? I thought as I wheeled myself over to the bed. I cleared a space on the overbed table. I flung the packets of biscuits onto my dressing table. Jesus mother! I exclaimed as I placed my laptop onto the cleared space. The street outside had been weirdly quite until now. I could still hear the odd popping sound off in the distance. Navigating my wheel chair closer to my bed I shifted myself from chair to bed, relieved there was no one to witness my awkward, transfer. My neighbour Ian, trying to get into his car. I spy the pursuers in the distance, milling around on all fours, a twisted grotesque parody of what were once human beings. The initial panic over, the streets are empty, people now listening to the warnings to stay locked securely behind closed doors. Nothing left to persue except the odd fool like Ian. They must have heard him quietly leave his house. The oddities approach slowly, four of them curious like cats crawling forward, their bodies closer to the ground. Their bodies turning this way and that as if seeking out the source of the sound. They cant see him, their acuity only activated by fast motion but Ian doesnt know that. He looks over his shoulder and sees them approaching and I know what he is going to do, I can see it in his tensing muscles. I fling the window open and scream at him. IAN FREEZE! He looks up at me startled, he has given up with the struggle to get his key in the car door. he looks over his shoulder and sees the slow, twitching shambling figures closer now. ''DON'T RUN! And as if my warning only reminded him that he could run, he begins to run and before I can say anything else they have him in their sights They cant see you if you dont run. I mutter under my breath as I close the window on his petrified screams. I close the curtains on the gory scene that unravels. I sink back down on my bed as I text my parents another warning. I am calmer now as I realise my disability will ultimately be my saviour, my instinct may be to run, but I knew that was never going to happen. I turned up the volume on the TV and watched the News as I waited for them to reply."

We got back from this one quite a while ago, but its still giving me nightmares, so I figured Id try and write about it. Thats supposed to help, I guess, though at this point, my problems run a little deeper than just needing to *express myself.* No news from the Travelers or legionnaires, but BREACH has been searching the Atlantic ocean with the aid of FVEY intelligence agencies and their satellites. We were deployed to China, a ways north of Songzi, near the Yangtze river, after several reports of farmers turning up eaten, or melted like they had been doused in acid. Normally, this alone probably wouldnt have reached our ears, if it werent for the rumors surrounding the incidents. Locals believed that the area had been cursed by malevolent spirits, and heard screaming or cries for help in the night. The sun would rise, and usually, nobody would even be missing, because everyone was too frightened to investigate the sounds  calling into question what exactly was making them. A witnesss grandson later recorded it, and released it on the Internet. That got our attention. Its been taken down on most places, but we all got a listen before our deployment. At first, all I could hear was the wind, but then, a man started to scream in the distance, yelling help or help me in Mandarin over and over again. It sounded normal, but it kept going on, and after a minute, I started to get this horrible chill down my spine, like something was wrong with what I was hearing. Every call had the exact same intonation as the last, right down to the smallest detail, to the point that it didnt even sound like a language. It reminded me of the parrot that Barrys cousin had, an African grey who liked to repeat the sound of somebody knocking on the door, so if you werent used to it happening over and over again, youd actually think there was someone there. Then, another man joined in. It was a different voice, but it was yelling roughly the same thing, and would occasionally break up the cries for help with a scream of pain, only the scream would sound exactly the same every time. It was probably one of the most disturbing things I had ever listened to, just because of how unnatural it sounded, and I wasnt alone  every one of us agreed that something wasnt right, and I wasnt looking forward to finding out what that something was. We flew in from Taipei in a UH-60M, and had civilians cleared out in advance, tracing along the river until we hit our mark. It was night, and the stars shone brightly through the dark clouds overhead. It was me, Jefferies, Barry, and Tanner, since Sprite was busy being analyzed in R&amp;D, and we were armed with three railguns, power armor, and my favorite electrical cannon, which I took to calling Vera. We werent equipped with our usual cloaking modules, because according to command, we were there to draw out the enemy  whatever that enemy turned out to be. Everything was shrouded in a dense fog, billowing over the land below in the pale glow of the moon. We rappelled down into the mist, and landed in the middle of a rice paddy with a splash, the muddy water coming up to my shins. The bird flew off, and we were left alone in the humid darkness, switching on our night vision. The terrain was dead flat, and you couldnt see much beyond a couple lights way off in the fog. Barry took out his nav equipment, and got us oriented. That way, he said, motioning ahead. About six-hundred yards. Tanner, take point, said Jefferies. Tanner moved ahead, and we followed, inching forward through the mist that swallowed us. Save for the stirring of water in our wake, it was completely silent, and even with our heavy armaments, I felt a sense of vulnerability creep in from the back of my mind, like I could be attacked at any moment, and would be dead before the others could even react. We crossed over a watery gap between the fields, and continued onto the next. Tanner raised his hand, motioning for us to stop, and pointed his firearm at something in the water. I crept forward with the others, and saw that it was half of a bisected corpse, his innards strewn between the stalks. His face had been melted into his skull, as though sprayed with a powerful acid. A sense of dread washed over me, then, and I could feel the presence of eyes watching me  something that I couldnt see, but could surely see me. The others shifted with unease, and I knew that they felt the same thing. Tanner advanced forward through the darkness, and we followed closely behind, my finger slipping into the trigger guard as the wind began to howl upon the air, rustling through the rice that swayed between us. The feeling of being watched slowly intensified, and I glanced back at every opportunity, expecting to see the horror that stalked me, but it was never there. It only watched, and waited, lurking in the shadow of the billowing fog. I heard something, then, far off in the distance. Screaming. An old man yelling for help, repeating himself again and again, but the cries were getting closer every time, until they almost sounded like they were directly in front of us. Tanner stopped, finger on the trigger as he peered into the howling mist. Other voices began to shout, coming from all around us, like we were surrounded by a crowd of invisible onlookers, but they all repeated with the same terrifying, unnatural cadence. I heard a piercing scream from directly behind me, and spun around in a panic  yet nothing was there. Every voice ceased at once, and the air fell to a deathly silence. Paralyzed with fear, I lowered my gaze to the water, and saw a mans face looking back at me, his dead, sunken eyes peering up from a skull of pale, drooping skin, like the flesh of a drowned corpse. Slowly, it rose above the water, standing upside-down on its unnaturally long, slender arms as the other half of its enormous body revealed itself. Looming above me was only a dripping, vertical maw of sword-like teeth that split down into the creatures yawning torso. All I could hear were the drops of water that fell from its horrifying frame, and the quickening heartbeat that drummed in my ears. Before I even knew what was happening, it snapped down on my arms with a vicious crunch, and ripped them clean from my body. A blinding pain tore through my senses, and I collapsed to the ground, screaming in agony as blood gushed from the ragged stumps where my arms used to be. A cascade of deafening bangs cracked through the air, the others opening fire on the creature with their railguns, and blasting it back in a spatter of blackened blood, yet as soon as that blood struck my armor, it only hissed and bubbled, eating straight through it and sinking into my skin in deep, penetrating welts. I writhed in horror and pain upon the ground, trying to pry the smoking armor from my body, but to no avail. The joints melted together, trapping me inside and leaving me to the mercy of the nightmares acidic blood. A chorus of hissing and snapping growls sounded from all around us as more of the creatures emerged from the mist, dashing toward my squadmates on their long, spindly arms while their gaping maws flailed above them. Most were blown back by the barrage that followed, but two flopped into the water with a splash, shuddering and recoiling as their terrifying mouths opened wide. They lunged forward, vomiting projectiles of corrosive bile that struck Barry and Jefferies, who could only scream in pain as the acid rapidly ate through their armor. Jefferies ripped his chestplate and mask off in time, but Barry wasnt so lucky, and his armor fused to his skin with a bubbling hiss, forcing him to his knees while he shrieked in absolute suffering. Tanner ducked as another glob of bile just barely missed him, and unloaded a shot into the oncoming horror that spat it, splattering the area with its acidic blood. Jefferies picked up his railgun, and rejoined the fight, bisecting one of the nightmares with a deafening boom. I was beginning to lose consciousness from the blood that gushed from my severed arms, but all I knew in that moment was adrenaline when another of the creatures rose from the water just ahead of me, slowly advancing toward me as its gaping maw drooped before it. I yelled for help, scrambling back, but the others were too busy fending off the rest of them. Looming above me with a shuddering rasp, the otherworldly terror snapped toward me as I fell back into the water, its massive teeth scissoring shut inches from my face. I kicked the horror off me, knocking it back into the muck. Spitting the blood and water from my mouth as it leaked through the melted remnants of my mask, I crawled away on the ragged stumps of my arms, desperately pushing myself forward with my legs, but I could hear the nightmare advancing from behind, its hissing growl stuttering through the air. The boom of a railgun cracked overhead, and a white hot pain burned through my skin as my back was spattered with the creatures blood. The dizziness began to overtake me, and darkness crept into the corners of my vision, my blood gushing into the water around me. Too weak to hold myself up, I collapsed, and felt my mind slip into the void. That was the last thing that I remembered. I woke up for a moment in the helicopter, Jefferies looking down at me overhead, but so much morphine was running through my veins that everything was just a haze of color. The pain was unbearable, even through the drugs, and when I realized that my arms were still gone, I tried to scream, but Jefferies and Tanner only held me still, the pale light of the full moon shining from beyond as I slowly slipped back into oblivion. I can recall flashes and images after that, but nothing coherent enough to describe. I woke up again two days later, in the medical wing at HQ. My entire body was wrapped in bandages, and I was restrained so I couldnt move. I was in an unimaginable amount of pain, and no matter how many times I hit that morphine button, it really didnt make much of a difference. Barry laid in the bed next to me, his torso wrapped in bandages from where he had been burned. I dont remember how long I was there for. Even with all the tech available to us, it must have been over a month. Barry got out before me, but he still came to see me every day, and he kept me up-to-date with what was going on. Two other squads cleared out the rest of the creatures after Jefferies was forced to call an emergency evac. At least, we hope that they were cleared out. Were still not sure how they got there in the first place. The brass took to dubbing them maneaters, which seems very appropriate. Their calls, were guessing, were actually the calls of their last victims, repeated to lure in any good Samaritans wondering what happened to their missing friends. Barry, whos buddies with a coms guy on one of the cleanup squads, told me they heard one calling for help, this time in English. It was screaming in my voice. In the meantime, Ive got some prosthetics coming my way, so Ill be back in the fire soon enough. No rest for the wicked, as they say. Were keeping stateside for the next one; something called Operation Dagon, set in the corn fields of Kansas. Anything more than that, I cant tell you just yet. Ill see you all soon, and remember to leave a snack on your doorstep tonight. Its hungry, and its watching you."

I was young, with a promising career ahead of me, the love of my life by my side, the whole world at my fingertips. I was 23 years old, not a care in the world. Id enjoyed all the milestones of my young life, but for one. I was yet to be a father. Your mother and I had tried, and we had tried, and we had tried, for two years. For those two years our attempts had been in earnest, but we were young enough that we figured we didnt need to rush. We both had the realization that something was wrong around the same time, so I took your mother to the doctor. It was then that we learned that your mother was unable to have children. The revelation was...devastating, to say the least. Wed lived our life by some kind of loose plan, but this was the first time a specific point of it had been denied to us. Even still, with more credit to your mother than anything, we pushed through it. We began looking into alternatives, and soon landed on adoption. Its a long process, adoption. Between the adoption agency, the lawyers, meeting prospective families from whom we might get a child, we ran ourselves ragged. The stress of it all, Im sad to admit, put a strain on our marriage. Thats when she came. I remember it was a Wednesday, just about two in the afternoon. Your mom and I were eating a late lunch when we heard a knock on the door. Standing on our porch was an attractive, fancy-looking woman dressed all in white with a briefcase in hand who informed us that she was aware of our predicament. When we asked how she came to know of it, she told us she was a consultant with the adoption agency wed been going through. She introduced herself as Lillian, and asked if we would be open to speaking with her for just a few moments. In hindsight, I would have slammed the door in her face. But I didnt. I invited her in, and the three of us sat down in our living room. She told us how sorry she was for our difficulty in having children, and lamented the frustration of both being a client of and working for an adoption agency. Then she asked the question that changed our lives forever. What if I told you that you two *could* indeed have a baby of your own? Your mother and I were equal parts skeptical and intrigued. Lillian told us that if we were interested, she could make possible our chances of having our very own child. Obviously, this sounded suspicious, but your mother and I agreed that we wouldve never forgiven ourselves if we hadnt heard her out. She opened her briefcase and retrieved two small vials of a dark liquid. She told us that if we consumed this liquid, it would enable your mother to get pregnant. She told us that we would have a happy, healthy baby, and that we could have as many as we wanted. She then told us that on our childrens 16th birthdays, they would go through a change that normal children dont go through. This change wouldnt hurt them, that it would cause them no pain at all. Lillian told us that she offered this only to hopeful parents whom she felt truly deserved it, to people who she felt would give a child a good home. If I didnt stress it enough before, please understand that our inability to have a child had really taken its toll on us. It seems so foolish in retrospect, an utterly ambiguous deal with what was made to sound like a minimal consequence. In truth, she took advantage of our grief, our frustration, our pain. She manipulated our vulnerability and our desire to have a child, and we fell for it. We accepted the deal. The liquid in the vial I drank was all but flavorless. We each drank it, and that was it. There was no feeling; it was as if wed drank a vial of water. Lillian wished us well and went on her way. Weve only seen her one time since then. Soon after that day, we learned that your mother was pregnant. We were ecstatic, to say the least. Just under nine months after that, your mom gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. We named her Jenna. Im sure this will come as a shock to you, learning that we had a baby before you. We didnt have you until Jenna was 12, so its not unreasonable that you dont remember her. Over the years youve mentioned certain memories, and Im sorry to say that Ive done all I could to erase any trace of Jenna from them. Im truly sorry, Kathryn. Anyhow, as Jennas 16th birthday approached, your mother and I speculated on what would happen. The surreality of the encounter with Lillian so many years earlier took our minds to wild places. We wondered if she was going to grow wings, if she was going to turn into a giant, all sorts of outrageous scenarios. On the morning of her birthday, your mother and I walked upstairs with breakfast for Jenna to enjoy in bed. When we opened her door, we expected to find her asleep. Instead, we found her standing in the center of her room, simply staring at the door, at us. There was nothing immediately noticeably different about her, but something was off. The tone of her voice, maybe. It was a long time ago, and Ive done everything I can to block that day out of my memory, so please excuse any lack of particulars. You, me, and your mother sang Happy Birthday and gave her breakfast, and she gave us a half-hearted thank you. That whole morning, though, all she could focus on was you. Her eyes rarely left yours. She would whisper things to you and you would look at her, confused. I only heard one thing she said to you that day. Well meet again. I promise. We will serve her together. I think it was at that moment that I knew the girl wed raised, the beautiful, smart, funny, kind, caring girl wed loved for 16 years, she was gone. Around noon she took a change of clothes into the bathroom and turned the shower on. Assuming she left out the window immediately, she was gone for about three minutes. What happened then, I remember as clearly as I remember yesterday. She came back through the front door, and she was covered in blood from head to toe, as if shed swam in a pool full of it. She stepped into the living room, where your mother and I were...we were in shock. She had no expression on her face, she was just...indifferent to the situation entirely. But her face was different, in a way. It was...angry, twisted. Her eyes were...bigger. And instead of the gorgeous blue theyd always been, they were cloudy white with flakes of red. Then in walked Lillian, dressed all in black. Say goodbye, dear. Lillian said to Jenna. What Jenna said...it felt like Id been punched in the gut. Yes, Mother. Jenna walked up to me and gave me a hug, but it wasnt her. It was...like she had never hugged anyone before, like she had read about it somewhere and was trying it herself for the first time. I was too afraid to move, so I just stood there awkwardly as she finished with me and did the same to your mother. Thank you for raising me. Goodbye. There was no emotion in her voice. It was just wooden, completely void of any personal connection we may have once shared. Lillian ushered Jenna out of the house and looked back to us. Youve done well. We will meet again. And with that, she left. Once I snapped out of my paralyzing fear and confusion a few seconds later I ran out our front door, but it was too late, they were gone. We called the police and told them what happened, and we found out what Jenna had done when we thought she was stepping in to take a shower. In our neighborhood there were only two houses that shed gone to. One was a house two away from ours, the other about three blocks away. They police say she attacked at random, just whichever person she saw first, she slaughtered. They never found the victims hearts, either. What really stumped them was that the exact same thing had happened at 12 other houses spread out across town, and in the next town over, and the next town after that, all at just about the same time. The victims were butchered, left in the middle of circles made of their own blood. Also with their blood were various symbols drawn on the walls. Investigators initially thought it was some kind of coordinated attack, that there were multiple perpetrators who struck simultaneously. But all the witnesses, and there were a *lot* of witnesses, said theyd only seen one person. A young woman, long brown hair, pretty, between 52 and 54. When shown a picture of Jenna, they all confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was she who had attacked their loved ones. When looking in to Lillian, investigators found that no such woman had ever been in the employ of, or in any way connected to, any of the adoption agencies wed interacted with 16 years prior. They never found another trace of Jenna from that day forward. It was as if shed vanished from the face of the earth. Once we were able to leave town, we moved across the country, to this house. That brings me to you, my beautiful Kathryn. Your birthday is in two days. On that day, something is going to happen to you. Even after everything, I cant begin to speculate as to what that something may be, but nevertheless, it will. I can only assume Lillian will return for you. No matter what happens, your mother and I will always love you. Always. Nothing will ever change that. So please, dont think that whats happening now means anything different. I know you werent expecting to spend the days leading up to your birthday locked in the basement, chained to the wall, but I hope the room I built provides you at least a little bit of comfort. I can only imagine how scary and confusing this must be for you. I hope you understand that we cant let anyone else get hurt. All we wanted was a child of our own, and we love the children we had. We love you deeply, unconditionally. I hope you dont hate us. If I would have had any idea what was going to happen to Jenna, I would have done what Im doing now, back then, with her. We just needed a baby. Kathryn, Im so sorry. I cant imagine what goes on inside you when it happens. I would take all of it on myself if I could. I have no doubt that Lillian is going to return. When she does, I will do everything I can to keep her from you. I am sorry to all the people hurt by the decision we made all those years ago, but I will never say I regret it. Your mother and I have cherished every single second weve gotten to spend with you, and we are going to do whatever we can to keep you here with us. I love you sweetheart, we both do. Ill never forgive myself for you having to go through this, or for Jenna having had to go through it. And it keeps me up at night, knowing I have two more daughters to whom I may very well have to write this same letter in just a couple short years, only theyll remember what happens with you. Arya and Casie love their big sister so much. Whatever happens on Wednesday, please try, just try not to hurt anyone. And if you see Jenna, please tell her we love her and miss her. Ill bring food down for you at 6pm. Love always, Your father. _____ To anyone reading this, I dont know what is going to happen on Wednesday. But I feel as though I owe it to you to tell you protect yourself. I dont know what Lillian does with the children of people who drink from those vials, but I know that those children can hurt people. I truly hope none of you have pay the price for our desperation.

Anyhow, as Jennas 16th birthday approached, your mother and I speculated on what would happen. The surreality of the encounter with Lillian so many years earlier took our minds to wild places. We wondered if she was going to grow wings, if she was going to turn into a giant, all sorts of outrageous scenarios. On the morning of her birthday, your mother and I walked upstairs with breakfast for Jenna to enjoy in bed. When we opened her door, we expected to find her asleep. Instead, we found her standing in the center of her room, simply staring at the door, at us. There was nothing immediately noticeably different about her, but something was off. The tone of her voice, maybe. It was a long time ago, and Ive done everything I can to block that day out of my memory, so please excuse any lack of particulars. You, me, and your mother sang Happy Birthday and gave her breakfast, and she gave us a half-hearted thank you. That whole morning, though, all she could focus on was you. Her eyes rarely left yours. She would whisper things to you and you would look at her, confused. I only heard one thing she said to you that day. Well meet again. I promise. We will serve her together. I think it was at that moment that I knew the girl wed raised, the beautiful, smart, funny, kind, caring girl wed loved for 16 years, she was gone. Around noon she took a change of clothes into the bathroom and turned the shower on. Assuming she left out the window immediately, she was gone for about three minutes. What happened then, I remember as clearly as I remember yesterday. She came back through the front door, and she was covered in blood from head to toe, as if shed swam in a pool full of it. She stepped into the living room, where your mother and I were...we were in shock. She had no expression on her face, she was just...indifferent to the situation entirely. But her face was different, in a way. It was...angry, twisted. Her eyes were...bigger. And instead of the gorgeous blue theyd always been, they were cloudy white with flakes of red. Then in walked Lillian, dressed all in black. Say goodbye, dear. Lillian said to Jenna. What Jenna said...it felt like Id been punched in the gut. Yes, Mother. Jenna walked up to me and gave me a hug, but it wasnt her. It was...like she had never hugged anyone before, like she had read about it somewhere and was trying it herself for the first time. I was too afraid to move, so I just stood there awkwardly as she finished with me and did the same to your mother. Thank you for raising me. Goodbye. There was no emotion in her voice. It was just wooden, completely void of any personal connection we may have once shared. Lillian ushered Jenna out of the house and looked back to us. Youve done well. We will meet again. And with that, she left. Once I snapped out of my paralyzing fear and confusion a few seconds later I ran out our front door, but it was too late, they were gone. We called the police and told them what happened, and we found out what Jenna had done when we thought she was stepping in to take a shower. In our neighborhood there were only two houses that shed gone to. One was a house two away from ours, the other about three blocks away. They police say she attacked at random, just whichever person she saw first, she slaughtered. They never found the victims hearts, either. What really stumped them was that the exact same thing had happened at 12 other houses spread out across town, and in the next town over, and the next town after that, all at just about the same time. The victims were butchered, left in the middle of circles made of their own blood. Also with their blood were various symbols drawn on the walls. Investigators initially thought it was some kind of coordinated attack, that there were multiple perpetrators who struck simultaneously. But all the witnesses, and there were a *lot* of witnesses, said theyd only seen one person. A young woman, long brown hair, pretty, between 52 and 54. When shown a picture of Jenna, they all confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was she who had attacked their loved ones. When looking in to Lillian, investigators found that no such woman had ever been in the employ of, or in any way connected to, any of the adoption agencies wed interacted with 16 years prior. They never found another trace of Jenna from that day forward. It was as if shed vanished from the face of the earth. Once we were able to leave town, we moved across the country, to this house. That brings me to you, my beautiful Kathryn. Your birthday is in two days. On that day, something is going to happen to you. Even after everything, I cant begin to speculate as to what that something may be, but nevertheless, it will. I can only assume Lillian will return for you. No matter what happens, your mother and I will always love you. Always. Nothing will ever change that. So please, dont think that whats happening now means anything different. I know you werent expecting to spend the days leading up to your birthday locked in the basement, chained to the wall, but I hope the room I built provides you at least a little bit of comfort. I can only imagine how scary and confusing this must be for you. I hope you understand that we cant let anyone else get hurt. All we wanted was a child of our own, and we love the children we had. We love you deeply, unconditionally. I hope you dont hate us. If I would have had any idea what was going to happen to Jenna, I would have done what Im doing now, back then, with her. We just needed a baby. Kathryn, Im so sorry. I cant imagine what goes on inside you when it happens. I would take all of it on myself if I could. I have no doubt that Lillian is going to return. When she does, I will do everything I can to keep her from you. I am sorry to all the people hurt by the decision we made all those years ago, but I will never say I regret it. Your mother and I have cherished every single second weve gotten to spend with you, and we are going to do whatever we can to keep you here with us. I love you sweetheart, we both do. Ill never forgive myself for you having to go through this, or for Jenna having had to go through it. And it keeps me up at night, knowing I have two more daughters to whom I may very well have to write this same letter in just a couple short years, only theyll remember what happens with you. Arya and Casie love their big sister so much. Whatever happens on Wednesday, please try, just try not to hurt anyone. And if you see Jenna, please tell her we love her and miss her. Ill bring food down for you at 6pm. Love always, Your father. _____ To anyone reading this, I dont know what is going to happen on Wednesday. But I feel as though I owe it to you to tell you protect yourself. I dont know what Lillian does with the children of people who drink from those vials, but I know that those children can hurt people. I truly hope none of you have pay the price for our desperation.

My name is Joachim Eisenherz (well, it's not, but you get the point) and I am your friendly neighborhood hacker. My calling in life is wine, fine dining, Cops TV series and making our increasingly cyberpunk world safer for your average Joe. Recently, I came across a nasty vulnerability in the Planet VR game. As you will see, I wasn't taken entirely seriously by the manufacturer. I've taken the liberty to hijack this random account (sorry, /u/SCPendolino, hope you understand) to show the public how the company treats my reports. The wall of text below is a dump from one of the company's mail servers. So, enjoy! Before the exploit makes it's way into Emotet and gets used by every single script kiddie and their mom. They still didn't do anything to fix this, so I suppose this is not the last time I post in here.

This vulnerability is critical, since in combination with CVE-2019-25463, it can lead to disastrous arbitrary command execution in humans (as absurd as this sounds). I can provide a proof-of-concept exploit, as well as a technical demonstration, upon request. The proof of concept is also explained within the attached document. As usual, this vulnerability will not be made public until it's addressed appropriately by your developers. I hope for a quick resolution of this issue.

I wonder what it takes for a freelance security researcher like me to be taken seriously these days. In any case, I sincerely hope you'll handle the situation correctly this time. To help you understand better, I've improved my PoC exploit and executed it on an unsuspecting player. I've been able to persuade him to run naked in the street. It was a blast, but I'd rather not see anything like it ever again. Video evidence, as well as the source code for the exploit are included. Again, I hope for a quick rectification of the situation.

Can't blame them, really - It tends to be quite a hassle. Therefore, I'm contacting you directly. Now, unless you do something about it, your company will receive dozens of e-mails like the example above. There is a vulnerability in your game, and it allows remote hypnosis and limited mind control (I'm not kidding) of your players. Details are included in the attached document. In case you don't believe me, take a stroll to your lab. There are six beta testers dancing Gangnam Style right now. If that is not enough, I don't know what is. You also probably want to handle this right now. An exploit has already made it to a clearweb GitHub repository. I'll let your CIO explain what that means. Oh, and by the way, I have access to your company mail server (as you can see from the sender address). if this ever makes it to the news, which I sincerely hope it does not, I'm going to publish every single email on this subject until today. So that the world sees what's going on. For now, I'm just going to dump everything up until this point on Reddit. Just to give you some encouragement.

100,vulnerability,nosleep,There's A Creature Living In Room Nine Of Our Hotel And It's Trying To Take Our Bodies (Part 1),10,b0cyzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b0cyzq/theres_a_creature_living_in_room_nine_of_our/,2019-03-13 07:55:57,"(If You're new here and don't care about all these excuses for my absence then just skip to the \*\* on the left side of the real beginning) You know, sometimes I just really hate myself. Because I had posted the things that I had last time, that being information about the hotel, I somehow had attracted the unwanted attention of Alonso Henderson (My bosss boss), and accidentally violated section 6 of my contract to keep work related matters *at* work. So if its been awhile since my last posts, thats the reason. See, Im technically not allowed to talk about work outside of work. Meaning this entire internet journaling thing was kind of became illegal when I posted that entry on the internet since I signed that contract when I first started working here five years ago. Though through some miracle, I was able to convince him to ignore the entire thing by claiming that this worked sort of as a therapy mechanism for me and a fictional story to anyone who had came across it, not having to attend therapy of whatever kind I probably needed meant I could work more hours for him while not wasting company money on getting the much needed help I probably should have been getting. I guess I dont have dental, Ive got mental. He decided because it wasnt a site to be threatened by and who would believe it anyways, so in the end everything was cool. Though that was a close one. Jaspers wife. Kara has apparently also found out about my writings and came over and told me to delete the story I was in the middle of posting. The one about Jaspers cult and how I became their guardian of sorts. At first I was hesitant, though once again, once someone beats you up, you tend to take heed to their requests. (It seems most of the people I consider to know me the best, have all taken a gander on handing my ass to me.) Anyways, all you guys really are missing out in the ending to that story is mind control, figuring out the secret to reviving the dead, and that a demon-like creature named Ziven (I dont remember his last name) is out who knows where, swearing to try to kill me. (But who isnt these days?) And how the spoken contract between me and Carmillo originated, though I guess its not *that* important. I never really have read back through my journal entries to often mostly because there wasnt that much to read. I mean theres supposedly a tale behind one random little entry in my logs that literally just reads Fuck Vincent, bastard and trying to put that into context can take some time. Not to mention all the time wasted from me getting carried away by my nonexistent attention span and yadda yadda yadda. Excuses, excuses. \*\* Anyways, no more bullshit. For those of you who dont know me, my name is Sevan (Winifred) Slater, and I work at a hotel. This hotel doesnt have any name in particular, but Ive come to give it many names, Zloy hotel, hell, home. Basically the gist is, weird things happen at this hotel in this little town in the middle of nowhere. From a dark lord living in the basement, a demon cat with acidic spit, to the floor opening up and releasing a giant plant monster in our backroom. Its rarely a dull moment around here, and even less so now that Kazimir is here. Kazimir Ivankov is, for lack of better term, a punkass instigator. And Im not just saying that because Im salty that he stabbed me in the shoulder this summer or anything. He truly is unbearable. At least, he is to *me*. Kazimir finally answered some of my questions only after I had guilt tripped him enough for him to begin to give a shit about informing me about all of the shit he was going to be bringing into the shit pile. Kazimir is what he calls a Zloy Hunter. Or at least thats what he calls himself. A self appointed title, if you will. When I asked what a Zloy was, he explained that anything that attacks you can technically be considered a Zloy. But, Zloy can technically translate to any kind of demon, creature or paranormal being around. I didnt try to pry into why he didnt just call them demons or creatures because he simply snapped about how it was easier *his* way. I asked about why he came to this town from his home in the Eastern part of Russia to which he explained that Zloy sightings were scarily high here, despite how often they were deleted from of the internet almost immediately after they were posted and that he just had to check this place out. Apparently, Russia and the totally *not real* land of Canada have a lot of Zloy activity too, though this town has more sightings per square mile than a good couple hundred kilometer areas of Russia he has worked in previously. He even taught me how to classify Zloy. There are three types of Zloy, one being extra-human abilities, a half is a Zloy with inhuman characteristics, and a two has paranormal abilities. Then you class them on threat level. one means an inexperienced person could take care of it with minimal trouble, two means a group of untrained people could take care of it, three means a professional can take care of it with ease, four means a group of experts could take care of it and a five means that its rare that anyone could handle it. To give an example, a spuiders that began showing up from back at the beginning of last year would be a 21 Zloy on Kazs scale(not that theyre around anymore), which would tell Kaz that it had inhuman abilities, didnt look human and was relatively easy to deal with. Honestly I kind of missed those slimy creeps. It had taken me a couple of month to finish training Kazimir about the hotel and Alphonse was finally healed up from his miniature vacation and had rejoined the party. The summer had finally ended and we were approaching the middle of fall. Noe was the same as ever and in all honesty, he was kind of acting a little nicer than usual. Though that mightve been because Kaz without fully understanding what Noe was yet, ripped off one of his face plates which meant Noe had to be forced by what he claimed was his contract, though I assume its more like his coding, to hide out in his office until Alonso could send a guy from the factory out to fix him. He must have been a little deprived of attention for those three days or something because hes been nothing but clingy for the past while. Things were actually both easier and harder with Kaz around. He and Alphonse had basically become best friends around here which I guess is fine and all, but lets just say that Kazimir isnt exactly the best influence. And Vince never changed. He never has, never does, never will. The cultists had been swinging by every now and then like usual. Things felt the strange kind of normal that they usually were. I had actually been getting more hours off then I really knew what to do, which meant I actually was getting more invested into the cheesy soap operas I would turn on the sad old tv in my sad old apartment to make the environment a little less hostile. Nobody had died in a while. That felt wrong. Though I didnt get much time off this particular day as I was called in early by Alphonse to come in because I was needed for something or rather. The radio in my car has begun speaking to me. Well that is, speaking to me inbetween the violent static that pretty much had become white noise for my short journey to work and back. It hasnt said anything noteworthy but has been speaking about the hotel in extremely vague terms. I couldve sworn it said my name once but I mean, it could have just been the number seven, spoken out of context due to the radios constant cutting back in and out again, I dont know. I have a tendency to either under-think or overthink so it probably isnt *too* important. I had returned to the hellhole as tired as ever and saw standing in the hotel lobby Jasper and Kara Floyd, the local cult leaders. A newly wed couple that upon looking at them, you think that you could figure them out. Jasper was a tall, pale, and scrawny man with the beginning of a well groomed bread that looked as if he sold duck-calls on the weekends, that coupled with the scars that lined up his arms gave the appearance of a rebellious trouble maker and Kara was a small, chubby girl with long brown hair and always wore a giant smile on her face that highlighted the rows of sun kisses that crossed her cheeks and the bridge of her nose, within her voice was a sweet and sugary southern accent. Their looks couldnt be any more deceiving. Jasper was a sweetheart, who didnt know how to say no to anybody. He always put others before himself even when he doesnt really like them and is always kind to everybody. He cries a lot, and seemingly only wants to make all other people happy. Kara was the kind of person that *actually* wrestles on Fridays and Saturdays. She knew who her friends and her enemies were and didnt take shit from anybody. If you made her husband cry you were basically deader than a holocaust victim. She had a big heart and a strong chokehold (something Ive learned from experience). I waved at them as I threw my backpack under the front counter and sat down. Hey, Winifred. Jasper waved gleefully. Hey dude. Whats up? Hows married life treating you? He rubbed the back of his head and chuckled nervously before saying, Not too much and amazing. How are you? Same old. Same old. How bout you Kara? Howre you adjusting to cult life? She huffed and popped out her hip. Not as culty as I thought at first, honestly! I still cant really believe how nice everybody there is. Im pretty sure thats because you married their prophet. Besides, I have the feeling that you would murder them if they even so much as glared at you. Now, I wasnt salty that they considered me their savior and still treated me as a filthy outsider scum, while Kara was getting a cushy welcome, not at all. Oh, believe me, darling. I have. Jasper started freaking out before Kara explained that she was just joking to calm him down. We both knew she was lying but Jasper was nothing, if not gullible. Before I could ask them what they needed, Kazimir walked in and threw himself down into the other swivel chair violently and threw on the security cameras real quick, sorting through them before spinning his chair into mine. Youre early. he mumbled smugly before leaning his head back into my personal space and giving a smug grin. Whats with that? his stupid Russian accent danced around his curious tone and I shrugged. Actually, thats my fault. Jasper threw out. Im so very sorry Winifred, I didnt know what time you came in and- Theres no need to apologize, Jazz. Its not like I had anything else to do. But what, if you dont mind me asking, do you need? Kaz rolled his eyes and sat up in his chair while Jasper tapped his foot anxiously. Well you um, see- I uh, Kara put her hands on his shoulders and roughly massaged them. Salright. Spit it out, hun. she encouraged while Jasper begun shaking. Well uh, you see, I and my high priests had last weekend decided to try and perform a ritual and uh, well it like, um worked and stuff. But the thing is that uh, it wasnt exactly what we thought it was and it uh, if you wouldnt mind coming- So basically, weve got a problem. Since Jaspers still pretty sure that *youre* some kind-a savior or whatnot, we kind of need your help. Kara patted Jaspers back reassuringly and waited for my answer. Uh you guys are being pretty vague about this problem of yours I huffed uneasily as they seemed to slouch a bit while reading my mood. I think it would be better if you saw it with your own eyes. well that sounded like the first ingredient to start cooking some trouble soup. But I decided that I was already here early and shit, what harm could a little stroll into the woods to a cultist camp, with a cult prophet, and an ex biker girl. I spun around to Kazimir and his always smug little face and got a devilish idea. Sure, Kaz and I would *love* to go! I stretched out my spine and threw my arms up to crack my fingers and Kaz kind of gave me this dulled out seriously look and growled. Well unlike you, I actually have a job to get back to- Oh, come on! You just checked the cameras, no security threats in sight! Come on, youre going to lose those legs of yours if you dont start using them! he kicked his swivel chair back to steer him in the backrooms direction. See, I use my legs. I use my legs just well, thank you very much. I think it would be good if he would come too, Winifred. That is, if he wants to. Jasper shrunk behind his wifes shoulder while looking down at us. I mean, hes the head of security. He must have experience with dealing with more hostile *things*. When Jasper wasnt nervous, his vocabulary could be border line other languagly, though when he was shy, which nine out of ten times he was, he spoke in shaky short sentences in the least offensive words possible. Well now Kazimir had to come. Jasper was giving him the kicked puppy-dog eyes. Itll be fun, a change of scenery. I urged, feeling Kazs aura of anger growing gradually towards me. Kaz cocked his brow at my newly found superior attitude and dropped it into a glare. Fine. Ill go. And so, me, Kazimir, Kara, and Jasper traversed the mile or so into the woods and made casual small talk on our journey. I was glad that Mr. Zloy/demon hunter big shot came with us as unofficial bait, just in case While on our stroll, Jasper and Kara explained that about two weeks ago they were in the middle of a ritual when they mightve accidentally summoned a Zloy in the attempt of doing whatever it was they were doing. They didnt elaborate, it was kind of fishy but I let it pass, them being cult leaders and all, everything they did tended to be fishy. We finally arrived in their humble little compound which used to be a homeless shelter which before that was a system of tunnels used for a sewage system that no longer was used as the town opted for septic seeing that settlers just kind of began building their houses wherever whenever time ago that was. Lanterns lined each wall giving of a warm soft glowy feeling and we entered the dark tube. It was when we stumbled upon a makeshift door that things began to pick up. Kara banged on the door, startling Jasper a bit before it was opened as well as it could and two men rushed out and further into the seemingly never ending pipes. Kaz and I stepped in and immediately I threw my hand up to shield my nose from the repulsive stench that greeted almost all of senses. Kaz didnt seem to bothered as he looked down to the corpse of a creature I had never seen before. It had wiry, yet, slimy black fur, was a thick as a bear, though around the size of a male deer. Holey, leathery wings protruded out of its back and a long entrail was sprawled across the tunnels floor. Whelp, here it is. Kara popped her hip out and threw her hand over it sassily. Weve been busy with this one for most of the summer, but in the end. I think you know how the story goes. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Kaz intermittent. Is dead though and of the smell of it, its been dead for some time. Why did you need Sevan to gaze upon its dead glory or shit? Because- Kara kicked the Zloy over to its stomach and moved some of its wiry fur aside revealing the demons breasts. I tried my best to cover my eyes (for modestys sake). Its a mommy. And how *did* you figure that out? I dug but Kaz shook his head. You summon it like this? Kara shrugged while Jasper awkwardly watched us all from the doorway. How am I supposd tknow. All I know s that earlier today we heard the noises that usually prelude an attack from this gal right ere. When shes already been dead for a good month. So do you just look at demon breasts regularly or nobody payed attention to my completely relevant argument. We have a suspicion that it had its babies somewhere in the forest around our camp. Jasper finally felt comfortable to speak up. The thing is, none of our men want to go out and go searching for the children of the creature that literally tore holes in our home in order to eat us willingly. So... I made a noise that was probably the mixture of a whales mating call and a starving babies whine and huffed. Kay. Ill get on it. Thank you, Winifred! Jasper jumped up and down like a child granted chocolate and hugged me. Thanks. Kara growled shooting me a *dont ever touch my husband again.* look and giving me a harsh punch in the most healed stab wound on my shoulder. Yup! I wheezed out all the air I had left and faked a smile. No problem. The Floyds bid Kaz and I goodbye and good luck as we traversed the forest floor carefully for some time, in search of baby monsters, but eventually came up with nothing. So- Were not finding anything. I deadpanned. Yeah, noticed. Well return to the hotel for now. And well start to search again when it gets darker, I feel like a Zloy with eyes like it had would be nocturnal. I thought you were too busy staring at its breasts to see its eyes, but okay. a stick shot out towards my direction barely missing my face. Shut it, girl! caught guilty and red handed, as I suspected. Kazimir and I walked back down the familiar path back to the hotel. When we entered the front doors, Alphonse shot his head over the counter in shock though relaxed when he realised that it was just us. Hey Kazimir, Sevan. Where were you two at? At compound. Kaz ran his hand through hair fluffing dandruff down his face and sighed. Whatd Jasper and Kara need? Alphonse pulled out his journal and begun writing down word for word the explanation he pried from Kazs gritted teeth. Ever since the beginning of this past summer, Alphonses mental state has been going nowhere but downhill. He pretty much became obsessed about trying to find out what was going on around the hotel and town. That was the main reason he and Kaz had grown so close. Alphonse has conceded himself into believing that Kazimir had all the answers he sought for and that if he wanted to put his curious mind to any kind of ease, Kazimir had the answers. Alphonses clothes no longer fit him well and hung loosely off of his body. He gave of a familiar stench that after the few weeks of smelling, one gets used to. He probably hadnt left the hotel in a few days, maybe even weeks at this point. He was always jotting down things that could give him a clue as to figuring out what Zloy were or where they came from. He lost his girlfriend, his life outside of the hotel, and possibly most of his sanity. He looked deadly tired as his hand flew across the lines on the page in seemingly no effort. Hey, can I go with you? When you go later tonight? Alphonses exhausted eyes seemed to light up for the first time in forever as the promise of hunting demon babies couldve been a chance to discover more. He had dissected most of the dead Zloy that ended up piling into a honorable sized kill count from Kazimirs hands trying to discover everything he could about this seemingly new world. Sure. Kaz began to wander to the stairwell to go about his rounds of the building. But Sevan has to be there too. Stupid savior shit and stuff. he threw open the door and trudged up, leaving me and Alphonse together. Alphonse turned to me and gave a warm smile. Maybe a walk in the woods tonight would clear up his mind a little and I walked behind the counter to join him. So what have you been up to? Eh, not much. Eat. Sleep. Existence. He chuckled. Same here! and awkward silence filled the room as he looked down to his feet shyly and shifted himself in his chair and began sorting through all of the camera inputs on the new computer. After a *certain* event regarding the hotel being temporarily out of our control and overrun by an outsider in the attempt to release some great evil, Noe and Alonso decided that security cameras would do us some good. They werent anything fancy, the quality reminding me the kind of television static you would get in the 50s/60s. But I guess it was better than the constant run around the building that had been our previous measure of defense. I usually used it to check the internet for substanceless things or just plain old streaming whatever shows I could find but I had to share it with that snitch Kaz who restricted *certain* websites so I could focus on working and in the hopes of preventing me from putting any*more* viruses on the computer. Fuck Kazimir. Alphonse finally broke the silence with a sudden, but not too new, bravery. Hey, Sevan? I hope you dont mind me asking or anything but Ive been wondering ever since I started working here, what exactly do you look like under those bandages? Oh? my voice dropped and cracked as I realised that Alphonse had been trying to pry into my private life again. He was sure that I had something to do with the creatures that roamed in this town; because how else would I still be alive? (his words, not mine). Ive read some of Alphonses journal exerts when he had passed out from lack of sleep one night, and was met with the ramblings one would expect from a mad man. Everyone but Kaz was out to get him or hiding something from him. He even had a theory that I was somehow in control of all the Zloy that roamed this town and that I was the devil incarnate. It was childish, though interesting nonetheless. Oh, for the new people here, I should probably explain the whole right eye/faces deformity before I continue. While I was in a foster home way back when, I was hosted by a man who was a priest. Who, like Alphonse, sure that I was possessed by the devil. But then again, this was the same priest that convinced his disciples to give him all of their diet coke and buy out all of the stores roundabout of the vile drink, claiming it brainwashed you into becoming an atheist. He was later found to be drinking it all. He hung onto the excuse that it was to cleanse the world of it but he was just feeding his sugary addiction. So I take his words and accusations with handfuls of salt. To make a long story short. I lost an eye, sustained enough scars on my face and arms to last me a life time and a wonderful personality that follows suite. And what exactly caused the whole, accident? I sighed and wondered about whether or not Nog (the manish creature that lives in the hotels ceiling)was doing okay before feeling the starchy texture of the gauze on my face with my finger tips. I didnt want to tell him the truth of *why* the priest had decided I was a demon in the worry that he would use that to fuel his theory about me further. I just got into a fight with someone who didnt like me. And as for how it looks- I peeled back the bandages slightly to give him an idea of the scars underneath and he nodded his head. I didnt really mind showing him in any other context. But him trying to prove I was some kind of otherworldly creature wasnt exactly my favorite predicament. I shifted the few lines of bandage over my eye and showed him my empty eye socket in the hopes that he would be satisfied. He slightly cringed at the sight and shrunk back. S-sorry. he mumbled and turned away, probably realising that his cringing wasnt exactly what a girl wanted. Though, it was the reaction I got from most people. Kaz returned from his rounds not too much longer afterwards and plopped in the third plushy leather chair and begun spinning aimlessly in circles while hugging his feet to his chest. He did this for a few minutes before deciding to give me his unwanted input, as always. You should cut your hair. his spinning never ceased. What do you mean? I asked. He finally slowed his circles down and pushed his chair into the direction of the monitor. He clicked the mouse a few times before answering my question. Do you even brush your hair? Its little like a birds nest. Not to mention, it makes you more vulnerable to attacks from both behind and infront. How does my hair make me more vulnerable to attacks? I held back a chuckle as Kaz explained. Easy to grab and knotty enough to get a good grip on. Besides, its kind of stressful to look at it. Very messy. He shook his head. Okay? I opened the top drawer and grabbed out the orange safety scissors from inside and handed them to him. Lets go. he guffawed a hearty laugh before looking me straight into my eyes and ceasing all glee. Seriously? If it bothers you that much, just cut it off. I explained, confused at his reluctance. He shook his head and looked back at the camera feed on the computer. No. Why not? Alphonse was watching us bicker back and forth thought decided to ultimately stay out of it. Because my mother taught me that a girls hair is her life. Then kill me. No! Wha- Youre- Im not cutting your hair. Thats creepy. How so? Because it just is! Kaz shot up but I was swift (and clumsy) and launched myself out of my own chair and into his, stopping his movement of escape. Leave me alone, you freak! Kaz laughed nervously before decided that having scissors around me was a dumb choice and chucking them across the room. Damn it. I removed myself from Kazimir and returned back into my own swivel chair. Whatever. Why do you even want me to cut your hair? I dont. If it was bothering you, you shouldve just gotten rid off it. But now, you cant, for it shall remain messy forever. I guess Kaz kinda made a point with the vulnerability to attacks, if only a bit. Id cut it when I got home. A awkward few hours later, me, Kaz, and Alphonse began prepping for our little walk into the woods, I had convinced Vince to station himself at the lobby until we got back with the promise of me owing him a free beer. And no surprise, he accepted it before lighting up some pot and leaning too far back on his chair and falling backwards, though he didnt remove himself from his feet up position on the floor. Before we could set out, ear piercing shrieks resonated throughout the night air and continued for what felt like a lifetime. Kaz dropped the extra guns and bags of ammo off of his back and darted to the sound of the noise. Is that coming from here? Alphonses eyes filled up with liquid joy and a sadistic smile grew onto his face, threatening to rip the skin between his ears and mouth straight and clean. He grabbed his journal from of the counter and followed Kaz up the stairs. I shrugged and wandered after them hoping that nothing too bad would interrupt my already interrupted day. The itsy bitsy spider climb up the water uh, thing! Vincents singing behind me wasnt something I was too shocked about. Nog seemed to like it as above me and through the sounds of painful agony that resonated through the walls, the roof above me was filled with a light pattering of feet and a subtle \*splunk\* above where Vince was howling his new makeshift version of the itsy bitsy spider. I made it about three fourths up the the stairs when the shrieking, wailing, and muffled pleas for help stopped and I picked up my pace ever so slightly. Banging and yelling came from Kazimir when I reached the second floor I saw Alphonse standing out of a room with a bronze 9 on the door and Kaz running off in another direction. Heh? I tilted my head. I-It was coming from this room. Kazimir went to get Noes master key so we could get in. Alphonse shuddered and jolted in pure happiness before he was interrupted from behind me. A hushed tone began to speak. Alphonse, please make return to the main desk to deal with any distressed guests. Sevan, I need you to stay here and help me. Noe had walked past me and shoved one of the keys on his cartoonishly oversized key ring while Alphonse disappointedly walked back down the flight of stairs, mumbling all the way. Uh, I mean no offence, Noe. But, why do you want *me* to help? I mean, Alphonses got a boner for these kind of things. Noe groaned as the door unlocked and he retrieved his keys. I mean that would seem to be the most factual option of going about this, but youre not the best with people and I need someone who wont try to drag away and hide whatever is in there. That makes you most qualified to help me up here. I guess that made sense. And also, I believe its in your contract to- Yeah, yeah, I know. the door was pushed open to reveal quite a gory sight. Guts were strung about the rooms floor and above the bed posts almost deliberately as twinkle lights in a teenage girls room. A blood covered sewing kit lied in the corner alone. On the floor surrounded by broken bones and ripped flesh lay the vent door from off of the roof. A light scratching sound came from above. It was as if someone was climbing through the vent, heading elsewhere. {Part 1 of the Dark One's Awakening (Zloy Hotel) : [URL"
101,vulnerability,nosleep,Im a Private Chef and my new Client is a Cannibal [Part 6],473,b2xm9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b2xm9y/im_a_private_chef_and_my_new_client_is_a_cannibal/,2019-03-20 00:47:47,"I thought I knew what sort of person I was. When I was growing up, I was just like the other kids. I had dreams and plans about my future and what I wanted to be when I became an adult. My dad would have the hardest time trying to get me out of a princess dress. Sometimes he chased me for hours insisting that he needed it washed. Of course I knew that having the dress on didn't make me a princess, I had grown up to be a bit more grounded than that in my dreams. The dress was my means of hiding from reality. It was that sense of escapism that seemed to be my temptation throughout my life. I wanted what I thought would give me freedom. Of course I chose the more structured path, I let those aspirations go and became the responsible adult I thought everyone had to become. But lately, because of a new presence in my life, it feels like the world is turning upside down. If you have kept up with me over the past few weeks you know I'm talking about a cannibal that has managed to somehow make himself feel almost normal. Ben Engel is likely not his real name; but from what I have learned about this strange and twisted man is simple: there is so much more to this world than wrong or right. And it both frightens and excites me to realize this now, as I sit here typing this up and realize; I have gotten involved way over my head with this. I don't like what I am becoming. But I can't lose my family. I have fought too hard and for too long for that. I know I'm being a bit long winded and you probably want me to cut to the chase. Sorry. This is still a lot for me to process, so I will take my time and get the details right. I owe my sanity to this, so bare with me as we go down this rabbit hole together.  Ben's father died quickly. It was a blow to his femoral artery that really did the trick, the long cuts against his legs causing him to fall into unconsciousness. I made sure he was dead before I headed back stairs. Ben was waiting for me. I dropped the knife on the floor and let it clatter against the wooden paneling before I made an announcement, ""You won't eat him."" Ben blinked a few times, perhaps confused by what I was telling him; so I repeated it with an explanation. ""That's why you brought me here. Because you could have done that days ago. But you were bound to him. You needed to be free. So now... now you owe me."" I was tired and didn't really feel like analyzing the entire structure of this broken monster's mind. I just wanted to go home. ""You're right,"" he admitted in exhaustion. I could tell his voice was cracking as though he too finally realized just what a hold this man had on him. There was a short awkward silence as he walked across the room and stared at the lake. It looked hypnotic. ""My children are my whole world. I can't afford another long and drawn out court hearing,"" I was starting to ramble but he held up his hand and said, ""What matters is that it's important to you. I will look into it, and I will make things right."" He made a call to get me a ride back to home and then told me he was going to give his father the burial that he deserved. His eyes were not filled with rage like before. But actually sadness. It was going to be hard for him to say goodbye even though this man had turned him into a monster. ""I'll be in touch when I get more details about your case Kassandra,"" Ben promised me as he let his hand rest against mine while we waited for his dinner. I felt my heart skip a beat as Ben stared down at the floor and tried to comprehend why he was suddenly showing such an attachment. Was it because I had opened up to him or had accepted his role? How many others had he ever even been honest with? Was I the only one that could even get close to understanding him? Reflexively I pulled away from his soft touch, I didn't want to welcome the idea that I had empathy for a monster. And yet as I drove back toward Austin, I realized that was exactly what was happening. I could see his pain. I could be exactly the same as him. What did that say about me as a person? I'm well on my way to becoming a monster myself I suppose. But I have my reasons. I'm fighting for something I believe in, just like anyone else would. I didn't ask for this! I didn't want to play judge and jury to a man that chops people up! I didn't hear from Ben for almost two days after that. Part of me was glad, it gave me time to compartmentalize everything and make sense of it all. James was still moving forward with contacting the judge as promised, so my resolve to make this go away only got stronger after that. I asked him to lunch, as a last ditch effort to make him see that this wasn't what was best for the girls. I insisted he come to the house just to see how happy they were. ""You look great,"" he told me when he answered the door. He was lying. I could always tell now that we were separated because of that half smile he gave. But I played it off and accepted the compliment before letting him in. I wanted him to see I wasn't being defensive or attacking his character. ""Thanks for swinging by,"" I said. ""Well I'm in town until Thursday so it's no big deal really,"" he said as we sat down in the kitchen and watched the girls race around with bubble wands. Their laughter was infectious. But his reminder about the deadline made it impossible for me to share their smiles. ""I think we got off on the wrong foot the other day at lunch James,"" I told him. ""You mean when you basically called me an adulterous bastard in front of the whole bistro?"" He was trying to lure me in the way he had before to get me to go on the offense. But it wasn't going to work. ""Look. We don't have to like each other, I get that. But we do need to start being proper adults for the girls. That's why I really don't think you've thought all of this through,"" I said softly. ""I never wanted this in the first place Kass! Joint custody was supposed to be the agreement and from what I have seen, you've managed to make that happen only twice since the settlement,"" he said. ""So you really would have preferred it if I had never found out about it in the first place? How long were you planning to live that lie?"" I asked. ""I'm just saying that my actions shouldn't reflect on them! They deserve a father in their life!"" James argued. ""Then be here for them!"" I said. Instinctively I grabbed his hand. It felt cold and clammy. He was nervous. ""Come back here to Austin. Make things work the right way, like we tried at first,"" I told him. I could see that he was almost believing me. But then he finally let go of my grip and stood up. ""You said it yourself. We can't turn back time. What's done is done,"" he said as he prepared to leave. I felt a knot twist in my stomach as I realized that this was my last chance to stop this from going any further. ""James, please. I don't want you to hurt us anymore,"" I told him. He was looking into my eyes and seeing my pain. But it wasn't empathy that I saw in his reflection. Only pity. ""It seems to be the only thing I'm good at Kassandra,"" he said evenly as he left. He didn't even say goodbye to the girls. I watched as he drove off, the girls crying a bit as their dad left and then I shooed them away to go take showers and get ready for supper. I needed whatever miracle Ben could cook up to work. As they showered I texted him. &gt;No dice. James is still going through with it. There was a long pause as I looked across the lawn and toward the open road. I felt empty inside, thinking that even Ben was not going to follow through for me. Then finally there was a response. &gt;Finished reviewing your original divorce settlement. I think I know where to go from here. Will check back in the morning. I breathed a sigh of relief. I just wanted all of it to be over. But maybe that was asking too much? I mean, I opened the door wide when Ben came into my life. I knew what I was getting myself into. Would I ever experience the same fresh breath of air that he felt when his father was gone? Or would I always be waiting for the other shoe to drop? I found out the answer this morning. I tossed and I turned waiting for some kind of answer to my concerns. Then a simple text came in around 8am. &gt;Taken care of. Enjoy your day off. That didn't give me the relief I expected so I texted back a few different questions to get details. But instead the messages all failed to go through. Ben has disposed of the burner phone and moved on, I thought. Maybe that's the best way our arrangement can end? He will grow tired of me, or realize that I'm too risky to keep around and just move on? Did I want him to move on? There was a certain thrill of excitement I got every time he gave me a call. Before I had a chance to even contemplate that, another alert came on my phone. But it wasn't from Ben's new number like I expected. Instead it was a medical alert. I jumped up and got dressed as quick as I could when I read what the message said. I got the girls up and took them to school faster than I even dared think possible and then I drove straight to the emergency room. I rushed in and went to the front desk, barely able to get my name right and then they led me to the room where my ex husband was on life support. ""What happened?"" I asked the nurse. ""Collision, it was on the interstate. Looks like a hit and run. The police were here earlier but he hasn't been cohesive enough to answer any questions,"" she said. ""Are you the wife?"" She asked. I blinked and looked at the machines that were keeping him breathing. This was deliberate. My heart dropped. ""I'm sorry what did you say?"" I asked. My mouth was starting to go dry. ""Are you the wife?"" she repeated it slowly like she thought I was dumb. ""No... just just the emergency contact. We're divorced. What kind of car was it? Did any cameras spot the accident?"" I asked. ""I don't think so... but I'm sure when the police get here they will have more answers,"" she said. My head was spinning now as I walked back out to the main lobby. Then my phone buzzed again. A private number. I stormed out of the ER and took the call. ""Tell me you didn't do this,"" I said, my voice sharp enough to cut through bone. ""I didn't."" There was honesty in his voice. But he was holding something back. ""But... you arranged for it to happen,"" I said slowly as I looked toward the small trail that led away from the hospital. Ben was there. He had come here to see the results of his malicious plan. I didn't even bother to care if anyone saw me. I ran straight up to his face and punched him square in the jaw. I moved to make another blow but he stopped me short. ""I deserved the first one. But anything that happened here is well beyond the request I made,"" he said sternly. ""And what did you ask? What the hell did you do??"" I screamed. ""The settlement said that if he was found to not be capable of providing for the children that any appeal would be tossed out by the court,"" Ben said. He was actually finding it hard to say the right thing. He knew he had fucked this up. ""I... Lucas. I told him to make it where James was hurt.... but this... I didn't intend this,"" he admitted. ""Just break his legs or something? Is that it?? I wanted you to find a legal way to help me out of this fucking mess I'm in, you idiot!"" I hit him again. This time he didn't try to stop me. Maybe he needed to feel the pain? ""If he dies... I swear to god that we are through,"" I said as I turned about and started walking back to the ER. ""You know what,"" I paused and looked him square in the eye. ""I changed my mind. We are through. Cut me off your damn salary. Delete my info. We're even now. An eye for an eye or whatever."" ""Kassandra..."" he began. But I didn't want to hear any of it. I was the reason all of this had happened anyway. This was as much my fault as his. Maybe even more so? Would any of those people have even been his meal if I had refused? Im the killer. Im the sinner. Ben liked to think he was strong enough to go through with anything. But in that moment I saw his vulnerability. He needed me to say that it was ok. But it wasnt. It never was. ""This is goodbye,"" I said sternly. If I walk away now, with what sanity I have left; maybe I can pick up the pieces of my own broken soul?"
102,vulnerability,nosleep,The Perfect Guy,143,b41j94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b41j94/the_perfect_guy/,2019-03-22 17:19:42," You know, Ive never understood why in movies, when a serial killer has someone at his mercy, why he says anything at all, he mused, chewing and swallowing his marbled ribeye steak. He pinned his meal down with his the flat of his knife, hard, until the blood squeezed out, with strong wrists and a firm, practiced, delicate knife point. The tip of the blade jabbed into the flesh of the meat, just the tip, and his vice grip visibly held the meat rigid and compressed against the plate. Awkwardly, slowly, he slid his fork into the steak, and pulling, he ripped the sinews of the meat apart, too slowly for comfort, just pulling the forked section away from the fold, stringy bits clinging in vain as the strands of the beef snapped one by one and separated with violence from the center. Both the killer and the victim know full well whats to happen next. Why speak? Whats the purpose of the dialogue here? Who is learning anything, and what would be the value of any of the lessons? he asked, rhetorically, not bothering to meet my eye as he spoke. He raised his fork to his mouth, paused, and just dropped the fork entirely to clatter upon his plate, his other hand sweeping to raise his wine glass and, holding it at the stem, reaching with it, extending his long index finger and pointing at me directly. Really Sarah, whats the point? he asked, this time with focus, this time with unblinking eyes that drank in my fear and nourished him better than the steak ever could. I didnt know what to say but the rag stuffed into and taped across my mouth would have well denied me any chance to respond. My wrists burned from their tight confines, more duct tape here. I thought it strange that he took the time to twist the duct tape into tight strands of rope, but in his defense the tightly wound tape seemed to dig deeper into my skin, it hurt more and left more of a mark. Mark was always the perfectionist though, wasnt he? He always knew just what to say, what to do, how to act. Everyone loved Mark. I loved him too. I hate that I still do. Bound to that chair, with a steak of my own growing cold before me eyes, I couldnt help but think back to the first time we met. Starbucks, on a Tuesday morning. I remember it stood out to me because Tuesdays always seemed so bland, nothing ever happened on a Tuesday. They wrote Sara on my cup and this tall, handsome man just walked up to me, and with just one finger, placed gently at the base of my wrist, raised the cup in my hand up to his gaze and he looked upon it, and remarked, They must have spelled it wrong. Im sorry? I remember mumbling, confused by his sudden presence inside my personal bubble. You need an H here, Id expect. Thats the correct spelling -the old way. Spelling Sarah with an h is how it reads in the bible, and I dont expect your parents would gift you with a biblical name without knowing its history and its strength. He stared straight through me, and I felt like I couldnt ever lie to this man. I well, yeah, I giggled, oblivious of the danger I was in. Its supposed to be Sarah with an h. But God knows why my parents spelled it that way, theyre not religious. He placed his palm ever so gently on my forearm and said, The most reliable translation of Sarah, the wife of Abraham in the Hebrew bible, is woman of high rank, or more commonly, Princess, he paused, gauging my reaction. Are you a princess, Sarah? he asked, with the slightest of smiles. I had never felt so attractive, so wanted so hunted in my life. I felt like nobody else was in the room. I never wanted to be outside and away from the way he seemed to look at me, with this casual acknowledgement, as if everything we might ever say to each other could continue if I wanted it to, but I could just turn away from him at any moment and our paths would just never cross again. I was in love. We married a year later. My parents loved him. He could talk politics and sports at length with my father, and hed never hesitate to do the dishes with my mother and sneak the odd cigarette with Mom when she had a rough day and needed some time away from Dad. He seemed well read but not contentious. Charming without being cloying. Smooth with a hint of self-deprecation. Strong without being boastful. Tidy without being obsessive. Sharp without being biting. He flirted with my friends to help them feel jealous of me, but I never doubted for a second that he was mine, all mine, and all he seemed to want was me. I wanted to have his children but every time I brought it up, he carefully rearranged the conversation with gentle chastisement of himself, saying things like Im not sure Im ready yet, or I barely know what I want for myself, let alone how I should raise another life, always with an onslaught of vulnerability and honesty which left me no room to doubt him. I hope you understand by now that hes just a run of the mill psychopath. That it was all a practiced dance and a careful puppetry of the self. That he doesnt even know who he is, and cant help himself. Because on that night, when I failed to answer him, with that foul rag stuffed halfway down my throat and I choked on my own saliva just trying to appease him, mumbling through my gag, as he asked me why, what IS the point of dialogue in the presence of monsters on that night, he asked for words when I was bound to silence, and that was the last night of my life. He roared, with his perfect, beautiful teeth bared for me to see, and bellowed with a gorgeous rage in my face. Those strong hands that used to cradle my chin so gently as we made love, they gripped the table and hurled it with mad abandon against the wall to my right, along with all the silverware and the food hed so carefully prepared. Nothing stood between him and I, bound roughly to my chair. Wild eyed and monstrous, he tore the buttons from his shirt and flexed his beautiful chest, then rushed to me and sunk his bite into my neck. I used to love how he kissed my neck. I felt like a treat that only he could enjoy. But on this night, with those smiling lips and gleaming teeth, he took an enormous chunk of flesh from my neck, tearing out the muscles that held up my gaze and forcing my head weakly to the side as I wailed in pain and my howls echoed around the dining room of the house he build for us. My father always said this was the sort of home he always wanted for me. High ceilings and archways between rooms. Our own little castle. He was so proud of how we lived. I wonder if he had any idea how Id die. Those soft, sinewy hands of his gripped my throat as he lowered his bite and tore away my bonds with his bloody bite. Sick from the blood loss and my gaping neck wound, I could barely raise my arms as he gathered me up out of my chair and held me close. Raising me by my neck and my thigh, he held me high above his head and curled me around his head so my belly pressed against his upper shoulders and neck. And with one arm crooked around my neck and one around the pit of my knees, taking a deep breath, he squeezed like he was trying to break the world itself in half. I felt all the air forced out of my lungs until I couldnt even scream if I wanted to. Blood poured from my neck and I heard my ribs crack one by one as he drove his arms tighter and tighter together. With a resounding heave, I heard him wheeze, and I felt what I thought to be my spine shatter as he tore me in half, rending me in two and tearing me apart and breaking my bones upon his upper back and shoulders. I used to brag to my girlfriends what a lovely, muscular back that he had. I used to tease him and call him Atlas  he who held up the world, another old name and old idea, just like Sarah, just like me. I thought he cared what I thought. But my broken ribs now punctured my lungs and I could feel my breath fill up with blood and fluid, and I coughed manic chunks of broken self all over the dining room as I shuddered weakly in his grip. As the light in my eyes dimmed and I fell into darkness I realized it was not ME that was telling this story to you tonight, dear reader. It was him. Or, I should say, it was \*I\*. It was Mark. Or Jeremy. Or James, or Steve, or Nathan. It was Ethan or Edward or Jacob. It was the guy you met last week that seemed too good to be true. It was the charming guy you met on the subway, or the tall, dark and handsome man you shared an Uber with by total accident that one night. It was the man who showed up to buy you that drink JUST when the night was getting good. The one your friends were jealous of, the guy who seemed to turn out the lights on the whole world, except for the time you spent together. Im Mark, and Im telling you this right now to make a REAL game out of this. Its a sense of sportsmanship, you see. You should know that men like us exist, and that were real, and we wont take just your life. Well take your soul, right down with us to hell. Now you know that were out there its up to you how you choose to act. Good luck, and God bless. Because God wont help you where I plan to take you."
103,vulnerability,nosleep,I'm the Man You Never See,2,b6kkj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b6kkj5/im_the_man_you_never_see/,2019-03-29 02:59:47,"&amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The train pushed steadily forward into the night, the rhythmic sound of the tracks below rumbling through the desolate and poorly lit carriages. The moonlit cityscape passed by, blurry and non-descript, through the scratches and grime of the perspex windows. Despite the fact there were very few people on the train, the heat was surprisingly stifling. The type of heat that feels thick in your throat with a questionable smell of gasoline and sweat. Obviously any functional air conditioning system had gone the same way as everything else; damaged or neglected beyond repair. The thing about poverty is that nobody tends to pay attention to it. We all recognise the rich and famous but we seldom remember the face of the man we pass in the shop doorway. It's the way the human mind is wired; when we witness something that makes us feel bad, we block it out. That's why this train was perfect. Nobody with money, power or influence would be riding this train at this time of night. Nobody with close family or friends would be here, they were more likely get a ride from someone in their life who cared about them. No, the people on this train were the transparent dregs of society, slowly shuffling from one area to the next. Mainly transient, some just down on their luck. There was one passenger however, that was neither of these things. Sat in the dark window seat in the back of the carriage and huddled into my stained kahki anorak, nobody paid me close regard. I looked around the carriage, taking a once-white handkerchief from my pocket and wiping the sweat from my brow as I did so. Not so much to see tonight I thought to myself as I put my handkerchief away and slid my black-rimmed glasses further up my nose. I liked my glasses because they were typically unfashionable. Thick, chunky and plain. I didn't need to wear glasses of course, the lenses were just plain glass, but they provided me with the affectation of vulnerability and that, I found out fairly quickly, worked out very well for me indeed. I watched the remaining few passengers on the train with dwindling interest. There were three in total, all unassuming and seemingly ordinary. A young woman with dirty blonde hair stood only a few feet away from me with her back turned. She was wearing a faded grey hooded sweatshirt and a pair of size 8 light blue jeans, hanging from her slight frame and frayed around the heel where they'd been worn into the ground. She'd drawn my attention as soon as I saw her, she was my usual type. Easy to start a conversation with, easy to lead. Women seemed to be drawn in by my carefully maintained enigmatic personality and winning smile. When I saw her board the train I knew in that instant where it could lead for us, but in the same instant that hope vanished when I saw the baby she was carrying in her arms. A clean little bundle, gurgling happily in stark contrast with it's surroundings. No, no, no. Babies and children were an absolute deal breaker for me. Single women were fair game, but single mothers? Well, they were a different matter entirely. I dropped my gaze and moved on to other matters in my mind when I saw the baby. The other two passengers on the train were male, one roughly in his 40s with nothing about him that would set him apart from the rest of the unwashed masses. The other was just a boy, still possibly a teenager. Teenagers held no interest for me, especially male ones. Tonight is a bust I concluded to myself with a sigh, my breath misting over on the cold window, creating a fog of dissapointment. A few moments later the train began to slow down, marking the end of the line. I stood, consciously lifting my collar an inch or two and nudging my hat down. I liked only to be seen when I had cause for it. Tonight there was no cause at all. I stepped off the train and looked around the dark station as the other passengers disappeared toward their own lives. I closed my eyes briefly against the cold breeze and allowed the briskness of it to fill my lungs. Any other night I suppose I'd enjoy the breeze, I'd enjoy the calm of the night and quietness of nature. But not tonight. Tonight had been wasted and my frustation was mounting. I sighed and turned leave the station and cross over to the multistory carpark just ahead when I suddenly heard something. No, someone. I heard a cough. I felt my blood throb inside my veins with newfound hope and excitement. Looking around I noticed a young girl, possibly early twenties, bundled up in a rotten sleeping bag amongst the grime and litter against the wall of the station. This was obviously her home for the night. My heart jumped a little as I relished this new opportunity. She looked over in my direction, flashed me a brief half smile as our eyes locked and then... looked away, seemingly disinterested. I smiled to myself as I slipped on my black leather gloves and reached into my pocket for my length of nylon rope. Tonight is going to be a good night after all."
104,vulnerability,nosleep,I'm the Man You Never See,17,b6l2e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b6l2e8/im_the_man_you_never_see/,2019-03-29 03:39:31," The train pushed steadily forward into the night, the rhythmic sound of the tracks below rumbling through the desolate and poorly lit carriages. The moonlit cityscape passed by, blurry and non-descript, through the scratches and grime of the perspex windows. Despite the fact there were very few people on the train, the heat was surprisingly stifling. The type of heat that feels thick in your throat with a questionable smell of gasoline and sweat. Obviously any functional air conditioning system had gone the same way as everything else; damaged or neglected beyond repair. The thing about poverty is that nobody tends to pay attention to it. We all recognise the rich and famous but we seldom remember the face of the man we pass in the shop doorway. It's the way the human mind is wired; when we witness something that makes us feel bad, we block it out. That's why this train was perfect. Nobody with money, power or influence would be riding this train at this time of night. Nobody with close family or friends would be here, they were more likely get a ride from someone in their life who cared about them. No, the people on this train were the transparent dregs of society, slowly shuffling from one area to the next. Mainly transient, some just down on their luck. There was one passenger however, that was neither of these things. Sat in the dark window seat in the back of the carriage and huddled into my stained kahki anorak, nobody paid me close regard. I looked around the carriage, taking a once-white handkerchief from my pocket and wiping the sweat from my brow as I did so. Not so much to see tonight I thought to myself as I put my handkerchief away and slid my black-rimmed glasses further up my nose. I liked my glasses because they were typically unfashionable. Thick, chunky and plain. I didn't need to wear glasses of course, the lenses were just plain glass, but they provided me with the affectation of vulnerability and that, I found out fairly quickly, worked out very well for me indeed.

105,vulnerability,nosleep,I'm an UnderCover FBI Agent on The Deep Web. (Part one),23,ba4x9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ba4x9t/im_an_undercover_fbi_agent_on_the_deep_web_part/,2019-04-07 01:38:31,"My name is Special Agent Barry Allen . It's actually my code name. Given to me by my colleagues. You may recognize this name from the comic book character The Flash. I was given this name due to my quickness to obtain IP addresses , bypass firewalls and hack into certain deep web sites and shut them down. That is my area of expertise. However, I've also been assigned to a Joint Task Force before which tracked and arrested drug runners, firearms dealers and human trafficking rings. Believe it or not. The federal government is everywhere. Social media, Reddit, YouTube. You name it. We have our guys on it. We monitor everything. That being said, the FBI only has jurisdiction to operate within the borders of the United States. In this new digital age we find ourselves living, Cybercrime is much more of a direct threat. Now more than ever Yes in the past we feared as a nation, biological and chemical warfare. As an example, right after 9/11 the United States had an Anthrax attack. In the FBI, it was known as Amerithrax Letters were mailed containing anthrax spores to several news media offices and to Democratic Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy, killing 5 people and infecting 17 others. Once the victim opened the letters they would immediately be exposed to the spores. Inhaling them is the most deadly form of the attacks. And it quickly destroys your immune and respiratory system's.Back then there were no known cures and it was difficult to treat as the symptoms often times confused doctors. The death rate once exposed was nearly 95% .No one was ever officially arrested or tried as the primary suspect for this horrific crime. If you ask me though, the scariest part of this investigation is where it led us.To a lab on an Army base. Essentially the US Army was weaponizing Anthrax using independent scientists specializing in microbiological warfare. Of course though, if you wanted to bring down Western Civilization today , all you'd have to do is manipulate or destroy our satellites and we would be back in the dark ages. Computers, banks , grocery stores and cell phones, power plants, even the water filtration system runs with electronics and the ability to communicate with satellites. Essentially, our world now depends on this. It's scary to think about. Especially when 14 year olds are hacking into the largest banks in the world from their mother's basement. Somehow they are able to bypass the best security systems we know of. (I personally believe they are using password skimmers) We joke in my department that in order to work for us, you simply only need to be smarter than a teenager. My background is in IT while in the military. While serving i also obtained several certifications and degrees in my field.. I worked alongside someone i never thought i would. Turns out the federal government often times hires former hackers to consult for them. In fact they have an army of internet soldiers at their disposal. I was actually trained by a convicted felon. It's been said he is one of the best hackers in the world. Eventually i was put in contact with men in the FBI. Essentially went through a series of rigorous tests to determine my operating field of work. After seeing our skills, they then placed myself and the felon on the Cyber Anti-Terrorism unit (or CAT as we call it) . Our first assignment was to locate a man on the Deep Web known only as Captain Death He runs this anonymous site in which the viewers would donate bitcoin to watch unspeakable acts of torture, mutilation and murder. Often times called Red Rooms. After searching for a while, clicking on every single link given to us, we found the exact link which directed us to the host site.We visited the website. For a moment the page was completely black. So we waited a few moments. Suddenly a bright red colored text appears across the top of the screen. Welcome! To the house of pain, tonight's events will commence in 2 minutes. Enjoy Looking over at my colleague, Jeff begins penetrating the sites security systems attempting to find the IP address of the hosts location. Viewing the site still with my eyes locked onto the screen. Using my laptop separate from Jeffs. The monitor goes black, Then a video attempts to load. Buffering now for several minutes. Any luck Jeff? I ask. I'm searching for a weakness in the security firewall. Give me a minute he responds. Frustrated i say, We may not have a minute Using access control, Jeff was able to find and manipulate the users login information bringing down the video before the it began. Believe it or not. One of the weakest points to a website can often times be it's login feature. Jeff found a vulnerability in the source codes software and exploited it. Still haven't found the guy. As that process is much more difficult. For now, we can rest a little bit easier knowing his account is compromised. The best hack is when you can invade a security system and not ever be noticed. This was not one of those instances. Who are you appears on Jeff's computer screen. He responds quickly The Dark Knight in bold green text as he looks over the offenders account. Attempting to track down banking information. Recent transactions. Even bitcoin exchange. Searching over the vast amount of data pouring into the site. Seems they have gone through great lengths to keep themselves hidden from the public. The Identity of the perp is still unknown. Patting Jeff on the shoulder i thank him for saving my eyes from witnessing god only knows what. I suppose for now it's a small victory. Let's take a break Jeff I urge. Shutting down our laptops we exit the dark cold room we sat in with monitors, computers, servers and many other electronic components all around us. One thing to remember, heat is the enemy of electronics. and for some strange reason, we enjoy freezing our asses off while hacking. Walking outside Jeff lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. Putting on his sunglasses Want one? He asks No thanks, they really break my concentration, I don't seem to function well with that in my system i reply he scoffs and quietly whispers (amateur) while choking and coughing. I smile and look up Yeah well at least I can breathe I say laughing. (A smile forming on ny face) We begin walking to a nearby restaurant. My phone lights up and rings loudly. It's my supervisor. Go for Barry I speak confidently. My boss is breathing heavily into the phone and says sternly What's the News on Captain Death? I begin to inform him on our progress and our struggles. Keep me posted Barry, good work. He says. (Not telling him Jeff did most of the work, i feel bad for taking credit for this one) Reaching the doors of the bar and grill, I notice a man sitting in the corner of the restaurant with his family. Jumping back quickly while peering around the corner. Jeff gives me a strange look as I inform him that man is a fugitive from an earlier investigation. I call in for back up and sit back in our unmarked unit waiting for the Cavalry to arrive as he is armed and extremely dangerous. 15 minutes pass as back up swarms the parking lot. We exit the vehicle and surround the building. Rushing in 12 men strong, guns drawn we make the arrest. Fortunately, he did not resist. No civilians were harmed on the takedown.This man has been on the run for months moving from state to state. I had previously set up a sting operation to illegally buy stolen guns from the man which had been arranged through the deep web. However , this particular sting was an in-person arms deal. He appeared very spooked and got away from us before the transaction was made. After searching his panel van today we found an entire armory of weapons. A few days pass and we now have a search warrant issued by the judge for his last known address. Confiscating all of his computers, hard drives and weapons. My partner and I found a hidden room below the living room floor boards with $1.4 million dollars in it. It also had passports and other documents. He was ready to flee the country for sure. Why he was out in public is beyond me. Though often times, men like him feel they are untouchable and above the law. It's several weeks later and work has been slow. (Not sure if that is good or bad) Until today that is, I began chatting on forums and meeting interesting characters in chat rooms. On the clear net and deep web. Today I met a dark shadowy figure online. He claims to have worked with a group of hackers who specializes in debit and credit card theft online. (Playing the part ask in a private chat) How much does this pay? Moments pass with no answer. I sit and wait for a response. A message appears with a link and a phone number. Contact him for a trial run, if you do well. He'll set you up with further work he writes. (Thinking for a moment, finally an adversary worth hunting) Typing quickly I say Who is he, do you know him personally? He responds rapidly and the text box closes after he writes Rule number one, no names! Fortunately I was able to copy the link and phone number before my computer screen went completely blank. Reaching for the burner phone i recently acquired i begin dialing the number provided. It rings several times. No answer. So i check out the link i copied. Right before i click on it. My phone lights up and rings beside me forcing me to jump out of my seat. Startled i look at the cell phone. Mildly confused as it reads 'unknown number. Quickly i answer the phone. A man on the other end speaks. How did you find this number? he asks. I inform him i was searching online for a while. Im new and im looking for work. I was told you're the man to call if i wanted some action, i need the money i implore. Competition is next week, meet at this address, winner gets a spot on my team, if you think you're up for the test, be on time he demands. I thank him and abruptly hang up. Jeff comes over to my place. He has some info on low level guys in the fraudulent/stolen debit card scheme. Using an unmarked and totally not suspicious surveillance van. We follow a few men on their day to day operations. For the most part, this portion of our job is the worst. Very daunting and boring. Sitting and waiting isn't exactly glamourous as the movies depict it to be. From what we can tell so far these men are using credit card skimmers. Victims of credit card skimming are completely blindsided by the theft. They notice fraudulent charges on their accounts or money withdrawn from their accounts, but their credit and debit cards never left their possession. How did the theft happen? You may be wondering, what exactly is this? Credit card skimming is a type of credit card theft where crooks use a small device to steal credit card information in an otherwise legitimate credit or debit card transaction. When a credit or debit card is swiped through a skimmer, the device captures and stores all the details stored in the card's magnetic stripe. The stripe contains the credit card number and expiration date and the credit card holder's full name. Thieves use the stolen data to make fraudulent charges either online or with a counterfeit credit card. These men have been using these small devices all over the local area and surrounding states as well. Targeting the nicer areas of town. Attaching the devices to the ATMs. Sitting a short distance away in their cars watching each victim approaching. Laughing all the way to the bank...so to speak. After several days of stake-outs. Out team makes the arrests. Finding blank cards, machines and large sums of cash on hand. After hours of interrogations we learn a much bigger scheme is in the works. The men inform us that they were merely a distraction for a much larger crime. My supervisor gives us clearance to make a deal with them. Lessening their charges if they are willing to cooperate. Speaking with the men for 3 more hours we learn what's really going on. The next few days are extremely tense as our offices try to warn all the banks and even get the media involved. Calling every bank, big and small we alert them of the situation that cybercriminals are poised to carry out an ATM cash-out, an operation that gives thieves access to untold sums of money by bypassing security measures on an ATM. If successful, the operation has the potential to be a heist unlike any weve ever seen. The FBI has obtained unspecified reporting indicating cyber criminals are planning to conduct a global Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash-out scheme in the coming days, likely associated with an unknown card issuer breach and commonly referred to as an unlimited operation. These unlimited operations compromise financial institutions or payment processors by installing malware that allows hackers to exploit network access, allowing admin-level access. Once inside, they can disable fraud protection, raise maximum ATM withdrawal amounts (and transaction limits) and withdraw large sums of money. Millions, potentially. All theyll need to carry out the attack are debit and credit card numbers found on the dark web, and dummy cards, also known as blanks, to attach the numbers to. The cyber criminals typically create fraudulent copies of legitimate cards by sending stolen card data to co-conspirators who imprint the data on reusable magnetic strip cards, such as gift cards purchased at retail stores. At a pre-determined time, the co-conspirators withdraw account funds from ATMs using these cards. It's nearly a week later and im preparing for my tests. I have my laptop ready in its case. Im extremely nervous.The information given to me is that i am to meet at this very strange building on the outskirts of town. I have no idea what to expect. I must come in first place to become a member of the team and ultimately take down the leader of this cybercrime domestic terrorist. If things go according to his plan.He could potentially put the entire country on its knees and our banking systems would completely collapse.Chaos and madness will spread like wildfires. Millions of people unable to access their money will riot and destroy stores. Stealing food and everything they can get their hands on. The police will be overrun and unable to do anything about it. The military would most certainly be called in an attempt to regain order. Mass hysteria ensues. To the extremes we have never seen before. I must stop him. Before its too late. "
106,vulnerability,nosleep,Restrain,143,ba59u1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ba59u1/restrain/,2019-04-07 02:13:07,"Owen Gage stood over me, knife in hand, while I lay bound and bleeding on the bedroom floor. What transpired that night would prove a pinnacle moment in time. It would forever alter the courses that both our lives would take. The significance would be lost without knowing that the story didn't start nor end there. It stretches a long way both directions in time and goes all the way back to the first grade. Mrs. Chen had brought our class through the woods beyond the schoolyard one Friday afternoon for a nature study to finish off the week. She paired us up and sent us off to collect different types of leaves to see if we could identify what tree they belonged to. I don't remember exactly how I lost my partner or why I had strayed so far from the group-- but for whatever reason, my six-year-old self decided to forage off the path alone. It took a little while for the fear of straying from the group to kick in. At first, I thought it fortunate to find another of my classmates away from their partner and the group as well. I knew his name was Owen because on the first day of school he'd said Octopus Owen when Mrs. Chen had us all introduce ourselves with the name of an animal starting with the same first letter as our name. After that little exercise, I hadnt heard him say a word to me or anyone else. He kneeled at the edge of the creek downhill from where I stood. His light blue jeans were muddied from the cuffs up through his shins. He kept his back turned to me while he worked away frivolously on something in front of him. I lifted the bottom of my dress and used a stick to keep me upright while I carefully made my way down towards him. About halfway, he heard the leaves crunching beneath my feet. His head perked up. His hands stopped moving and he lifted his head. ""What took you so long?"" he said before turning to face me. His change in facial expression was instantaneous. So much shock, so much fear. ""What do you mean?"" I asked him when I reached the bottom of the hill. I tossed my walking stick into the creek and watched it float for a while before getting caught against the bank close to where he'd been working. Owen moved his lips to say something but quickly thought better of it. He took a step back to the place where'd been working. He closed his legs together so I couldn't see through them. He pivoted his body to keep blocking my view while I made my way towards the water. I pretended I didn't notice what he was doing. Again, I lifted the bottom of my dress to keep dry to the best of my abilities and knelt next to the creek. I started making little zigzags along the surface with my finger and watched the Water Bugs skip upstream towards where hed been working. I was in a spot Owen couldn't completely obstruct my view. What I saw in the spot hed been trying to hide was tough to process at first. Three miniature bodies were strewn out on a rock. Their brown and green skin was moist in the areas where it wasn't ripped or broken. One of them was separated from its webbed feet which looked like they'd been ripped off and cast away into the mud. Their frog organs had been pulled out from their bellies and were dangling way below them. I looked up and met Owen's eyes. ""Don't tell,"" he said. ""Owen, what did you do?"" ""Don't tell, Heather."" Perhaps I was too naive to grasp the gravity of the situation. I stood up and started to walk towards him, his shoulders slouching more and more with every step. My eyes periodically glanced at the carnage he'd left on his little makeshift work station behind him. Owen moved out of the way without any fuss when I reached him. From up close, it became very clear what the young boy had wandered off to the creek to do that day. A little bit of my innocence died. I started to cry. My sobs sounded in the open air and trees above us. ""Don't tell,"" he urged again from behind me. I covered my eyes with my hands and tried to control myself. I wondered if the rest of the group was close enough to hear me. ""Please, Heather, don't say anything. I'll be in so much trouble. Theyll call my parents."" I looked at the remnants of the frogs one more time then looked down towards my feet. ""Mrs. Chen will tell my parents and they'll take me out of school."" There was a long silence that followed. I wished with everything inside me that I had never strayed from the group. ""I won't tell,"" I said finally. Perhaps I was feeling particularly compassionate that day. More likely I just said it because I thought it would be the best way to leave the presence of Owen Gage and get back with the class. It was the right call. When I turned back towards him, he had my walking stick gripped in his hands and maybe a foot or two behind my head. His face was cold and he was looking at me wide-eyed, with his teeth grit. Fortunes were in my favour that I didnt push the disturbed young man too far that day. He was able to reign himself in. He wouldnt lash out at another human for a couple years. Naive as it may have been, I did, in fact, keep my word to Owen and never told anyone about what I saw down at the creek. I also made a point to avoid him as much as I could from that day forward. Not that it proved to be a particularly difficult task. I just continued doing as myself and the rest of class always did. Never interact with Owen. *** I wonder what Mrs. Chen and the other school staff thought about Owen were from their adult perspective while he progressed from grades one through three. Though obviously never in plain sight of us, my guess is that there were many discussions behind closed doors with Owen's parents about why their child was having such a hard time getting along at school. From the outside looking in, it's hard to pinpoint what or when exactly it was where things failed to click for Owen as a developing child. By all accounts, he was in good health and part of an Indiana middle-class family in a middle-class neighbourhood. He was raised as a single child in a loving home with all the opportunities and resources that any kid in town had. His father was a plumber who did work on my house as well as plenty others on my street. His mother was a teacher who taught in another school on the other side of town. Unless a dark and evil secret existed behind the walls of that little red house on Cecil Street, no one could fairly pin the blame on his mom and dad or the environment they raised their son in. I believe Owens problems ran far deeper than any of us could see on the surface. He was doomed and outcast by the sum of the many moving parts within his nature. Something dreadful from deep inside him was always urging to hang back from the group, to eat alone at his desk, or spend the teacher's lessons drawing morbid pictures of people dying at his desk. How long can a child go through middle school like that and fly under the radar? How long before he becomes the inevitable victim of the physical and psychological torment of his peers? Not very long. An already disturbed mind was not equipped to handle the suffering he experienced nearly every day at school. I can say with honesty that not once did I partake in the constant bullying of Owen Gage. I was never the one calling him names, stealing things from his backpack, or hunting him down at recess to beat him up. You could say I was guilty of being a bystander-- and you will get no argument from me. I was raised to always do the right thing and that's what I thought I was doing all along. Even if that meant standing idly by while the popular boys, the ones who my friends were hanging out with more all the time, picked on Owen at every chance they got. Understand that Owen was more than simply the social outcast with an obsession with all things dead and dying. Ever since the day at the creek, the day I promised myself I'd make as little contact with him as possible, I could feel him hovering over me like a bad omen any time I was in his presence. It was like he was always just out of the corner of my eye. Sometimes it would be something seemingly harmless, like catching him staring from across class-- this is when we were young, long before the prepubescent boys started to do the same. Other times it felt more sinister. I would notice him hanging around the line of trees at the end of the yard, hiding and staring while I skipped rope with my friends. Sometimes I'd look over my shoulder and see him twenty paces behind me while walking home. He lived in the other direction from the school than I did. There was no reason for him to be heading the same way. So you see it was an act of self-defense that I never stepped in to help Owen Gage. I couldnt risk strengthening the bond with him in any way. *** I started getting interested in boys in the third grade. It was the beginning of the early stages of an innocent attraction towards a boy in my class. I started finding it preferable to leave my friends at recess or stay late after school to hang around with the guys on the baseball team. I took an affection towards a boy named Chase Anthony. He played Shortstop and was the best hitter on the team. As time passed I started to suspect his feelings towards me were much the same. His friends would tease us when we walked around the outside of the field together and say one day we'd grow up and have babies together. The joke never bothered me. I was smitten with Chase. For years it did seem like the direction we were headed. I was the first girl in my grade to get my first kiss. I can't say for certain, but I think Chase was the first of the boys as well. Either way, the day both his friends and mine spread whispers amongst each other that eventually led to us meeting behind the last portable at the edge of the yard was the most nervous Id ever felt. Chase was already waiting there. He told me that he'd kissed a girl at summer camp the year before, but I didn't believe him. His cheeks were so red and he kept looking at the ground instead of looking at me. My stomach felt like it was going to crawl up my throat and jump out my mouth. I knew everyone was watching, so I just acted. I walked briskly towards him, grabbed his head and pulled it down towards mine. Everyone was swooning in the background and giggling amongst each other. Chase's big body trembled. It felt like he was trying to pull his head back against the hand I was using to hold him in place. Slowly he relaxed, and for a brief time, I knew that he was enjoying it just as much as me. Then every muscle in his body relaxed at once. He went entirely limp and his full weight collapsed in my arms. I opened my eyes. The girls screamed behind me. Chase's friends were yelling angry things that I couldn't make out while I was fumbling with Chase, trying not to drop him. I slowly lowered to the ground and lay him as gently as I could on the concrete. I looked up and saw Owen taking big steps backwards away from us. He had a big rock, like the one he'd killed the frogs upon, brandished above his head. He tossed it to the ground and ran in the other direction before Chase's friends caught up and proceeded to pummel him within an inch of his life. Chase's eyes stared distantly up towards the clouds. One arm was stretched over his head, the other over his body with his fingers dangling above the ground. Blood dripped out from somewhere under his hair where Owen had struck him. It pooled around his head and my shoes. I screamed so loud the world shook. Fuzzy sounds filled my ears that I think we're the shouting teacher's running towards us. Fortunately for us all, Owen did not die that day. He was out of school for two months while he recovered and returned to the loud cheers of the whole school at an assembly in the gym. Unlike Chase, Owen never returned to school after that day. The school staff was very careful to make sure we didn't hear anything about him or where he'd gone. I saw that as the biggest gift that could have ever been given to me. What happened that day made me hate Owen Gage with all my being. It was a blessing to never have to see him again. *** For the next nine years of my life. That's exactly how things stayed. I even took extra measures, making sure that if I was walking near his neighbourhood that I would take the long way on the main road to bypass. The most I heard of Owen was when the rumour spread amongst our class in eighth grade that hed had been kicked out of his new school for luring a girl into the woods and beating her within and cracking her skull with a bat. Some kids said that he'd been taken out of State for Juvie Hall. A couple kids said that he killed himself the same day. Whatever happened, little information was given to us or even the local media. As far as I was concerned, that was for the best. Chase and I started dating shortly after he returned back to school and we'd stayed a couple for the near entirety of our childhoods. He had a big dent on the back of his skull from where he'd been struck and sometimes hed force my hand over it whenever he wanted to make me squeamish. For all the time that followed up until our senior year, my life and his, returned to the normal suburban upbringing it was always supposed to be. To think that I believed that delusion so long simply because I thought the ever-dangerous Owen was gone forever. Sometimes, even while lying in Chase's comforting arms, I would get that little prick of recognition. That feeling where the white hairs on the back of your neck stand up and you swear that someone is watching you. It was so similar to when I would catch Owen staring or stalking from the trees. All the way up until the night of my prom, that's the way it remained nothing more than a distant feeling. That night, however, was when everything changed. When my whole world was turned upside down. Chase and I eventually split in the second semester of our senior year. It was long overdue. He'd been bothering for me to sleep with him since tenth grade and was getting increasingly frustrated with me telling him that I wanted to wait until after we were married. I broke up with him after last period on a Friday at his locker and scurried all the way home without stopping. I remember him wailing in front of everyone and slamming his locker over and over. I stayed put in my parents house that weekend, crying the whole time in my room while my mom brought me meals and told me that it was all for the greater good. By that end of that weekend, I'd decided not to attend any more parties (not that I was ever big on drinking) until I was away at college the next fall. It even took me a long time to eventually decide to go to prom alone. I probably wouldn't have tried had it not been for my friends constantly nattering at me. That was the most peer pressure I succumbed to. I only had a few cups of punch and refused everyone who offered me a sip from the flask or water bottle filled with vodka they'd snuck in. I went directly home after it was over and was the only one who didn't go to an after party of some kind. I wouldn't have been much fun if I had decided to go regardless. I saw Chase with his baseball buds along with all their dates having fun on the far side of the dance hall. Chase looked over his new girlfriends shoulder and smiled at me like he was the best thing Id ever lose. I didn't bother stopping to make small talk with my parents when I got home. They were in the living room watching a Dateline with the volume up and barely turned to look when I stormed passed them towards my room at the back of our little bungalow. I turned the lights on and it was off with the blue dress my older sister wore to prom the year before right away. I tossed it over my chair, along with the rest of what I wore, and lit a couple scented candles. I went into my bathroom for a shower where I planned to quickly rub down all the sweat and hopefully a little bit of the stress I'd accumulated over the course of the evening. I didn't bother washing my hair. I turned the water off and reached for a towel to pat myself dry and then slipped into the pajamas Id left lying on the floor earlier that morning. Something was wrong the moment I stepped back into my room. It ran deeper than the simple observation that the space I'd left alight was now dark save for the candles I'd lit on the desk. That feeling was back. It had crawled out of the deepest corners of long forgotten memories and made a renewed appearance so strong it almost brought me to my knees. It seemed like so long since I had felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up quite the way they did in that moment. The presence was unmistakable. The bathroom door squeaked closed again behind me. The shadow, which had been waiting on the other side, stepped forward. A massive hand cupped over my mouth and pulled me back. The fingers clenched, the short and rigid nails dug into my skin. Another arm wrapped around my neck and started to choke me. I tried to scream, knowing full well my dying breath would barely make it passed the fingers cutting me off. The large frame twisted and ripped me off my feet. Gently, it lowered my body to the ground, pressing its lower half on top of mine so it could bring me down without making any noise and so I couldn't kick or thump my body. Oxygen ran low. I wanted to fight harder, to find some kind of deeper strength from within me, but it simply wasn't there. The urge to live flickered. Submitting suddenly didn't seem so bad. In my moments of vulnerability, I discovered a renewed sense of clarity. In the pale orange light, I could make out the face of the one who'd returned to me. The boy whod finally came to take what he'd always wanted and what Id been guilty of keeping from him. Chase. He was the only person who knew that the rectangular window next to my bed would squeak open, even with the latches locked, if you put enough weight right at its base and pushed from the outside. What possessed the boy Id loved for so many years to do such a violent and awful thing was lost on me. The only thing I knew for sure was his intent after breaking inside my room. He rolled on top of me and increased the pressure on my neck. He slid his body up so his mid-section pinned mine to the floor. I was on my last reserve of oxygen. Little black blotches started to cloud all over my vision. Even if I had enough left in my lungs to let out a single yelp to alert my parents, who were still awake and maybe fifteen feet away and separated by two walls, he wouldn't slip and allow me his chance. His mind was set on his goal and only an act of god was going to save me. From inside his jacket, he withdrew three pieces of cloth. One, which he balled up and shoved inside my mouth when he took his hand off momentarily. The second, he used to tie around my head and make sure that one inside my mouth was held in place and couldn't be spit out or moved ajar. The third, he used to tie my hands together. Just in case I had any energy left he felt needed to be restrained. ""Why did you do this to me?"" he whispered. He put his hand on my shoulders. They started to slowly glide down my arms and then towards my hips. I swore I could have heard him crying. Like a spoiled boy, overwhelmed by finally getting what he wanted. ""I'm not going to hurt you."" I screamed into my gag as if I expected any sort of sound to escape. His hands moved my hips to my belly. He pulled the bottom button of my pajama top open. I heard a creaking noise from the window next to my bed when he reached for the second. The rest was deja vu. Chase's forced moments of intimacy were put to an end. This time, his body was so much bigger and it was my flat body that broke his fall when he dropped and rolled to the side. In the space behind him, Owen Gage stood over me, knife in hand, while I lay bound and bleeding on the bedroom floor. For reasons that would soon be made clear to me, he had perhaps been my saviour for as long as I'd known him. The one barrier constantly pulling away his only friend and keeping him in check. The same one who I'd held so dear for all those years. The one who finally snapped when he wasn't going to get what he wanted in the ""normal"" way. Owen lowered the knife to the ground. I saw his arms-- his whole body even, tremble. He pushed Chase's lifeless body a little farther away and sat down beside me. He told me about how he and Chase had been friends since the first days of kindergarten. He told me about how it was not him, but Chase who had struck the poor girl in the head with the bat they never found. It was one of Chase's old baseball bats. He could even show me where it was buried. He told me that he hit Chase on the head with the rock because he knew that he was sick just the way was. Chase only knew how to camouflage himself better. The last thing he revealed was that this was the first time he'd ever given into the suppressed urges which had haunted him his entire life. It was the only time he'd allowed himself to kill another human being. It was a door he said could never be closed once it had been opened. I hugged him and swore I'd never tell that he'd been there that night. I'd tell everyone I'd wrestled the knife from Owen and stabbed him myself. My dad's footsteps sounded from down the hallway. Owen increased his grip on my body, I felt his nails digging so far into my skin that it hurt. He untied my hands and then he fled back out the window and pulled it closed behind him. It was the start of another long period in my life that I would go without seeing the deeply troubled Owen Gage. # I met my husband at Notre Dame the next year and we got married shortly after graduation. We moved out to California and had one daughter who's getting ready to start her freshman year at high school in the fall. We returned to Indiana last fall to visit my mother, who in her twilight years, had to move into hospice care. My visit there was largely uneventful, save for holding back the tears while I watched the shell of my mother slowly peel away and get ready for her final rest. Outside of all the grieving, there was one thing that caught my eye in the many hours that I would stay by my mothers side. One lanky staff member who looked about my age. His name tag said, O. Gage. He didnt interact much with the other staff or visitors, but once in a while he'd allow himself to make eye contact and spare me the slightest bit of recognition. I noticed that he'd sit by the beds of those who he knew were close to passing. Patiently, hed watch them fade away into death. Even after theyd pass, hed sit there still and staring for some time before finally getting up. I saw a certain beauty in how hed found his way of keeping himself restrained. Hed made his compromise with all his inner demons."

So many of us believe that our hearts have been permanently broken because of our life experiences, but it's that belief of brokenness that causes us suffering. Underneath it all is still just love, unstruck by any of this.*** As Lucas approached Kierra -- knife in hand -- I realized the police wouldn't get here in time. I looked around the yard frantically. All I could find was an axe laying on top of a tree stump. ""*Fuck*."" I shook my head and ran over to grab it. Without thinking twice, I sprinted back to the garage and burst through the door I waved the axe around and shouted, trying to look and sound as intimidating as possible. Lucas was lanky, but he was in good shape. And he was probably around five years younger than me, so I needed an advantage on him. They both looked completely shocked as I ran toward them. ""Drop the knife!"" I shouted, brandishing the axe at Lucas. ""Get the fuck away from her!"" He glanced one more time at Kierra, then at the door. He didn't drop the knife, but he ran around me and bolted out of the garage. I dropped the axe and hurried over to Kierra, who was sobbing uncontrollably. As I got closer, I noticed a horrible smell. My heart sank as I realized she had soiled herself. ""You're okay,"" I consoled her as I untied the ropes. ""You're safe now, okay? No one can hurt you."" She nodded through more tears. ""You're so brave,"" I continued talking calmly, trying to keep her attention on my eyes. ""You're going to be okay."" Once she was free from the ropes, I draped my jacket over her shoulders and helped her from the chair. ""I need to call the police now,"" I said, taking out my phone. ""I'm still right here with you, okay?"" ""No!"" she said, eyes going wide. ""They'll arrest him!"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""Lucas will be charged."" ""You can't!"" she pleaded. ""You can't get him into trouble."" I bit my lip. Victims of domestic abuse often cover for their partners, no matter how bad the abuse gets. It can take a long time to unravel that level of confusion. ""Kierra, because he put you in immediate physical danger, I have to call the cops,"" I said. ""I promise everything is going to be okay."" ""Please."" She shook her head. ""If he goes to jail, I think I'd -- I'd kill myself."" In that moment, I considered hospitalizing Kierra for suicidal thoughts, but I was seriously concerned that her lingering attachment to Lucas would lead her right back into his arms once they were both free. I've helped a lot of patients break free from that trauma bond, so I came up with another idea. ""What if you come stay with me?"" I asked. ""I have a panic room above my garage. It's fortified with steel and blastproof Kevlar panels. You'd be untouchable."" She looked up and sniffled. ""You'd let me stay there?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""And if you'd like, I can provide you with daily therapy sessions until you're feeling better."" She paused for a moment and nodded. ""Really?"" she said. ""Thank you -- thank you so much."" ""Great,"" I said. ""Now, let's get you out of here -- and find you a fresh set of clothes."" She buried her face, ashamed. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""That's the slicer."" ""What do you mean?"" ""He -- He bakes these pies,"" she said. ""And then he makes me slice off a piece and eat it every time I misbehave."" My jaw dropped in disgust. ""And the pies are poisoned?"" ""Yes,"" she said miserably. ""They give me unbearable cramps and stomach problems. But I'm afraid someday it will be worse."" I bit my lip again. There was no way in hell that I'd ever let her return to Lucas. I'd keep my promise to her for now, but the moment she was ready to leave my place, I was going to call the police. And if they didn't lock him away, I'd take matters into my own hands. \* \* \* If I wasn't going to involve the cops yet, there was one more person I needed to protect. He wasn't hard to find, because -- just as Kierra mentioned -- Lucas had tagged him in dozens of public Facebook photos. ""Ryan,"" I stood up to greet Lucas's friend. ""Thank you for coming in."" ""Sure,"" he said, taking a seat. ""You said it was urgent?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""Your friend Lucas. He's extremely dangerous."" ""Lukey?"" He let out a small laugh. ""I don't think so."" ""You have to trust me,"" I said. ""He was holding his wife in the garage -- with the intent to harm her."" His eyes went wide. ""You know about that?"" My heart started to race. Oh god, were they both in this together? I slowly reached for the phone in my pocket. Enough was enough. It was time to stop playing detective and bring in the real police. ""It's not what it looked like,"" he said quickly. ""He was just trying to protect her."" I lifted my fingers from the phone. ""What?"" ""She's crazy."" He shook his head. ""This whole therapy thing was his idea. He wanted to save their marriage, but she hated it. After the first session, she threatened to kill herself if he went back. She held a knife to her arm."" ""You're lying."" ""I'm not!"" he said. ""Listen, Lukey made some bad choices, but he's not a bad guy. He did it because he loved her."" ""Yeah, I've heard that before,"" I scoffed. ""Every abuser says they have to hurt their victim because of *love*."" ""It's not like that!"" Ryan protested. ""He came back to you because he wanted to keep getting help. He restrained her so she wouldn't hurt herself while he was gone. She even agreed to it."" ""How do you even know any of this?"" Ryan looked down. ""Because he asked me to watch her that morning,"" he said. ""To make sure she was safe."" ""Bullshit,"" I said. ""He had a fucking knife."" ""Probably to cut the rope!"" said Ryan. ""What about the bowel movements?"" I said. ""The poisoned pies."" ""I -- I don't know,"" he said nervously. ""She kept shitting herself and blaming his pies. This has been a thing for months now. She gets horribly sick every time he starts seeking help -- from friends, family, and now you."" ""You think she poisons herself *intentionally*?"" ""I have no idea,"" he said. ""But I tried a slice, and nothing happened to me."" I looked at him for a moment and shook my head. ""I'm sick of being lied to,"" I said, taking out my phone. ""I know you're romantically involved with Lucas. This is all just some sick plot to get rid of Kierra, and I'm putting an end to it."" He frowned. ""I'm not involved with Lukey."" ""Yes you are,"" I said. ""You kissed him in the parking lot."" His cheeks went pink. ""You saw that?"" ""Yes,"" I lied. It was true enough. ""So now I know you're a liar too. Just like him."" ""No, the kiss happened!"" he said quickly. ""But it was unreciprocated. I was just trying to show him what real love could feel like."" ""Unreciprocated?"" ""Yeah, I initiated it. But he pushed me away as soon as our lips touched."" He looked down at the floor. ""He has a heart of gold, but he's loyal to a fault. I don't think he'll ever escape the hold she has over him."" I looked at his eyes, trying to get a read on this whole situation. I was seriously sick of the mind games and manipulation. This was why most therapists opted not to treat the Cluster-B disorders. I stood up to indicate that our conversation was over. Now I was glad that I hadn't called the police, because there seemed to be a lot more to the story. I still had no idea who was telling the truth, but Kierra was safe above my garage, so I had plenty of time to figure this out. After Ryan left, I sorted through some of the latest resumes for my assistant position. There were plenty of decent candidates -- mostly grad students looking to get some experience -- but none of them felt quite right. There was a knock on the door and I looked up to see the FedEx guy back with another box. That was strange. I wasn't expecting any deliveries today. ""Hey, doctor!"" he said with a smile. ""I tried to drop this off at a house in the suburbs, but the guy said his wife doesn't live there anymore. He said you might know where she is?"" I raised my eyebrows and took the package. ""I wonder if the wife left because you made him gay?"" he said. ""I mean, no offense, but that's not really a good outcome of couples therapy, right?"" I looked up from the package and glared at him. ""Do you *ever* stop talking?"" He blushed and waved goodbye, which instantly made me feel bad for being so rude. ""Uh -- Sorry,"" I said. ""It's been a rough week. What's your name?"" ""That's alright!"" he said. ""I'm Trevor."" ""Thanks for everything, Trevor,"" I said. ""You've made this whole move a lot easier for me."" He smiled again and said, ""No problem!"" After he left, I looked down to the package addressed to Kierra. It really made me nervous that Lucas had referred the package to my office. I would bring it to her, of course, but I had to examine it first. There was no way I'd let an unknown package into my safe room. I kept that place locked down like a bank. I cut the package open and was surprised to pull out a package of gummy bears. At first they seemed harmless, but then I read the label. ""*Oh, for fuck's sake*..."" I could practically feel my blood pressure rising. Kierra didn't have Borderline Personality Disorder or C-PTSD, and she definitely wasn't the victim of a sociopath. \* \* \* ""Kierra, you received a package today,"" I said, sliding the gummy bears her way in the panic room. ""Oh, thank you!"" she said. ""How was your day? I've been practicing all of the meditations you gave me, and they're helping so much."" Her eyes started brimming with tears again. ""I just can't believe you've given me a second chance at life,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm finally ready to start standing up for myself."" ""That's great,"" I said flatly. ""Why don't you have a gummy bear?"" She sniffled and looked at me, confused. ""Right now? I'm not really hungry."" ""Oh, I really have to insist,"" I said. She shifted in her seat uncomfortably. ""What's the matter?"" I said. ""Not in the mood to vomit out your ass today?"" ""What are you -- What are you talking about?"" The tears fell freely from her eyes. ""Nobody's poisoning you,"" I said. ""Sugarless Haribo gummy bears? I had these on an airplane once -- and it's an experience I'll never forget. There are about 300 Amazon reviews detailing similar experiences. So cut the fucking bullshit."" I was surprised to see her tears and hysterics stop abruptly. ""Congratulations,"" she said calmly. ""You cracked the case of the diarrheal gummy bears."" I looked at her, trying not to appear anxious. It was important to maintain the upper-ground with people like this. ""Has this all just been an act?"" I asked. ""You can just -- turn off those emotions?"" ""Well, they're always off,"" she said. ""But yeah, I realized that Borderlines get more attention and sympathy, so I decided to give it a try."" ""That's disgusting,"" I said. ""There are people out there struggling with mental illness -- trying so hard to get better -- and you use it as a tool?"" She laughed. ""Don't get all sanctimonious on me, dick burner."" I froze. ""What did you say?"" ""You burned your dick as a kid,"" she said matter-of-factly. ""Is that why you're so obsessed with saving people? Because your first love rejected you, and now no one will ever love your burnt dick?"" I felt an intense dread forming in my stomach. I forgot about the files I'd left up here ""Where--"" ""No need to freak out,"" she said, reaching forward to hand me the file. ""But you know, we're actually pretty similar."" ""No, we're not,"" I said, snatching the file away from her. ""Think about it,"" she said. ""We're both puppet masters and control freaks. We both feel superior and safe when we're arranging everyone to do what we want."" ""That's disgusting,"" I said again. ""No, it's incredible!"" she said, eyes lighting up. ""When I first met Lucas, he was so innocent and full of life. Cheerful and funny. Now he's angry, moody, and depressed -- all for me."" ""Well, I'm going to help him feel good again,"" I said. ""So I guess we're not so similar."" ""Please,"" she said. ""You have no power over him. He's bonded to me, and he'll do whatever I say. He's like a little puppy. Even when he knows I'm fucking with him, he comes running back. He'll stay with me forever."" ""He'll realize he deserves better,"" I said confidently. ""Once we build up his boundaries and self-respect, he won't put up with your behavior anymore."" ""That's when I give him the honeymoon phase again,"" she said with a smile. ""Back when everything was perfect and we were 'soulmates'. That's the high he keeps chasing."" I felt my blood boiling. ""I'm going to report you."" ""To who?"" She laughed. ""The gummy bear police? There aren't any laws against emotional abuse. And if the police ever come knocking on our door, my body will be covered in enough bruises and scars to make sure he's the one leaving in handcuffs. Who would believe him over sad, wounded Kierra."" Her eyes began to tear up again, lip quivering. Then she stopped immediately and grinned. ""People like you are the reason that abuse victims are afraid to come forward,"" I said. ""99% of the time they're telling the truth, but the world focuses on the 1% of liars like you."" ""Hey, let's make a bet."" She leaned forward, ignoring me. ""I'll bet you $1,000 that by the end of the year, I can get Lucas to kill himself."" ""That's murder."" ""Not in the eyes of the law."" She stood up to gather her belongings. ""Now, I think I'll be checking out of the Harper Hilton. My husband needs me."" And then suddenly -- without warning -- I felt an overwhelming burning sensation tear through my heart. Nothing good ever comes from that feeling. \* \* \* Weeks later, Lucas returned for his twelfth daily session. That might seem like overkill, but it's really hard to break the addiction to a toxic person -- so I wanted to be there for him, every step of the way. ""I just can't believe it!"" he said, a big smile on his face. ""I never thought I could feel like this. It's like my whole body weighs nothing. All the anxiety is just gone."" ""That's great, Lucas,"" I said. ""I take it the guided meditations are helping?"" ""All of it!"" he said. ""The meditations, the books, our sessions, all of it. It just feels like my heart is so big and free, you know?"" I broke into a rare smile too -- I couldn't help it. Moments like this were exactly why I got into therapy. It was so inspiring to see Lucas transform his depression and anger into a joyful new chapter of his life. ""Oh man, I just want to dance around!"" he said. ""Do you like to dance?"" ""Absolutely not."" I shook my head. ""But feel free to do a solo."" As he bounced around the room, I could practically see the energy bursting from the heart he was so proud of. ""You know,"" he said, slowing down. ""When Kierra left me that breakup letter, I thought I would never be happy again. But now I feel a totally different kind of happiness."" ""Do you miss her?"" I asked. ""I don't know,"" he said, pacing around. ""The letter was so thoughtful, and it made me realize she really is a good person deep down, even if we aren't together. The way she told me to move on and find joy without her It was just so selfless."" I felt a bit guilty. I was the one who typed out that letter. But the ends justify the means, right? Still, Kierra's '*puppet master*' comment nagged in the back of my mind. ""But then there are so many other things I don't miss,"" he said. ""The drama, the fighting, the tricks I don't feel like I'm walking on eggshells anymore. And you know something else weird? She never introduced me to her family. I want to be with someone who's excited to introduce me to their family!"" ""That's great,"" I said, glad that he hadn't forgotten her darker qualities. ""You deserve that."" ""You really changed my life."" ""Well, I also chased you with an axe,"" I said. ""But I appreciate that."" He continued pacing around my office. ""Do you think Kierra will ever come back?"" ""I don't know,"" I said stiffly. ""If she does, what would you do?"" ""I guess I'd hear her out,"" he said. ""She's probably working on herself too, right?"" I felt that dread in my stomach again. ""Lucas, she was extremely abusive to you. People like that don't change overnight."" ""I guess, but I would want to give her the benefit of the doubt!"" he said. ""And then she'd be able to see how well I'm doing too."" I pursed my lips. ""In your particular situation, I'd exercise a lot more caution."" ""What do you mean?"" He frowned. ""Lucas, she wanted to cause you harm,"" I said, anxiety kicking in. ""I actually think it might be a good idea to take measures to protect your identity."" He raised his eyebrows. ""My identity?"" ""That's right,"" I said. ""People with Cluster-B disorders are notorious for returning and wreaking havoc in their victim's lives, even years after the relationship has ended."" ""So you don't think Kierra could change?"" ""I don't know,"" I said, growing increasingly agitated. ""But for now, I'd really recommend changing your address, your career, and your name."" ""My name?"" He laughed. ""I'm serious,"" I said. ""Please, will you just trust me?"" ""Okay..."" He nodded slowly. ""I mean, you got me this far. I'm not going to start doubting you now. But there's no way I'll find a new job any time soon. I don't have a college degree."" ""You can come work for me,"" I said, surprised by the words coming out of my mouth. ""I need an assistant."" ""Really?"" His face lit up. ""Wow, sure. That would be awesome! You won't regret it. I'm going to be the best assistant you've ever had! Hey, we'll be like the Batman and Robin of psychology."" ""Sure,"" I said. ""Sounds like a plan."" If he was here, at least I could keep an eye on him for the majority of the week. And I could definitely upgrade the security around here. ""For my name, how about something unique"" he said, gazing off into the distance. ""Like Dutygreen Weatherfancy."" ""Dutygreen-- What?"" I sputtered. ""No. The whole point is to pick something that won't draw attention to you. Here, just go with something from a list of common boy names."" I took out my phone and read off a few to him. ""Liam William... Noah... James"" ""Oh, I like Noah!"" he said. ""Noah Weatherfancy"" ""*Jesus Christ*,"" I muttered. But before I could look up last names, Lucas -- or Noah -- pulled me into a tight hug. ""Thank you so much, Doc,"" he said. ""You didn't just save my life. You made it a life worth living."" I looked into his eyes -- eyes that were so eager, and so kind. Suddenly, I felt an extremely warm, soft vulnerability in my heart -- an unexpected sensation I hadn't known since childhood. So in that moment, I decided I would need to shut this man out of my heart forever. ""Alright, that's enough,"" I said, pushing him away. ""You'll start as my assistant in two weeks."" \* \* \* I walked up the stairs of my garage with a plate of food. I looked at my phone's security feed to ensure Kierra wasn't near the door. ""*Alexa, unlock safe room*."" The doors opened, and I stepped into the room. I had repurposed the entire space to provide all control from the outside, rather than the inside. Kierra was sitting in the corner, arms crossed. I walked over to her and knelt down with the food. ""How are you feeling today?"" ""I'm not doing your forced therapy sessions."" She took the tray. ""So don't even bother."" ""I'm not going to keep you here without some sort of rehabilitation,"" I said. ""Let me help you."" ""Dr. Harper, you aren't God,"" she said. ""You're not the police. You're not the criminal justice system. You're not a prison."" ""I understand that,"" I said. ""But I've worked with the Cluster-B disorders extensively, and I think I could help you feel better. If you try focusing on your emptiness, and boredom--"" ""You're like a broken record."" She chewed her food noisily. ""Emptiness, boredom, emptiness, boredom I keep telling you, I don't want to change. You think my condition is a bad thing, but it makes me better than everyone. Better than you."" ""Don't you want to know what real love feels like?"" I said. ""Vulnerability, softness, freedom?"" ""Don't *you*, doctor?"" Her eyes met mine -- wide and unrelenting. The sociopath stare. I held her gaze, determined not to lose this battle of dominance. ""You're good, Dr. Harper,"" she said. ""But you have a fatal weakness."" ""And what's that?"" ""You don't let reality play out the way it wants to,"" she said. ""You keep trying to arrange and control everything. But sooner or later, reality will win -- and the floodgates will open.""

108,vulnerability,nosleep,There is this ugliness inside of me...,1,ahjvs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ahjvs9/there_is_this_ugliness_inside_of_me/,2019-01-19 18:07:36,"There is this ugliness inside of me. She is a wretched part of me I cant seem to annihilate. So instead, Ive resorted to keeping her locked away  caged and starved, with the high hopes that one day when I check on her, she would have turned into nothing but microscopic, insignificant dust in the tornado of my insides. But shes hungry. And Im vulnerable. And vulnerability makes her mouth water. Because she knows me well. She knows me *so* well. We have this unbreakable bond, you see. She was born the first time *it* happened. Born of confusion, hatred, pain; created from tainted innocence, loneliness, rage, and love. The first time she came to me, she came to me in the dark, as my nine-year-old self wept, my knobby knees tight to my chest, face buried in my arms  uncertainty and disorientation swirling and encompassing all of my being. *Dear, sweet, child why do you weep?* Her voice sounded like perfectly shattered glass. And yet, it was as hypnotic as a lullaby. As sweet as oozing honey, straight from the comb. It was as smooth as velvet grazing your bare skin. With each letter pronounced, there was a precision to her tone  articulate, immaculate. I looked up, my face wet and swollen. Through my tear-filled eyes, I saw her. My eyes instinctually, somehow, averted from her face, but took in all the rest. She was as black as black could get. She shined in the moonlight from my open window, glistening like hot, liquifying tar  leaving thick droplets, staining the tanned carpet, one pace at a time. Each droplet, however, would suck itself back into its place, in reverse-motion, leaving the carpet completely unscathed, and then stained again  a seamless loop. She was on all fours, crawling her way towards me, her extensive torso inches from the ground. Her limbs were spindly, jutting out from her body like that of a spiders. Jagged were the edges where her joints creased. Even so, her movements were fluid. Smooth. Slow. Graceful. I should have been afraid. *Why do you weep, sweet child?* Her voice; precise... articulate... immaculate... I flinched at first, and immediately after, somehow, my muscles relaxed naturally. I realized then, that her voice wasnt coming physically from her but from inside my own head. But it was also, in some way I can't really explain, being projected into the air, because I could hear her externally, too. I suddenly felt like I was about to fall asleep. My eyes felt so heavy My head felt like it weighed a ton. I turned from her, exhausted, and rested my cheek on my knees, stared at the wall. She touched me then. And I let her. Her long claw-like finger grazed my exposed cheek. She was as cold as stone, as smooth as glass. I waited to feel the residue of her thick liquid tar all over my face, but it never came. When she touched me, she felt like a solid being. She caressed my little head. *Tell me, sweet child* I closed my eyes. I-I did a bad thing I blurted it through a soft sob. She placed her entire palm on the top of my head and closed her long fingers around it. Her fingers encaged my entire face. She pressed. *It* was happening again, only, I was standing at the bottom of the stairs this time. I heard little footsteps coming down them. My breath caught when I saw *myself*, from a few nights ago, peering around the corner of the L-shaped stairs, holding our stuffie, Teddy. Somehow, this absolute knowing took over me, and I completely and unequivocally understood that I was currently a bystander in my own memory. That I was here to watch. And watch only. I continued to observe memory-me, utterly unperplexed. I stood and watched as our bare feet hit the cool tile and listened as they pitter-pattered across the formal dining room, past the family room, and into the kitchen. A cabinet shut, the faucet turned on, a consistent gulp and a satisfying little *ahhh* echoed slightly into the vaulted ceilings. My eyes stayed intently on the image before me. Memory-me darted gleefully towards the stairs, wiping our mouth from the water residue. Oblivious. As soon as our foot touched the first step, *he* said our name. My vision unfocused, blurred, contorted I closed my eyes, cemented in my position. I didnt want to watch anymore. *Watch, child* I shook my head sharply. *Watch.* It was a demand. Not a request. I obeyed. My eyes, and my eyes only, dragged to the right, where they followed my memory self cautiously walking towards the voice we should have ignored. But something was different. My brow furrowed as I tried to focus. There was something trailing behind memory-me as we walked in *his* voice's direction. Something was forming. It was black, thick, and it was oozing out of us a little at a time, ending in one big, condensed puddle of goo. What are you doing down here, huh? *He* said playfully. I watched from afar, as my memory self stood at the foot of the futon where *he* slept, holding Teddy close to our chest. *He* was just out of sight in the dark. Did you *pretend* to get a cup of water just to see me, Clair? *he* cooed. His arm came from the shadows The black liquid left behind pulsed. I flinched, turning my attention to it. Arent you afraid of the dark, Clair Bear? *He* had placed my small hand in his big hand now, cradling it. Caressing it. Another pulse made way, but this time, the ground beneath my feet shook. Come. Come to bed with me, he said from the darkness, sickly sweet. I heard the faint noise of a hand patting bedsheets. I then diverted my eyes from the black puddle, and stared intently at memory me, clutching Teddy close to our lips, hesitating. I absent-mindedly reached my hand out. I even opened my mouth to tell her to stop, to tell her not to go but then our fate was sealed with his last words, which were filled with an overwhelming sense of security that no child could ever deny from an adult: Ill keep you safe. And then memory-me was taken out of my line of sight. A loud, guttural shriek ripped through the nights air. I dropped to the ground, slapping my hands to my ears. Through my squinting eyes I saw, as a jagged, pointy arm shot up from the black puddle that had been left behind, colliding with the ground with an impossible tremor, creating a crack that ripped from the floor, up the wall and to the ceiling, spilling debris like soft falling snow. Then another arm shot up from the blackness, its claws digging into the floor, the floor boards splintering beneath them. The entire house shook this time  and it didnt stop. Picture frames fell face-down, paintings came off of their hinges, vases toppled over and shattered into a hundred pieces. My fathers most precious collection: a wall of CDs, dating back to when he was just a boy, began diving towards the ground, sending dozens upon dozens of broken, serrated disks and plastic casings bouncing into the air. The kitchen cabinets flung open and down came a waterfall of ceramic plates and bowls, and glasses, leaving a tsunami of brokenness in their wake. More rips and cracks slithered across the floor frantically, creating openings in the tile, the floors, the walls, the house, the earth. I crawled as fast as I could underneath the wood dining room table for some sort of shelter, as the entire world shook with vigor. Another shrill cry pierced the atmosphere, and as I clapped my palms to my ears once more, I yelled along with it, screaming as loudly as I could, tearing my vocal chords, pressing my eyes shut as hard as I could physically bear it. Then everything was still. Thats when I finally saw her face. With my universe suddenly mute, the only sound was that of a slight and distant humming slithering into my ears. I then watched in the utter silence as her face finally emerged from the inky puddle of tar. Only, she was beautiful. So very beautiful. And human. Her eyes were that of a feline creature standing out of the blackness that dripped down her face. The whites of her eyes almost glowed in the dark. But she wasnt looking at me. She was looking in the direction of where memory-me had disappeared to. She was crouched down. Slowly, gracefully, she began making her way towards the direction her eyes were set on and right before she went out of my line of sight, her head abruptly snapped in my direction. But she wasnt beautiful anymore. She was the ugliest thing I had ever seen. She had but an oval head, devoid of any humanly features. She had teeth the size of nine-inched nails, serrated and protruding through her face, jutting out in perfect rows of pearly white. The oozing tar never once touching her eyes, nor those teeth. But her eyes her eyes remained the same. Cat-like, large, and glowing, filled with intent. She leapt soundlessly beyond, towards the darkness that held memory-me and *him.* I gasped for air. I was back in my bedroom, on the floor, staring at the wall. Her claws had released my head, sending a wave of erupting gooseflesh all over my skin. My heart was ramming against my rib cage so hard, I was truly afraid it would burst through. But I didnt move. I closed my eyes that burned with hot water, ashamed. So very ashamed. Now you know. I said, through the new tears. *Such, innocence taken* Her voice was a soft purr. My head felt heavy. Like it weighed a ton. The point of her claw then rested under my chin, feeling like a perfect shard of glass. She guided my head to face her. I should have been afraid. *Let me save you.* Her teeth were almost the size of half my face. Here eyes were fixed on mine. Filled with intent. The black tar oozed and swirled perfectly avoiding her brilliant eyes. I felt one warm teardrop glide down my cheek. How? I sniffled. I think she smiled, although I couldnt tell, because there were no lips to show for it. We faced one another head-on now. Eye to eye. I felt sleepy again. Like my head weighed a ton. *Let, me, in.* I blinked once, a very long blink. And then I opened my eyes, and nodded."
109,vulnerability,nosleep,Have you thought about your fear of the dark? I have.,1,ai6tku,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ai6tku/have_you_thought_about_your_fear_of_the_dark_i/,2019-01-21 16:18:58," Have you ever realized how vulnerable we are when we sleep? I have Its not something many people think about. In fact, most people consider themselves safe in their homes while they sleep. I mean, why would you sleep somewhere you dont feel safe? It doesnt make sense. Some people dont have a choice, sure. But wouldnt you agree that most people probably feel their home is safe? Some people have this *irrational* fear of the dark, though. I say irrational because, you know whats in your home. Dont you? So, every night, you get ready for bed, you turn out the lights, and youre mind wanders. If youre somebody who is afraid of the dark and must have a light, or noise, or something, I dont blame you. Have you ever thought about something being in the dark that you cant see? I have. That chair. Or the tv. Or the dogs in the floor. You know what all of that is. So, when its dark, you assume thats what it is. But have you ever thought that maybe it *isnt* what you think it is? I have. Though, you probably havent. Youre too *rational.* You think youre *safe.* And thats fine. Ignorance is bliss. Have you ever thought about what you would do if something moved in the dark? I have. Id get up and try to turn the light on. But why? In fact, most people would go straight for the light. Humans have this innate need to *know.* If something is going to kill them, they want to know what it is. But why? Have you ever imagined turning the light on and seeing something staring back at you? I have. But nonetheless, people still go to sleep every night feeling safe and sound in their beds. Because you know whats in your house, right? But Have you ever realized how vulnerable you are when you sleep? I have. Youre giving up all control. Youre trusting youre senses to wake you up if somethings not right. Thats putting a lot of faith into something, dont you think? You are completely unaware of whats going on around you. Have you ever wondered if someone could take advantage of that? I have. Id imagine most people dont live their lives in fear, however. But like I said, we have a desire to *know.* Especially if youre afraid of the dark, youd rather live in the light. And thats fine. But what about when you sleep? Have you ever thought about how vulnerable you are when you sleep? While youre awake, you have ways of making yourself feel safe. Nightlights, music, prayers. All things to ease your *irrational* thoughts. Its not the dark that youre afraid of, though is it? No, its the thought of not knowing what lurks in the dark. The ever-looming creatures and beings of the shadows. Waiting for the moment when you have immersed yourself into *unknowing.* But what about when youre asleep? What is there to do then? Have you ever thought about that? I have. Whos to say that while you lie in bed, reading things on your phone, there isnt something watching you. Waiting for you to drift away. What are you going to do while youre asleep? See, this is what I mean. Have you ever thought about how vulnerable you are while you sleep? I have. As your consciousness fades, you may catch a glimpse of it. A quick look into what happens once your eyes are closed. The shapes of your room that youre accustomed to, suddenly not the shapes it should be. These things wait. They wait for that vulnerability. What things? The same things you are afraid of while youre awake. The things too *irrational* for normal people to be afraid of. Have you ever watched someone fall asleep, thinking their safe? I have. And do you know what the best part is? Theres nothing they can do. What *can* they do? What if, by the time theyve heard me or seen me, its too late?! Thats the beauty of sleep. The vulnerability. And *everyone* must do it at some point. Have you ever watched and waited for someone *unknowing* to fall asleep? I have. "

I figured I would continue the story where I left off. It might answer some of the questions Ive been asked. Ill continue with the next weekend I stayed at my dads.) It was late Friday night again, another weekend to stay at my dads apartment. The car ride there was dreadful, I kept thinking about the clawed shadow that hung above me only two weeks prior. I knew it had something to do with the apartment. The apartment looked more like a motel. It was a long building with several one-bedroom units strung together. Thinking back on it now, I can honestly say it was a dump. We pulled into the parking space. The windows looked blacked out with the, almost unnatural, darkness that filled the inside. My brother and I grabbed our things and followed dad inside. The layout was very basic for an apartment. The front door led directly into a small living room. Directly connected to that was a galley kitchen/dining room combo that was divided from the living area by a sort of breakfast bar. The kitchen looked like it was designed in the late 70s with everything being cheap wood with tarnished brass handles on the cabinets and drawers. The back door was in the kitchen and led onto a small concrete patio, nothing too special. Off to the left was the hallway that led back to the bedroom and bathroom. That night at dinner, I contemplated telling them what I saw. I figured theyd just brush it off as my 8-year-old imagination running wild. My brother would probably laugh at me since he was going through his teenage-angst years and didnt much care for my child-like thoughts. I was alone, so what else could I do except grin and bear it? The time finally came to sleep, I wasnt sure I could. I was afraid to see him again. There was some comfort knowing my dad and brother were there with me on the king-sized air mattress, but it didnt stop the feeling of vulnerability. I squeezed my eyes shut and attempted to force myself asleep. I laid awake for what felt like an hour, staring at the back of my eyelids. My mind running wild with frightening images and thoughts of what could be lurking in the darkness. Then it happened \*tap\* \*tap\* \*tap\* A gentle tapping sound, like the sound of dripping water into a metal sink. It seemed to echo in my head, as if it wasnt coming from the living room at all, but within my brain. \*Tap\* \*Tap\* \*Tap\* The sound was louder now, more aggressive. What was it? Was I imagining the sound? Was my child-like imagination running away from me? I kept my eyes shut, hoping to ignore it until it went away. \*TAP\* \*TAP\* \*TAP\* The sound became louder, but no, it wasnt getting louder. I realized, it was getting *closer*! I could hear it directly in my right ear. I slowly opened my eyes, and saw it, the faceless head now inches from mine. It was like looking into an empty void. The gnarled claw it used to tap had stopped tapping directly next to my head. It pulled the claw away from the wall and hovered it over my face, tilting its head. As if it had never seen a child before. I was frozen with fear, I couldnt move or make a sound. What did it want? Or worse, what could it do to me? With that thought, I was free and squirmed out of the way letting out a terrified screech as the creature retreated, sliding into the shadowed wall. My dad and brother immediately sat upright, I obviously scared them awake. After taking several minutes to calm me down and hear what had happened, my dad told me it was just a bad dream. He chalked it up to sleeping in an unfamiliar place and told me to go back to sleep. It goes without saying, I didnt sleep that night. My mind kept racing with the image of the faceless shadow hanging over me. Strangely enough, that would be the last time I see ituntil my teenage years"

I squeezed my eyes shut and attempted to force myself asleep. I laid awake for what felt like an hour, staring at the back of my eyelids. My mind running wild with frightening images and thoughts of what could be lurking in the darkness. Then it happened \*tap\* \*tap\* \*tap\* A gentle tapping sound, like the sound of dripping water into a metal sink. It seemed to echo in my head, as if it wasnt coming from the living room at all, but within my brain. \*Tap\* \*Tap\* \*Tap\* The sound was louder now, more aggressive. What was it? Was I imagining the sound? Was my child-like imagination running away from me? I kept my eyes shut, hoping to ignore it until it went away. \*TAP\* \*TAP\* \*TAP\* The sound became louder, but no, it wasnt getting louder. I realized, it was getting *closer*! I could hear it directly in my right ear. I slowly opened my eyes, and saw it, the faceless head now inches from mine. It was like looking into an empty void. The gnarled claw it used to tap had stopped tapping directly next to my head. It pulled the claw away from the wall and hovered it over my face, tilting its head. As if it had never seen a child before. I was frozen with fear, I couldnt move or make a sound. What did it want? Or worse, what could it do to me? With that thought, I was free and squirmed out of the way letting out a terrified screech as the creature retreated, sliding into the shadowed wall. My dad and brother immediately sat upright, I obviously scared them awake. After taking several minutes to calm me down and hear what had happened, my dad told me it was just a bad dream. He chalked it up to sleeping in an unfamiliar place and told me to go back to sleep. It goes without saying, I didnt sleep that night. My mind kept racing with the image of the faceless shadow hanging over me. Strangely enough, that would be the last time I see ituntil my teenage years"
114,vulnerability,nosleep,Gnarled Shadow Claw (Part Two),1,al1uts,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/al1uts/gnarled_shadow_claw_part_two/,2019-01-30 03:43:14," (Ive had a lot of people ask about my last post with the shadow person. I figured I would continue the story where I left off. It might answer some of the questions Ive been asked. Ill continue with the next weekend I stayed at my dads.) It was late Friday night again, another weekend to stay at my dads apartment. The car ride there was dreadful, I kept thinking about the clawed shadow that hung above me only two weeks prior. I knew it had something to do with the apartment. The apartment looked more like a motel. It was a long building with several one-bedroom units strung together. Thinking back on it now, I can honestly say it was a dump. We pulled into the parking space. The windows looked blacked out with the, almost unnatural, darkness that filled the inside. My brother and I grabbed our things and followed dad inside. The layout was very basic for an apartment. The front door led directly into a small living room. Directly connected to that was a galley kitchen/dining room combo that was divided from the living area by a sort of breakfast bar. The kitchen looked like it was designed in the late 70s with everything being cheap wood with tarnished brass handles on the cabinets and drawers. The back door was in the kitchen and led onto a small concrete patio, nothing too special. Off to the left was the hallway that led back to the bedroom and bathroom. That night at dinner, I contemplated telling them what I saw. I figured theyd just brush it off as my 8-year-old imagination running wild. My brother would probably laugh at me since he was going through his teenage-angst years and didnt much care for my child-like thoughts. I was alone, so what else could I do except grin and bear it? The time finally came to sleep, I wasnt sure I could. I was afraid to see him again. There was some comfort knowing my dad and brother were there with me on the king-sized air mattress, but it didnt stop the feeling of vulnerability. I squeezed my eyes shut and attempted to force myself asleep. I laid awake for what felt like an hour, staring at the back of my eyelids.

My mind kept racing with the image of the faceless shadow hanging over me. Strangely enough, that would be the last time I see the shadowuntil my teenage years.I hadnt received any more visits from it, but I hadnt forgotten it. The image of its featureless head wouldnt leave my memory for years after. Some strange occurrences happened within the apartment when I wasnt there. When I turned 14 my dad told me about items going missing and even a key bending on its own. I asked him recently and he mentioned that he had found a mailbox key shortly after moving in. When he checked the apartment mailbox, he discovered a hand-written letter inside addressed to a man that used to live in his unit. After some research and contacting the woman who wrote the letter, he discovered that the man had committed suicide there no more than 7 months prior. He had hung himself after falling into a deep, seemingly random, depression. The police ruled it out as being drug-related, but I think it had to do with the entity I saw all those years ago. Shortly after I turned 12, my mom had met someone new and we moved to a small town in Ohio that was very far away from my hometown. My brother decided to stay with my aunt, which left me with a new step-sister and step-brother. Around the age of 14, they had moved out, leaving me with a room of my own. I couldnt have been happier that I finally had my own room. My dog, Brandi, slept at the foot of my bed most nights, she was a 90lb Boxer and the best guard dog Ive seen. Summer of 2003, I had developed a habit of staying up late and gaming until the break of dawn. Some nights, Id be lucky to get to bed as early as 4am. One night, I remember feeling unusually tired around midnight. I figured that I had a pretty long day as it is and decided to go to sleep early. As I lay in bed, I found that I just couldnt sleep. I felt physically and mentally exhausted, my body felt heavy, but my eyes would not stay closed. Frustrated, I started to get back out of bed, thinking some TV might help (teenage me was dumb) I sat up in my bed, trying to figure out why I felt so crummy seemingly out of nowhere. Then I noticed my dog staring at the corner of my room, her ears perked up and a low-pitched growling that can only be described as angry. I slowly turned to look at the corner, thinking she just saw a light that spooked her. There, standing in *my* corner was a little girl, no discernable features. It looked like the shadow of a little girl just pleasantly standing in the corner of my room. I stared with wide eyes for several seconds before realizing her hand, her hand wasnt the right size. It was larger, mangled with a single large claw coming out of the index finger. I couldnt move, I was frozen in place looking into the void of the shadow that stands so casually in my room. The little girl was much darker than the corner of my room. Her foot slowly began to slide out, sucking up the light like water through a Shop Vac. Brandi jumped off the bed and slid on the wood floor, standing in a very defensive stance. Her deep growl echoed through the room as I feel my body loosen up. I could move again! The girl slid backward into the wall as if pulled by her waist, and the light came back to my room. She was gonefor now"

All I really knew was that she took medication and she felt better. A learned behavior , that still effects me to this day. she had also had me on all types of medication since I was four. At a young age I learned to abuse my meds and hers. Making life harder, I had a younger sister who was just as sick as my mom. My my stepfather worked two jobs so I took care of them while he was away. I didnt attend school for the most part. My first OD was in middle school in seventh grade they found me on the bathroom floor. Now, lets jump forward to 2003 and 13 apparently this wasnt my moms first attempt to commit suicide and she was in a coma for six months. DCYF was involved because of my sisters sick behaviors and put us in programs. I ran away every day to get high and for cigarettes. I commit crimes and got caught up in that. Needless to say I ended up in jail for juveniles and at some point put an a locked program to finish serving out my time out of state !In this program it was locked program but you could work your way up to a house where you could have a little bit more freedom. When my freedom was finally earned a female Victoria and I decided that we would run away so we brought out the garbage and it was pouring outside and we started hopping fences and running as fast as we could. We knew staff would be looking for us quickly! We ended up getting towards the highway and a guy stopped and offered if we needed a ride and we said yeah we needed to get to Brockton but I wanted to go to Rhode Island, but anyways I went with her we got to Brockton and she sees a girl she knows and said she has a place for us to stay Come to find out we decided to go, we ended up in a cupboard in the kitchen with a mattress on the floor. The girl was nowhere to be found there would be two males that would come in on a regular basis and Victoria and I would cry and she would plead for them to leave me alone and they did but they would sexually assault her shortly after that I dont know how many days we had been there but I remember we were drugs and put on a bus headed to New York. So when we arrive in Manhattan we get picked up and drugged and thrown into the back of a car. I remember sort of waking up and peeking through what was ever covering my eyes and seeing Surf Avenue. I was in Brooklyn. I had never been to New York in my life. I wake up in the living room. Its completely black like theres no lights on at all and Im on the couch and there are five African-American males talking to each other with there street names , standing around me and Im still kind of groggy from whatever they drug me with. And Im asking for my friend Victoria and Im like where is she where is she in there like shes fine shes fine. Then they each climbed on top of me and took their tiurn with me prior to all of this I had been a virgin. and being a drug addict , sex was never a thought in my mind. Even as a teen. I was so upset I just remember crying while they took advantage of me. After being drugged again . I remember being transported to another housing complex but this time Victoria and the girl that was in Brockton was there with this other African-American male . He had a gun on my head so I would do sexual acts to him. I hoped he would fall asleep so I could somehow get away since there was only him , as far as I knew. I had no idea if they were more in the house. I stayed up as long as I could and when I finally realized he was asleep I decided to take my chance to escape. so I sneak out of the room and run down the stairs and there is an older woman cooking in the kitchen and she yells upstairs to the guy upstairs and tries to stop me from going out the door. He chased me out with a gun bare ass naked through the project building. I didnt take the elevator because it took too long. I started taking the stairs and I ran and ran and ran and cried and asked for help and nobody would help me. I ran down the street and there was a man, probably in his 40s from the area and African-American male who stopped me. He asked well whats going on to relax , let him help me. I was very hesitant because of what had happened to me. I said OK as long as you can get me to safety and back home to Rhode Island. I told him what had happened and the street names of the guys! Hes like yeah just hold on I got to get my son on the bus. I was like OK so he goes he gets his son hes probably about seven years old get him them on the bus. We walk into a building and he knocks on the door and who answers the door but of one of the 5 males who had taken a vantage of me the night before.... "
116,vulnerability,nosleep,I put out a Craigslist ad for a new roommate to ward off my stalker and avoid violating my lease. My new roommate might be a demon. (FINAL UPDATE),1,a6xo2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a6xo2c/i_put_out_a_craigslist_ad_for_a_new_roommate_to/,2018-12-17 18:25:17,"I was in a good mood when returning from school that night. The final exam wasnt as bad as I thought it would be, and despite [everything that happened](URL I still managed to get in a lot of studying. I even ended an hour earlier than I expected to- which, in retrospect may not have been an indicator of a good grade, but all that mattered was that the exam was over, and I could finally catch a little break. And I really needed this break; I had been tired and exhausted lately and I needed to catch up on sleep. I even bought fried chicken from Churchs to celebrate with Hector. I never expected to come back from school to see Hectors head in a sack and his hands in what looked to be golden handcuffs, with five figures surrounding him, trying to get Hector to stop thrashing around. All five figures were in hooded robes, but I could immediately tell they were not human. Instead of heads, the figures all seemed to be big, unblinking eyeballs shrouded in rounded hoods. They all turned towards me, then towards each other, seemingly confused. I couldnt really tell because they were literal floating eyeballs in hoods. The tallest figure of all was not an eyeball, but a pair of lips that seemed to be floating in the hood. He had a gigantic book in his hand that looked older than my grandfather and he looked genuinely surprised at my arrival. Hector made a sound of urgency; he sounded like he was gagged and couldnt form proper words. Ah, Finn Conway. I did not expect you here for another 36 minutes and 22 seconds. But so good of you to join us anyway, were running on a tight schedule as is. Watching a gigantic pair of lips speak was honestly not the strangest thing Id seen, but it was still quite unsettling. Yeah, well, exams ended early. Who are you and what are you doing in my house? I demanded. And why does Hector look like hes being kidnapped? Oh, because he is. The mouth replied, shutting his book. My eyes widened; what was going on? What? I turned to Hector, then to the mouth. What are you talking about? And seriously, *who are you*? Perhaps youd be more familiar with this form of mine. As soon as I blinked, the pair of lips and all of the eyeballs were replaced with Daniel, the first person who responded to my Craigslist ad and the first person I interviewed to be a potential roommate. I opened my mouth to speak, but he put up his hand to interrupt me. Before you ask questions, you can just continue to refer to us collectively as Daniel, because my true identity would be inconceivable to you. Put simply, I am what you humans would call your guardian angel. I am from the high courts of Heaven and I uphold the law as the delivery of what keeps the universe in balance, My eyes are always on the lookout for any potential glitches in the system, so to speak. Daniel motioned to the other figures, who quickly reverted back to being floating eyeballs with hoods. Their unblinking mannerisms were extremely strange. To you, we may seem like separate parts, but that is not the case. We are all one in the same. These eyes judge, and I, as the mouth, deliver the verdict. I exist to make sure you live your lifeline out to where you were destined to be. I am there to make sure your lives do not exceed nor fail to meet your deadlines, and that nothing gets in the way of it. I- But being that I am not entirely omnipotent, and I have billions of other humans to watch over, I can only really drop by and check in when you are in grave danger. And this demon, Daniel gestured to Hector, who was still trying to squirm away from the figures restraining him. Is putting you in grave danger simply by exposing you to the truth of the universe, which you should not be learning as a mere mortal human. Hectors muffled yells got louder and louder in his head sack. In another blink of an eye, Daniel reverted back to the pair of lips from before. I am terribly overworked as is, but I got word of the demons whereabouts in this area around the same time you began your interviews for a new roommate. Unfortunately, my timing was off and I was not able to interrupt your meeting. When we had the interview, I was really checking in on a tip-off of the exiled demon. Daniel wasnt real? I recalled the super-normal interview with the seemingly super-normal, aspiring chemist Daniel and couldnt remember anything that would have suggested him being anything but what he said he was. Figuratively speaking, Daniel was not what you were looking for in a roommate. The mouth concluded. I squeezed my temples. This was beginning to feel a lot like a headache. Okay, pause. So what youre saying is that you know exactly when Im supposed todie, or whatever, and Hectors presence has been messing around with my original deadline? Yes. It is all in the book. The book is law, and I uphold and embody the law. Mouth-Daniel motioned to the ancient book he was holding; on closer inspection, it was dog-eared throughout and he had his thumb lodged between specific pages, as if to keep track of where he was. You uphold and embody the law. Indeed. Alright. And you also said youd drop by if I were in grave danger, but where were you when I was basically kidnapped against my will? That doesnt sound like following the law to me. I said bitterly, being careful about my word selection. I knew this may not have been the right time or place but if I really had a guardian angel this whole time, why was he absent when the Amy situation happened? Excuse me? It should be in that book of yours- yknow, when I got kidnapped by my stalker, Amy, and was almost forced to marry her at gunpoint? Mouth-Daniel waved me off. It is understandable that you were thrown off by those turn of events, but I can assure you that was not life-threatening in the least. fact, you would have lived a long life under her care, well into your 80s. Initially, you would have resisted, flabbergasted by the proclamation of her emotions. But then you would have realized how devoted she was to you and came around. You would have eventually fallen in love with her. Man, thats not love, thats Stockholm Syndrome. You would have really been okay with me living a life that I never wanted to? I scoffed; I couldnt believe what Mouth-Daniel was spewing out of his, well, mouth. Some guardian angel you are. Finn Conway, you are sorely mistaken. My job is not to ensure you live a life of the utmost quality. What I exist to ensure is the quantity of your life and see that the laws are being followed. And quantity-wise, your lifeline has been a series of tangles and loops ever since this demon entered your life. At one point, you were supposed to die a few days ago, and at another point, your life was extended to beyond what a mere mortal could live until; you would have quite literally made history. This is not how it should have been. And that is what I am here to fix- to clean up the mess the demon made and to right the wrongs of your lifeline. Mouth-Daniels eerie calm demeanor was beginning to get on my nerves. But before I could retort, he interrupted me again. But that is not all that I seek to uphold and embody. Your lifeline is one of many, but your world is still one of its kind. He materialized a small black object from his palm. He held up the black box-looking object, and I quickly realized it was a GoPro. But there was only one reason someone like Mouth-Daniel would be showing me a GoPro in this situation. Are you aware of what this is? I gulped. I had a feeling I knew where this was going. Uh, a camera? Yes. Mouth-Daniel said, crushing the camera between his fingers. His fingers resembled golden daggers, and his hand as a whole was comprised of six of those golden digits. What was left of the camera then spontaneously combusted into a flame and melted away in Mouth-Daniels floating palm. The palm of his hand displayed a small holographic visual of a third-party recording of what had gone down in the Pollacks household. This was hidden between the bookshelves of Mabel Pollacks room, carefully placed so a recording of the exorcism could be captured without the camera being seen by anybody. If it werent for us, the Pollack family would have figured out the truth and possibly caused the recording to go viral on the Internet. I cursed myself for not being more careful. I didnt even think to check the room for any cameras because I didnt think Chris would actually try and record the exorcism; thank God the video didnt get out. I also felt somewhat betrayed by Chris; we never even gave permission for him to record the exorcism, much less witness it in the first place. This is precisely what I am talking about. Not only is the demons presence affecting your own lifeline, its very presence is disrupting the balance between our worlds and this should not happen. Had this video gotten out, our PR department would have had a Hell of a time trying to convince people online that this video was a hoax. Mouth-Daniel then directed his attention back to Hector, who was still struggling against the eyeballs keeping him in the sack. The pair of lips made a nodding motion, and the eyeballs immediately stopped trying to restrain Hector. One of them uncovered his head from the sack and ripped out the rag in his mouth, avoiding Hectors gasps for breaths and coughs. His face was battered and bruised and he was bleeding profusely from his mouth. I knew he didnt handle pain the same way as a human would, but it still looked extremely painful. One of Mouth-Daniels eyeballs floated to the book, opened it, and began scanning it as Mouth-Daniel continued to speak. You have violated several rules. You damaged purgatory spirits, eradicated and consumed a fellow brethren, helped a human survive and lengthened her lifeline beyond what it should have been, and you still have not showed up for your judicial hearing for your original crime. Your presence has affected this human and the human now knows more than it ever should have. The humans timeline is damaged and must be reset to where it should have been from the start. Mouth-Daniel declared. Also, profiting off fake exorcisms? Really? Hector shrugged. I had to pay rent. Mouth-Daniel sighed. Well, you know what is coming to you. As the keeper of the law, I declare that you will be held accountable for the betrayal of your kind and breaking various rules while here in the mortals realm. You cant just waltz in here and decide that on your own. I grabbed Daniels arm. There was nothing to grab; there was only fabric. I immediately retracted my hand, appalled by the emptiness I felt. Clearly, otherworldly creatures bodies didnt work the same way human bodies did. Shivers ran down my spine. Actually, I can. I am the law. Daniel retorted. I cringed at the pair of lips and crossed my arms. The eyeballs moved to cover Hector again, who protested by trying to kick their lack of a body. Needless to say, it didnt work. At least hear Hector out, I pleaded. He clearly has his own reasons for doing things. Let the demon try and defend itself, Daniel nodded reluctantly. The eyeballs paused in their movements. Thanks for the golden opportunity. I would have explained earlier if you didnt ambush me and tie me up like this. Hector sighed, gesturing to his beat-up face. I made a contract with the human. Im legally bound to protect him until he dies. The eyeballs spun in place in what I thought was an eye-rolling motion, and Mouth-Daniel snapped his fingers, ordering the eyeballs to mute Hector again by putting on the mouth gag. This was obviously not what he wanted to hear. Hector flailed and protested against his restraints. You made a contract? With this human? Dont make me laugh, there is no way- Actually, yeah! I shot up in my seat, coming to my senses. Everyones focus was on me now and I knew I couldnt stop. I knew what would help get Hector out of this mess, and it was something he had been mentioning for a long time. Everything he did was to keep me safe from danger. And isnt that a valid reason for him to have had broken all those rules? Yeah, he may have thrown me into a bunch of danger simply by existing, but he also protected me from those dangers. It was to uphold our contract. I hoped this was going in the right direction, because I was saying what immediately came to mind. ""Every crime he committed in my world was to keep me safe."" And where is this contract? Mouth-Daniel demanded. Uh, does it have to be a physical contract? Cant it just be word of mouth? Without physical evidence, we have no reason to pursue this revelation. I thought for a moment, then rushed over to my room. Hold up. I mumbled as I rummaged through my desk, through the mess of papers, until I found a fried chicken oil-stained roommate contract that we signed when Hector moved in. It contained a bunch of jargon about the lease and the responsibilities of a roommate, and also Hectors special addition of fried chicken on Fridays in exchange for protection of my soul. My name was signed on the bottom of the confirmation page, and Hector opted to put his bloody fingerprint instead because he thought that was how contracts were supposed to be formed. I handed the forms over to Eyeball-Daniel, who had followed me in. Eyeball-Daniel snatched it from me and took it back to the others to discuss the forms. As they contemplated in silence, I sat by Hector, who looked tired and beaten. I dont suppose I can help you out with those cuffs? I murmured, trying not to attract so much attention from the Daniels. Hector shook his head. Nah, this is made up of material you humans will never be able to discover. Its fine, its just a little uncomfortable. He assured. I nodded. I hope I didnt make things worse with the whole contract thing. I dont think it was in his book of law or whatever. I hesitated, looking down at my hands. Hector nudged me with his knee. Are you kidding? You really saved my ass back there by bringing up the contract. Heres a secret, that book isnt 100% right all the time and it takes some time to update with newer information. Its kind of like Wikipedia. Thats probably why they didnt know about the roommate agreement, because they tend to miss little details like that from time to time. They really didnt believe me when I told them cause they think I lie a lot, but they had no choice but to believe you, since youre a human. I dont know if thatll fly in the end, it definitely wont excuse everything I did before coming here but it will help me out with everything I did for you. Everything you did before coming here, huh? All this because you refused to eat humans? Might have been easier to just eat our souls and be done with it. I asked. Hector stared at me, then let out a short laugh. Wait, I never did tell you the real reason why Im in so much trouble, did I? Hector said, fidgeting with his restraints. It was my turn to stare. Excuse me? Yeah, all that about being kicked out of Hell for refusing to eat humans? I wasnt lying about the refusing to eat humans part, Im genuinely sick of eating humans and wanted to branch out. Sure, it got me dirty looks in the streets but its not a violation of a law or anything. Its just an unpopular way of life. Hector shrugged. I was never kicked out. Im sure you could tell from what that mouth was flapping, I was avoiding my arrest warrant for committing an actual crime. Wait, so you were lying to me? I mean, I wanted to make a good first impression at the roommate interview. I wanted to be cool. Being kicked out of Hell was the coolest thing I could think of. Hector gnawed at the handcuffs, to no avail. How is that even remotely co- how is that supposed to make a good impress- *dude, you told me you were kicked out for refusing to eat humans!* I sputtered. I couldnt believe what I was hearing. If refusing to eat humans wasnt Hectors crime, then what was? Why would I be condemned to Hell prison for a diet preference? Thats so George Orwell. Youd really believe anything I say. Well, I had no reason to believe otherwise! Everything you said was crazy enough for me to have to accept. Whats the real reason youre in this mess, then? I demanded. Weve come this far and youre about to be arrested, so you might as well be straight with me. Hector was silent, his gaze falling on the figures who were still conversing, probably within their own psychic realm or whatever. I made a deal under the table with a soul I was supposed to torture, Hector finally said. You know this isnt my body. I never told you the details, though. This is Hector Sanchez, and he died when he was 27 back in 1922. Grew up poor, mom died when he was born. Left with only a sister who died of polio when he was 12 and a father who struggled to make ends meet. But they had a lot of debt from a lot of past mistakes. Hector went to Hell for killing three mobsters, because he thought those people were the mobsters who were threatening his family for their debt. Turns out, he pissed off a whole other group of mobsters who murdered him in cold blood after finding out that their own were killed by him. He ended up in Hell because he killed the wrong people at the wrong time, wrong place. Thatsnot fair. Lifes not fair. You know that. Why hit up a deal with him specifically? Why not all the other souls youve tortured in your lifetime? Well, Hector grinned. I liked his name. My jaw slacked. Thats it? Yeah. Arent there a million Hectors out there? Yeah, but this one happened to be tortured at the right time, right place, by the right guy: me. Despite me always skinning him only to put the skin back on his body to do it all over again, he told me his life story, and I listened. This was around the time where I decided to go on my non-human binge. Then I thought, why not borrow this guys body and identity and go to his world to try all the foods he always mentioned back when he was alive? Long story short, I snuck his soul to Purgatory while I borrowed his identity to fuck around in your world. Couldnt send him to Heaven cause they have a lot of security guards there, but Purgatory beats Hell by a long shot. That sounds super illegal, and Im not even familiar with your laws. Look, everything isnt always black and white. I never really approved of the way these tight-asses threw bad guys in Heaven and good guys in Hell, just cause of the way their books told them they should do it. Hector Sanchez didnt die a fair death, and he sure as Hell didnt live a fair life. The odds were always stacked against him. Id like to think what I did was morally rightwhich, actually, kind of goes against everything Im supposed to stand for. I exhaled slowly. This was a lot to take in at once, but this time I knew Hector had no reason to be fabricating anything, seeing as he was in a tough situation now. The more I thought about it, the more I saw things from his perspective. The real Hector Sanchez really was disadvantaged from the start. He never would have went through that if we were born into a family with better luck, better wealth, and better status. I wondered if cases like Hectors was common- things that led souls to be wrongfully incarcerated to Hell just because they broke some laws that were a million years old and clearly not adapted to changing times. It sounded all too similar to certain criminal laws we had on Earth, and I realized- maybe Hell and Earth werent so different, after all. Yknow, youre right. And for a demon, youre really not as bad as you make your kind out to be. I remarked. I mean, maybe its just you and every other demon just sucks. But youre more human than demon in my eyes. We exchanged tense smiles. Hey, after a few centuries this demon thing gets really old. The arrest was worth the execution. E-Execution? Oh yeah, Im most likely gonna get the human equivalent of a death sentence and be eradicated in the flames of Hell forever for what I did. My jaw dropped as the Daniels turned around, seemingly reaching an agreement. We have taken the words of this physical contract into consideration. The contract isvalid. Mouth-Daniel finally said. Hector looked ecstatic, and I breathed a sigh of relief. However, Mouth-Daniel cut off our celebration. Seeing as the situation is somewhat paradoxical in that he caused the very problems he was protecting you from, this must be submitted to the higher Courts for further inspection. In addition, he will still be facing trial for his crimes of sending a soul to Purgatory. I deflated. What? How is that fair? It is just. I am the law. Mouth-Daniel insisted. We get it, youre the fucking law. Hector slumped back in his seat. So what now? Mouth-Daniel closed the book, and the book disappeared from between his hands. Now that the demon is in our custody, we will be taking the demon back to our realm where he will be tried. But I will say, the contract was compelling and may help dispel some crimes hereeven if it was paradoxical. I drowned out Mouth-Daniels words as I realized what was awaiting Hector. Here, courts really showed no mercy in cases with people who were disadvantaged from the start. A lot of undeserving people got death sentences for cases that should have been reviewed better. And it really seemed like Hector was not going to get a good outcome, despite the contract; the contract couldnt save him from a guilty verdict. And what usually followed guilty verdicts wasnt good. I couldnt stand to hear Hector being forced to attend an unfair trial and potentially get executed. I stood in front of him, immobile and firm. So youre just going to execute him because he did something that went against your book? Have you ever considered the fact that your book is wrong? Cause from what he tells me, its not always updated 100%, and it really doesnt account for all the injustices that the real Hector Sanchez faced when he was sent to Hell in the first place. And you said so yourself that you're not omnipotent, so how am I supposed to believe your book is absolute? I stormed. The book *is* absolute and I will not dispute that with a human. Your feeble mind will never be able to comprehend the sheer vastness of the contents of this book, which contains the answers to questions you humans will never be able to know despite seeking profusely. But I never said anything about execution. Mouth-Daniel remarked, sounding confused. Iarent you taking him to trial? You guys have been implying Hectors guilty, and heIm assuming hes gonna get executed or something down there when the trial doesnt work out in his favor. I stammered, realizing Hector duped me again. One last hoorah before he left. He will not be executed, per se. His crime is not of that caliber. He will have to perform what you humans equate to as community service, but execution requires a far greater crime. And he has not committed that. Hector laughed obnoxiously in the background. Dude, did you really think I was gonna get executed? Where the fuck did you get that idea? Shut up, I said, turning red at my mistake. You really wanted to screw around one last time, huh? You guys really made this whole thing sound horrible and beyond repair- It is horrible. The demon disrupted the balance of the universe and messed with your timeline, which will take some time to get back to normal. Mouth-Daniel interrupted. You made it sound horrible enough for an execution. I retorted. How am I supposed to know what punishments fit the crime in your book? Mouth-Daniel interrupted again; higher beings really needed to learn some manners. All I want to know is, why? Why would you want to confine yourself to a mortal life, escape trial, rather than face a sentence that would be more of an inconvenience than an execution? Instead, you chose to take the more difficult route and avoid your responsibilities. All we do down there is torture souls and eat humans. It gets old after a couple of centuries and I got bored. I wanted to try something new, is that so bad? Hector shrugged. By doing this, you have singlehandedly upset the already tedious balance between us and the humans and exposed their world to even more calamities from Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. You have potentially shortened and lengthened Finn Conways lifespan to ridiculous degrees by making him aware of our worlds and vice versa. Hector was silent for a moment. Well, when you put it that way it does sound pretty bad enough for an execution. And I must remind you that you will still be held accountable for the- Yeah, I know. Soul to Purgatory bad. Torture souls forever good. Hector sarcastically drawled. The Daniels nodded, and took off their hoods. They all simultaneously turned into human Daniels again. We will be waiting outside this building for you. We will take another portal back to Hell; this one will be eradicated. Daniel walked over to where Amy had carved the summoning circle into the floor and put his palm over the grooved ridges. In one smooth swipe, the circle disappeared, and the wood was back to normal- before Amy defiled it with her insanity. With his other palm, Daniel produced a small black duffel bag which he threw onto Hectors lap. Please pack lightly, and only what you need. We will see you in no more than fifteen minutes. With that, all of the Daniels walked out of the apartment. I debated telling them how weird it looked that they were all essentially the same person in different clothes, but figured people would just pass them off as quintuplets or something. They were the least of my concerns in that moment. Well. Hector got up once the restraints melted off his wrists. He stretched his back and yawned. Its been a great run. Sorry you have to find another roommate again. You can keep whatevers left of the fake exorcism money, I dont need it where Im going. Hector rummaged around the apartment. So thats it? I said. You're really leaving? Just like this? Not cause I want to, obviously. But you heard the eyeballs. I gotta blast. Theres no point in running anymore, they have me cornered and d rather just deal with this shit now before it gets any worse. Guess that means I have to find another place. I murmured. Now that theres no stalker following me where I live, I dont have to live with a roommate out of fear for my life anymore. And hey, the lease will end soon, so I wouldnt be breaking any contracts. I realized the irony of my statement shortly after I said it. Hey, at least one of us benefitted from this, right? Hector commented. He seemed to ponder what to bring back and contemplated the amount of room he had in his small bag. He ended up only packing his fryer and the fried chicken I brought back into the duffel bag he was provided. Those were the only things that he wanted to take back to Hell before his trial. Knowing it was the last of his things made me feel a pang of guilt. I crossed my arms. If the trial goes well, will I ever see you again? I asked. The strange feeling of sadness was beginning to set in; though these has been the wildest weeks I had been through in my entire life, I knew that I would feel a void where Hector and his strange fried-chicken loving self were. And I had to admit, Hector grew on me in the short time we had together. No, probably not. Im most likely going to be confined to torture duty for at least a couple centuries for what I did. he said. I looked downcast, and Hector laughed. Kidding, kidding! Im telling you, its no big deal. Youre definitely going to see me again. Hector assured. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. The trials not gonna be that bad. At least, I hope. Im really hoping Ill only be held accountable for what my crimes back down in Hell. If I get a good enough lawyer to represent me theyll be able to sleaze the contract into freeing me from any crimes committed while with you. I guess I looked unconvinced, because Hector continued on with his explanation. He put a hand on my shoulder in a reassuring manner. Look at it this way, man. Were contractually bound until you die. It might be a while, but Ill see you again. We have no cell service in Hell, though, so if I do visit its gonna have to be a surprise. Alright. I took his words and chose to trust that we would eventually cross paths again. I uncrossed my arms and stuck my hand out for Hector to shake. Until next time, then? Hector glanced at my hand, grabbed it, and pulled me into the most awkward and clumsy hug that I had ever experienced. I was surprised, to say in the least; I had never seen Hector do anything that could have been considered remotely affectionate so this was strange to me. Hector pat my back tensely, clearly uncomfortable by the gesture that he initiated. This is weird. Hugs are weird. He let go, and Hector rubbed his neck nervously- a habit he picked up from me. I saw that people hug in TV when leaving each other for a long time but now that Ive tried it, I have no idea why. It just makes things sadder, and this isn't even the end of things. I nodded in agreement, amused by his discomfort at a simple hug, especially considering hes done worse things. Hector zipped up his duffle bag, and I gazed at the immaculate floorboards where the summoning circle once was. To think all of this happened because I was careless and put my information online for my stalker to find; as an IT guy I really should have known better. But my carelessness led to meeting Hector, learning more about the universe than ever, and having weird misadventures with otherworldly creatures in my otherwise boring, law-abiding life. And I managed to stay sane and alive through all of it. If I could have done it all again, I wouldnt have changed a thing- except maybe my stupid username from the game, MrPeanutButter26. Thanks for everything, Finn. I really had a great time here. You know, for a human, you werent that bad. Hector smiled at me. Despite his words, his smile felt incredibly sincere this time around, and it was a shame that the one time he showed human-like vulnerability, it was because he was leaving for an unknown amount of time. Ill see you around, Hector. I said, smiling back. Hector took one last look around the apartment, and then at me before closing the door gently behind him. I heard the rustle of his duffle hitting his leg as he walked away into the hallway, until I heard nothing else but silence. * &amp;#x200B; In a nutshell, I had a really strange time with Hector, but it was exciting nonetheless. I dont know when hell come back and how hell manage to stay out of trouble, but I knew he would figure out a way somehow. And when he did, I would treat him to more fried chicken places- maybe even take him on a trip to Louisiana so he can get some of that genuine fried chicken experience. I have a feeling this isnt the end of our encounters with one another, and despite everything, Im glad I met Hector. His fried-chicken loving presence is always welcome at my place, wherever I end up moving to. Thanks for following me in my strange misadventures, guys. I promise Ill keep you updated if Hector ever visits again."
117,vulnerability,nosleep,I put out a Craigslist ad for a new roommate to ward off my stalker and avoid violating my lease. My new roommate might be a demon. FINAL UPDATE.,1,a6xqae,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a6xqae/i_put_out_a_craigslist_ad_for_a_new_roommate_to/,2018-12-17 18:36:18,"I was in a good mood when returning from school that night. The final exam wasnt as bad as I thought it would be, and despite [everything that happened](URL I still managed to get in a lot of studying. I even ended an hour earlier than I expected to- which, in retrospect may not have been an indicator of a good grade, but all that mattered was that the exam was over, and I could finally catch a little break. And I really needed this break; I had been tired and exhausted lately and I needed to catch up on sleep. I even bought fried chicken from Churchs to celebrate with Hector. I never expected to come back from school to see Hectors head in a sack and his hands in what looked to be golden handcuffs, with five figures surrounding him, trying to get Hector to stop thrashing around. All five figures were in hooded robes, but I could immediately tell they were not human. Instead of heads, the figures all seemed to be big, unblinking eyeballs shrouded in rounded hoods. They all turned towards me, then towards each other, seemingly confused. I couldnt really tell because they were literal floating eyeballs in hoods. The tallest figure of all was not an eyeball, but a pair of lips that seemed to be floating in the hood. He had a gigantic book in his hand that looked older than my grandfather and he looked genuinely surprised at my arrival. Hector made a sound of urgency; he sounded like he was gagged and couldnt form proper words. Ah, Finn Conway. I did not expect you here for another 36 minutes and 22 seconds. But so good of you to join us anyway, were running on a tight schedule as is. Watching a gigantic pair of lips speak was honestly not the strangest thing Id seen, but it was still quite unsettling. Yeah, well, exams ended early. Who are you and what are you doing in my house? I demanded. And why does Hector look like hes being kidnapped? Oh, because he is. The mouth replied, shutting his book. My eyes widened; what was going on? What? I turned to Hector, then to the mouth. What are you talking about? And seriously, *who are you*? Perhaps youd be more familiar with this form of mine. As soon as I blinked, the pair of lips and all of the eyeballs were replaced with Daniel, the first person who responded to my Craigslist ad and the first person I interviewed to be a potential roommate. I opened my mouth to speak, but he put up his hand to interrupt me. Before you ask questions, you can just continue to refer to us collectively as Daniel, because my true identity would be inconceivable to you. Put simply, I am what you humans would call your guardian angel. I am from the high courts of Heaven and I uphold the law as the delivery of what keeps the universe in balance, My eyes are always on the lookout for any potential glitches in the system, so to speak. Daniel motioned to the other figures, who quickly reverted back to being floating eyeballs with hoods. Their unblinking mannerisms were extremely strange. To you, we may seem like separate parts, but that is not the case. We are all one in the same. These eyes judge, and I, as the mouth, deliver the verdict. I exist to make sure you live your lifeline out to where you were destined to be. I am there to make sure your lives do not exceed nor fail to meet your deadlines, and that nothing gets in the way of it. I- But being that I am not entirely omnipotent, and I have billions of other humans to watch over, I can only really drop by and check in when you are in grave danger. And this demon, Daniel gestured to Hector, who was still trying to squirm away from the figures restraining him. Is putting you in grave danger simply by exposing you to the truth of the universe, which you should not be learning as a mere mortal human. Hectors muffled yells got louder and louder in his head sack. In another blink of an eye, Daniel reverted back to the pair of lips from before. I am terribly overworked as is, but I got word of the demons whereabouts in this area around the same time you began your interviews for a new roommate. Unfortunately, my timing was off and I was not able to interrupt your meeting. When we had the interview, I was really checking in on a tip-off of the exiled demon. Daniel wasnt real? I recalled the super-normal interview with the seemingly super-normal, aspiring chemist Daniel and couldnt remember anything that would have suggested him being anything but what he said he was. Figuratively speaking, Daniel was not what you were looking for in a roommate. The mouth concluded. I squeezed my temples. This was beginning to feel a lot like a headache. Okay, pause. So what youre saying is that you know exactly when Im supposed todie, or whatever, and Hectors presence has been messing around with my original deadline? Yes. It is all in the book. The book is law, and I uphold and embody the law. Mouth-Daniel motioned to the ancient book he was holding; on closer inspection, it was dog-eared throughout and he had his thumb lodged between specific pages, as if to keep track of where he was. You uphold and embody the law. Indeed. Alright. And you also said youd drop by if I were in grave danger, but where were you when I was basically kidnapped against my will? That doesnt sound like following the law to me. I said bitterly, being careful about my word selection. I knew this may not have been the right time or place but if I really had a guardian angel this whole time, why was he absent when the Amy situation happened? Excuse me? It should be in that book of yours- yknow, when I got kidnapped by my stalker, Amy, and was almost forced to marry her at gunpoint? Mouth-Daniel waved me off. It is understandable that you were thrown off by those turn of events, but I can assure you that was not life-threatening in the least. fact, you would have lived a long life under her care, well into your 80s. Initially, you would have resisted, flabbergasted by the proclamation of her emotions. But then you would have realized how devoted she was to you and came around. You would have eventually fallen in love with her. Man, thats not love, thats Stockholm Syndrome. You would have really been okay with me living a life that I never wanted to? I scoffed; I couldnt believe what Mouth-Daniel was spewing out of his, well, mouth. Some guardian angel you are. Finn Conway, you are sorely mistaken. My job is not to ensure you live a life of the utmost quality. What I exist to ensure is the quantity of your life and see that the laws are being followed. And quantity-wise, your lifeline has been a series of tangles and loops ever since this demon entered your life. At one point, you were supposed to die a few days ago, and at another point, your life was extended to beyond what a mere mortal could live until; you would have quite literally made history. This is not how it should have been. And that is what I am here to fix- to clean up the mess the demon made and to right the wrongs of your lifeline. Mouth-Daniels eerie calm demeanor was beginning to get on my nerves. But before I could retort, he interrupted me again. But that is not all that I seek to uphold and embody. Your lifeline is one of many, but your world is still one of its kind. He materialized a small black object from his palm. He held up the black box-looking object, and I quickly realized it was a GoPro. But there was only one reason someone like Mouth-Daniel would be showing me a GoPro in this situation. Are you aware of what this is? I gulped. I had a feeling I knew where this was going. Uh, a camera? Yes. Mouth-Daniel said, crushing the camera between his fingers. His fingers resembled golden daggers, and his hand as a whole was comprised of six of those golden digits. What was left of the camera then spontaneously combusted into a flame and melted away in Mouth-Daniels floating palm. The palm of his hand displayed a small holographic visual of a third-party recording of what had gone down in the Pollacks household. This was hidden between the bookshelves of Mabel Pollacks room, carefully placed so a recording of the exorcism could be captured without the camera being seen by anybody. If it werent for us, the Pollack family would have figured out the truth and possibly caused the recording to go viral on the Internet. I cursed myself for not being more careful. I didnt even think to check the room for any cameras because I didnt think Chris would actually try and record the exorcism; thank God the video didnt get out. I also felt somewhat betrayed by Chris; we never even gave permission for him to record the exorcism, much less witness it in the first place. This is precisely what I am talking about. Not only is the demons presence affecting your own lifeline, its very presence is disrupting the balance between our worlds and this should not happen. Had this video gotten out, our PR department would have had a Hell of a time trying to convince people online that this video was a hoax. Mouth-Daniel then directed his attention back to Hector, who was still struggling against the eyeballs keeping him in the sack. The pair of lips made a nodding motion, and the eyeballs immediately stopped trying to restrain Hector. One of them uncovered his head from the sack and ripped out the rag in his mouth, avoiding Hectors gasps for breaths and coughs. His face was battered and bruised and he was bleeding profusely from his mouth. I knew he didnt handle pain the same way as a human would, but it still looked extremely painful. One of Mouth-Daniels eyeballs floated to the book, opened it, and began scanning it as Mouth-Daniel continued to speak. You have violated several rules. You damaged purgatory spirits, eradicated and consumed a fellow brethren, helped a human survive and lengthened her lifeline beyond what it should have been, and you still have not showed up for your judicial hearing for your original crime. Your presence has affected this human and the human now knows more than it ever should have. The humans timeline is damaged and must be reset to where it should have been from the start. Mouth-Daniel declared. Also, profiting off fake exorcisms? Really? Hector shrugged. I had to pay rent. Mouth-Daniel sighed. Well, you know what is coming to you. As the keeper of the law, I declare that you will be held accountable for the betrayal of your kind and breaking various rules while here in the mortals realm. You cant just waltz in here and decide that on your own. I grabbed Daniels arm. There was nothing to grab; there was only fabric. I immediately retracted my hand, appalled by the emptiness I felt. Clearly, otherworldly creatures bodies didnt work the same way human bodies did. Shivers ran down my spine. Actually, I can. I am the law. Daniel retorted. I cringed at the pair of lips and crossed my arms. The eyeballs moved to cover Hector again, who protested by trying to kick their lack of a body. Needless to say, it didnt work. At least hear Hector out, I pleaded. He clearly has his own reasons for doing things. Let the demon try and defend itself, Daniel nodded reluctantly. The eyeballs paused in their movements. Thanks for the golden opportunity. I would have explained earlier if you didnt ambush me and tie me up like this. Hector sighed, gesturing to his beat-up face. I made a contract with the human. Im legally bound to protect him until he dies. The eyeballs spun in place in what I thought was an eye-rolling motion, and Mouth-Daniel snapped his fingers, ordering the eyeballs to mute Hector again by putting on the mouth gag. This was obviously not what he wanted to hear. Hector flailed and protested against his restraints. You made a contract? With this human? Dont make me laugh, there is no way- Actually, yeah! I shot up in my seat, coming to my senses. Everyones focus was on me now and I knew I couldnt stop. I knew what would help get Hector out of this mess, and it was something he had been mentioning for a long time. Everything he did was to keep me safe from danger. And isnt that a valid reason for him to have had broken all those rules? Yeah, he may have thrown me into a bunch of danger simply by existing, but he also protected me from those dangers. It was to uphold our contract. I hoped this was going in the right direction, because I was saying what immediately came to mind. ""Every crime he committed in my world was to keep me safe."" And where is this contract? Mouth-Daniel demanded. Uh, does it have to be a physical contract? Cant it just be word of mouth? Without physical evidence, we have no reason to pursue this revelation. I thought for a moment, then rushed over to my room. Hold up. I mumbled as I rummaged through my desk, through the mess of papers, until I found a fried chicken oil-stained roommate contract that we signed when Hector moved in. It contained a bunch of jargon about the lease and the responsibilities of a roommate, and also Hectors special addition of fried chicken on Fridays in exchange for protection of my soul. My name was signed on the bottom of the confirmation page, and Hector opted to put his bloody fingerprint instead because he thought that was how contracts were supposed to be formed. I handed the forms over to Eyeball-Daniel, who had followed me in. Eyeball-Daniel snatched it from me and took it back to the others to discuss the forms. As they contemplated in silence, I sat by Hector, who looked tired and beaten. I dont suppose I can help you out with those cuffs? I murmured, trying not to attract so much attention from the Daniels. Hector shook his head. Nah, this is made up of material you humans will never be able to discover. Its fine, its just a little uncomfortable. He assured. I nodded. I hope I didnt make things worse with the whole contract thing. I dont think it was in his book of law or whatever. I hesitated, looking down at my hands. Hector nudged me with his knee. Are you kidding? You really saved my ass back there by bringing up the contract. Heres a secret, that book isnt 100% right all the time and it takes some time to update with newer information. Its kind of like Wikipedia. Thats probably why they didnt know about the roommate agreement, because they tend to miss little details like that from time to time. They really didnt believe me when I told them cause they think I lie a lot, but they had no choice but to believe you, since youre a human. I dont know if thatll fly in the end, it definitely wont excuse everything I did before coming here but it will help me out with everything I did for you. Everything you did before coming here, huh? All this because you refused to eat humans? Might have been easier to just eat our souls and be done with it. I asked. Hector stared at me, then let out a short laugh. Wait, I never did tell you the real reason why Im in so much trouble, did I? Hector said, fidgeting with his restraints. It was my turn to stare. Excuse me? Yeah, all that about being kicked out of Hell for refusing to eat humans? I wasnt lying about the refusing to eat humans part, Im genuinely sick of eating humans and wanted to branch out. Sure, it got me dirty looks in the streets but its not a violation of a law or anything. Its just an unpopular way of life. Hector shrugged. I was never kicked out. Im sure you could tell from what that mouth was flapping, I was avoiding my arrest warrant for committing an actual crime. Wait, so you were lying to me? I mean, I wanted to make a good first impression at the roommate interview. I wanted to be cool. Being kicked out of Hell was the coolest thing I could think of. Hector gnawed at the handcuffs, to no avail. How is that even remotely co- how is that supposed to make a good impress- *dude, you told me you were kicked out for refusing to eat humans!* I sputtered. I couldnt believe what I was hearing. If refusing to eat humans wasnt Hectors crime, then what was? Why would I be condemned to Hell prison for a diet preference? Thats so George Orwell. Youd really believe anything I say. Well, I had no reason to believe otherwise! Everything you said was crazy enough for me to have to accept. Whats the real reason youre in this mess, then? I demanded. Weve come this far and youre about to be arrested, so you might as well be straight with me. Hector was silent, his gaze falling on the figures who were still conversing, probably within their own psychic realm or whatever. I made a deal under the table with a soul I was supposed to torture, Hector finally said. You know this isnt my body. I never told you the details, though. This is Hector Sanchez, and he died when he was 27 back in 1922. Grew up poor, mom died when he was born. Left with only a sister who died of polio when he was 12 and a father who struggled to make ends meet. But they had a lot of debt from a lot of past mistakes. Hector went to Hell for killing three mobsters, because he thought those people were the mobsters who were threatening his family for their debt. Turns out, he pissed off a whole other group of mobsters who murdered him in cold blood after finding out that their own were killed by him. He ended up in Hell because he killed the wrong people at the wrong time, wrong place. Thatsnot fair. Lifes not fair. You know that. Why hit up a deal with him specifically? Why not all the other souls youve tortured in your lifetime? Well, Hector grinned. I liked his name. My jaw slacked. Thats it? Yeah. Arent there a million Hectors out there? Yeah, but this one happened to be tortured at the right time, right place, by the right guy: me. Despite me always skinning him only to put the skin back on his body to do it all over again, he told me his life story, and I listened. This was around the time where I decided to go on my non-human binge. Then I thought, why not borrow this guys body and identity and go to his world to try all the foods he always mentioned back when he was alive? Long story short, I snuck his soul to Purgatory while I borrowed his identity to fuck around in your world. Couldnt send him to Heaven cause they have a lot of security guards there, but Purgatory beats Hell by a long shot. That sounds super illegal, and Im not even familiar with your laws. Look, everything isnt always black and white. I never really approved of the way these tight-asses threw bad guys in Heaven and good guys in Hell, just cause of the way their books told them they should do it. Hector Sanchez didnt die a fair death, and he sure as Hell didnt live a fair life. The odds were always stacked against him. Id like to think what I did was morally rightwhich, actually, kind of goes against everything Im supposed to stand for. I exhaled slowly. This was a lot to take in at once, but this time I knew Hector had no reason to be fabricating anything, seeing as he was in a tough situation now. The more I thought about it, the more I saw things from his perspective. The real Hector Sanchez really was disadvantaged from the start. He never would have went through that if we were born into a family with better luck, better wealth, and better status. I wondered if cases like Hectors was common- things that led souls to be wrongfully incarcerated to Hell just because they broke some laws that were a million years old and clearly not adapted to changing times. It sounded all too similar to certain criminal laws we had on Earth, and I realized- maybe Hell and Earth werent so different, after all. Yknow, youre right. And for a demon, youre really not as bad as you make your kind out to be. I remarked. I mean, maybe its just you and every other demon just sucks. But youre more human than demon in my eyes. We exchanged tense smiles. Hey, after a few centuries this demon thing gets really old. The arrest was worth the execution. E-Execution? Oh yeah, Im most likely gonna get the human equivalent of a death sentence and be eradicated in the flames of Hell forever for what I did. My jaw dropped as the Daniels turned around, seemingly reaching an agreement. We have taken the words of this physical contract into consideration. The contract isvalid. Mouth-Daniel finally said. Hector looked ecstatic, and I breathed a sigh of relief. However, Mouth-Daniel cut off our celebration. Seeing as the situation is somewhat paradoxical in that he caused the very problems he was protecting you from, this must be submitted to the higher Courts for further inspection. In addition, he will still be facing trial for his crimes of sending a soul to Purgatory. I deflated. What? How is that fair? It is just. I am the law. Mouth-Daniel insisted. We get it, youre the fucking law. Hector slumped back in his seat. So what now? Mouth-Daniel closed the book, and the book disappeared from between his hands. Now that the demon is in our custody, we will be taking the demon back to our realm where he will be tried. But I will say, the contract was compelling and may help dispel some crimes hereeven if it was paradoxical. I drowned out Mouth-Daniels words as I realized what was awaiting Hector. Here, courts really showed no mercy in cases with people who were disadvantaged from the start. A lot of undeserving people got death sentences for cases that should have been reviewed better. And it really seemed like Hector was not going to get a good outcome, despite the contract; the contract couldnt save him from a guilty verdict. And what usually followed guilty verdicts wasnt good. I couldnt stand to hear Hector being forced to attend an unfair trial and potentially get executed. I stood in front of him, immobile and firm. So youre just going to execute him because he did something that went against your book? Have you ever considered the fact that your book is wrong? Cause from what he tells me, its not always updated 100%, and it really doesnt account for all the injustices that the real Hector Sanchez faced when he was sent to Hell in the first place. And you said so yourself that you're not omnipotent, so how am I supposed to believe your book is absolute? I stormed. The book *is* absolute and I will not dispute that with a human. Your feeble mind will never be able to comprehend the sheer vastness of the contents of this book, which contains the answers to questions you humans will never be able to know despite seeking profusely. But I never said anything about execution. Mouth-Daniel remarked, sounding confused. Iarent you taking him to trial? You guys have been implying Hectors guilty, and heIm assuming hes gonna get executed or something down there when the trial doesnt work out in his favor. I stammered, realizing Hector duped me again. One last hoorah before he left. He will not be executed, per se. His crime is not of that caliber. He will have to perform what you humans equate to as community service, but execution requires a far greater crime. And he has not committed that. Hector laughed obnoxiously in the background. Dude, did you really think I was gonna get executed? Where the fuck did you get that idea? Shut up, I said, turning red at my mistake. You really wanted to screw around one last time, huh? You guys really made this whole thing sound horrible and beyond repair- It is horrible. The demon disrupted the balance of the universe and messed with your timeline, which will take some time to get back to normal. Mouth-Daniel interrupted. You made it sound horrible enough for an execution. I retorted. How am I supposed to know what punishments fit the crime in your book? Mouth-Daniel interrupted again; higher beings really needed to learn some manners. All I want to know is, why? Why would you want to confine yourself to a mortal life, escape trial, rather than face a sentence that would be more of an inconvenience than an execution? Instead, you chose to take the more difficult route and avoid your responsibilities. All we do down there is torture souls and eat humans. It gets old after a couple of centuries and I got bored. I wanted to try something new, is that so bad? Hector shrugged. By doing this, you have singlehandedly upset the already tedious balance between us and the humans and exposed their world to even more calamities from Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. You have potentially shortened and lengthened Finn Conways lifespan to ridiculous degrees by making him aware of our worlds and vice versa. Hector was silent for a moment. Well, when you put it that way it does sound pretty bad enough for an execution. And I must remind you that you will still be held accountable for the- Yeah, I know. Soul to Purgatory bad. Torture souls forever good. Hector sarcastically drawled. The Daniels nodded, and took off their hoods. They all simultaneously turned into human Daniels again. We will be waiting outside this building for you. We will take another portal back to Hell; this one will be eradicated. Daniel walked over to where Amy had carved the summoning circle into the floor and put his palm over the grooved ridges. In one smooth swipe, the circle disappeared, and the wood was back to normal- before Amy defiled it with her insanity. With his other palm, Daniel produced a small black duffel bag which he threw onto Hectors lap. Please pack lightly, and only what you need. We will see you in no more than fifteen minutes. With that, all of the Daniels walked out of the apartment. I debated telling them how weird it looked that they were all essentially the same person in different clothes, but figured people would just pass them off as quintuplets or something. They were the least of my concerns in that moment. Well. Hector got up once the restraints melted off his wrists. He stretched his back and yawned. Its been a great run. Sorry you have to find another roommate again. You can keep whatevers left of the fake exorcism money, I dont need it where Im going. Hector rummaged around the apartment. So thats it? I said. You're really leaving? Just like this? Not cause I want to, obviously. But you heard the eyeballs. I gotta blast. Theres no point in running anymore, they have me cornered and d rather just deal with this shit now before it gets any worse. Guess that means I have to find another place. I murmured. Now that theres no stalker following me where I live, I dont have to live with a roommate out of fear for my life anymore. And hey, the lease will end soon, so I wouldnt be breaking any contracts. I realized the irony of my statement shortly after I said it. Hey, at least one of us benefitted from this, right? Hector commented. He seemed to ponder what to bring back and contemplated the amount of room he had in his small bag. He ended up only packing his fryer and the fried chicken I brought back into the duffel bag he was provided. Those were the only things that he wanted to take back to Hell before his trial. Knowing it was the last of his things made me feel a pang of guilt. I crossed my arms. If the trial goes well, will I ever see you again? I asked. The strange feeling of sadness was beginning to set in; though these has been the wildest weeks I had been through in my entire life, I knew that I would feel a void where Hector and his strange fried-chicken loving self were. And I had to admit, Hector grew on me in the short time we had together. No, probably not. Im most likely going to be confined to torture duty for at least a couple centuries for what I did. he said. I looked downcast, and Hector laughed. Kidding, kidding! Im telling you, its no big deal. Youre definitely going to see me again. Hector assured. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. The trials not gonna be that bad. At least, I hope. Im really hoping Ill only be held accountable for what my crimes back down in Hell. If I get a good enough lawyer to represent me theyll be able to sleaze the contract into freeing me from any crimes committed while with you. I guess I looked unconvinced, because Hector continued on with his explanation. He put a hand on my shoulder in a reassuring manner. Look at it this way, man. Were contractually bound until you die. It might be a while, but Ill see you again. We have no cell service in Hell, though, so if I do visit its gonna have to be a surprise. Alright. I took his words and chose to trust that we would eventually cross paths again. I uncrossed my arms and stuck my hand out for Hector to shake. Until next time, then? Hector glanced at my hand, grabbed it, and pulled me into the most awkward and clumsy hug that I had ever experienced. I was surprised, to say in the least; I had never seen Hector do anything that could have been considered remotely affectionate so this was strange to me. Hector pat my back tensely, clearly uncomfortable by the gesture that he initiated. This is weird. Hugs are weird. He let go, and Hector rubbed his neck nervously- a habit he picked up from me. I saw that people hug in TV when leaving each other for a long time but now that Ive tried it, I have no idea why. It just makes things sadder, and this isn't even the end of things. I nodded in agreement, amused by his discomfort at a simple hug, especially considering hes done worse things. Hector zipped up his duffle bag, and I gazed at the immaculate floorboards where the summoning circle once was. To think all of this happened because I was careless and put my information online for my stalker to find; as an IT guy I really should have known better. But my carelessness led to meeting Hector, learning more about the universe than ever, and having weird misadventures with otherworldly creatures in my otherwise boring, law-abiding life. And I managed to stay sane and alive through all of it. If I could have done it all again, I wouldnt have changed a thing- except maybe my stupid username from the game, MrPeanutButter26. Thanks for everything, Finn. I really had a great time here. You know, for a human, you werent that bad. Hector smiled at me. Despite his words, his smile felt incredibly sincere this time around, and it was a shame that the one time he showed human-like vulnerability, it was because he was leaving for an unknown amount of time. Ill see you around, Hector. I said, smiling back. ""And Hector?"" ""Yeah?"" ""Sorry for...you know. Saying I wouldn't have ever went through this stuff if you weren't here. You've been through a lot, and that was selfish of me to say, especially when you saved my life. Even though you caused it, I guess. My life's been more exciting than it's ever been since you came. And I don't want you to leave thinking I hated you."" ""Apology accepted. I knew you didn't hate me, you worry about the weirdest shit."" I rolled my eyes. Hector took one last look around the apartment, and then at me before closing the door gently behind him. I heard the rustle of his duffle hitting his leg as he walked away into the hallway, until I heard nothing else but silence. In a nutshell, I had a really strange time with Hector, but it was exciting nonetheless. I dont know when hell come back and how hell manage to stay out of trouble, but I knew he would figure out a way somehow. And when he did, I would treat him to more fried chicken places- maybe even take him on a trip to Louisiana so he can get some of that genuine fried chicken experience. I have a feeling this isnt the end of our encounters with one another, and despite everything, Im glad I met Hector. His fried-chicken loving presence is always welcome at my place, wherever I end up moving to. Thanks for following me in my strange misadventures, guys. I promise Ill keep you updated if Hector ever visits again, and when he does I'm sure strange happenings will follow once more."
118,vulnerability,nosleep,The Dimension of Sleep,1,a7bbv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a7bbv6/the_dimension_of_sleep/,2018-12-19 01:05:03,"Vulnerability. Something we all strive never to be. It means that we are open for attack. It is something that we, as humans, can almost sense about ourselves. It's that feeling that you get when you're in the wrong part of town and someone is walking behind you. It's when you're out in the woods when night falls and you don't know your way out. It's the feeling you get when you tell the girl that you've had a crush on since the 7th grade the way you feel about her and she hasn't answered you yet. It's very uncomfortable, and comfort is something we're always searching for. &amp;#x200B; The common theme with all of these examples \]that were just given is that they all are avoidable. You don't usually HAVE to be in the woods when night falls, you can usually stay away from the bad part of town, and you don't have to take the leap and put yourself out there to a person you're interested in if you don't want to. Bravery goes hand in hand with vulnerability. When we go against our natural feelings of dread or anxiety, its called bravery. We see it everyday. We celebrate it. But what happens when we aren't in the position to choose between vulnerability or bravery? It doesn't feel good to not be in control, but even the bravest of the brave are vulnerable for one third of their lives. It happens every night when we drift off to sleep. &amp;#x200B; Vinny Regoni opened the door to his early 2000's model Chevy S-10. He had just left another session with his psychologist in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Being a blue collar guy from Pittsburgh, he didn't have much money to use for any kind of medical attention unless it was an emergency. Four straight days of twelve hour work days with no sleep had gotten to him again. Feeling like a zombie everyday at work was starting to get him in trouble. It's not very safe to work at a foundry and not have all of your wits about you. &amp;#x200B; Vinny had sleeping problems all of his life. This lack of sleep had resulted in many different problems during his childhood and throughout high school. His physical development was stunted due to the stress that not getting the right amount of rest causes. His grades had always been subpar from Kindergarten on to his senior year of high school. This knocked any chances of him going to college save for some classes at the community college, and with graduates of Ivy League schools are having trouble for work, it didn't bode well for Vinny. He knew, as his parents did too, that he would be doing some sort of manual labor for the rest of his life. &amp;#x200B; Because of Vinny's inability to sleep properly, he tried to self medicate with sleeping pills and opiates. The opiates seemed to help out all of the problems that he had. Including his anti-social tendencies. Allowing him to talk to people more easily and fall asleep every now and then. His self medicating grew into a habit and at the age of 22 he had to attend a drug rehabilitation center. Before his bad habits turned into addiction though, Vinny was able to go on a few dates with a few different women. One of them turning into a longer term relationship. Other than his family, she was the only other person in the world that he had feelings for. The only one that made him happy when he had forgotten what happiness was. Her name was Tiffany. &amp;#x200B; Prior to Tiffany, Vinny didn't have a reason to get better. She was the one that got him to finally admit that he had a problem that needed fixed and that it would all be ok because she would be waiting for him on the other side so that they could start a life together. So for Vinny, going to rehab was a very easy decision, and after 30 odd days, he was clean and sober. &amp;#x200B; After rehab, they moved in together after finding an apartment to rent in a building overlooking the Ohio River. It was an old red building in a river town called Monaca, about 25 miles outside of downtown Pittsburgh. It was very close to the foundry that he worked in and was an easy drive for Tiffany to get to UPMC in the Oakland neighborhood of the city where she was a nurse. After getting everything moved in, Vinny started attending AA meetings to maintain his sobriety. They were living a basic, normal life and were completely content with it. Everything was great for the couple, but when night fell, a feeling of foreboding came over them both as soon as they lay their heads down onto the pillow to sleep. &amp;#x200B; The reason for Vinny's insomnia was caused by sleep paralysis. It was the reason he couldn't sleep as a boy, and it's the reason he can't sleep now. The drugs had been able to make him go to sleep and not have think about the events that had happened to him throughout his life when he was stuck to his bed with no control, but now after the drugs, the episodes were much more frequent and much scarier than they had ever been before. It was almost as if whatever had been coming to him in the night was angry that it wasn't able to cause the panic and fear it so loved to give Vinny before he started using. Now, with Vinny's new found sobriety, it could get it's revenge. &amp;#x200B; Before his problems with drugs, Vinny's sleep paralysis episodes were mainly auditory. He would hear strange sounds like whispering voices in the room, or scratching on the walls or floor next to him. Sometimes, if he fell asleep on his side, he would feel like someone or something was right behind him. Panic would then set in and begged his body to do something about it but this was impossible. Even with all of his might, he could not move at all. Sometimes he tried to flip around and attack whatever it was behind him, and other times whatever was behind him only made him want to jump out of the bed and run full speed straight out the front door. That was the worst of it. Although extremely scary, it was able to live your life. Things were different now however. &amp;#x200B; Since Vinny has been clean, the sleep paralysis episodes were getting worse and worse. It was no longer just hearing things in the room. He was now seeing things. Horrible, ungodly, otherworldly beings. These beings sometimes looked like what he thought would be an alien, and other times demons. The alien beings looked the same when they visited him in his bed. They looked like the ""gray alien"" forms that people have been reporting since the mid 1940's. The demons, on the other hand, came in different forms. They even seemed to have a hierarchy governing them. Sometimes it would be a larger demonic being with smaller minion demons with him. The demons would often be alone though, but the aliens always came in a group of two or three. &amp;#x200B; It had been two days since the last time Vinny actually got any sleep. He had been laying in bed looking at the ceiling, too scared to drift off. Sometimes the TV would help him sleep more peacefully, or at least pass the time when he couldn't sleep, but he didn't often turn it on because he didn't want to disturb Tiffany. &amp;#x200B; Tiffany arrived home from work at around 11:30 pm after a long, tough, afternoon 3-11 shift. She was in the middle of a split shift and had to be back to the hospital at 7 am, so needless to say she was very tired. She was worrying about Vinny a lot in the past two days because she seen that he was fighting sleep even more than usual. She told him that she understands, but that he really needed to go to bed with her and try to get at least a few hours. Vinny hesitantly agreed with her and after finishing up their pre bedtime routines, they slipped into bed to which Tiffany fell asleep almost instantly. Vinny convinced himself to not fight it that night and reluctantly shut his eyes. &amp;#x200B; A few hours into the night, around 2:30 am, Vinny's eyes sprung open. He could hear something in the corner of the room but couldn't see anything. He tried to move his arm, his leg, his hand, his finger, but nothing moved at all. It was then that what was in the room started to come into view. A skinny, distorted, black figure was sticking to the wall and ceiling in the right side of their room. It was completely black, like the darkest shadow you've ever seen and had almost no discernable features except for on it's face. Its face looked a lot like what a witch is commonly described as. Like the wicked witch of the west on the Wizard of Oz except with a longer, more gnarled nose and a smile that showed broken, yellow and black, teeth inside of a smile that reached from the outside of each eyeball making the smile look like it was about a foot and a half in length. It's eyes, soulless and jet black. Blacker than the pits of Hell where it most likely came from. &amp;#x200B; It stayed in the same spot staring at him for what seemed like an eternity. One twisted hand lay flat on the ceiling above while the other hand and its two feet were on the walls. Vinny was in absolute panic and filled with a hopeless fear that was impossible to explain to somebody unless they had actually went through it themselves. It then began to move. Each movement it made sounded like bones cracking and rubbing against each other inside of its body. Click, clack, click, clack, click, clack. Each move it made was quick and jerky. As it moved onto the wall directly in front of him, its neck began to crack and stretch out straight at Vinny's face jerking, clicking, and clacking the whole time. Its face was only about a half a foot away from Vinny's while the rest of the body still stuck to the wall. Vinny was pulling together every ounce of strength that he had in his body to try and mount a counter attack but to no avail. He was paralyzed. He was vulnerable. &amp;#x200B; Still only six inches from Vinny's face, the hag began to open its foul, stinking, black, disgusting mouth. As it did so a gurgling sound was coming from its mouth. It kept opening until its mouth was large enough to fit Vinny's entire head within it. A long black, tongue with open sores all over it, came out of the hag's mouth and with the tip of it, put it inside Vinny's left nostril. Vinny could actually FEEL this. Like physically FEEL it! He began to hyperventilate as tears ran down either side of his face. Tiffany, hearing Vinny's breathing, woke up. As soon as she moved her head, the hag hissed and darted out the bedroom door. Tiffany then shook Vinny a bit which allowed his body to get in line with his brain and wake up. &amp;#x200B; As soon as he was able to move, Vinny pushed his body up to the head of the bed, put his arms around his bent legs, put his head in between his knees, and rocked back and fourth crying. Tiffany had no idea what to do at this point so she did what she did best and comforted him. She didn't want to tell him that she had seen something dart out of the room as she woke up. She was terrified by this, but didn't let it show, knowing that this was very much the wrong place and time to talk about what that was all about. So she put her arms around him, rubbed his back and head, and told him that it's all ok now. That nothing can hurt him right now. Needless to say, Vinny did not go back to sleep that night. &amp;#x200B; Morning came and neither Vinny or Tiffany could get the events of the night before out of their heads, although neither of them were wanting, or willing, to bring it up. &amp;#x200B; The day came and went. Night had fallen and Vinny's anxiety rose. It was as if the darker it got, the more anxiety he began to have. He wasn't afraid of the dark, or anything like that, it's just that the closer it got to bedtime, and what happened the night before, he had a damn good reason for it. &amp;#x200B; It was time for bed again, leaving both Vinny and Tiffany in anything but a peaceful and relaxing mood. The hag that had tormented him the night before was still fresh in his mind. The way that it had happened had something different about it too. It felt more real. There was more detail to the demonic thing that had been stuck to the upper corner of their room. Vinny was even able to smell the hag. A rotten, twelve day old dead flesh in the heat of the summer smell. As if her gut had rotted, expanded, and exploded. He could actually smell the evil. He prayed to God that that was the very worst it would get, but that prayer must have gotten lost in the mail. &amp;#x200B; It was difficult for either of them to get to the point where they could fall asleep. Their bodies were screaming for sleep, but their minds were ignoring the body's plea. After a while though their bodies started winning the battle and they both slipped off to sleep. &amp;#x200B; After feeling like only minutes had passed something jolted Vinny awake, or somewhere in between awake and sleep, depending on your definition of the word. &amp;#x200B; He immediately knew that something was very wrong. He couldn't move, not even an inch, as usual, but this time the feeling of panic that he was experiencing was amped up to a level that he had previously believed was impossible to get to. Directly in front of him was a huge demon. Vinny knew that this was much, much different than ever before. He knew right away that whatever this was, whether you call it sleep paralysis or dreaming, or whatever, was nothing of the sort. He knew now, that this was real. Very...very...real. &amp;#x200B; The demon stood there with it's scaly, hairy, hands hanging down to its side. They only had three digits, each with a knife like appendage coming off of each where a fingernail might be. It's body was not solid, but swirled as if it were a whirlpool of sheer black tar. It was like a black hole event horizon, able to suck anything the demon wished right through. It had the head of a ram, but with eyes so evil looking that it was almost as if just looking into them too long would kill you with dread alone. It's massive horns had a dark mist coming from them that seemed too dance a damning dance on top of it's unholy head. He immediately got the feeling that he was looking at the exact opposite of God. &amp;#x200B; Tears rolled down Vinny's face in a constant stream. It was the only part of him that he could ""move"". The demon's arms rose out to his sides while it's demonic, disgusting head looked upwards and a whispering could be heard throughout the room from every angle. Vinny could feel a pressure start to build all around his body as the whispering got louder and louder. The stench of death was heavy and sickening. It made Vinny start to vomit all over his chest. He was still completely immobile. The whispering was now thunderous, and deafening. It was intelligible. &amp;#x200B; The only comfort he was afforded was knowing that at least Tiffany was not having to deal with what was going on right in front of their bed right now. Still unable to move any part of his body except his eyes, he strained to look over to his right to assure him that she was in fact ok. Tiffany's eyes were wide opened though. She was looking directly at the massive beast in front of her. Vinny could see something else that made him vomit again just from absolute, sickening dread. An imp like creature, completely jet black as if it were a three-dimensional shadow, had her head between it's two long fingered hands as if to make sure that she couldn't look at anything other than the beast at the bottom of their bed. &amp;#x200B; Vinny started cry uncontrollably, he was unable to make any sounds, or even move his mouth, but his tears were flowing like the Allegheny River after a torrential down pour. He was completely helpless, and because he was, so was she. &amp;#x200B; It was hard to explain the booming sound in the room as a whisper, but there's really no other words to describe it. As it got even louder, the demon's body began swirling faster, and faster. It then started to grow outwards from the middle of it's chest and immediately enveloped the room. &amp;#x200B; Vinny now had control of his body again. He could move his arms, legs, and head now. He was no longer in his room though. Al he could see, all around him, was the blackest of the darkest shades of the darkest black. He was staring at nothing at all. An absolute, unfathomable nothingness. There was no longer any light, no sounds, no...nothing! It was at this point that he noticed that he was only able to move head a tiny bit from side to side, but was unable to move it upwards. He tried to sit up but he couldn't. He tried to lift his hands up over his head, but his knuckles smacked into something hard only an inch or two above him. He tried kicking his legs, but when he tried to lift it, his toes hit something hard a couple of inches above them also. &amp;#x200B; He was in a box! A dark, cold, solid box of nothingness that allowed him to move, but only enough to make him understand that he could do nothing to release himself. A feeling of absolute hopelessness, despair, and panic filled his entire soul. It was as if he was buried alive, but in an even smaller box than a coffin! He tried to scream for help, but nothing came out! Nothing at all! It was then that he noticed that he couldn't hear anything at all. Not even when he scratched at the bottom of whatever hellish device he was in. The demon had taken all of his senses. Vinny was trapped in another dimension in which no one would ever be able to find him for the rest of eternity. He didn't know what the fate of Tiffany was either, so as far as he knew, she was floating around in a box of no senses also. He had no way to know, but even though she watched as Vinny got sucked into the chest of the demon, she was spared the same fate. The experience broke her mind though, and all she could do was repeat the word ""whisper"" over and over again. &amp;#x200B; Vinny was lost. As all of the hopelessness ate away at his soul, his fate actually got one step worse. He could hardly breathe. The oxygen, or whatever he was breathing, was only enough to keep him alive. Each breath had to be sucked in as if he was being choked, but not hard enough to kill him. It felt as if his eyes were going to explode in his head. He thought to himself, is this it?! Am I going to die?! &amp;#x200B; He was able to hear one more thing before everything went silent again. It was the booming whispering of the demon. ""You have already died, and in your current state, you shall stay for all eternity..."" the demon said. &amp;#x200B; Vinny screamed for help, but silence again washed over him. This is where he will stay, unable to move but a few inches, not able to make any sounds, and working to suck in each and every breath...for ever and ever."
119,vulnerability,nosleep,Darkness- Awakening,1,aa5ejb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/aa5ejb/darkness_awakening/,2018-12-28 12:14:38," My eyes open. Pain shoots through my body as conciseness overtakes my slumber like an out-of-control fire. Everything hurts, yet, I see nothing. My muscles convulse as I try to move, to stretch, to flex, something that will break the spell that has transfixed my still vessel. As blood flows back to its proper station, I am on pins and needles. I sit up and strain my eyes into the darkness of the room. Am I dead? Is this the deepest part of hell where not even light can touch its sucking maw. My left leg limply falls to one side and dangles, as if suspended off a dock or in this case off a chasm that keeps going down and down and down with no bottom in sight. I kick my foot out, it falls back and my heel hits the side of the podium on which I had awoken. A metallic CLANG echoes into my ears, proving that my auditory senses are working. I rub my hands all over my naked body, doing a tangent inventory of myself to make sure I am whole. Head; check. Ears: working, check. Eyes: check. Nose; check. Mouth; check. Teeth; check. Arms; check. Genitals; (thank god) check. Legs: check. I wiggle all my fingers and toes until lI have full circulation. The pain dulls as I stretch out and move as much as I dare so as to not fall off of the unseen podium on which I sit. I kick my other leg over and let it hang, like Im a small child whos feet don't touch the ground when sitting at the dinner table. Fuck, how far down is the ground? I think out loud as my words echo in the darkness. My throat burns as I croak out the words. I wince and rub my throat. I spit between my legs and sigh in relief as I hear the viscous glob of saliva hit the floor in less then a second. I grasp the cold metal of my platform as I lower my feet onto the floor. I inhale sharply as my toes touch the wet steel floor. Still holding what I now reckoned to be a metal table for balance, I shift most of my weight to my feet and stand as straight as I can. I breath deeply as my legs recover from their paresthesia, moving them ever so slightly as the pins and needles fade away and my muscles return to normal functions. Trembling, I take a step into the darkness, and then another and then another, my arms straight out in front of me in fear of running head-first into a wall. I shudder as a cacophony of thoughts swarm my mind. What if there are no walls? What if Im outside and the sun was extinguished? What if Im blind? What If I really am dead? I gasp loudly, at first in shock and then relief as my hands make contact with a wall. I inspect it with my fingers. The wall is cold, metal and rusted in some places. I run my hands along the gritty surface as I follow the wall to my right, praying to find a door or a window or something, anything to get me out of this damned room. I hear something scurry though a puddle a few feet behind me. I shudder and move faster along the wall, more desperate then ever to find a way out. A brief laugh escapes my mouth as I feel the wall change. I feel around the new space meticulously until I find it. The shape of a wheel forms in my minds eye as I grasp it firmly and push. When pushing the wheel fails, I deduct that perhaps the most reasonable thing to do would be to turn the wheel, opposed to pushing on it. The wheel lets out a shrill squeak as I turn it with all my might. As I feel the trundle slacken, I push open what I now know to be a hatch and bathe the vestibule that until then had confined me in harsh sunlight. My victory of escaping the room was short lived as I crouched with my head in my hands, blinded by the sudden light like I witness to a nuclear blast. I move my hands from my face and squint my eyes at the ground. I strain as the sight of my toes on a metal floor come into focus. I take a deep breath as I slowly raise my head and take in my surroundings for the first time. I stand alone on the deck of a dilapidated ship, long worn from weather and neglect. I tentatively walk to the bow of the ship, my head on a swivel, scanning for any potential threats. As I reach the forepart of the vessel, one that I have identified as a coastguard cutter, I examine the horizon. The high sun in the sky assured me that I had a few hours of daylight left, cringing at the thought of being alone in the dark once more. The ship was beached, or more appropriately run aground on a thin beach of pale sand that stretched on without any sign of an end in either direction. Where the sand ended, a thick weald loomed, giving no token of being inhabited by the likes of anything but a few birds that had built their nests in the tall trees. The cutter was unremarkable. At about 20 meters in length and silent, I doubted that she was sea-worthy. Was this why the crew had jumped ship? Had the cutters disrepair caused its original party to take to the land and leave her to be reclaimed by nature? As I explore the vessel to a greater length I find that nature had indeed intended to claim the craft. Birds, rats and other undesirable stowaways had colonized the once powerful skiff, now still forever. The dark, wet innards of the ship are the perfect breeding ground for rats and almost every other vile creature partial to both water and darkness. At the discretion of meeting one or some of these creatures face to face, I peeked my head into the room from whence I had emerged minutes earlier, now illuminated by the sunlight shining through the open portal. On the wall adjacent to the hatch, a row of tall personal lockers stood unmolested, no doubt accredited to their purpose to be able to fare rough seas and not come ajar. The containers were your typical military style lockers with the letters M.S.R.T. stenciled on them in large black letters.The rooms former means of illumination was a long perished light bulb at the center of the room, an assortment of broken glass laying beneath the socket that once housed it. To the left of the room was the table I awoke on. The table was one of a seemingly medical purpose. Stainless steel and bolted to the deck, I could imagine it being used to treat infirm sailors or castaways saved from a watery grave. But why had I been on the table? Was I one of the irresolute mariners that I pictured in my head? If so, what was wrong with me? I shook the thoughts away and took a deep breath. Too much thinking like that and I was fearful of inflicting a panic attack upon myself. I focused at the task at hand and turned my attention back to the room. The rest of the dim space was unremarkable and only inhabited by a few miscellaneous pieces of furniture strewn around the deck with the rest of the wet debris . I stepped into the alcove and made my way to the lockers on the far side, no longer intimidated by the space now that I could see. I began to jostle the locks of the containers, hoping for one of the locks to follow the example of the rest of the ship and just fall apart. Unfortunately, this did not prove fruitful. None of the locks were in such poor condition that I could will them to crumble in my hands. My blood pressure slowly rose as I checked each lock before finally spotting a compartment not donning a padlock. The door of the locker made a loud clang as I opened it, consternating a family of fat black rats who had made a nest in the receptacle. I jumped out of the way as the vermin darted from the locker to one of the darker corners of the room and then out of sight. Much of the lockers contents were well worked over by rot, mold, rats or all three and were therefore unsalvageable. A puddle of dark, stagnant water occupied the bottom of the locker, rendering any items within the waters confines either rusted or decayed. To the credit of the vault, the clothing rack and shelf near the top of the container had suspended a few items high enough to keep reasonably dry and clear of blight. The cargo that I was able to scavenge was hardly the treasure I was hoping for, but did have their uses. Among my new positions were a pair of blue cargo pants, a hand-held radio, its batteries corroded beyond use, a multitool, a pair of canvas and leather gloves, a pair of sunglasses, a rubber water bladder, two 9mm Beretta magazines with a capacity of 15 rounds each, three 30 round M4 magazines, 12 green chemlights and a Black duffle bag. I loaded the meager supplies into the bag and pulled the cargo pants over my naked legs and buttoned them at the waist, not exactly my size, but they will do in a pinch. As I stepped back onto the freeboard, donning my new gear, I almost laughed at the thought of how silly I must look, but stifled it due to my thankfulness that I was no longer stark naked. It is surprising how much confidence one can gain from simply covering ones self, or on the other hand how nudeness can present one with such a feeling of vulnerability. Though I was partially dressed, I was under no illusion of indemnity, for the sun was setting faster then I had previously anticipated and I was still the sole occupant of the ghost ship. I trade back up to the bow of the ship and set my attention to the sands below. The tides had long washed away any spore of the missing mariners, making it impossible to say weather or not the crew had abandoned ship before or after she ran aground. Knowing that If I jumped from the bow of the cutter to the sands below I would risk injury and not willing to chance getting my equipment wet, I searched around for something I could use to lower myself safely onto dry land and away from the stinking rust pot. After reviewing the cutters deck for a useful implement, I settled for a length of rope attached to a flotation ring, inscribed in black and orange U.S.C.G.C. SEA FOX. Looping a figure-eight around one of the cleats on the deck, I tossed the remaining length of line off the starboard bow, the ring landing on the sand with a soft thud. I put my arms through the straps of the duffle like an awkward backpack and swung my legs over the side, grasping the rope firmly as I lowered myself onto land. Okay now what? I asked myself, probably more for the comfort of hearing my own voice then anything. I was still very disoriented and I needed to find some clean water. Who knows how long its been since I hydrated, I know that I didnt. What I did know is that without water, Im not going to get very far. I looked up and down the beach, trying to find any evidence of fresh water or other people who could assist me in my confused disposition, I saw neither from my vantage point by the Sea Fox. I then turned my attention to the woods. The way I figured it, I was much more likely to find a small creek with fresh water in the woods then I was to find anything on that godforsaken coast. I grunted and looked down at my bare feet, as I am not partial to walking through foliage without anything to protect my toes from nature, but I walked along all the same. The change in scenery was a welcome one, for some reason the woods made me feel safer then I did on the beach or even on the cutter for that matter. I let my mind wonder as I listened to the birds sing to each other in the trees high above me. I had so many unanswered questions and nobody around to answer them. Opposed to thinking about what I didnt know, I tried to focus on what I did know. I woke up alone on an abandoned coast guard vessel and now Im walking through the woods to find water. It doesnt matter if I didnt know who or where I was. It didnt matter that I dont know where anyone else is. It didnt matter that I could have an unknown affliction, silently plaguing my vessel at that moment. All that mattered was that I was walking through the woods in search of water. I used that as my mantra as I continued to trek deeper into the wilderness. Before I knew it the sounds of the birds and the echoes of my thoughts were harmonious with the sound of running water nearby. I found the runnel about 25 meters to my 10 oclock and moved eagerly towards it. Once examined, I deducted that this creek was most likely a tributary to the ocean from some unseen topographical incline, hill or mountain. The clear water was moving quickly through the orgy of rocks littered throughout the rivulet. Convinced of its sanitary integrity, I drank gluttonously until my stomach swelled and nausea rose in my throat. I then filled up the bladder in my duffle bag and thought about my next moves. Leaning back on a large tree, I tried to think up my next best options. I could follow the stream up to its source, which may or may not be runoff from a dangerous peak. I could keep walking straight through the woods (North-West judging by the position of the sun) and hope to run into someone who can help me and maybe answer some of my questions. I could go back to the coast and try to flag a boat down or find a town? I took a deep breath, and focused, my thoughts not nearly as jumbled now that I am hydrated. I know that the Sea Fox was a US coast guard ship, so logically I am most likely in the United States. The fact that the ocean was to the east, makes me confident that I am on the east coast of the United States. Judging by the humidity and the full bloom of the conifer trees, I decided that I was in fact on the South East coast of the United States, Florida, Georgia or South Carolina, very hard to be sure. I stopped thinking. How did I know all this? How can I tell where I am on the globe from looking at the sun and the trees and the ocean, but I dont even remember who I am? Decidedly, who I was still wasnt the most important thing to worry about. The sun was setting and I was no closer to finding civilization. I stood up and collected my gear. My plan was too keep heading inland and hopefully make some human contact. The conifers creaked in the wind as I silently hiked through the wilderness, the noisy Birds as my only companions. Hours passed and the air grew cooler as the sun provided increasingly less illumination as it set past the trees. I followed the dying light until it disappeared and I was again left alone in the darkness. Trying to navigate the southern woods at night made me feel like a runaway slave trying to find his way to freedom. I silently trod on through the forrest, listening hard for any familiar human sounds. It was hours until the sound of a vehicle engine blessed me with its distant tone. Soon after I found the road. The road was a thin two lane parkway, its asphalt old and heavy worn, stretching on straight as far as I could see on either direction. This is where I made my decision to travel north opposed to taking the chance and running in to the ocean again if I took the more southern route. The tall trees loomed over the road like a tunnel of darkness that even my well-adjusted eyes had trouble decrypting. For hours I tracked through this dark tunnel, seeing no sign or token of any man for man-made Device save from the asphalt road. I decided to rest until morning in some tall, dry grass a few meters from the road in a small clearing, with high hopes of being roused by a passing vehicle. my sleep was not a peaceful one, it was plagued with queer dreams of dank passageways in some apparent subterranean conurbation. Sight was the only sense I possessed in this incubus, leaving me unbalanced and dumb. I was not alone in these tunnels for I can make out the animate shapes of strange creatures passing about in the dark passage, These creatures, though hideous to gaze upon did not frighten me, nor did they make any attempt to molest me as I moved about them, seemingly unnoticed. The creatures were incomparable to any recorded animal on earth. They were roughly 10 feet tall with conular bodies with a head and several tendrils spouting from the apex, each about four feet in length and seemed to slide about on a layer of slime produced from their abdomens like giant slugs. It seemed I explored these tunnels and walked amongst these creatures for hours before I woke and returned to the conciouse world. my Slumber was ended very abruptly with a pain in my side. I opened my eyes to the early morning sky, still a dark blue with the sun soon to fully arrive. once again, I was not alone and my gaze was met by the stern face of a police officer, obviously disgusted with the vagrant laying half nude before him. I opened my mouth in surprise and joy with the anticipation of my rescue but the words that left my mouth were not my own, nor were they English. phnglu mglwnafh Cthulhu Rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn were the jumble of noises projected by my hijacked vocal chords, followed by a concoction of both blood and vomitus from my gaping mouth. Then the world darkened once again as I slipped into a merciful analgesia. ***Chapter 1*** Awakening again, this time not in a foul darkness but in a ray of abrasive Florissant light, I gasp for breath and lift my arm to shield my sensitive eyes from the harsh illumination. Once agin I have found myself in a strange room without recollection of the terms of my arrival, but this time I was not alone. I sensed the presence of the other man before I sat up to meet his gaze. The man was tall, perhaps over 75 inches, with sharp features and beady eyes, eyes that shone with fear, no doubt triggered by my vivification. The man wore no shoes nor belt and his basic garments held the suggestion of a police uniform. He sat on the ground on the opposite side of the small room with his back to the corner, no doubt in an effort to be as far away as possible. I recognized this man as the very same peace officer who had discovered me by the side of the road. How long ago was that? Where am I now? Just what the fuck is going on. The man stared at me, his eyes wide and blood shot, but made no effort to speak or gesture to me in any way. He just sat there, his unsettling, mad gaze never faltering from me. the room its self was square, with one metal door without a means of opening from my side and no windows. The walls were all covered with plastic sheets and encompassed everything from the floor, to the door and was even secured around the one rectangular light fixture that illuminated the room, hanging a foot or so from the rooms ceiling. I dont know how much time passed, maybe hours maybe days. There was no food in the room only a 5 gallon bucket for body waste and another full of discolored water that tasted of iodine. How do I know what Iodine tastes like? I shook off this question. I pushed myself into a meditative trance and cleared my mind, If I didnt keep an even head I feared I would end up like the rooms only other occupant, the man in the police uniform, apparently mad and possibly mute. The light clicked off with an audible CLICK and the small room was plunged into darkness. The man began to shriek wildly from his corner of the room, the first noise admitted from him during my tenure in the compartment. I jumped to my feet and put my back to the wall, ready to defend myself if assaulted in the darkness. The mans screams continued for numerous minutes until they subsided into hoarse wails and eventually soft pitiful weeping. Judging from the sounds of the broken man in the room, I inferred that he had not moved from his original spot, comforted little by this inference I did not let my guard down as I strained my eyes against the blackness, desperate to see something. My heart pounded in my chest and I could have sworn that I could hear its soft rhythmic beats over the sound of the pathetic sobs. the beats got louder. and soon lost cadence with my pulse. The noise I was hearing was not my heart at all, but the sound of something outside the door, still rhythmic and getting louder. Something was coming. My companion seemed to take no notice of the sounds, nor did he change his sobbing as I started to move along the plastic coated wall towards the metal door. As I reached the door the sounds from the exterior stopped. I pressed my ear to the door, listing intently for any evidence of the strange noise. CLICK the door opened outward and I stumbled into blinding light, falling on hard, damp concrete outside. Still blind, I tried to get to my feet but was grabbed by two sets of hands and pushed roughly back into the dark room. I let out a surprised cry as I fell back on my ass facing the now open door. My vision returned quickly, and I watched as two men in woodland pattern MOPP suits entered with LED mounted rifles at the ready. They began shouting nearly inaudible orders through their gas masks, and when I did not comply one of the men kicked me in the chest and I fell on my back on the plastic sheets that covered the floor as the other man quickly approached the now frantic and terrified man at the opposite side of the room, his rifle trained on his chest. The man who kicked me yelled trough his protective mask once again and I perceived his words to be TURN OVER!. I did as he said and rolled onto my stomach. He quickly dug his knee into my back and secured my hands behind me with thick zip-ties while his partner struggled to subdue the thrashing lunatic whos screams had now come to a fever pitch. I watched from my prone position on the floor as one of the men in the MOPP suits butt stroked the pitiful lunatics face with the back of his AK-47. I heard and sickening crunch as a guiser of blood exploded from the mans nose and he feel back to the floor, limp. He was then also zip-tied and put in the same prone position I was. The over-head light clicked back on as another man in MOPP 4 walked in, unarmed save for a black polymer case, perhaps the size of a laptop computer. He initially took no notice of me and walked straight to the unconciuse, bloody man laying only a few meters to my left. He set the case down on the ground and unsnapped the latches. He then removed a small flashlight and held it like a pencil in his right hand as he touched the bloody face with his left, examine the damage. The masked examiner then removed a small bottle of liquid from his case and poured it over the still mans broken nose, making a sick red puddle on the plastic sheet beneath his head. his face now significantly clean of blood save for a steady trickle that came from his nostrils and ran down his lips like a tiny scarlet stream. the examiner lifted the policemans eye lids and shown his small light into his pupils. He then turned to the armed sentinels and shook his head. One of them men quickly dragged his limp body out of the room by his legs, leaving a thin smear of blood in his wake. I never saw him again. The examiner then turned his attention towards me and I was brought to my knees facing away from the door. Like my late companion, he checked my eyes but gave no signal to the other masked man whos rifle was still trained on my back. He then checked my mouth and my skin thoroughly. once finished he put his flash light in a ziplock bag and placed it back in his black case. He left without a word. A black cloth bag was placed over my head as I was forced to my feet and dragged out of the room. I tried to walk but the pace the men kept was much too brisk and my lags seemed weak and sore. the cement floor turned to gravel and then grass beneath my feet. I heard the chirping of birds, whippoorwills to be precise and felt a breeze on my still partially naked body. I was pulled blindly for some distance before I was pushed down into a metal chair, my hands still secured tightly behind me. the bag was removed and I blinked hard, trying to regain focus. The sun was high in the sky and shown straight down through a canopy of trees. I looked around and saw that I was in a dense but bright forrest, a man standing in front of me, his arms crossed tight across his chest. The man was slightly shorter then I but with very impressive muscle mass. His hair was cropped closely to his scalp and he wore a neat black beard that made him reminiscent of a civil war general. He was dressed fairly plainly, kaki cargo pants, Merrill boots and a black polo shirt. The only thing that would make him stand out from any middle aged dad at a barbecue was the Sig P226 on his belt. he studied me intently and I him, neither of us spoke for nearly a minute. He broke the silence first. Good morning, Travis, its been a while his mouth almost turned up into what could have been a smile but he quickly extinguished it with a stroke of his beard with his right hand, his left resting casually atop his pistol. Who the fuck are you? I asked, not breaking contact with his gray eyes. The man sucked his teeth. Damn brother, it hasnt been THAT long, dont tell me you forgot about your old pal bobby already? This time a slight smile did crease his lips. Right Bobby I repeated back to him, carefully. Maybe Im going a bit too fast for you, I apologize. Lets take this barney style for a bit before we get into talking about me, hooah? He watched me expectantly, I nodded in reply. he clapped his hands fan-fucking-tastic! Okay, lets start with where have you been for the past 8 years? I dont know I replied honestly. Bobby inhaled, pursed his lips and nodded. Okay okay, I know where You should have been. You should have been six feet under at Arlington. Thats where I saw you last, when I escorted your flag draped casket back home from Mali almost a decade ago. He paused and cleared his voice. I watched you die, I watched you go in the ground and I handed the same flag that covered your casket to your favorite bartender who was the only person you allowed at your funeral. He still has it last I checked, right next to his shotgun over the bar in Arkham. He stared at me, as if expecting me to know what he was talking about. Look Bobby I dont know if were on the same pa. He cut me off. I BURIED YOU MOTHER FUCKER. I SAW EVERYTHING. YOU ARE DEAD! Tears welled up in his eyes for perhaps a second but were gone just as fast as they came. He got closer to me. Master Sergeant Travis Dunn, died on October, 13th, 2019 in North Africa from wounds he sustained in a fire fight with insurgents during the last crusade. Now here he is 8 years later in Savanna, Georgia more alive then ever. Can you explain that to me, Master Sergeant? No. I replied honestly. I dont know who I am or what is going on, so Im not explaining shit to anyone. If you want any more then that then you may as well kill me or untie my hands because you are wasting your fucking time. Bobby stared for a minute and nodded to someone behind me. My restraints were cut and I was helped to my feet. Bobby grabbed my hand in a firm shake.  Then we have a lot of catching up to do, Travis. The war started long before the first shots were fired. With 90% of The US military performing scorched earth operations in the Middle East, there was next to nothing to protect the homeland. Every single deployable National Guard and reserve unit was sent to the Levant to exterminate the islamic plague. Perhaps the best thing would have been to drop a bomb, one larger then the world has ever witnessed, god knows we had them, but that wasnt the kind of operation that was chosen. on September 11th 2018 a coalition consisting of only the United States, Israel and Japan (who had just recently raised and trained an Offensive Army) Invaded Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria And Turkey. Shortly after, the terrorist cells hiding amongst the refugees who fled to Europe started their systematic attacks on major sites in Europe. Buckingham palace, the Louve, the Eiffel tower and The Entire Vatican had been reduced to rubble all in a matter of days. The rest of the refugees who consisted of mainly men between 18-45, quickly militarized and began a campaign of terror as they burned, murdered and raped their way through Europe. The mild europeans, who had never retained a right to own firearms, stood no chance against the hordes of angry savages and could only look on as their wives and daughters were brutalized in front of them. The only countries that still stood were Switzerland, Finland, Poland and Estonia. They sat back and prepared for what was to come as the rest of the feeble continent burned in the fires of jihad. America was a different story. Any muslim south of the Mason-Dixie line was either drawn and quartered, shot or lynched on sight. Men formed militias and prepared for the worst, many of them had been secretly stockpiling supplies and weapons for years. Save for a few isolated incidents, Texas, New Hampshire, Florida and most of the south stayed relatively peaceful. the west coast was a different story. All the sanctuary cities were subject to brutal acts of terrorism, much like those in Europe but on a smaller scale. The residents of these states had not the means nor the desire to defend themselves and Instead tried to preach tolerance as their cities burned. The scores of thousands of illegal immigrants took advantage of the chaos and started to loot and riot as they pleased, without help from the national guard, The police forces in these Affected Areas stood no chance. Instead of pulling soldiers out of the War on the other side of the war, the president and congress both agreed to re-instate the selective service and a lottery began. 1 in 5 men, able in body and mind were assigned to the nearly vacant national guard installations in the west to try to keep the peace. They soon resorted to brutal tactics and squashed most of the violent opposition. Those of the muslim faith and any who could not provide legal documentation for being in America were sent to camps in the Mojave desert. Many never made it. There was nothing to keep these soldiers from using unnecessary force, there was no more UN, no more Geneva Convention and no other world power to tell America what they were doing was wrong. Anyone who could have or would have said something was much too busy defending their own homeland or simply ceased to exist. California burned and soon there was nobody left to fight. Over the corse of 6 months, the soldiers were left to patrol a wasteland of what was once Los Angeles and San Fransisco. It was then, when we were at our weakest that North Korea attacked, not with ICBMs like they had threatened, but with their entire land Army assisted with Chinese Auxiliary, Invaded the ruined west coast of the untied states. The 800,000 conscripted Guardsman stood no chance against the 9,000,000 communist troops flooding into the American homeland as a series of bloody battles ensued with results of American troops being pushed farther and father East. Militia men from the New Confederacy in the southern states Rushed to the Aid of the National guard in what came to be known as The Peoples Republic Of California. Meanwhile, operations in the Middle East were wrapping up, The commander and chief cleared every Man, Woman and child as a target in the Levant. The American-japanese-israli coalition swept across the caliphate and razed every city and town that they came across. Within a year, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and the entire Arabian peninsula were all but vacant of any human life, while the Mediterranean countries were claimed by Israel and Became a sanctuary for many European jewish converts as wells as one of the presiding world powers. With Americas main forces focusing on cleaning up the Middle East, Israel turned its attention to Africa, deploying 600,000 soldiers Augmented with the 1st Ranger Battalion as well as 10 Special Forces operation detachments. In Tripoli, the capital city of Lbya, ODA-666 embedded with the the 7th IDF infantry regiment and the 22nd Mossad. it was here on October 13th 2018, that MSG Travis Dunn lost his life. "
120,vulnerability,nosleep,Something Ugly Lives Near Creve Coeur Lake,1,aajki8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/aajki8/something_ugly_lives_near_creve_coeur_lake/,2018-12-29 19:27:50,"I grew up in the suburbs of St. Louis, near the largest natural lake in Missouri. While only a few hundred acres in all, Creve Coeur lake was always a point of pride for me. My parents taught me to ride a bike around that lake, and I spent my summers hiking through the surrounding park. Legend has it that the lake got its name from a Native American princess long ago. She fell in love with a French fur trapper who broke her heart, and she threw herself from a waterfall to end her despair. Thus, French settlers named the lake Creve Coeur for her broken heart. I dont know if that story is true, but mine is. Not so long ago fluttered close to death on the edge of that lake. I think Im finally ready to tell my story. It was December, just after Christmas. I left a Friendsmas Eve party not far from the lake, and decided to burn off any lingering rum in my system in the crisp lake air. I rolled down the drivers-side window, pulled back the cloth cover to the moonroof, and turned down the dark forest lane leading into the park. My friends had mentioned that the coyotes were particularly hungry that year, and could be seen chasing deer through the park. I personally thought that was a little far fetched, but was pondering the merits of driving slow when a deer appeared in my high beams. Anyone who grows up around deer knows to floor it when a hit is inevitable, but for some reason I stood on my brakes. The tires squealed. The brown creature bounced off of the hood and smacked the top of the windshield with a crack, and suddenly I was at a stop. I caught my breath, and checked the rearview and side mirrors. It wasnt on the road, so at least I didnt have to worry about clearing it. I cursed and hit my horn, regained my composure, and realized that while the deer wasnt blocking the road, my ass sure was. I tested the accelerator, and continued down the wooded roadway. I emerged from the woods and glided out onto the level road that traced the lake in a black crescent. The sky opened in a dark expanse mirrored by the lake. On a clear summers night, thousands of stars set in a deep blue formed a glittery panorama, but on this cold winters night, the placid water and empty sky presented an enveloping, dark abyss. It was beautiful nonetheless. I pushed the view from my mind as I turned into a parking lot and pulled my car to a stop. I set the clutch to park, flicked off the lights, and eased back into my seat. I knew there had to be some more damage than just my windshield, and while insurance would cover most of it, the premium was sure to go up. I sighed and set my hand on the door handle, and my breath caught in my throat. Something was deeply wrong. I could feel it, a sinking anxiety brought on by some primal instinct, a hasty sense that pierced concerns for automotive repairs. My consciousness sharpened. I felt the breeze on my face, icy cold. Sharp. It carried the smell of copper, the smell of blood. My ears bristled. I heard breathing, my own growing more ragged by the second. But the air carried the sound of some other set of lungs heaving as quietly as they could. A shiver split across the crown of my skull and spiked down my spine. From my hunched position my gaze swept across the sparkling hood of my car to the shadow cast by the streetlight behind me. The stretched silhouette continued beyond the exaggerated contours of my midsize sedan, and revealed the contorted frame of some devilish creature crouched on top of it. Something was on top of my car. I shuddered, and my gasps approached hyperventilation. I stared at the shadow, waiting for movement, and slowly leaned back into the drivers seat. The moon roof came into my periphery, but I still couldnt see it. The thing perched just beyond my vision but near enough that I knew for sure something was there, something vile and hungry, something whose savagery was restrained by a quarter inch of glass. I slid my hand from the door handle to the window button, and waited for a reaction as the power window whirred to life. I paused when the window sealed shut, then brought my shaky hand back to the steering wheel. I could feel it glaring at me above. My scalp tingled, a feeling I can only describe as hopeless vulnerability. I drew a deep breath, and made a promise to myself: if this was my end, I was dragging this creature to hell with me. I coiled every muscle in my body like a spring. I let my breath out. I stomped on the break, ripped the clutch into drive, and floored the gas pedal before its first strike to the glass. The 4 liter engine with Sky-Active technology screamed to life and the roar mingled with the grunt pushing through my gritted teeth. The car lurched through grass in front of me and back onto the crescent road. I fixed my vision on the blurring yellow and white lines illuminated by dim running lights. I saw stars, shining suddenly into the night sky. Not stars. Tiny bits of safety glass showering from the cracking moonroof above. They stung my eyes and scratched throat with each rough inhale. I gripped the wheel tighter and willed the car faster, though my foot had pressed the pedal as far as it could go. All the while, a rhythmic crack sounded overhead. I saw my target: the concrete building housing the lakes restrooms. The only surface I could think of to hurl the creature against. I yanked the tires straight and flew off the road, careening through gravel and grass. I slid down in my seat, and jerked my head back to meet my tormentor. Our eyes met through spider-webbed glass. I saw hate and anger. Hunger and power. But deep in those orange, putrid slits crept a shadow of fear. I gave it the finger and let out a scream. I woke up in the hospital two weeks later. The police report says I put my car through that concrete shit-house at 70 miles an hour. I should not have lived. But I did. I was mangled head to toe, and anything that could be broken was. The police report also says the accident was a result of inebriation, evidenced by the residual alcohol in my blood from the nights festivities. No other bodies were found at the crash site, or on the hill leading down into the park. They did find a blood smear where I remember hitting the creature, but the animal of origin could not be determined due to environmental contamination. The final report concludes that I hit a deer, and later fell asleep at the wheel. I know the truth. Something ugly lives near Creve Coeur lake. Its strong and vicious, smart and hungry. But it bleeds like anything else, and fears like anything else. Ive spent the last five years fixing my body and hardening my mind. I think Im ready for another late drive past the largest natural lake in Missouri. Ill find that hellish creature. And when I rip out it's heart, Ill bring new meaning to the name Creve Coeur."
121,vulnerability,nosleep,To The Boy I'm Stalking (3).,1,a0qe7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a0qe7x/to_the_boy_im_stalking_3/,2018-11-27 13:28:52,"Previous Entry- [URL &amp;#x200B; Hello again reddit. Hello again Adam. I hope you had a nice sleep last night and are feeling revitalised today. True to my word, I left you alone so hopefully you didnt prepare any big tricks for me that Im not going to expect. Ive been very busy today though Adam, preparing little treats for you; these will become apparent when the time is right. Tell me, do you like surprises? So, let me catch you up reddit. When I left you yesterday, I had just text Adam asking him to message the girl sat across from him in the restaurant. It was easy enough to get into her life and shell have no idea that it was me. You see, I never intended on getting myself involved in her life fully, until I thought about different ways I could test Adam. Its a shame really, how easy certain people make it for you to have access in their lives. I met her at a bar whilst looking for someone to test Adam with. You see, quite the opposite to what Im sure many people are thinking, Im quite a charismatic character. Im not some socially anxious creep. Im a calculated, intelligent and charming man. We got talking after I offered to buy her a drink. Ive always thought about how torture isnt the best way to extract information from a person, but something that is much better is in fact alcohol. Get talking to someone whilst sharing drinks in a natural calming environment and you will extract more information from someone much faster than you could ever imagine. Not long after sitting down, youve learnt what you want to know; job, age, relationship status, about her family. After that, the most important thing is making sure she will not remember you. Thats easy enough. Slip a little rohypnol into her drink and make sure she gets home safe. Do nothing to her. You should never lay a finger on a lady without her consent. The drug is purely and simply in order to wipe her memory clean. On the way back to her place, you need to take her phone and get her number so you can have it for the future, she wont remember this. Put her to bed and leave. I did this about three weeks ago. In this game there can be no rash or impulse decisions, everything you do must be planned and acted out precisely. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, back to how she fits into this puzzle Im creating for Adam. &amp;#x200B; Melissa, as youll come to know her, lives alone. Shes an only child and she lost both of her parents 6 years ago. Shes 29 years old and works as a nurse. What Melissa epitomises is vulnerability. A caring and lovely woman who just feels alone in the world. She is who you will be targeting Adam. I thought Id start you off easy. Women are more naturally vulnerable than men physically and her lack of close friends, family or a lover alienate her; this means that she wont feel as though she can reach out to anyone else. You can control her life, and youre going to do as I say or youll find out the consequences of disobeying. It took Adam 13 minutes to type and send his message to her. His reply to me came 2 minutes after; he watched her panic and scamper from the restaurant before sending it. It read: *Initially she was panicking. I could see her drawing deep breaths and her eyes were wide. After that she scanned around the room, she looked deeply and intensely at every person in the restaurant. She didnt seem to suspect me. After this, she appeared to be in denial. It looked as though she calmed herself down, shaking her head and attempting to return to her meal. It didnt take long though before she panicked again and left the restaurant shaking.* Now I dont know what Adam messaged her, but as a witness; it looked like he did a very good job. Tell me, Adam, how did it feel? Did you enjoy the power? Have you ever instilled fear into someone, its quite the rush dont you think? I left him be at the restaurant in order to think about how he felt regarding what hed done to the woman. That was when I took my leave for the evening. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I know you read the post yesterday Adam which once again disappoints me because you didnt reply. I heard you talking about it on the way to school with Jeremy this morning. I must say, it doesnt really feel like you and Jeremy are aware enough of your surroundings. Did you not notice me at the magazine stand having a peruse? Anyway, that was the perfect time to catch back up with you today. Could you let Jeremy know I liked his t-shirt, Metallica are one of my favourite bands. &amp;#x200B; So lets talk about your day today then Adam shall we. You had History first. Studying the Russian Revolution and the rise of Bolsheviks to power, but you didnt enjoy that did you buddy? Head in hands, eyes barely open, day dreaming. You especially dont like the girl you sit next to in that lesson do you? Throwing looks to Jeremy like youre Jim Halpert from the office every time she opened her mouth. After that was Maths. Now that seemed like a boring lesson; for a man who loves calculation, Ive never really enjoyed maths. Who was the girl you were sitting next to in that lesson Adam? You seemed to have a soft spot for her, blushing and smiling at her every word, maybe Ill have to have a little poke around in her life to see why she intrigues you so much. &amp;#x200B; I left you after that. Ill tell you why. Your mother works until 2 in the afternoon and your dad starts work at 1pm. You and your sister both attend school until 3:30pm, that means, between the times 1pm and 2pm, your house is entirely empty. Now, that shouldnt be a problem should it? The home is a secure place dont you think. Well, your mother clearly thinks so. She takes no care and employs no precaution when she uses the spare key left under the mat; that makes it very easy for someone to observe her using the key and then know where it is. &amp;#x200B; Someone like me. &amp;#x200B; You live in a very nice place Adam. Your bedroom looks even better up close than it does from a distance. &amp;#x200B; When you get home tonight, have a check in your top chest draw. Ive left you a file of information on Melissa and a flash drive. Read up on Melissa, youll be seeing her tomorrow. Do not use the flash drive until I instruct you to do so. Theres also a Metallica record for Jeremy, I hope he enjoys it. Youll hear from me very soon. Your Stalker x"

As I listened with perked ears I deciphered the cause of the frenzied commotion to be an unnervingly panicked, Father Thomas. David, wake up, its Father Thomas! I need to speak with you about Brother Terry... its urgent! I heard my dads door creep open and his weary voice engage his unexpected visitor. The early throes of the conversation were too muffled to make out clearly, and my curiosity was stronger than my will to sleep by this point, so I hobbled bleary-eyed to join the unexpected reunion outside. When I arrived in the hallway I saw my fathers door was left agape and that he and Father Thomas were already inside. The disheveled reverend was sitting anxiously at the edge of the bed. His appearance, to me, was... troubling... No longer was he the neatly kempt, antiseptic man wed seen coming out of the prison just hours earlier. Gone was his chummy, amiable demeanor, replaced instead with by one denoting unrest and fear induced paranoia... His head would turn sharply and abruptly, to and fro, to address the smallest disturbance in the room, meeting them trepidation and ultimately relief. It was as if he was expecting something to be there, hiding in the corner, waiting to catch his glance... His once immaculate black robes had been exchanged for pajamas, tackily decorated with seemingly fresh smears of mud and dirt. There was a small cut below his left eye, and a swab of dried blood now painted his cheek. His hair was awry and tangled up with dried out, crumbling leaves. He was agitated and fidgety, seemingly unable to remain still, as he sat with one leg crossed over the other, rocking his foot in vigorous anxiety. His eyes met mine as I entered the room but he did not otherwise acknowledge my presence. My dad was leaning against a small stationary table on the wall adjacent the open door with arms crossed, sporting a gaunt worrisome expression, presumably processing the manic information hed just been relayed. Father Thomas looked up at my dad, smoking room? Um, y-yeah... you need one? my dad asked. If you dont mind, David... responded the reverend, with the vulnerability and humility of a starving beggar on the street. No... not at all. Here, my dad reached into the pocket of his coat strewn over the chair next to him and handed Father Thomas a cigarette. The Father then parsed the unlit smoke in his lips and held it there with trembling finger as my dad stretched forth a lighter and sparked it for him. He took a long deep inhale, caging it in his lungs as he closed his eyes. After a moment he exhaled and a plume of smoke filled the air around him. Thats better, he said, his nerves noticeably calmer, forgive me, come in son, close the door behind you. I did as he asked and then addressed the room for claritys sake and asked them to recap what Id missed, so whats going on? I heard you mention something about Brother Terry? He escaped, my father replied, his succinct response doing little to help my confusion. Escaped? How? When? Did they catch him? Do they know where he might be? He, my dad began before Father Thomas coolly interrupted him. Hes in my trunk... the reverend delivered in an almost nonchalant manner before taking another long drag from his cigarette. Wait... hes... hes in your trunk? my dad gasped, in a tone revealing that their conversation hadnt made it quite to that point. Yes, the reverends pithily replied in irritating vagueness. In your trunk? The trunk of the car you drove here?Wha-? my fathers astounded disbelief not relenting, as I found myself internally echoing his sentiments. We should have never gone down into those haunted halls... Father Thomas sighed as a wave of mournful regret washed over him. Whatever was down there, what demon lurked those dark corridors... well I... I have no doubt it has Terry now... Hold on, Father... I interjected, with all due respect it sounds like youre the one who has, Terry... Yes, son, indeed I do. And truth be told, this whole thing is my fault... I should have fought the beast alone, I knew that the others, as well intentioned as they may have been, were not prepared to face that kind of unadulterated evil... We cornered the creature with the Spoken Word and Holy artifacts and I successfully cast him from his earthly host. But... I fear he did not return to Hell from wince he came but instead sent forth his legions into the vessels nearest him. With Terry being the closest, and I suspect, most infested by the scampering spirits... I prayed that I was wrong but tonight I could deny no longer that Terry, was in fact, horribly possessed... I was laying in bed not two hours ago, reading scripture and preparing next weeks sermon, not different than any other Sunday evening. As I sat my Bible and notes aside for the night I felt a quickly manifesting sense of looming darkness permeate the room. Instinctively I clutched my rosary and began to cleanse the room through prayer. I was interrupted, however, when I heard a fir rapping on my bedroom window. I nervously looked through yawning blinds and peering back at me... well it... it was Brother Terry, piercing me through the panes with hateful intent... But, I chimed in, just because he escaped and found out where you live well... I dont see how that means hes possessed by a demon... No, no, youre right, the reverend agreed in a gruff whispery voice, normally I would say its a disgruntled inmate, a scary prospect of course, but not one of spiritual origin. However... my bedroom window is on the second floor, and below it is a sheer wall to the ground. So to see him staring at me through *that* window in particular... well you get the picture... When I saw him, doing what can only be described as *floating* there, I... I immediately darted for the bedroom door as I heard the glass shatter behind me. I reached for the knob only to feel myself be jolted backwards through the empty frame and see the outside of my home now quickly shrinking in the growing distance before me. As he carried me hastily through the whipping wind of the night sky, he was shouting the most awful things. Things that my oath to the priesthood will not allow me to utter. Aside from the insidious threats he kept repeating, The book priest. Give me the book. My mind was reeling and all I could think was that he mustve been asking for the Bible still resting on my bedside table. So I old him it was back at home and that Id retrieve for him if he only returned me unharmed to solid footing. As I did he sharply and abruptly stopped in midair as we hovered meters above the treetops below. I felt his grip shift as his arms wrapped my chest and then he suddenly screeched in pain, as if hed mistakenly touched the searing end of a hot poker. I could see a fresh and immediately festering burn on his arm in what looked to me to hold the shape of a crucifix. Thats when I remembered the rosary still adorning my neck. I yanked the chain free, snapping the clasp in the process, and grabbed the cross dangling from its end tightly in my hand. I then said a prayer, as with all my might, I wrenched it downward and punctured the flesh of his thigh. He dropped me from his arms with a howling cry as we both came hurdling back down to the harsh cushion of trees below. I crashed through the leaves violently, leaving a wake of snapped branches marking the path of my descent from the heavens. Eventually, a large set of twin limbs finally wedge me mercifully between them. God must have guided my fall as I emerged from the impact relatively unharmed, only minor scrapes and bruises to tell the tale. As I untangled myself and climbed the rest of the way to solid footing, however, I saw that Terry had not been so fortunate... He was impaled on the trunk of small fallen oak, splintered straight through the chest. A most disturbing sight I can assure you... Most disturbing of all though, was that... he was... still alive... still cursing me with same spiteful vigor... it appeared he was more concerned about being stuck there than his, by all accounts, fatal injury... I wasted no time pondering the whys and hows of the scene, however, and quickly made haste back to my house. Once there I gathered together every rope, roll of tape, and chain that I could find, as well as every holy object my arms could carry. I threw it all in the back seat my car and started the engine. But then, as I started to drive back to were Terry lay spiked, I remembered something... The book hed been asking for, in my frantic struggle Id thought maybe he was speaking of my Bible but... then it hit me. I had obtained a diary, some years ago now, that a guard had confiscated from an inmate that smuggled it back from the boilers. The diary belonged originally to a man named, Abner Haney, or as he is colloquially known amongst the prisoners, VooDoo Bob. Id taken the confiscated diary to translate its foreign text, and after months of varying degrees of success among its passages it now rested in a locked filing cabinet in my office. I had, had several of the inmates, whom frequented chapel at the time, helping me to dissect its pages, Brother Terry among them. It dawned on me that this must have been the book that he was after. I ran back into the house and shuffled around the contents of the cabinet where I retrieved the diary then drove the half miles or so back to the location from which Terrys scornful screams could still be heard echoing through the forest. When I arrived I was relieved to see he had not been able to free himself, and with him still impaired, I took the opportunity to bind his arms and legs. I then pried him up and off the piercing splinter protruding through his rib cage, to reveal a gory circular window wide enough to see the open trunk of my parked car behind him. I further bound him with chains and the remaining rope then drug him through the dirt as he continued his onslaught of obscenities. I worked Im up along the rear bumper and rolled him over into the empty hull where I proceeded to seal his mouth shut with an exuberant amount of duct tape. Lastly, I taped several crucifixes to the underside the trunk lid, in an effort to keep him from attempting to force it open. Once I felt sure that he was sufficiently bound, I retrieved the diary from the passengers seat and brought it before him to confirm my hunch. Is this what youre after demon? The tape ensured that he couldnt speak but his eyes lit up as he rocked and struggled against the ropes restraining him. His reaction told me what I needed to know and I knew that it was, in fact, what he had come for. With my question answered, I sealed shut the lid and resolved myself to drive him back to Telford. I suppose I had made it halfway there when the idea that returning him to his cell inside the prison was not perhaps the best course of action. After all, he was locked in Seg and had managed to escape. The only way I could imagine that happening was if he had help... was if an inmate or guard had *let* him out... Whos to say they wouldnt just do it again? And that of course was ignoring the fact that there was now a hole eight inches in diameter straight through his chest. How could that possibly be explained by forces outside of anything but the supernatural? I feared that returning Terry to Telford would cause panic among its residents... And... then I thought about the book... about the passages I couldnt read, the ones we could never decipher... and well... then I remembered you, David. The thought struck that perhaps *you* could read them. I know it sounds crazy but I dont think the fact that you appeared before me today of all days was a mere coincidence, it was, I believe, Gods divine plan. My dad looked baffled to say the least. His thoughts obviously reflecting my own. I could tell that he, too, wondered how Father Thomas could have the smallest expectation that he could read what the Father and other inmates had not been able to after months of dedicated research. But... my dad perplexedly replied, how can I help? I dont know a second language... Ill be the first to admit, its a stretch, but well... its the only hope weve got at the moment. You see, most of the diary is written in Latin, Aramaic, and Hebrew, and while challenging to understand, I can use existing resources to decipher those pages. Some of the passages, though, are written in an even more primitive and primal language.. A language described in some the the other passages to be the original language... the language... of the dead. And well... from information I can gather from the decipherable sections, it can only be read *by* the dead. Sometimes I gathered that Abners trapped soul would manage break free and leak ink on to diarys worn pages. He would reveal himself in the form of desperate cries for release and sometimes... rather *interesting* information. Among his desperate passages, he wrote an entry describing the demon who now held him captive. It appeared to be a transference spell, roughly instructing the reader how to control the spirit and possibly how it can returned to the burning depths of Hell from wince it rose. However, the incantation itself, is written in the dead language and I, not any living man, can translate it... I am ashamed to say it was arrogance that led me to disregard instructions outlined in the book as I led those men down into the abandoned prison labyrinth. My training as priest had falsely convinced me that I was prepared to dispatch of the evil. I see now the importance of the cursed books unheeded warnings... May God forgive me... Okay, I interrupted in unabashed confusion, but if it can only be read by the dead then... well... how could my dad hope to read it? You never told him, did you David? the reverend somberly addressed my father. Told me... what? I... my father remorsefully sighed, I didnt want to worry you boys... He reached into his draping coat pulled out and pulled out a cigarette before he continued. I guess it was a few months into my incarceration... I... well... I collapsed coming in from the yard. Just one second I was fine and the next everything went dark... I dont know what happened to cause it, and I dont remember anything after that either... but... I awoke in a wooden box to the sound of dirt skidding across its surface... It was the unmistakable sound of being buried alive... I started screaming that I was awake and for them to let me out, not a moment later I heard a panicked muffled conversation and then saw the sharp end of a shovel prying up the nailed shut lid. I was greeted by two guards, and the Father here, white faced and breathless, as if emerging from the shallow grave at their feet... was a ghost... And I learned soon after that well... maybe that *was* what they were seeing... I was, through no mincing of words, that I had been declared dead a full eighteen hours earlier. That... I hadnt taken a breath or held a pulse in nearly a day. But now, all of a sudden, I was alive and remarkably healthy. The next few days I became a lab rat of sorts as the doctors and nurses in the infirmary fruitlessly examines me for answers to what had I had just experienced... Ultimately the cause was never discovered and well... I wish I knew more about it all but... honestly, its just a blank. Surmising from what I think Father Thomas is getting at, Im assuming he is hopping that my time on the other side will work as a technicality of sorts and allow to read the still untranslated sections of the diary. Yes, David, you are right in your assumptions. If you dont mind... Id like you to try and read Abners instructions... I mean... Ill give it a shot but I dont think its gonna do much good. I feel like Id know if I had magically become fluent in a second language... All I ask is that you try, said Father Thomas as he reached behind him and pulled out a leather bound book that he had tucked into the waist band of his pajamas. Ive learned as much as is possible for me to learn from the books cryptic texts, he professed as he tentatively relinquished it to my dad, I... I hope youll have more luck. Sure but... what exactly am I looking for? inquired my father as he took the diary and began to tepidly scan through its pages. Abner writes that the spirit haunting him has been displaced. He tells that the spirit once inhabited a powerful demon... a demon that, too, is familiar with the inmates of Telford. A demon that I believe you may have encountered as well, David. I... have? my dad responded puzzled by the reverends assertion. I believe he waved at you once... The creature from the woods? I postulated. Precisely, the Father confirmed. The creature is the spirits former *body*, for lack of better description. Now the beast is just a soulless husk, acting out of nothing more than instinct and muscle memory. I do not know how the spirit has come to be dislodged, perhaps by choice, but I suspect that to destroy him, he must be returned to his original form. I believe that Abners incantation details how it may be possible for us to do that. Okay, well heres to hopping youre right...Page? my father inquired. The very last, replied the reverend with bated breath. My dad ruffled through the diary and arrived just shy of the back cover. His eyes searched it intensely, desperately attempting to make sense of its hieroglyphic markings. I... Im sorry I a defeated exhale left from Father Thomas with the sound of my dads regretful apology, but then... No... wait... the words they... it took me a minute but I... I can read them... Father Thomas, suddenly reinvigorated, swiftly hopped up from his bedside perch hustled to my father, peering over his shoulder at the pages of the diary. What does it say David? Quickly, weve not a moment to spare! It says... well I dont think I can translate it to English... but essentially its a list of words to be read off in order, giving the speaker of the words control of the spirit, or demon... well control of where it goes rather. I can read it but its still very confusing... I think, if I understand correctly, the body and the spirit need to be next to each other for it to work But well... it... it doesnt say what will happen once they are reunited, only that this will reunite them. What if *reuniting* them only makes the demon stronger? What it wants to be rejoined, I asserted. It is very possible... Father Thomas admitted, in truth I worry the same. But I do know that when casting the spirit from a human vessel it lingers until it finds another. Thats what happened to Terry, to Briggs and that young guard, Oates. It dispersed itself between them, sending its legion of demons fleeing to the first vulnerable soul they saw. Oates? That was the young guard from the check in station, I remember reading his name on his uniform. Thats why he knew you isnt? He has seen you before, from the M-Seg vents... I asked my dad. Yes, Father Thomas answered, and the more I think about it... well it makes sense that the demon may have used Oates to free Terry from his cell tonight. I mean who else could, or would have released him? So, you believe the the fragmented spirit is controlling all three men simultaneously? What about Briggs? Why not just release him too? I questioned. Well, as I said, Terry was the closest man to the demon when it was dispelled, and as a result, I think the most of the demons power now resides in him. And as for Briggs... well he... hes dead... His body was discovered shriveled up and mummified, the life seemingly sucked straight from his being. And though I cant prove it, I think that was Terrys handiwork, consuming and reassembling his scattered ghosts. For all I know, Oates is dead now too, a victim to the same malicious fate. Alright... well fuck... I muttered, sorry Father, forgive my language. But let me try to summarize this... So we have to somehow lure the beast from the trees into the same place as Terry, and then my dad needs to read the magic words and then we can kill it... er... hopefully? Any ideas on how to do that? Can we funnel it into a cage with holy objects? They seem to work on the spirit... Im afraid the holy objects are of no use on the creature. Remember, he isnt evil, more like an animal, a crucifix wont cause the same lethargic reaction as it would on its former host. We do need to drive it into a confined area somehow, but the logistics of that elude me... My father, who had been thumbing through the diary, seemed to have found something interesting on one of the pages, without even glancing up he enlightened us of his discovery. I think I have an idea... VooDoo, er, Abner, he wrote something about a ritual involving the beating hearts of eight dead men. Human sacrifices, that when all consumed, will create a new soul within their consumer... The fleshcrows! I shouted excitedly after piecing together what he was eluding to, but werent there eight of those? Maybe a spare? No... not a spare... The eighth was to be used as a doppelgnger of sorts. The beast only needs seven to create a new soul, and after it has devoured them, it transfers the new, infant soul into the remaining empty vessel. After transferring its soul, it becomes a hull again, returning to a state of catatonic hibernation, waiting for the next time its summoned. I think maybe thats how the spirit haunting the vents became separated in the first place. The creature is making copies... Ramirez and the guard burned the eighth, if I recall correctly, so if the creature consumes the seventh fleshcrow, he will be full and there will be nowhere to transfer the spirit possessing Terry... By my math only a handful of the fleshcrows have been accounted for... and... I think I know where the others may be hiding. Forgive me but... fleshcrows? Father Thomas asked. Its a long story, my dad answered, but back during the Holy Wars there were eight men found skinned alive in the prison halls with the skins and hearts missing. C.O. Johnson later told me that he saw the skins in the woods, stuffed with hay and walking around aimlessly through the trees. Anyway, as youve gathered, I think the creature in the woods is hunting them. And well its risky, but I think if we can capture one, well maybe we can use it as bait to lead the creature and trap it in a somewhere... Alright, well how do we find these reanimated carcasses? the curious Father inquired. When I worked with hounds in the kennels, my dad began, they used to lead me to a small opening leading down between some large rocks. I used to hear something moving down there and there was always hay in the direct vicinity... I think thats where they hide from it... If we could get on to the prison property and somehow coerce a fleshcrow from the cave, I have a feeling that after that it wont take long for the creature to find us... But how do we get inside the gates? Its not exactly a convincing pitch to tell the guards to let a priest, an ex-convict, and his son in to roam freely on the grounds to hunt demons... Not to mention the possessed fugitive in the trunk... I said expressing my skepticism of the chaotically evolving plan. Leave that to me, Father Thomas offered, I can make a few calls, and depending on whos on duty, bargain for a lot to a little unmonitored time at the gates... With that, Father Thomas pulled his decade old flip phone from his pocket and stepped out into the hallway. A moment later I heard his faint voice petitioning our entry with an unknown person on the other end of the line. I took the alone time with my father to ask him a few burning questions. So... you died? And you didnt tell us? I didnt want to worry you, and besides... once it was over and I was okay, what good would it do to bring it up? I suppose, I begrudgingly conceded, but you really dont remember anything? Nothing at all? He hesitated for a moment then spoke in a considered and grave manner, well... I remember running... I remember running through an endless dark... Everything was pitch black and the floor was scolding hot, burning my bare feet. I ran aimlessly for days and I never hit a wall and the texture of the floor never changed. I remember feeling so thirsty and tired but I knew I couldnt stop or they would catch me... Who would catch you? I... Im not sure... it was too dark to see but from behind I heard someone or something following me. It sounded like a pack of wolves but it felt more sinister than that... and when it called out it spoke several voices at once, all saying the same thing in unison, Your soul belongs to us now... I dont know what it was but I knew I had to out run it... After what felt like weeks of constant pursuit, I saw a vague yellow hue in the distance and... well... when I reached it I woke up in shoddy box, in a shallow grave, my grave... But, like I said, I dont remember passing out or dying. I just remember the nightmare that ensued and running and eventually... waking up. Thats why VooDoo remembers you isnt it? It must have been him his legions who were chasing you... And the guard, Oates... the thing he wanted back... its your soul isnt it? My dad sighed a grievous sigh and in his typical poetic fashion said, thats the thing about prison... the judge gave me twenty and Im that time I learned that even if youre sentence doesnt reflect it... in prison everybody gets life. There are no pardons, no paroles... And well... at Telford... I think everybody gets death too... Just as my dad finished relaying his haunting anecdote, Father Thomas reentered the room, with an aura of urgency about him. We can get in but we have to leave now. Theres a shift change in an hour and after that our window of opportunity will be gone. My dad shot me a glance as if to gauge what I was thinking. I knew what he wanted me to say. He wanted me to tell him to go ahead without me, that Id wait for his return from the safety of my hotel room. Instead, my response left a bitterly remorseful taste on his tongue, when instead, I said, Well what are waiting for? Lets go. We hurried out into the hallway and then anxiously down the elevator. I resigned myself to not think beyond the current moment, to not consider what all the culminating snap shots in time were leading to. Stepping through the sliding glass doors of the hotel and out onto the parking lot beyond, we were greeted by the emotionless chill of a deep autumn night. The world outside seemed to be more peaceful than it should have been. Caught up in an ignorant doldrum, blissfully unaware of the chaos that it held within its waning hours. As we made our way to my dads vehicle, Father Thomas left us with some parting instruction. Just follow close, when we exit for the prison, pull off to shoulder and join me in my car. Once we lure the creature there will be a back entrance to to the underground wing left unlocked. The new shift will make their rounds to check all doors within an hour or so of clocking in so we wont have much time. Are there any questions? The instructions were clear enough and we shook our heads indicating we needed no further clarification. Good, the Father nodded, now lets be on our way... and may God be with us... With that, Father Thomas departed our vehicle for his own which hed parked off and away from the others in the corner of the lot. We backed into the empty lane between the spaces and waited for the reverend to pass us and take his place at the front of our small convoy. As we got in line behind him, I could see his trunk was abundantly wrapped in rope and links of bungee cord. It served as a grim and constant reminder of the priests insidious cargo and the bleak task ahead. As we traversed the winding black ribbon dividing the thick, uncompromising walls of towering pine zooming past us on either side, I too, was reminded of my fathers dreams. His long journeys home through the twisting trees, beneath the shining moonlight above. I wondered if perhaps the familiarity of it all had dawned on him as well. The highway was desolate and completely bereft of passing motorists, and for the first time in my driving career, I found myself longing to be caught up in a traffic jam. My eyes were transfixed on the reverends blaring red taillights, and I distracted myself by blurring in and out of focus. The distraction did not last long, however, as the Fathers car swerved violently to the right as his brakes screamed out painfully, the awful screech reverberating through the crisp night air. I watched, horrified, as he abruptly careened off the road bouncing turbulently into a shallow ditch and plowing onward until finally slamming to a stop against the trunk of a massive fur tree. I quickly pulled off to the shoulder as my dad reached into the glove compartment to retrieve a flashlight. We hastily, yet nervously, exited the car and began sprinting our way to the crash site. As we neared the Fathers vehicle there was a thick, smoky fog forming around it from beneath the tire wells, and up from the radiator. Pine needles still falling like rain from the rattled branches above. My heart sank as the flashlights beam penetrated the rear view window. I saw the reverends head drooped over, seemingly unconscious from the impact and graciously, oblivious to what was encroaching upon him. In the back seat was a second figure... and although I had never met him it... well it didnt take me long to understand that I was looking at Terry Guines. What happened next is beyond my capacity or desire to accurately articulate. Terry looked back at us through the glass and shot us a devious, almost playful smile before climbing between the Father and the steering wheel, straddling him as he maintained eye contact with his horrified audience. Up to this point I had not truly allowed myself to believe in any of my dads stories, not fully given up on my skeptical viewpoints, on my remaining thread of sanity. And though I had spent the last few weeks listen to and recording the most vile and atrocious acts that I could fathom, I could have gone the rest of my life without bearing witness to one. But as Terry impossibly gripped the priests wilted head between his pressing hands, and then effortlessly pulled it from his limp neck stretching it to unbelievably gruesome lengths, the devastating reality that my father had not been weaving a yarn of fiction shook me to the core. I watched as the Fathers head was ripped from his shoulders, the connecting tendons popping like tightly wound guitar strings one after the other. I felt vomit attempting to evacuate my mouth as, we started silently backing back towards our own vehicle. A moment later, Terry opened the drivers side door and stepped out palming the late reverends decapitated skull, as blood drained out the dangling tendons and formed a thick pool on the yellow grass below. Heads up, he shouted in an unnaturally deep voice before tossing the severed head at our feet, aww... whats wrong Dave? Dont feel like playing catch? There was no reply as we continued reversing away until the hood of the parked car kissed the back of our thighs. Come on Dave... its your old pal, Dr. Giggles? Arent you even going to say hello? Nick... my father whispered, get in the car and start the engine. Im not Now! he ordered. I skirted my way along the hood and still open door and then into the slowly into the drivers seat. I turned the key and as the headlights blasted the darkness ahead, Terrys haunting visage was seared into my mind. His white prison garbs were stained in multiple shades of red indicating that they were soaked in more than just the Fathers blood. His eyes were glossy black spheres encased in horribly vascular sockets. His expression told a story of pure hatred mingled with wicked amusement. Through his chest, just as the Father had said, was an aperture through which I could see the illuminated trees behind. And his feet... well... they werent touching the earth below him as he glided the air towards us. As he approached ever closer, my building anxiety was palpable. Get in... get in the car... I urged my dad. Just put it in drive, he yelled back. Going so soon, Dave? Terry sarcastically probed. Wouldnt dream of it Terry, my dad quipped back, with an air of confidence I was surprised to hear. My father started moving across the car and out onto the highway, with Terry steadily closing the gap. Nick, toss me the diary, my dad ordered still backing up with his eyes locked on the encroaching inmate. I reached over to the drivers seat and grabbed the book then threw it through the open window to my father. This what you looking for, Terry? He said as he held it up over his head. The sight of it seemed to spark immediate rage in Terry who was just a few meters away from crossing the cars beaming headlights himself. Give me that fucking book! he snarled, you insignificant cunt! Give me that book before I slit your fucking throat! My dad casually tossed the book a maybe twenty or thirty feet ahead of me, centered with the hood of vehicle. You want it? Then take it... Everything from point that sped up considerably. Terry bolted for the diary which was now lying facedown on the asphalt. As he bent to retrieve it my dad shouted, Now! Now, Nick! Hit the gas! Without even thinking, I floored the gas pedal and sent the car barreling full speed at the unsuspecting Terry. I hit him going upwards of forty miles an hour sending him up over the hood, smashing against the windshield. I continued accelerating down the road blindly before I harshly threw on the brakes and launched him several meters forward, scraping along the road before me. I then sat in an adrenaline fueled haze as from the side mirror I saw my father retrieve the book and start sprinting my way. I threw the car in reverse and lurched forward so violently that my head nearly slammed against the steering wheel. I stopped just shy of my father and he quickly jumped in the passengers side seat. We have to go, he isnt dead, my dad warned as all too soon Terry began to stagger himself back up off the ground. Daaaaavid! said the beast, give... me... that... fucking... BOOOOOK! My dad rolled down his window and antagonized the demon further, You want it? Then come get it, bitch. He rolled up his window and turned to me, we go through with the plan. Just drive, he wont be far behind. I let off the brake and floored it past the reeling Terry, speeding down the interstate until he was out of view. I felt numb, unable to process what had just transpired, unwilling to even try. I opted to focus on the road, instead. Before long we were on the last stretch of highway and the task at hand began to feel more daunting with every mile. To this point we had been lone travelers on the interstate but as I took the exit for Telford, a shiver ran down my spine as headlights filled the rear view mirror. When we passed under a stretch of dim street lights, to my utter dread, I recognized the car behind me. It... it was the Fathers. Just drive, the turn-in is straight ahead, my dad informed me. As I rounded the last corner and the prison came into view, the overwhelming realization that I was now fully wedge between a rock and a hard place became painfully apparent. With a demon behind me, and countless more before me, I knew that as I came up to the prisons long driveway there was no turning back. As it were, there was only one option remaining, and that option, as much I didnt want to... was to finish the fucking job...

123,vulnerability,nosleep,The Krampus Killer,1,a1s252,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a1s252/the_krampus_killer/,2018-11-30 23:37:01," Twas a few nights before Christmas. The ground was covered in a thick blanket of white, that was like a gift-wrap which could only be opened in spring. Jake pressed his face to the window pane, gaping at the large snowflakes and their intricate, fragile pattern falling from above and creating a thin layer of frost on the glass. Pass me the beer. said Steven. There were four of us and we were all of us misfits. Mandy had been born with a slight clubfoot and had a penchant for shyness. She mostly spent her time writing stories of science fiction and fantasy, where being different made you a hero. Just like the rest of us, she never got asked to join the other kids for sleepovers or pizza at the mall. Then there was Jake, whose Harry Potter-esque glasses and slight stutter had made him a prime target for bullies since the first grade. Thats where Steven came into the picture. Hed stood up against said bullies and ever since then, he and Jake had been best friends - both of them alienated from the rest of our peers. Stevens family had moved to our small little town from Canada and in a town where everybody knew your great-grandmother, outsiders werent looked on with kind eyes. Especially not those rolling into town with new money. Stevens parents had a successful real-estate business and instead of living in a busy big city, theyd chosen to settle here so the kids could grow up close to the countryside, away from the poisonous exhaust fumes that devoured cities like demons dwelling underground. And then there was me. I had been the result of a small indiscretion within my family, almost eighteen years ago. By the time my brother turned five years old, my dad had a short-lived affair with a younger colleague during a time when his marriage was standing on thin ice. So, nine months later, on a mild Fall day in August, I was born and my dad named me Ivy. But my biological mom didnt want me and so my dad stood at the doorstep of our house, with a tiny baby wrapped in his arms, seeking forgiveness from his wife. In the eyes of our family, the only mom Id ever known was the woman who raised me as her own, even when she could have chosen not to. In the eyes of our town however, my dad was practically the incarnation of evil and I was his offspring. Growing up wasnt easy. Ever since Id been old enough to speak in complete sentences, I heard peoples whispers and saw how they always looked at me funny when I was out with my parents. Most of the time, mom and dad ignored it but I still sometimes caught the tired look in her eyes. Mom would let out a resigned and weary sigh that seemed to signal the end of a deliberate effort and the beginning of passive deterioration. On those days I felt the most guilty, because even though they never said it - I still felt like her suffering was my fault. I remember how the school hallway always reeked. The odor of the stale urine curled from under the restroom doors, depressingly mixed with deodorant and body odor in equal measure. I always tried to keep my head head down and push my way through the sea of despondent faces. Then one day, when the mocking voices became unbearable and Id ran to hide in the bathroom like a coward, Id found Mandy. Shed been sitting there, head deep into Robert Louis Stevensons *Treasure Island* book. We became friends that day. Stevens family lived in a house with a couple acres of land attached to it. It had originally been an old farm but there was no longer any livestock and because there wasnt really any business for dairy production, the farmer had decided to sell the house with the farmland. The countryside had been put to sleep under a blanket of white. The boughs glistened with frost; the air hung silent and cold. Not far from the main house was a small guest house. It was mostly used by guests of the family, but when it was unoccupied it had become our sanctuary - or clubhouse if you like. Wed put our heart and soul into making it as cozy and comfortable as possible. Comic books were haphazardly scattered through the living room and what could only be described as a sea of blankets covered the sofas. When we were kids, wed spend weekends in here having sleepovers, talking the night away while drinking root beer and sodas. Now, we still had sleepovers but the root beers had been swapped for normal beer and the occasional bottle of vodka if we felt rebellious enough. Christmas had always been an important time of year for us, but now more so than ever. It was our senior year of High School and we would be graduating that summer. Wed be parting ways and going to different colleges. As sad as it was to acknowledge it, werent kids anymore. Thats why this last Christmas was so special. Whats that you got there Mandy. Steve asked. He slouched in the armchair as he drank from the cheap beer. Occasionally hed catch himself slouching and straightened up again, pushing his shoulders backwards and sitting taller. I thought we were exchanging gifts later. he joked, curiously eyeing up the book Mandy was holding in her hands. Its something I found in an old bookshop. Mandy explained.. The book itself was bound in red leather, cracked and dry with age. Thin volume smelled faintly of musk and dust. The pages within were brittle and what remained of the books original stitching were barely holding it together. It looked *very* expensive. Mandy opened up the books pages and within were intricate sketches and illustrations of some sort of horned beast, almost like the devil but not quite, engulfed in flames and bones scattered around him. The handwriting was so old I could barely make it out myself but from what I could gather it seemed to be some sort of rhyme in old english. Have you ever heard of Krampus? she asked and when we all shook our heads she continued. Hes sort of like the opposite of Santa Claus. Instead of bringing gifts to to good children, Krampus brings kids who have been bad suffering and torture. Sometimes he even goes so far as to kidnap kids and puts them in a sack so he can devour them later on. Or takes them to the underworld. This book can *summon* him. What do you mean summon? I asked, well-aware of how much my voice quivered. When I looked at Mandy to seek some sort of understanding, I caught a hint of something in her eyes I hadnt seen before - exhilaration. I dont know why, but something about that look scared me. And I could tell by the awkward silence that it had scared Steve and Jake too. Im saying, we can summon Krampus. Get him to scare the shit out of Hayley and her little posse. Ive done most of the work already. Its really simple. Mandys voice had gone from calm to frantic. She pulled out a piece of paper with some names written on it in ink. There was a blood stain just below the names, like a thumb print. All we each have to do, is sign, say the incantation and burn the paper. Its *so* easy. You dont really believe in this bullshit do you? Steve was calm, but I could tell he was just as unsettled as the rest of us. I watched Mandy as her face burned a hot red. I do believe it, and why shouldnt I? Dont you guys see it?! Maybe its *their* turn to suffer. To feel what its like to be an outsider. A *victim*! I l-like b-being an o-outsider. said Jake. B-better that than b-being one of *th-them*. Dont you think? Steve laughed and his deep chuckle lifted the spirit of the room. His face had a softness to it even when it came to rest, as if he lacked the inner bitterness other people. Hed always known he he was and was comfortable with himself. Thats why we all admired him and why Mandy was completely in love with him. Shed never admitted it, but I knew from the way she glanced at him when she thought nobody noticed. Unfortunately, what Mandy didnt know was that her feelings of adoration towards Steve, were unrequited. Mandys gaze shifted from the small piece of paper in her hand, to the floor as if she was pondering what to say next. Out of the four of us, the bullying had hit her hardest. The kids at our school spread a rumor some years ago, claiming the reason for Mandys clubfoot was incest within the family. The rumors grew and well.you know what teenagers can be like when they feel particularly nasty. Come on, Steve placed his hand on Mandys shoulder and I saw her blushing under that unruly, ginger fringe that always seemed to cover her eyes. Lets forget about this and actually open our presents. Ive been waiting all day! Mandy nodded and Steve grabbed the piece of paper from her hand, throwing it into the fire. The ancient pages took mere seconds to go up in flames and just like that, everything went back to normal and we discussed when the best time for opening presents would be. But something shifted in the air that night. A sort of bittersweet and melancholy feeling hung in the air, as we all knew that by the time we parted ways for Christmas, our childhood innocence was coming to an end. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \------- The Christmas holidays arrived and the last day of school felt like a breath of fresh air. My final class of the day was social studies with Mrs Haywood, whose kind, Bambi-like eyes and pin-up style clothes made her look like a glamorous movie star born in the wrong era. It was easy to get lost in her eyes and voice while she talked about neo-pagan Christmas traditions. The bell finally rang out and mass of students made their way out of the entrance, like a hive-mind focused only on one thing: freedom. S-smell ya l-later, Ivy. Jake said as we parted ways. Looking back it now, I realize that out of all of us, Jake was the lucky one. The walk back home was the one time of the day when I finally got some peace of mind. The other kids either got the bus or drove away in their fancy cars but I liked the silence and hearing the snow crunch beneath my feet with each step I took. All the while, my mind drifted back to the night at the club house and Mandys nearly manic plea to summon some ancient Germanic devil. It was unsettling and I truly hoped that the holidays would be good for her. Hey! Wait up! Steve ran up to me, panting as he was catching his breath. Here. He handed me a small packet neatly wrapped in silver paper and tied together with brown string. I opened and inside was a silver bracelet with my initials engraved. I was stumped, and didnt know what to say. So before I could stop myself, Before I could stop myself, I kissed him on the cheek and for a moment we both stood there, giggling like children. I just...didnt want the others to know Id gotten you something else, yknow. I'd never seen Steve blush, he was always stoic, in charge and to be honest, annoyingly self assured. So for the first time ever, our inspired leader showed a sort of vulnerability I didnt even know he was capable of. &amp;#x200B; Thank you, I love it. I told him and it was the truth. Merry Christmas, Ivy. We parted ways and I continued my walk home. I didnt get far until I could see the flashing blue lights of several police cars ahead my and as I walked the alleyway which was my usual shortcut, I noticed the road ahead had been blocked off by police tapes. A couple of curious bystanders were being held off by the police and as my curiosity got the better of me, I peered over the blue tape and stopped, frozen solid in my tracks. The police officers tried to stop me from looking at the grotesque scene directly in front of me but it was too late. It took a few moments before my mind could comprehend what I was seeing. When I did, I vomited on the spot. The wave of nausea that hit me was so intense I barely had time to lean against something, so I fell to the ground before emptying out the contents of my stomach. *It couldnt be.*when I was sure I wasnt going to throw up again, I used all of my strength to push myself up on my feet, and forced myself to turn around because what Id seen was so bizarre, so utterly surreal that I didnt want to believe it unless I looked at it again. Their bodies lay there like ghoulish mannequins, The first one belonged to a girl. Her esophagus and arteries sticking out like so much corrugated and rubber tuning. It looked as though as special effects team had worked over time for a Freddy Kruger horror movie set. The smell was the worst - it was the smell that could only come from recently butchered carcasses. The second victim had been a boy of similar age, although, to be totally honest with you if the forensic pathologist hadnt confirmed his sex, it would have been nearly impossible to tell. His heart had been cleaved from the body. The arteries, now drained of their life fluid, stuck out like so many rubber hoses. His skin was peeled back and the ribs cage had been cracked and pried open, the whiteness of the bone shone out in the sea of flesh. . Two poor teenagers, kids just like myself, who probably had no idea of what was going to happen to them. Except they werent just any kids - I immediately recognized the girls face and her cascading, auburn locks. It was Hayley Nichols, and her boyfriend Eric - two of the usual suspects responsible for much of the bullying over the past few years. I listened to the police officers talking among themselves, apparently their corpses had still been warm by the time the police arrived. The faces were now the grayish color of a cadaver and I couldn't help but wonder how much of the procedure theyd been able to live through. There were rope burns on the wrists and ankles. But the mouth wasn't gagged. Maybe the killer enjoyed the screams. If so, the police officers guessed, this wouldn't be the last victim. &amp;#x200B; \-------- &amp;#x200B; The murder was all anyone would talk about. It was all over the local news, and soon enough people began speculating what might have happened to those poor kids. The killer was still on the run and the police were no closer to figuring out who it was. Over the next couple of days parents were advised to set a curfew for their children and monitor their whereabouts. The whole town was in a bizarre sort of lock down and everyone were terrified. I sat up in my room, skyping Mandy and Jake whod spent the last half hour trying to figure out what the police were going to do next. Its sick isnt it? What the hell kind of person would do that? A psycho - thats who. You dont think Mandys voice trailed off and whispered so quietly I could barely hear her through my headphones. You dont think it was *him* ? Wh--what do you mean him? Jake stuttered Krampus. I mean, Steve threw the paper in the fire. Maybe that was enough to summon him? The laugh came from Jake this time - timid at first, stopping and starting. I could tell from the way he rolled his eyes and half bit his lip that he thought Mandy was being ridiculous. The truth was, so did I but I wanted to stay straight faced. Hey.. Jake said Wh-whats that br-bracelet? Oh, I pulled my sleeve over the bracelet and felt myself blushing against my will. Its nothing. Hey, Ive gotta go but Ill talk to you guys tomorrow okay? I closed down my laptop and stifled a yawn and tried to munch on a rice crispies bar but I still struggled to eat. Nobody prepares you for what it's like to see a dead body or how it makes you feel afterwards. My parents had asked if I wanted to see a therapist and I promised I would but, mostly I was just in shock. I opened the door and notice by the side was a small, square box wrapped in strangely familiar silver paper and brown string. Placed neatly inside was a blood stained dog tag. Almost at the same time, I heard my mom answer the phone but just as quickly, followed by the sound of glass shattering into hundreds of small piece on the floor and my mom shrieking in horror. A few seconds later, her familiar and light footsteps came running up the stairs. She stood in the doorway to my room, her hands shaking and I already knew what she was going to tell me. Its...oh god Ivy...its about Steven. "

Over the next couple of days parents were advised to set a curfew for their children and monitor their whereabouts. The whole town was in a bizarre sort of lock down and everyone were terrified. I sat up in my room, skyping Mandy and Jake whod spent the last half hour trying to figure out what the police were going to do next. Its sick isnt it? What the hell kind of person would do that? A psycho - thats who. You dont think Mandys voice trailed off and whispered so quietly I could barely hear her through my headphones. You dont think it was *him* ? Wh--what do you mean him? Jake stuttered Krampus. I mean, Steve threw the paper in the fire. Maybe that was enough to summon him? The laugh came from Jake this time - timid at first, stopping and starting. I could tell from the way he rolled his eyes and half bit his lip that he thought Mandy was being ridiculous. The truth was, so did I but I wanted to stay straight faced. Hey.. Jake said Wh-whats that br-bracelet? Oh, I pulled my sleeve over the bracelet and felt myself blushing against my will. Its nothing. Hey, Ive gotta go but Ill talk to you guys tomorrow okay? I closed down my laptop and stifled a yawn and tried to munch on a rice crispies bar but I still struggled to eat. Nobody prepares you for what it's like to see a dead body or how it makes you feel afterwards. My parents had asked if I wanted to see a therapist and I promised I would but, mostly I was just in shock. I opened the door and notice by the side was a small, square box wrapped in strangely familiar silver paper and brown string. Placed neatly inside was a blood stained dog tag. Almost at the same time, I heard my mom answer the phone but just as quickly, followed by the sound of glass shattering into hundreds of small piece on the floor and my mom shrieking in horror. A few seconds later, her familiar and light footsteps came running up the stairs. She stood in the doorway to my room, her hands shaking and I already knew what she was going to tell me. Its...oh god Ivy...its about Steven."
125,vulnerability,nosleep,The creature on my ceiling.,1,a2e6hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a2e6hd/the_creature_on_my_ceiling/,2018-12-03 02:41:51," My dad died when I was 3 years old, I cant really remember him at all. He died in an accident at home, he was working on his car when it slipped from its blocks and fell and crushed him, thats what mum told me. I think thats when the creature moved in, it wasnt very big then though, nothing more than those black spots you sometimes see floating around your eyeballs. I noticed it mostly at night, I think its always there though, perched just outside of my periphery. It lives on the ceiling above my bed, it was just a little black speck. It got bigger though, much bigger. After my dad died it was just me and mum for the longest time, she used to tell me stories about dad all the time, how much she loved him, and how much he loved me. He adored you shed say, trying to hide her quivering bottom lip. She tried to hard to protect me from her own vulnerability, she never wanted me to see her struggling or sad, she always put on brave face and just get on with it as she would say. I knew though, when she was sad, I think all kids know when their parents are sad, we can sense it. Something just felt off with her. As the years passed and I got a bit older, mum spoke less and less about dad. She started doing cooking classes during the day while I was at school, she was a natural. Shed bake fresh bread to make me sandwiches for school, cook all of these amazing meals for just me and her for family dinner time, she even went out bought a $1000 knife set, her special knives she called them. Thats where she met him, Robert... Bob, At the cooking class, Mum never really dated, she was always so focused on me and her, she didnt have time for anyone else, but I was heading in to high school and doing well, finding my own independence. I guess she felt that she could finally let her guard down a bit and let someone else in to our little family. Looking back on it I can see why she chose him, he was handsome I suppose, he always made mum laugh, and I had never seen her smile the way he made her smile, she loved him. Id never seen my mum in love, Id only heard her talk about it when she would talk to me about dad. She was happy. It didnt take long before Robert was at our house most nights, they would cook together, family dinner night with Bob was once a week in the beginning, we always had a roast dinner, Mum made the best crispy rosemary potatoes. One family dinner night mum had made the usual roast, Bob was running late that evening, so I was helping in the kitchen. Sweety can you grab the big knife and start cutting up the meat for me?  she asked I grabbed the big knife from mums special knife set and started making the first few slices in to the meat, this knife was so sharp, it made cutting the meat effortless. I heard the front door open and a voice call out from down the hallway. Honey Im home! Bob announced. He came in to the kitchen and wrapped his arms around Mum, and kissed her, I watch his hand slide down the back of her pants, thats when the knife slipped and I cut the end of my finger, nothing serious, but it bled a lot. Shit! Are you ok? He rushed over to me Mum has that queasy look on her face, she never was good at dealing with blood. Im fine mum I said, my finger was pulsing. He grabbed my hand and wrapped it in a tea towel. Finish dinner honey, Ill take care of her he said and lead me towards the bathroom. He flicked the bathroom light on, and shut the door behind us, he stood right behind me with his arms over mine as I washed the blood off of my hands. You should be more careful you know? You could of cut one of your pretty little fingers off I could feel his breath in my ear. I just stood there, frozen, staring at the drain watching the blood and water spiral down. He squeezed the tip of my finger where the cut was, I could feel him pressing up against me, I just kept looking down. I didnt know what else to do. There was a knock on the door. Is everything ok in there? Mum asked Everything is great honey, shes just fine He said as he released me and quickly turned towards the door. Ok well come eat, dinner is ready Mum said as she made her way back down the hall. I couldnt eat that night, I said I felt sick and went to bed early. Mum just assumed it was because I cut myself. Maybe she didnt care. I laid there that night, just staring at the ceiling, staring at the creature that had always been there, it was bigger now. It sat pulsing directly above my face, sticky tar spread out like spiders legs, my heart was racing, I couldnt breath, it felt like I was swallowing golf balls. I cried myself to sleep, quietly, I didnt want mum to hear... or Bob. He started coming in to my room at night, As soon as Id hear the door handle my body would just freeze, paralysed. It wasnt every night, but it was often enough. Id lay there staring at the ceiling as he slithered his way in to my bed, he would rub his hands over my body, put his hands down my pants, rub his disgusting erection against my skin until he finished in his underwear with a pathetic little spasm. Then he would kiss my neck and leave, never said a fucking word. All I could do was lay there, and stare at the black goopy mass spreading its tendrils across my ceiling, it was writhing and pulsing, getting heavier. I thought it would fall, wrap itself around my face and suffocate me. I wanted to tell mum so badly what was happening, I just couldnt bring myself to say the words, I was so scared of what he would do, what if she didnt believe me? I suppose it doesnt really matter now, does it? The last night he came in to my room, it had been a while since he had last visited, maybe a week? I felt his eyes on me all night, it made me feel numb. I remember taking the knife from the block, the big one, from mums special set. Mum has fallen asleep on the couch, her head in Bobs disgusting lap, I walked hurriedly passed the living room where they were, making sure to hide the knife from his eyes, I knew he would be watching me. I got in to my bed and placed the knife under my pillow, then I laid there with the creature, it had spread itself across the ceiling and was now dangling like snot, I watched it grow and writhe and spread down the walls, crawling tentacles slithering their way across the floor towards my bed from all directions. The familiar sound of a late night door handle creaking paralysed the room, the air froze, it felt like I was in a vacuum, floating through space waiting to suffocate. He was sloppier than usual that night, he and mum had been drinking, his breath reeked of wine, he pulled the covers off and climbed on top of me, he started kissing my neck and parted my legs with his knees, I felt his hand between my thighs pulling my shorts to the side, exposing me, he spat on his fingers and rubbed them between my legs. I caught my breath. I reached under my pillow, the whole room was alive now, the creature wrapped itself around me, its tendrils spread up my arm, coiled my hand around the cold metal handle of mums special knife and I stabbed him, I stabbed Robert right in his fucking throat, and before he even knew he had a blade in his windpipe I pulled it out and I stabbed him again, and I stabbed him again and again again and again and again, he rolled and fell on to the floor, I sat on top of him and I stabbed and I stabbed and I didnt stop stabbing until the blade got stuck in the floor boards and the tip of the knife broke off. Then I cut his fucking dick off. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE! Mum screamed from the door way WHAT DID YOU DO!?! ROBERT! She screamed through tears She stared straight at me, with pure hatred burning in her eyes. Ill never forget that look. You fucking bitch, you took him from me! Why couldnt you just let him fuck you!? You selfish cunt! You took everything from me! Even your fucking father loved you more than he loved me! My mother was a very sick woman, turns out she killed my dad because she thought he loved me more than he loved her. She had kicked the block out while he was working on the car. She told me this through gritted teeth, with bits of spittle flying out of her mouth. She had known about Robert coming in to my room the whole time, she probably even encouraged it. She lunged at me and wrapped her hands around my throat, I was drenched in Bobs blood, I could feel her grip slipping in it. I guess one of the neighbours had heard all the yelling and called the police. The next thing I know mum was being pulled off of me, kicking and screaming, last I heard she had killed her self in prison. I felt nothing when they told me. The court determined it was self defence, and they let me go, to try and lead a normal life. That brings me to now, sitting here with you, your blood soaking the sheets. Its wrapped around me again, the creature, it protects me now, my inky black friend. I begged you not to touch me."

He muttered something in what was probably ancient Latin with an unenthusiastic tone- a tone of someone carrying out a task the novelty of which long forgotten. I watched as, without further disruption, the squeak of his kiss on my aunts hand went unheard by the nurses who had rushed by her side. Their attempts to prolong her existence bore no fruit.

128,vulnerability,nosleep,They seemed so nice...,1,a4zy75,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a4zy75/they_seemed_so_nice/,2018-12-11 08:22:31,"I am a 33 year old man. Around 13 years ago, I had the most terrifying experience of my life. It still gives me chills just typing my ordeal out. During that time, I was a security guard at my towns local mall. I had previously lost my driver license, due to a few too many DUIs on my record. So I was forced to walk home every night. The mall that I worked at was a good 8 miles away from my apartment. My security job at the local mall paid for my rent, but I was never on good terms with my few co-workers. Thus, I could never hitch a ride with them. They had a tendency to treat me like shit for a vast variety of reasons. However, going into details would take up a story of its own, but it made work miserable. Despite the toxic atmosphere, I couldnt find anywhere else to work. So I was stuck with the job. I was just getting home from a particular shift. I think it was around 7 PM when I got off. It was a fairly hot day, to the point where it was almost unbearable to walk. After an half an hour worth of walking, a car pulled up right next to me. The driver, a very attractive girl around my age, rolls down her window and asks me if I want a lift. She had curly long black hair that almost touched her ankles, and wore a dark blue dress. There was another girl in the passengers seat with her. Her hair was shaved to a near buzz cut, and her beautiful amber eyes were her most striking detail. The 2nd girl wore a green T-shirt and a pair of jeans. I was really tired of walking home for several hours at a time, and I wanted to spent some...um...time with those girls. So I gladly accepted their offer. That was the worst decision of my life. I climbed into their car, and I sat in between them. It turned out that those girls were twin sisters and were coming home from a late night drive. The passenger was named Margaret and the driver was named Lacey. The girls chatted me up a storm, mostly asking about my relationships with friends and family, my work, my schooling, and my dating life. I revealed to them that I was living alone, and I virtually had no family. My only relative that I knew was my mother. Even then, she committed suicide after I graduated from high school. So I was living on my own with no family, and very little (if any) friends. They gave me condolences, and offered me to come to their house. Being the lonely (and horny) guy that I was, I agreed to go home with them. 25 minutes later, we arrived at the girls home. They lived in a cheap home that was located in a somewhat secluded forest a few miles away from town. I walked inside, and immediately rested on the couch. Lacey turned on Jim Hensons the Dark Crystal for me and her, while Margaret was cooking some lasagna. Soon dinner was ready, and all three of us sat on the diner table. As we were eating, I took a drink from my milk. Without warning, my head started to become incredibly dizzy. After what felt like an eternity (which was probably only for a few seconds), I blacked out. I woke up on a bed with a splitting headache, and feeling very nauseous. I tried to get up, but I couldn't. To my shock and horror, I realized that my wrists were tied to the bed frame, while my ankles were tied together. Within milliseconds, I notice that I have been stripped completely naked. I have never felt so damn vulnerable and violated in my life. I felt a scream coming, but it was muffled by the silk scarf that was gagging my mouth. Suddenly, I noticed Lacey and Margaret standing in the corner of the room. What I saw the look on their faces chilled me to the bone. Both of those girls had the most demonic grin imaginable. I got a sickening feeling in my stomach. They started to walk towards me in such a predatory manner. As soon as they got within a foot away from me, they stripped themselves nude. Due to the sheer feelings of fear, anger, and vulnerability, I was not even remotely aroused by that sight. Instead, it just made me cower in pure terror. Lacey tried to get on top of me, but I managed to kick her in the stomach. She had the wind knocked out of her, but she quickly recovered. Margaret grabbed a kitchen knife, and held it to my throat. She threatened to gut me like a pig if I tried resisting them again. So I submitted, and let them rape me. My god, being violently raped by those two girls was a soul crushing experience. No words can accurately describe the true horror of being sexually assaulted. It is among the most dehumanizing things in this world. On top of it all, it was physically extremely painful. After they were done doing their deed, they tucked me into bed, and left the room. I spent the rest of the night tied to the bed, in a miserable state of struggling to stay awake and not being able to sleep. My attraction for Margaret and Lacey stopped abruptly after that encounter. The next day at around 6 in the mourning, Margaret woke me up and untied me from the bed. Then she tied my wrists and my elbows behind my back. She then escorted me at gunpoint to the kitchen upstairs. When I reached the kitchen upstairs, I observed Lacey cooking some eggs. Margaret then gently placed me on a chair. In a couple of minutes, the eggs were ready. Due to being tied up, I was spoon fed like a child. The eggs were quite delicious and well made, but they obviously never got my mind away from my situation. I begged them relentlessly to release me and let me go home. Their response made my stomach churn horribly. I cant recall exactly what they said to me, but it went something along the lines of This is your home now. You are our little pet, and we will do whatever we want to you. You are never leaving us. Do you understand?. I started sobbing profusely. Margaret and Lacey were completely unmoved, and started to mock me for it. After I was done eating the girls made me quit my job at gunpoint. Then they imprisoned me in a dog cage for the rest of the day. Margaret eventually left for work. I am unaware of what her job is, but she often worked from around 7 AM to around 2 PM. Once Margaret got home, Lacey would leave for work. I also dont know where Lacey worked, but she was usually out of the house from 2PM to 8PM. So I was never alone in the house, and they monitored me like a hawk. That made coming up with escape plans quite difficult. Other than Lacey and Margaret periodically sodomizing me, the rest of the day was uneventful. Unfortunately for me, Lacey and Margaret were very into bondage. They were quite fond of tying me up in a wide variety of ways. So I basically spent 95% of my ordeal chained or tied up in a some way in the basement or attic. To make matters worse, they never followed any safety rules. I cant tell how many bruises I got from being tied up so much. It was a miracle from the heavens that I didnt suffer permanent nerve damage or even lose a limb. The rope burns that I got were absolutely atrocious and painful. I also almost choked to death on my gag twice, but I was saved both times by my captors. I also was kept in a miserably cramped cage for quite a bit of the time. There are only a few things that are more insufferable then being bound and gagged in a small cage meant for medium sized dogs. They further humiliated me, by forcing me to pose for pornographic photographs. I no longer felt like a human being, but a mindless plaything only meant to please my captors. After 3 days of pure hell, I finally saw an opportunity to escape. Margaret and Lacey were busy arguing about something that I did not care much to know about. Meanwhile, I was laying on the couch with my hands and ankles tied. I saw the backdoor was only partially closed. I took the opportunity to push myself off the couch, and crawl towards the door. I managed to drag myself outside the house. Once I hauled myself out of their house, I crawled on the forest floor. I hoped that I could encounter some hikers that could rescue me. Sadly, it took them only a short time to figure out I was gone. It only took about 10 minutes for my kidnappers to find me. Once they found me, they picked me up, and carried me back into their house. Lacey then tied me to a tree next to their house, as Margaret ran upstairs. It was a 5 minute wait until Margaret walked out of the house to fetch me and her sister. They then walked me to their upstairs bathroom. I turned out that Margaret was filling up the bathtub in order to torture me. As a punishment for my attempted escape, they repeatedly dunked my head into the bathtub for a few minutes. I literally thought I was going to drown in their bathtub. This had to rank among the most terrifying experiences in my captivity, along with the first time they raped me. After they were done dunking me, Margaret and Lacey dragged me into the basement. They then tied me to a chair. The ropes were bound so tightly that I thought I was going to asphyxiate. The next night, I woke myself up. Tired of all the abuse I endured, I decided I was going to escape or die trying. I chewed through my ropes, and untied myself. I quietly sneaked out of their house, and walked into the woods. I hiked through the forest trails, looking for signs of civilization. I eventually reached town and found my way to my apartment. As soon as I walked into my place, I collapsed on my couch. I turned on John Carpenter's The Thing to help calm my nerves. Man, it felt good being home. It was like a weight just was thrown off my shoulders. The next day, despite being gone for nearly 4 or 5 days, no one reported me missing. For that moment on, I wished I had friends that had my back, but I never could make myself form relationships. Embarrassed by being kidnapped and raped by two girls much smaller than me, I foolishly never contacted the authorities. I blamed the whole kidnapping and rape on myself. When I reluctantly open up to people about my experience, they would always tell me that I was somehow lucky that I was raped by women. Lucky!?!?!....ARE YOU SHITTING ME!?!?! Lucky is literally the last word I use to describe being violently raped without mercy and treated like a living doll. It took me years to get a peaceful night of sleep. My sense of security took me even longer to recover. I was left with incredibly low self esteem. There would be times that I seriously contemplated suicide. My already alcoholic tendencies increased dramatically. On top of it all, I couldnt find another job, which left me evicted from my apartment. Which in turn left me to live a homeless life for around 9 months. I was stalked by Lacey and Margaret for a few weeks, obviously hoping to recapture me at some point. When they picked me up, I told them where I lived. So it was very common for me to see them waiting for me outside my apartment. Without warning however, they suddenly stopped and left me alone. I had no idea why, but I was just relieved that they were out of my life. Around 6 to 8 years later, I found out that the sisters had kidnapped a 11 year old boy. Lacey and Margaret had abducted him around a few weeks after I escaped their clutches. Interestingly just around the time that they stopped stalking me. They did the same shit to him as they did to me, but he wasnt as lucky. The kid survived, but Lacey and Margaret held him captive for a few years. According to one online article that I read, the sisters were having a party at their house. One of the party-goers found the boy tied up in a cage in the basement. They contacted the police, and the sisters were arrested. They were charged with unlawful imprisonment, sexual assault, and possessing child pornography (like me, they had a disgusting habit of forcing him to pose for pornographic photographs). I cant remember their prison sentencing, but they are still in jail. They will be for several more years to come. I am now a manager at a local Italian restaurant. Although I never started a family or entered a relationship, life has been treating me well. I have plenty of money, a stable home, and I completely recovered from my alcoholism. I found the time to pursue my hobbies in military history, paleontology, politics, and sci-fi and fantasy. All in all, I am completely satisfied with my life now."

He was one of those guys that would enter a room and everyone would simultaneously notice. Not in a good way, or a bad way, but almost the same way your boss would enter a room. People would fall silent, and he would keep his stoic expression. He was about 511, relatively athletic build, but what stood out were his eyes. His eyes were a bright Turquoise, but the whites of his eyes were slightly red, as if he were hung over. His eyebrows curved downward slightly almost like a permanent scowl, but he never seemed or sounded angry or impatient. I had utmost respect for him at the office. He kept his head down, never skipped a beat, and was a fantastic worker, but not a try-hard. He was trouble free, but not goody-two-shoes. He was silent, but not a downer. He was stress free and never complained, but wasnt lackadaisical. The kind of worker a manager really values. He also never once harassed any of the women in the office; in fact the women all noticed and despised the fact that he wasnt drooling over them. However, his eye contact was the elephant in the room. He wouldnt hold a gaze uncomfortably, but when one locked eyes with him, it was compared to locking eyes with a lion. An uncontrollable sense of vulnerability overcame you. Im a pretty easy person to get along with, and Im a bit of an outsider. Not an outcast, but more so a woman that finds other women irritating. It was never the same after my mother screwed over my father, who was a good man, and played victim all along the way. Of course my mother ended up with the house, and my father ended up in the stereotypical shitty apartment while someone lives in the house he paid for. Nevertheless, I opted to spend more time with my father. Im about 54, a gym nut, and big into fishing, football, and off-roading. I never got into girly habits and most people that meet me assume Im bisexual. I may be guilty of experimenting here and there, but thats irrelevant. I decided to invite him out for a drink after work for happy hour. The way he responded really caught me off guard; mainly because Im so used to this plain-vanilla, passive-aggressive fake nice office types. He stood up, looked me in the eyes and said, Tell me your name. I found myself responding in kind My names Morgan. He replied with a warm smile and a handshake, Well Im Jason. Lets do it. At 5 on the dot, he came to my cubicle (god thats such a depressing thing to admit) and said in his commanding tone You Ready? I couldnt help but feel a bit of tension between us, as he was so much more confident and firm in his words than most men. I hopped right up After you, Jason. I dont know why, but this was going to be a good night. I dressed humbly as usual, but Im no prude. I also havent been laid in a while, so Im keeping my options open here. Dont judge me. We walked down the main road in the cool North Florida Fall weather, he wore a thermal with the sleeves rolled up, exposing his vascular forearms, and he wore a necklace which appeared to be made of twine, but had a small brass ring on the end. His hair was pushed upward in the front and a light brown. As we approached the local brewery near the harbor, a woman on a cell phone was walking her overly-hyper German shepherd. I absolutely love dogs, so I instinctively let out an Awwwww and lowered my level. The dog looked very happy to see me but then took a look at Tim, whimpered, and walked behind its owner with its Tail between his legs. The dog growled softly and trembled slightly, and when I looked up at Tim, I noticed he was holding eye contact with the Dog and his eyes were open a little wider than usual. The owner didnt even say anything when Tim switched his gaze to hers, and she looked as if she saw a ghost. She took her dogs leash tight and ran around us both in a big circle, looking back at us the whole time. They just dont understand. He said as he kept walking, I was curious but Im not nosy. We walk into the Brewery and as he sits down he smiles a bit and the 2 bartenders faces light up as Tim gets us a round. He got me a Pumpkin Ale and Himself Stout. Id be lying if I told you this wasnt racial profiling. Not all White Chicks are obsessed with Pumpkins Champ I poked, and after he took a sizeable swig of his Stout, he looked into my eyes, smiled and said I knew you were different. We really hit it off. He was a genuinely interesting person who just happened to not be narcissistic about it. He was very sure of what he wanted in life and very goal oriented. As the Brewery got more crowded and the drinks were flowing, we had even more fun. His eye contact never lost its power though, and it was kind of a turn on for me. This was my cue to start talking shit about the other office-hoes. Jason, you gotta know that the women in the office notice you. I said rather lasciviously. He turned serious for a second and said I do. I dont care. They can think what they want to, but their games wont work on me. Well I didnt invite you out to play games, Jason. In fact I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I regret never talking to you at the office. He proceeded to down his Stout and close is eyes tight. When he opened them back up, I swear his eyes turned a lighter shade of blue, almost like a swimming pool, gleaming impossibly in the darker setting. He leaned towards me and when his eyes met mine I felt almost paralyzed. My place? I agreed before I even realized what I got myself into. Before we left I saw him talk to the female bartender, she got a terrified look on her face, then sprinted to the kitchen, and came back with what looked like a Monster Energy Can. The red one, I don't know what they're called anyway. We finally get back to his, and he turns the lights on. I walk in and notice that his place is sparkling clean, but almost too plain. Kind of like a hospital ward. I turned around and his eyes had gone from swimming pool blue to white. His skin had darkened a shade and when he asked Something Wrong? I noticed that his teeth looked whiter than before. His voice also sounded different. It sounded irate. I began to get nervous, but I was intrigued and a little buzzed, which was just enough to cloud my judgment. Nothings wrong, Jason. I said gently as I glided over to him. He got a mischievous look on his face and he knew exactly what time it was, as did I. I want to thank you for such a great night, and I meanreally thank you. I began to run my hand up his arms and around the back of his neck as I gazed up into his piercingly white eyes. He pulled me in and kissed me deeply, and as he did, I felt energy leave my body. I went from aroused and ready for action to sluggish. I opened my eyes and his eyes were no longer White, they were a serpentine yellow, but there was a wave of drowsiness overcoming me and I felt myself collapsing into something that I couldn't discern. Before I knew it everything was spinning and I woke up, at my office desk. I checked my watch and it was 9 AM. 9 am on the same day. ""What a ridiculous dream"" I thought to myself, who could even think of... There was a Monster Energy Ultra Red on my desk with a post it note. ""You may need this, Morgan. Thanks for the great night. xoxo Jason."" I asked my boss where Jason was when I noticed his desk was empty and she had no clue who I was referring to. Even after I described him the company had no records of ANYONE named Jason working here within the last 8 years. This is getting weird. Break time rolls and I turn on the TV. Someone's getting interviewed for a car accident downtown. I can't discern the face as he was turned to the side, but in an almost terrifyingly quick motion he snapped his head towards the camera. &amp;#x200B; There he was. The Turquoise Eyes The whites slightly red The mean eyebrows The eye contact"
130,vulnerability,nosleep,Train is approaching. Please keep the distance from the edge of the platform.,1,9o1vkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9o1vkl/train_is_approaching_please_keep_the_distance/,2018-10-14 21:51:39,"""Train S1 from Warsaw West station to Otwock station will arrive at track one platform one."" The bland, digitally synthesised voice announced my train home just in time to prevent me from falling asleep on the platform. Like after every shift, I got on the train and headed home. Sun, low over the horizon on the east, confirmed my hypothesis that the shift I just finished was the night one. Cubicle farm I squandered my time in would not be a true place if misery if any sunlight was allowed to penetrate it's bleak, grey interior, so once inside it was easy to lose track of the time of day outside. You, whoever concocted the ""flexible"" work scheduling system my employer adopted, should spend eternity suffering in the deepest pits of hell. Enjoy your kale shake, sipped somewhere in the Silicon Valley through a reusable straw (you have to save the world, right?), while people on the receiving end of your algorithm now go to work at random hours, enslaved by ever-buzzing smartphone in the permanent state of jet-lag. The station I just left consisted of two crumbling concrete platforms perched on the opposite sides of the tracks, disappearing into the [tunnel][1] through the hill on which the city center was situated. On the other side, just outside the station, a bridge carried the trains above nicely renovated tenement houses and far away over the river. Neither roof nor walls protected the passengers from the weather, but they did not obscure the view of the trees growing in the park around the station either. --- ""Train S1 from Warsaw West station to Otwock station will arrive at track one platform one."" Another shift ended. I don't remember whether it was inhumanely early or inhumanely late, but the station was dark and only a few unfortunate souls shared the platform with me. Chilly autumn wind piled golden leaves in the nooks and crannies of the structure, adding a visually pleasing layer on top of piss-stains, graffiti and trash. Then I felt it for the first time. A warm puff from the tunnel disrupted the cool breeze. It came from the depths of the tunnel, probably caused by a train entering it on the other side. The smell made my stomach turn. It should have smelled of rust and grease, but instead the scent made me think of the putrid air escaping a decaying corpse. And the temperature... One could expect the blow from the tunnel to be warmer than the temperature outside, but that one felt like someone actually breathing on my face. ""Some homeless dog must have been minced under train wheels down there"" I explained that unsettling event to myself. If my irregular schedule did not incapacitate my brain, over the weeks that followed I would have surely asked myself why the warm puffs of rotten air from the tunnel suddenly became an irregular, but frequent feature of my daily commute. --- ""Train S1 from Warsaw West station to Otwock station will arrive at track one platform one."" Few months of ""flexible schedule"" and ""grabbing the opportunities of gig economy"" turned me into a barely conscious wreck, crawling between work and home in the permanent state of exhaustion. ""Wait, did one of the lights in the tunnel just blink?"" I saw one of the lightbulbs inside dim, as if something obscured it for a split second. The ungodly hour and way too many hours of work must have caused my vision to play tricks on me. The train approaching the platform lit up the tunnel from within. A shape, scurrying away into the darkness, brushed against the edge of my field of view for a time long enough for the atavistic parts of my brain to label it as something foul and dangerous. It was the first time I experienced hallucinations while standing on that cursed train stop. --- ""Train S1 from Warsaw West station to Otwock station will arrive at track one platform one."" Unresistible force made me turn towards the gaping mouth of the tunnel. Reek of death, now familiar, but still turning my guts inside-out, hit my sense of smell just before I saw the most sophisticated and disturbing hallucination so far. Walls of the tunnel were covered with slimy net of pulsating, veiny substance. Like other hallucinations it lasted just for a second, but it still left a terrible impression that lasted well beyond the moment I boarded the train minutes later. I was aware that something was really, really wrong with me at that point, so theoretically I could have reached out for help. Provided that I could afford it. --- ""Train S1 from Warsaw West station to Otwock station will arrive at track one platform one. Kill yourself you worthless piece of shit."" ""Did somebody hack the announcement system and modify the message?"" I tried lying to myself. --- ""Train S1 from Warsaw West station to Otwock station will arrive at track one platform one."" Shrill, hair-raising scream stopped my mindless wandering along the platform. It came from the tunnel, now swarming with unnaturally huge cockroaches and releasing wave after wave of rotten air. ""God is dead you idiot"" A low voice stated just behind me. ""IT HURTS!"" A little girl screamed from other direction. Seconds after visions appeared everything went back to normal. Fellow passengers, the grey figures wrapped against freezing-cold wind, did not seem to see the hair-raising horrors inside the tunnel at all. --- ""Train S1 from Warsaw West station to Otwock station will arrive at track one platform one."" The gust of wind from the tunnel smelled like a freshly fried doughnuts. By that time I was starting to get used to seeing, hearing and smelling horrible things from the tunnel, but something nice for a change was a real surprise. ""Come closer."" Husky female voice whispered into my ear. I expected this vision to end quickly, like all other visions did. ""Just one step. Please, do it for me."" The female voice, even more seductive this time, proved me wrong. The tone woke up needs an instincts repressed for way too long inside me. All the rationality went outside of the window as soon as my subconscious processed the promises in that tone. I made one step towards the yellow line at the edge of the platform. ""Thank you. One more, just for me."" I moved closer. ""Don't keep me waiting..."" I left the yellow line behind. ""You are almost there..."" Horrible scream and screeching of train brakes brought me back to reality. The train driver had no chance to stop the two hundred ton machine coming out of the curved tunnel. The guy in green jacket, seconds earlier standing next to me on the platform, was now a smear of gore on the tracks. --- Miraculously, after that accident the terrible visions out of the tunnel never haunted me again. Not that they had much chance though: just days later I got and immediately took an offer to switch that awful job for something with a sane schedule in a different part of town. Were the visions just delusions of exhausted, stressed brain, or did they have a more sinister origin? I'm not sure, and I will never be, but deep inside I feel that I know the answer. Something terribly evil lurked inside the tunnel, trying to drive insane, torment and kill, yet the visions were irregular, as if that thing took days off. Moreover, hallucinations never occurred when I was alone on the platform, even though it should have been the easiest to scare me then. The only explanation is that the thing from the tunnel was not after me at all: sleep deprivation-induced vulnerability allowed me to merely ""overhear"" the haunting of the guy in green jacket who died under the wheels.

131,vulnerability,nosleep,Forests of Maine,1,9p0f0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9p0f0z/forests_of_maine/,2018-10-18 03:52:38," I lived in a quiet town of Northern Maine. The onset fog that blanketed each morning had grown comforting in my years. It told me that all was the same, that nothing had changed when I slept, that old Maine was still exactly how I had left it. My mother used to tell me stories, that when she was a little girl, they could keep the doors unlocked. If a stranger were to pass, and enter the threshold of her home, you could bet dollars to every penny, that they could be found in the kitchen. There my grandfather would sit with the stranger, and offer them food at all hours of the night. For out here, it has always been man in the home of nature, and out here we believed that we could only do it together. Although that was some time ago, I still keep the tradition of leaving a small plate in the fridge, in case someone in the night showed, and the incumbent wild, nature of my home, my mother's home, and her father's before, and before, came seeking a piece of human shelter in the bristling blades of this green swallow of earth. Yet, another night passed, and only another breakfast did my small plate serve. I opened the front door, the very same wood that had passed through my grandfather's hands. The one he built after the storm. The only storm that anyone in these parts speak of still. For Maine connected itself with the True North, and I've never heard anyone argue of it otherwise. That was why this morning's clear pasture stopped me from descending the stairs that reached my graveled path below. The silence of the forest poking from the treeline ahead, worried my heart irregular. The white frosted tips that decorated the Maine green in the morning was even dry of dew. And the usual cover of fog that reminded me of the unchanged, was missing too. I swallowed roughly, unknowingly, for the air had changed. This was not how I had left my Maine. A tentative step, reluctantly, as I began to walk the same path I've taken every morning. I passed through the oak and pines, and diverse maples; the ground a blanket that looks more like a quilt of diverse spruce and fir crunched beneath the soles of my runners. I had never heard the forest in such a whisper. My long relationship with nature and seclusion told me that a big kill had died nearby, that the hungry would come, and I had to keep my eyes wide. Things changed when food was readily available; from even the small creatures, to the tiniest bug, that once minded their own, would now seek their fill on the simple weakness of another. For out here, their is nothing poetic, nor sweet, there is only food when food could be had. I had now left my house, nearly a mile. The woods felt unfamiliar to me, giving a sense of excitement. The same tree that I had touched on my passing's everyday now felt strange against the skin of my palm; the bark felt raw and inhuman, as if I were the first person it had ever seen. Every fern that brushed my legs itched, every mushroom hung poisonously, added to my newfound allure of what was once old and familiar. I was young again, living at home, and my parents had left for the first time. The walls were the same, the furniture too. But it was the idea of the empty rooms that gnawed me silently. I could keep them open, but the fear of not hearing them open, made me keep them closed. I could walk in and see for myself, that there was nothing there, perhaps even a small hello; in case someone had been left behind, my sister or my little brother, even a friend of theirs that we had all forgotten. It was the fear of being alone, kneaded into the fear that I wasn't. I had become so engrossed in my new discovery, the chase of each step deeper into these woods that made the hair on my neck bristle, and goosebumps rubbing beneath my North Face that seemed so loud that I had not heard the small scraping sounds until now. I stopped in my tracks. Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. It sounded foreign, not of these woods. Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. It could be a sound made by man. Scrape. Scrape. Scrape. Or a bear rubbing against a tree. Before I realized which direction to follow, I smelled it. The odor of death was fresh in these woods. It made my empty stomach churn as the taste of steel entered my nose and sat on my tongue. I could smell the onset rot that ate away at the deep, red sinew of the open faced carcass nearby. My instincts told me that great predators would be drawn to the kill. That whatever took it down, could still be there now; munching and crunching its bones beneath powerful, rabid jaws, splitting down the long femur for the uncooked, and raw marrow. Salivating for more, as its greed poured from its snout and wet its chin. I could hear its growl in my throat. The forest pounded emptiness into my ear as I followed the flattened path, the deep hooves marked the struggle with upturned leaves and broken branches. The great beast fell once or twice but managed to right itself, though the pack of smaller footprints told me it was too late. It had already been surrounded. My eyes followed the chase into a run, my legs picked up speed until I was nearly at a sprint; I could hear my self panting, breathing, gorging myself with the same open air as they had. I kept running and ducking until it led me to an open clearing. Where I stopped abruptly in my tracks. The moose laid mostly on its shoulder, it had crumpled from the attack. Likely a broken ankle, chewed through by the strong jaws of a wolf. My eyes darted to the edges of the clearing, and there was no wolf in sight; so I inched closer to have a look at the mostly uneaten torso of the great beast. It's hind legs were in ribbons, the stench of its last meal spilled onto the ground, and it's large marbled eyes screamed. I wanted to place a hand on the poor thing, to show it one last act of kindness before time took it from this place. And as I came closer, an illogical sense of fear washed over me, but I was desperate for this act, naive that it mattered, so with my outstretched hand, shaking, I place half a palm on its shoulder, as if the dead cared for my comfort. I felt something move. My heart shot to my throat, causing my scream to stick to my lungs as I fell backward, immobile, stoically accepting my human vulnerability, stereotypical of fear. The small jagged stone and broken cones of pine embedded themselves in my skin. I felt my leg throb as I numbly glanced over the heap of flesh. There tucked beneath the mat of fur was a small bundle with pointed ears, nearly white all over except for the spots of brown near its bushy tail, readying itself for winter, was a rabbit. A snowshoe rabbit. Though its head moved in a way I had never seen. I inched closer again to see it buried deep into the under gut of the moose; and in its mouth, plastered red, it gripped the hind legs of the unborn calf with its two large front teeth and shook a piece loose. Chewing the babe from its mother's womb. A part of me had always known that nature fed to live, that even great carnivores picked at a diversity of nutrition. That I wanted to believe everything can be categorized into little compartments, that everything and everyone I knew to be one dimensional; I wanted to believe that a baseball player should stick to baseball, that a mother should be loving and caring, that a rabbit only eats carrots, while I, myself, felt a plethora of interests and emotions that were as fleeting as I chose. I picked myself up from the ground, brushed the sense of nature from my clothing and returned to the path that led back to my home, exiting the forest behind. When I was younger I believed that we used to be able to keep our doors unlocked. That we fed strangers through our kindness and understanding of the wild secrets of Maine. Now that I am older I know, it's the things man would do when it is scared and hungry, when it is unpredictable, that are truly frightful."

My mother watched as I careened forward, my face meeting the carpet after my first steps. My mother looked for rugburn but my face was completely intact. I was still crying however as there was a sharp prick on my foot and it was bleeding from three newly made puncture wounds. My mother combed the floor for what I stepped on on our thick shag carpet, but besides a stray Lego and a penny, there was nothing there. A week later, however, she was relieved and confused all in one when, as I stepped on an electric plug, a thick red rash appeared on my face as my foot remained unharmed, aside from the small scars that remained from last week. My mom, being a religious person, was convinced it was a miracle. That or a curse. After the priest looked me over and ""sensed no evil"" upon me, she settled on the former. She was a humble woman though, and decided not to be boastful, keeping this to ourselves. My mom's proclamations of ""miracle"" didn't help my ego, however, and I became something of a bully. I was chosen by God after all. I was a 11 year old terror. I beat up any kid who I deemed not worthy of my time and any licks I took I felt later, only feeling a stubbed toe or sore throat at the moment while later, when I stubbed my toe and got the flu, I felt every right hook or weak attempt at retaliation, usually while I was safe at home or in class. My teachers were often confused, however, when I asked to go to the bathroom with a bloody nose and a black eye. This all changed, however, when I met Chris. He was a beanpole, and nerdy as they came(like science and math nerdy, not video games and comics nerdy). He stepped in front of another kid I was hitting with a determined yet scared face. My mom once told me that real bravery isn't not being scared. It's being scared and doing it anyway. Chris was weak and defenseless, but damn did he have courage in spades. I didn't hit that kid that day. Maybe out of disbelief. Maybe out of respect. Maybe out of guilt. But Chris's face stuck in my mind every time I wanted to pick a fight. My bully days slowly petered off until I myself was getting ostracized since I'd punched at least one person from every ""clique"". As I got towards high school, I became increasingly depressed and confused, feeling like a shitty chosen one. This lead to one of the lowest points in my life. At about 14, after a sickening rhythm of wake up, school, home, sleep, with no hobby or friends to dull the monotony of every day life (basing my whole personality on my superiority complex), I decided to hurt myself. The increasing numbness I felt in my heart from my self-prescribed isolation drove me to a dark place. After downing a beer my mom kept in the basement fridge, I took out my pain on my arms. But the more I cut, the more my shin hurt, while my arms stayed pristine and pale like always. My heart skipped a beat, my mind having forgotten my ""gift"" in a moment of muddled passion. I sat for a while just protecting my shins. I was afraid that if I hit my shin on my bed frame in my sleep, I'd bleed out before I woke up. I didn't sleep much that night, having fastened pillows to my shins. Not wanting to look odd or hint to my mom that I was expecting an injury, I went to school completely unprotected. That came back to bite me during 3rd period when the pudgy ginger who took my place as class bully who sat in front of me trusted his foot back and slammed it into my shin. Immediately, my arms bursted open in a sharp pain of steel on flesh. I stifled a yelp, asking to bed excused. I ran out of the room with my long sleeve hoodie soaking up as much blood as it could before it began to drip. I ran into the bathroom having painfully pulled up my sleeves to wrap them in paper towel. Tears streamed down my face and my cries were quick breathed hiccups at this point. As i did my best to stop the bleeding, I heard a stall open up behind me and out walked Chris. He was scared and hesitant at first but when he saw the tears in my eyes, his face gained that same bravery I saw that day on the playground. He dropped his backpack and pulled out an emergency medical kit. He took out the gauze along with a needle and string. And there we sat as he sewed me back up. ""I wanna see CERN one day."" He said out of the blue as he reached the third slice in my left arm. """"Y-Yeah?"" I replied in confusion. ""Yeah. I love science. Medicine. Math. I wanna work there one day,"" He said with a cool determination in his face. I looked at him with a dumb look on my face so he continued with, ""You have to go with me. In repayment for sewing you up. So you can't do this again."" He said, a bit of a voice break betraying his bravery with a sense of vulnerability. He was just a kid after all. I kinda laughed before thinking for a moment. ""Fine. I'll go with you."" I said, weakly punching his arm, ""I'm Mikey by the way."" His smile stretched from ear to ear. Considering I left a trail of blood, we were eventually found. My mom was called. I was sent to a juvenile mental health facility for a long time. Chris and I talked a lot. Whenever I had phone privileges. About a month after I got out, we started dating, and two years later we were married. It's been almost 5 years since then. We got a nice little flat in the middle of Grand Rapids, MI. He taught me how to find enjoyment in life again and eventually I told him my secret. He didn't think I was crazy, cursed, or chosen. He simply said, ""Something else to add to how weird you are."" And laughed. He doesn't know but I've been working extra shifts at the hotel downtown to save up for a trip to Cern for our 5 month anniversary. It was after one of these shift that it happened. I'm a stocky guy. Broad shouldered and bad tempered. Most people don't mess with me when I walk down the street at night. That is until last night. As I was making my way home, a skinny tweaker stopped me and asked if I had money. I politefuly yet curtly said no. He pulled out a gun and pointed it right at my forehead. I was too late to stop him as I tried to reach for the gun which spooked him. It went off and I felt a small, dull pain in my toe. Like I had just stubbed it on a corner table. The tweaker looked at me like he just saw me transform into a werewolf and took off running. I write this now knowing I'm a dead man walking I write this now, afraid of our coffee table. I'm sorry Chris. I won't be able to go to CERN with you. You don't have to put on a brave face. It's okay to cry. "

My mother watched as I careened forward, my face meeting the carpet after my first steps. My mother looked for rugburn but my face was completely intact. I was still crying however as there was a sharp prick on my foot and it was bleeding from three newly made puncture wounds. My mother combed the floor for what I stepped on on our thick shag carpet, but besides a stray Lego and a penny, there was nothing there. A week later, however, she was relieved and confused all in one when, as I stepped on an electric plug, a thick red rash appeared on my face as my foot remained unharmed, aside from the small scars that remained from last week. My mom, being a religious person, was convinced it was a miracle. That or a curse. After the priest looked me over and ""sensed no evil"" upon me, she settled on the former. She was a humble woman though, and decided not to be boastful, keeping this to ourselves. My mom's proclamations of ""miracle"" didn't help my ego, however, and I became something of a bully. I was chosen by God after all. I was a 11 year old terror. I beat up any kid who I deemed not worthy of my time and any licks I took I felt later, only feeling a stubbed toe or sore throat at the moment while later, when I stubbed my toe and got the flu, I felt every right hook or weak attempt at retaliation, usually while I was safe at home or in class. My teachers were often confused, however, when I asked to go to the bathroom with a bloody nose and a black eye. This all changed, however, when I met Chris. He was a beanpole, and nerdy as they came(like science and math nerdy, not video games and comics nerdy). He stepped in front of another kid I was hitting with a determined yet scared face. My mom once told me that real bravery isn't not being scared. It's being scared and doing it anyway. Chris was weak and defenseless, but damn did he have courage in spades. I didn't hit that kid that day. Maybe out of disbelief. Maybe out of respect. Maybe out of guilt. But Chris's face stuck in my mind every time I wanted to pick a fight. My bully days slowly petered off until I myself was getting ostracized since I'd punched at least one person from every ""clique"". As I got towards high school, I became increasingly depressed and confused, feeling like a shitty chosen one. This lead to one of the lowest points in my life. At about 14, after a sickening rhythm of wake up, school, home, sleep, with no hobby or friends to dull the monotony of every day life (basing my whole personality on my superiority complex), I decided to hurt myself. The increasing numbness I felt in my heart from my self-prescribed isolation drove me to a dark place. After downing a beer my mom kept in the basement fridge, I took out my pain on my arms. But the more I cut, the more my shin hurt, while my arms stayed pristine and pale like always. My heart skipped a beat, my mind having forgotten my ""gift"" in a moment of muddled passion. I sat for a while just protecting my shins. I was afraid that if I hit my shin on my bed frame in my sleep, I'd bleed out before I woke up. I didn't sleep much that night, having fastened pillows to my shins. Not wanting to look odd or hint to my mom that I was expecting an injury, I went to school completely unprotected. That came back to bite me during 3rd period when the pudgy ginger who took my place as class bully who sat in front of me trusted his foot back and slammed it into my shin. Immediately, my arms bursted open in a sharp pain of steel on flesh. I stifled a yelp, asking to bed excused. I ran out of the room with my long sleeve hoodie soaking up as much blood as it could before it began to drip. I ran into the bathroom having painfully pulled up my sleeves to wrap them in paper towel. Tears streamed down my face and my cries were quick breathed hiccups at this point. As i did my best to stop the bleeding, I heard a stall open up behind me and out walked Chris. He was scared and hesitant at first but when he saw the tears in my eyes, his face gained that same bravery I saw that day on the playground. He dropped his backpack and pulled out an emergency medical kit. He took out the gauze along with a needle and string. And there we sat as he sewed me back up. ""I wanna see CERN one day."" He said out of the blue as he reached the third slice in my left arm. """"Y-Yeah?"" I replied in confusion. ""Yeah. I love science. Medicine. Math. I wanna work there one day,"" He said with a cool determination in his face. I looked at him with a dumb look on my face so he continued with, ""You have to go with me. In repayment for sewing you up. So you can't do this again."" He said, a bit of a voice break betraying his bravery with a sense of vulnerability. He was just a kid after all. I kinda laughed before thinking for a moment. ""Fine. I'll go with you."" I said, weakly punching his arm, ""I'm Mikey by the way."" His smile stretched from ear to ear. Considering I left a trail of blood, we were eventually found. My mom was called. I was sent to a juvenile mental health facility for a long time. Chris and I talked a lot. Whenever I had phone privileges. About a month after I got out, we started dating, and two years later we were married. It's been almost 5 years since then. We got a nice little flat in the middle of Grand Rapids, MI. He taught me how to find enjoyment in life again and eventually I told him my secret. He didn't think I was crazy, cursed, or chosen. He simply said, ""Something else to add to how weird you are."" And laughed. He doesn't know but I've been working extra shifts at the hotel downtown to save up for a trip to Cern for our 5 month anniversary. It was after one of these shift that it happened. I'm a stocky guy.

135,vulnerability,nosleep,The dream I've been afraid to speak of...,9,9fb7iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9fb7iz/the_dream_ive_been_afraid_to_speak_of/,2018-09-13 06:06:33,"It happened in the early morning hours, six years ago in the house where I grew up. I lived in a large farmhouse built nearly 200 years ago. My parents had spent years renovating the house into a beautiful home, but the floorboards always creaked. I swore the house would sway sometimes, constantly settling under the elements. I was a senior in high school, caught in the throes of final papers and exams. I had spent the night with eyes glued to textbooks. By 2:30 AM, I could hardly keep my eyelids open and knew it was time that I finally retire to my bed. The house was quiet. The only noises to be heard were the trees rustling outside in the brisk spring breeze and the house making its typical moans. My mom had been asleep for hours behind her closed bedroom door. I sleepily slipped into my shirt and pajama shorts, and climbed under the covers. Eyes already closed, I reached for the cord to my lamp and turned out the light with the weak flip of a switch. What I experienced next still leaves me with questions, about the peace and blackness of my room that night. Worn from all the schoolwork I had done, it wasnt long before I was sinking into a deep sleep. I heard my cats gallop down the hallway, chasing each other most likely. A funny and familiar sound. Still drifting, I was somewhere between asleep and awake then. Somewhat conscious of my surroundings, I heard the floorboards in my room whine once. Normal. But then again and again. I half-heartedly came to, glancing into my room dimly lit by the light on our garage. That was when I noticed a darkness shrouding the corner by my closet. It wasnt a figure, something that couldve been figment of my imagination. It was a tall blackness that starkly contrasted the blue glow of the light, so opaque that it looked solid enough to touch. I tried to blink the sleep from my eyes, failing to understand what I was seeing. I laid on my side, practically falling off the edge of my bed as I peered drowsily into the night. I felt the other side of the bed depress. All at once and without time to react, the covers pulled taut over me. Beneath them, what felt like two spindly hands wrapped around me from behind. I was being pulled backward, its bony fingers buzzing on my chest. Hot, rancid breath crept into my ear and down my shoulder, You will die tonight. I shot up in bed, completely awoken from sleep. Flailing for the light switch, I flipped it on and spun to look behind me. Nothing. The corner by the closet was only occupied my by backpack on the floor - nothing that could cast such a large shadow. My sweaty hands gripped the sheets, practically puncturing them with my nails. I didnt sleep again for hours, until morning light began to peak through. Still, I drifted off with the lights in my room left on. I still dont know why actually happened to me that night. I like to tell myself that it was just a sickening nightmare. The words it said, the hands I felt - just cheesy tricks of the mind. But I cant help the thought that maybe, in the vulnerability of my half-sleep, something wanted to take me. It was the first and last time I ever had such a dream. Im just glad I woke up."
136,vulnerability,nosleep,Please board the windows,174,9h5fsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9h5fsc/please_board_the_windows/,2018-09-20 00:06:01,"Isn't it interesting how people can share their fears? When I was little, my aunt used to have a room filled with porcelain dolls. For years I slept in this room and never had any problems, but then one day my cousin told me that *she* could never sleep in that room because the dolls crept her out. I could never sleep in that room again. I'm not really afraid of dolls anymore, but there is another fear I contracted as a kid that's stuck with me up through now: windows. I was over at my friend Ronnie's house for a sleepover birthday party, andlike at all sleepoverswe stayed up late goofing off before falling asleep. Ronnie had an older stepbrother, Reggie, who decided to join in on the party. In retrospect, Reggie was kind of a weird guy, but he was older than we were so we all thought he was pretty cool, though Ronnie didn't like him much. Anyway, we were trying to tell scary stories, but we all sucked at it; we kept acting scared, but really we were just having a good time trying to tell stories. Then it was Reggie's turn. ""This isn't really a story,"" Reggie began. ""It's just something that happens sometimes."" The entire room fell rapt and still. Reggie continued. ""Our houses don't really protect us. Things come and go all the time. Usually, it's just bugs, like spiders and stuff. Sometimes little animals get in, like mice or slugs. But really anything can get in. In Florida sometimes people come home and find alligators in their houses..."" Even as a kid I had heard all of this before, but it was uncomfortable to think about. I was scared of spiders and slugs and I didn't want to think about them crawling into my room at home. Reggie's ""story"" was creeping me out. ""Sometimes, people come in."" This was the moment that ruined me. This was the moment I felt that deep sense of dread seep in through the hairs on my back and into my spine. I can trace it all back to Ronnie, and his sleepover, and Reggie's stupid story. ""Just like the bugs and animals, sometimes people just come into your house. They crawl into your basement and hide there for a little bit. Sometimes they peek through the cracks in the basement door and watch you and your mom and dad walking around. But it's not just the basement. At night, sometimes people come into your house and rummage through your kitchen. They want food, and if they can't find any they like, they'll even peek into the bedrooms to see if there's any tasty snacks in there."" Every one of us was completely still. The story was bad enough, but Reggie was starting to get a little weird. As he went on, it seemed like he was losing track of what he was saying. He stared past the group, at the bedroom door behind us, and his words became a drone that seemed more mindless than anything. I wanted the scary stories to be over; I just wanted to go to sleep. ""Most people lock their doors, so people can't get in that way. Instead they crawl in through the windows. Before they come in they'll get up close to the window and look around in the room to see if someone's there. That's why sometimes, if you turn around really quickly, you'll catch a glimpse of someone's face in the window, looking in at you"" I felt something warm in my underwearI'd peed my pants for the first time in years, which was enough to break the spell. Ronnie's mom yelled at Reggie for scaring us, and she gave me a pair of Ronnie's underwear to wear, but I wasn't able to sleepor look at the windowsfor the rest of the night. In fact, for the next six months I slept in my parents' bed, even though I was much too old to do so, and I insisted on covering up my windows when I finally moved back to my own room. I was always afraid that if I looked out, I'd see someone standing there, staring back at me.  A few months ago I got my first real job, and it was time I finally moved away from home. I packed my bags and headed to Denver, Colorado to try to find a place to live before my start date. I found an ad on Craigslist for a house to rent that seemed like a good deal, but not *such* a good deal that it seemed too good to be true. ""Ranch-style home with lots of natural light!"" the ad bragged. ""VERY PRIVATE."" The pictures looked great online, so I scheduled a viewing. The landlord was a scraggly middle-aged woman who was so aloof that I first thought I'd gone to the wrong address. She told me that she actually lived in Arizona, but her property manager had quit right after the previous tenant broke their lease. She moved back in to her house in Colorado but wanted to find a tenant quickly so she could get back to her family in Arizona. The house was indeed beautiful, but I started to feel uneasy at the large number of windows installed throughout the home. Every room had, at minimum, two glass doors to the outside, and most rooms had an extra large-pane window for additional viewing. I had just come from several years of dorm rooms and basement apartments, so I hadn't needed to confront my minor phobia until now. ""Any chance we could board up the windows?"" I had meant it to sound like a joke, but it came out with the tones of a serious request. ""You too, huh""she sighed. I was expecting more resistance, since my request was ridiculous, but I guess someone else before me had asked for the same thing. ""The last tenant asked about that too. No, we can't board up the windows"" ""I was just kidding""my embarrassment covered up the fact that I absolutely *would* have boarded up those windows, had I been allowed. I signed the lease and moved in just a few days later. I was relieved to finally have my own place, but as night approached I felt dread take over like I had not felt in years. At first I casually strung up some sheets in front of the larger windows, but as sunset approached I found myself quickening my pace as the anxiety set in. Tape, garbage bags, anything would do, so long as I could cover all of the windows before sundown. I made sure all the doors and windows were locked, and then, huddled with blankets on my bed, I waited. I knew right away that the night would pass slowly and sleeplessly. The first sounds came from my bedroom window. A light tapping followed by a couple almost imperceptible thuds. Something or someone was testing the glass to see if it would give. As the minutes crawled by, I waited in terror as the scratches and taps traveled the perimeter of the house from one window to the next. Like a dentist probing for cavities, the would-be intruder tested every corner and crevice of the windows, looking for any vulnerability that would let it in. Finally, it reached the front door. At first it started with the usual picking and prodding, but then I heard a faint screeching, like metal being dragged along the glass. The scrapes were short and infrequent, like they were trying to avoid making too much noise, but they persisted for several minutes. Then, finally, the noises were gone, and I felt some brief relief, until my phone rang seconds later. I'd stayed tense and still for hours, so I didn't dare move now to pick up the phone. It rang, went silent, and then notified me that I had a voicemail. Very, very slowly I reached for my phone, unlocked it, and listened to the voicemail. It was my landlord. ""Hey, sorry to call so late at night, but I forgot to tell you something and it was bothering me. I did some painting right before you moved in and you probably don't want to be breathing in those fumes all night. You should probably crack a window or something before going to bed. Anyway, you're probably asleep already, but I just wanted to let you know."" There was no way that was a coincidence, no way my landlord just so happened to call and ask me to open a window as soon as the intruder gave up. I knew I wasn't safe. My fear boiled over as I thought back on everything I'd gone through. Why had the previous tenant asked to block the windows? Why did the landlord travel all the way back from Arizona just to lease this house? Why did she call in the middle of the night, right when the noises stopped? *Why was Reggie looking at the door when he told his story*? I needed to leave. I needed to get far, far away from this goddamn house. I clutched every last scrap of courage inside me and ran for the back door, which led out to the patio. I unlocked the door and ripped it open, bounding out through the patio, into the neighbor's back yard, and out to the bordering street. I pointed myself toward the local downtown and ran, desperately fleeing whatever was looking for me at the house. Eventually I felt just barely safe enough to stop and fill my heaving lungs, surrounded by empty city streets. I was safe, I felt, now that I was in a somewhat public space. After a moment to reflect, I pulled out my phone and bought a plane ticket back home. Then I called a taxi service and took myself to the airport, never to visit this place again. ... I reached home, manic and paranoid. I needed to talk to Reggie. I needed to know what he was thinking of when he told that story. I didn't know how to find him, but I *was* able to find Ronnie's address through my high school class's alum directory. I hadn't slept since what happened in Colorado, but I needed to resolve this, so I left to visit him right away. The house at the address listed seemed like it may have been abandoned; the windows were boarded up and there was no car in the driveway. I tried the front door but it was stuckor locked, it was hard to tell. Still, I was desperate, and with a bit of effort I managed to climb up over the garage and get access to a window on the second floor. I tried to look inside but this window was boarded too. In the end, I decided to pry it open and step inside. I needed to know if Ronnie lived here. The inside of the house was dusty, but it didn't seem abandoned. The room I'd entered seemed like a study, garnished with some chairs and a few bookshelves. I slowly crept away from the window, and as I approached the doorway I heard a faint sound coming from inside the house. Following my ear, I made my way down the hallway and approached a room with a closed door. The sound grew more descript, now clearly a whimper. I leaned forward and set my ear to the door. ""Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Stupid Reggie go away please stop please stop Stupid Reggie..."" I leaned down to peek through the crack at the bottom of the doorway. Through the slit I could see a man, very young, sitting on the floor. He had his knees to his chest and was holding his head in his hands, rocking back and forth. ""Stupid Reggie, leave me alone"" Though I hadn't seen him in years, I could tell this was Ronnie. What a relief! I'd finally found him! And here he was, nestled so cozily in this house where there were no windows because he'd covered them all up. I felt a connection to him just then, realizing that we'd been living the same nightmare all this time. I wanted to talk to him, but he seemed like he didn't want to be bothered, so I slowly left his room to wait in the rest of the house. I'm still waiting to talk to him. Sometimes he stops whimpering and I approach his room, but he starts again when I get close. Sometimes I watch him through the crack in his door, because seeing him so scared makes me feel a little better about how I handle it. But also it's nice to have him here, because I'm less scared when I'm not alone. People come by and drop groceries by his front door, so I bring them in for him. I eat some, because I need food too, but I always leave the good stuff for Ronnie. He must know I'm here, because I think he's caught me looking at him beneath the door once or twice, so he knows I'm taking care of him. Recently, though, Ronnie's been sleeping a lot. He must have stayed awake for a long time like I did so he needs a lot of sleep. In fact I haven't heard him whimpering for over a day now. That's good. I'll watch him until he wakes up. "
137,vulnerability,nosleep,The Scalp of Rabid Wolf,6,9i4brq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9i4brq/the_scalp_of_rabid_wolf/,2018-09-23 10:10:22," Of the early days of the world, after our ancestors crossed the Bering Straight and millennia before any of the tribes we know of today existed, very little is actually remembered. Sure, there are tales of the beginning of Man, and of the Earth, but those are only fables legends told to explain what was then unexplainable. This, however, is not a fable, but a story. A story probably distorted by time, but at its core true nonetheless. It is in these murky depths of history that the story begins, more than ten thousand years ago. It was in a large depression west of the Appalachians, in what is now known as middle Tennessee, that the tribe of the Utlavgitle resided. At one time the leader of a great alliance of tribes, their expansive influence had long since been shattered, and they were now nothing but mere ghosts of their former selves. For generations, they had been oppressed by the surrounding larger tribes, forced by threat of annihilation to make frequent payments to them, and were in desperate need of a warrior who could lead them back into their former glory. Rabid Wolf was known far and wide as an exceptional warrior of one of those outlying tribes. He himself was something of a living legend at the time, seen almost as a living demon. It was said of him that his eyes blazed with black flames, that he drank blood for water, and that as a child he had carved his own heart out with a knife, leaving a grizzly hole in its place. Needless to say, Rabid Wolf was a fearsome warrior with little regard for any ethics or morality. As such, he one day found himself in an argument with the chiefs son, which ended with the death of the son, and, consequently, Rabid Wolf being banished from the tribe. He tried to go to the other tribes, but none would have him save the Utlavgitle. Upon being accepted into his new home, an idea occurred to him, one that would not only benefit him, but also the people of the tribe. The Utlavgitle, though heavily oppressed, were plentiful in numbers, and Rabid Wolf thought that with the right kind of leadership, it would be possible for them to reclaim their old power from years before, and if he were to be the one to do it, then he could also enact his revenge upon his former tribe. His plan was not without risk, however, and Rabid Wolf knew this and perhaps understood it better than anyone. The lands of the Utlavgitle were surrounded by less-than-friendly tribes who were united in their oppression of the Utlavgitle, and could easily squash them like maggots if they so pleased. So, he made a proposal to the chief, who knew well of Rabid Wolfs skill in battle: let him conduct a series of mock wars within the tribe, with the chief leading one side and Rabid Wolf leading the other. If Rabid Wolf should win ten out of thirteen of these mock wars, and each time convince the captured warriors to willingly fight for him, then Rabid Wolf should be allowed to lead the Utlavgitle into war to claim the territories of the surrounding tribes in real war. The chief agreed, and not only did Rabid Wolf win all of the mock wars, but each time only the chief was left standing against Rabid Wolfs men, as all of the others had been successfully convinced to join his ranks. Having passed with flying colors, Rabid Wolf immediately became the second in command, and, after many months of preparation, led the warriors of the Utlavgitle out to reclaim the honor that had been stolen from them decades before. Once they set out, they began to gain their former territory very quickly. Despite the lack in numbers of the Utlavgitle warriors in comparison to their enemies, under Rabid Wolfs leadership, they soon became unstoppable in numbers and skill. Within five years, it is said, the Utlavgitle Empire stretched all the way from the Appalachian Mountains of the east to the Rocky Mountains of the west, with nothing in between free from their rule. Village after village burned, tribe after tribe was taken, and person after person was killed. Rabid Wolf himself is said to have slain over three thousand men, women, and children, and to have raped even more women and girls. Yet, despite this, people flocked to his army like gnats to a light, for it seemed that few were immune from the power of his persuasion. That is not to say, though, that there weren't those who deeply despised the Utlavgitle and their precious Rabid Wolf. No, it would have been impossible for them to not have many bitter enemies, and many bitter enemies they had, chief amongst them the Aklak from the north. The Aklak were a large tribe along the coast of what is now known as the Hudson Bay, and they had been recently advanced upon by Rabid Wolfs army. Initially only angered by their advancements, they were soon further enraged when they began to hear tales of Rabid Wolfs vileness. Rabid Wolf, too, was becoming more and more agitated as time went on, for though they were a small-statured people, the Aklak were some of the fiercest fighters of the time, and as such, the Utlavgitle, no matter how hard they tried, could not manage to defeat them. To their advantage, though, they remained elusive, constantly on the move so that the Aklak could never find out where their main camp was. Nevertheless, in spite of their best efforts, a band of Aklak scouts did one day spot Rabid Wolfs camp along the Hudson River. Knowing that they had little time to act before his camp moved again, the scouts hurried back to the chief, who promptly sent three of his stealthiest warriors to sneak into the camp and assassinate Rabid Wolf in his sleep. And so, veiled by the darkness of night, the assassins snuck into Rabid Wolfs tent and strangled him with a rope. To prove to their chief that they had indeed killed the villain, they took a large strip of his scalp, and left the camp. The chief was pleased, and without the military genius of Rabid Wolf, the empire of the Utlavgitle soon began to fall, and things, for the most part, returned to how they were before the rise of the Utlavgitle. Rabid Wolfs body was brought duly back to his birthplace in present-day Tennessee, where he was to be ceremoniously buried. To make sure that it didn't completely decay on the way back, his body was preserved, though it was poorly done, at that. When the body was finally brought back home, the villages medicine man saw where the piece of Rabid Wolfs scalp had been taken. Being a devout supporter of him and knowing that only the Aklak could be the ones responsible, he performed a very complicated and very dangerous spell so that as long as any part of Rabid Wolfs body remained in existence, his spirit would live within that piece. According to the legend, soon after this was done, the Aklak were hit by a mysterious plague that caused a fatal inflammation of the throat. In his pride and on his deathbed, the chief of the Aklak ordered the scalp to be expertly preserved and sealed in a great willow tree that stood in the center of their village, for he could not bear the thought of his greatest trophy ever being lost. Never did any of the Aklak know of the curse that was placed upon it. There the scalp of Rabid Wolf remained for many centuries, until almost none of the tribes of Rabid Wolfs day existed, and his Empire was no more than a myth. That is, until one sweltering summer afternoon, a small boy of the Aivig tribe came across the tree that contained the scalp of Rabid Wolf. The once magnificent tree that had stood in the middle of the Aklak village all those centuries ago was now dead and decrepit. The sealant, now chipped away in a spot, was what had caught the boys eye. Upon closer inspection, he saw that the sealant in fact covered a hollow in the trunk, and so the boy picked at the small hole until he could put his arm in and feel for whatever was inside the trunk. After a moment, he felt what seemed to be human hair. Driven by his growing curiosity, he picked away at the hole until he could finally bring out the scalp. Immediately upon pulling it out of the tree, the boy felt an awesome power flowing through his body from the scalp. Exhilarated by this incredible find, the little boy, whose name was Soaring Tree, raced home to show his grandmother. However, his grandmother, who had grown up hearing the tale of Rabid Wolfs scalp, knew instantly what it was, and immediately took it to the tribes shaman, who attempted to destroy it, but failed. Both the shaman and Soaring Trees grandmother were found soon afterwards mysteriously dead. Soaring Tree, who was close to both his grandmother and the shaman, felt a strange lack of remorse for this sudden loss, which was very uncharacteristic of him, as he was usually a sensitive and caring person. Later, when everybody was asleep, he snuck into the shamans tent and retrieved the perfectly intact scalp. Over the next several weeks, his conscience grew heavier as guilt built up within him about his lack of grief. Seeing an opportunity, the spirit of Rabid Wolf used this vulnerability to gain a stronger foothold on Soaring Tree, so that the dead warriors spirit could slowly devour that of the childs, with the goal that eventually Soaring Tree would be nothing more than a shell for Rabid Wolf, who would then live through the childs flesh in addition to his scalp and distantly buried bones. Over the years, Soaring Tree grew into a warrior, the greatest of his people, and all of the surrounding tribes grew to fear the Aivig because of him. And though he was young in age, his leadership was exceptional, for as he approached manhood, very little of his original spirit remained, so that in character and expertise he was nearly identical to Rabid Wolf, though he did not consciously know it. Then there once came a morning when Soaring Tree came into conflict with the chief of his tribe. After several heated words, they engaged in a traditional unarmed battle to the death for the position of the chief, as was Aivig custom, with the chief trying to keep it, and Soaring Tree fighting to take it. With the spirit of Rabid Wolf to guide him in addition to his own natural fighting ability, Soaring Tree ultimately killed his opponent and became the successive chief of the formidable Aivig tribe. After this point, the story of Soaring Tree becomes much the same as Rabid Wolfs from centuries before. He killed and raped by the thousands, and in addition to that he also regained every last inch of the ancient Utlavgitle Empire, with new lands to add. It is no secret that names hold power, and this was no less true back then as it is today. And in Soaring Trees time, his name was probably the most powerful one in North America. For some, the name of Soaring Tree was something to fear. For others, it was something to hate. But, because of Rabid Wolfs skill in speech and persuasion, for most it was a symbol of hope a great beacon of light to stand behind until the very end. And though it seemed that Soaring Trees greatness would never end, his greatness, as all things eventually do, one day did come to an end. Soaring Tree was old, and though he hid it well, he was dying, and he knew it. He was on the Colorado Plateau, headed south, when he died painfully and alone in the night. His body was brought back to his home in the north, where he was buried as a warrior, along with the scalp of Rabid Wolf, though none knew of its significance. The people mourned, and Soaring Trees successor, though not nearly as good as Rabid Wolf or Soaring Tree, was better than the successor of Rabid Wolf insomuch that the Aivig Empire did not crumble immediately afterwards. However, while it did not lose any territory, no new lands were gained, either. The Aivig Empire simply remained in a state of expansive stagnancy. About a hundred years after Soaring Trees death, the empires leader, Falling Stone, desperately wished to expand the already expansive empire further south. However, despite his best efforts, Falling Stone could not do this. At least, not on his own. All knew of Soaring Trees greatness, yet few knew why he had been such a phenomenal warrior and leader. Nonetheless, as it is with many things, the truth, though diluted and distorted, lived on in the shapes of rumors and legends that few took seriously. Falling Stone had grown up hearing these tales, but hed never taken very much stock in them. But as time wore on, Falling Stone couldn't help but wonder if perhaps there wasn't some truth to these stories after all. Knowing that hed be ridiculed if he went chasing after it, Falling Stone initially refused to go searching for the fabled scalp. But failure persisted, and out of desperation Falling Stone finally gave in and headed north to find Soaring Tree's grave. There he found not only the rancid bones of Soaring Tree, but also the legendary scalp of Rabid Wolf, and just like Soaring Tree had more than a century before, Falling Stone felt a tremendous power surge through his body the moment he laid hands upon the old scalp. Delighted with this new invigorating power and visions of conquest, Falling Stone hurried back down south and shared his secret with none save the awakened beast that hung from his hip. As with Soaring Tree, Rabid Wolfs spirit tried to slowly devour that of Falling Stone, but found that success would be difficult. Soaring Tree's spirit had been young and vulnerable when it had come into contact with the cursed scalp and encountered Rabid Wolfs demented hungry spirit, making it easy prey. However, Falling Stone was old, grizzled, and war-hardened, and so was his spirit, and because of this, the two were constantly battling for supremacy over Falling Stone. It is said that a house divided cannot stand, and such was the case for Falling Stone, though Falling Stone did not know it. As the unconscious battle within him waged, his leadership in real battle declined. The old emperor was finding the push southward increasingly more difficult, and eventually found that the Aivig push was now being pushed backwards. Around the time that they had been pushed back to where theyd started in the first place, news reached the emperor of rebellions erupting all over the empire, and though he tried as hard as he could, Falling Stone could not keep his great empire from trickling out of his old grizzled clutches, for that battle inside still raged on. Then, at the solemn end, the Aivig Empire collapsed completely, and so too did Falling Stone. As far as the different versions of the story go, some say that the scalp was buried along with Falling Stone, while others say that somebody who knew it for what it truly was took it and kept it hidden somewhere safe. Some even say that the scalp was handed down through the ages as an adopted family heirloom, but no matter the ending, each version of the story is very consistent in one thing: that the scalp of Rabid Wolf still exists to this very day. And now I know the truth, for my grandfather has just very recently passed away, and before he died he handed me an Indian scalp as a rite of passage as I leave behind my childhood and travel forth into manhood. My grandfather said that I must keep it locked away, somewhere safe and hidden. But I am no fool. This scalp is too valuable a resource to just leave locked away. No, I will be the first to finally control it, and I will go down as one of the greatest men in history. How will I control it, you might ask? Easy: I have history to teach me. Soaring Tree was too weak to coexist with the scalp, and Falling Stone was too ignorant to know that the scalp would try to consume him. But I am not weak, nor am I ignorant. I will coexist successfully with Rabid Wolf, and together, we will conquer the world. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [URL"

While Jake was in surgery, I was settled on a bed with a gown too big for me, an IV in my arm, and a cup of lukewarm orange juice in my hand. Other than exhaustion, dehydration, bruises, and abrasions, I was deemed fit for questioning. Officer Jackson had been with me for the past twenty minutes, patiently trying to grill me regarding the murders inside the cabin. The gruesome, ungodly murders of five unidentifiable males that were discovered by Nans grandson. The photos Officer Jackson showed me were horrifying. The bodies were barely recognizable. Barely, unless you knew them well. And I did. They were the corpses of The Maniac and his four thugs. What was done to them was inhuman but I knew that kind of evil existed. I was a first-hand witness to The Maniac and his thugs themselves proudly flaunting it. But they didnt do this, not this time. Someone else lurked in this world with just as much bloodlust and cruelty. It frightened me. I was just glad Jake and I were spared, as defenseless as we were. What also frightened me was the fact that Jake and I would never be safe. With The Maniac dead, another will take his place. We wouldnt even be safe in prison. The only relief I had was the absence of Nans photo among the victims. I wondered why Officer Jackson hadnt mentioned her yet. I wanted to ask, but I didnt want to involve myself. I wished Jake was with me, he was much better at dealing with these sort of things. I exercised my right to remain silent as Officer Jackson bombarded me with questions regarding our purpose being there, the identity of the victims, my identity, Jakes identity, and the reason we were tied to trees. After many futile efforts on his part, a nurse walked in and sternly asked him to leave and let me rest. I was grateful for her interruption as Officer Jackson shot me an exasperated look and excused himself, informing me that hed return tomorrow. Despite my discomfort and worry, fatigue was quick to rob me of any autonomy as it plunged me into a heavy, dreamless sleep.  I woke up to the sun casting striped shadows on the wall. I jumped up in bed anxiously, then groaned as my body remembered last nights ordeal. When a nurse walked in with breakfast, I immediately asked about Jake. When she told me he was in recovery, I requested to see him, only to be told that it was up to the officers who had been waiting to talk to me. As if on cue, Officer Jackson walked in the room with a tray of coffee and muffins. Another officer joined him, this one cradling a large file. Good morning, son. Im Officer Ross. We thought you might appreciate something fresh for breakfast. Officer Jackson placed the coffee and muffins on the overbed table next to my breakfast tray before they each took a cup and sat down. The muffins smelled a lot more tempting than the cold slab of yellow on my plate and I nodded in thanks as I hungrily reached out for one. After a few ravenous bites, I decided to try coffee for the first time in my life. I took a sip and grimaced, pushing the cup away, disappointed that it didnt taste as amazing as it smelled. I didnt understand why people in movies were always drinking it. Officers Jackson and Ross didnt seem to mind it either. I washed out the taste with some water and went back to devouring my muffin. As I ate, Officer Ross pulled out a photo from his file and flipped it over to me. It was a photo of some middle-aged guy. I furrowed my brow. He placed the photo on the overbed table and pulled out another, holding it in front of me for a few seconds before placing it on top of the first photo. He did this five more times before he held up a photo of Nan, exactly as we had seen her. I think the recognition was obvious on my face as Officer Ross pointed to the photo. It seems like you know this woman, dont you? You were found next to her cabin. I tried to remain unresponsive, but my concern over Nans well-being was overpowering. Is she okay? I asked hoarsely. Officer Jackson straightened up. Finally, good to have you join us. How about you give us your name as a start? I just wanna know if Nans okay. How about this, son, Officer Ross said, You tell us everything you know, and well tell you everything we know. I knew an unfair deal when I heard one. I shook my head. Officer Ross wasnt deterred. You called this woman Nan just now. H- No I didnt. Yes you did. How do you know her? I just wanna know if shes okay. Son, were here to help you, Officer Ross said. As far as I can see, youre a victim too. How about you help us officers out? This case has gotten us thrown for a loop and we can definitely benefit from your knowledge. You seem like a reasonable young man. We know your experience was daunting but, rest assured, youre safe and were on your side. I frowned as I wondered if this was one of the tricks cops pulled to ease you into spilling your secrets. Son, Officer Ross continued, Nan is depending on you. Without your help, she could be in grave danger. I looked at him worriedly. Shes in trouble? Tell us what you know. Let us see what we can do, he gently persuaded. I caved in, but twisted the truth just enough to protect Jake and me. I introduced myself as Will Preston and Jake as Theo Logan. I told them that we had gotten lost hiking two days ago and entered the supposedly abandoned cabin only to be welcomed by Nan. I told them that we hung out with her and cleaned up the house for her. I told them that The Maniac and his thugs were random bad guys who broke in. I told them that Jake and I tried to draw their attention away from Nan by running away, but they caught us. I told them that the bad guys went back inside when they heard the radio humming. I told them that we saw a car approach the house at night and assumed it was the grandson. I told them that, not long after, the police arrived and, not long after that, an explosion drew them out and they found us. During my statement, Officers Ross and Jackson were staring at me with the most perplexed looks on their faces. I broke out in a cold sweat as I wondered if they could tell I wasnt being a hundred percent truthful. Officer Ross held up the photo of Nan. So, youre saying you saw this lady, Nan, yesterday? Yes. What happened to her? Theythey didnt hurt her, did they? I asked, my voice cracking as guilt invaded my vocal chords. Whos they? Officer Ross asked. The bad guys! Officer Jackson pulled out one of the crime scene photos. These bad guys? I winced as I looked at the horrifying image again. Yes. Those bad guys. Do you know who they are? Officer Jackson asked. No. Do you who did this to them? No. Did you hear or see anything suspicious from the direction of the cabin? Violent movement? A struggle? Did you see or hear anyone else approach or leave the cabin? No, just the car at night at then the police. Diddid the same thing happen to Nan? I asked anxiously. Officer Ross ignored my question by asking, Son, why dont you tell us what you know about Nan? Shes very nice, I replied. She said she was sorry for not having food, cause her idiot grandson dont bring much but shes was real excited he was visiting. Shes a bit demented, I think. I mean, likesenile. Repeating herself. She was always asking us to bury the old ashes in her oven cause she was scared the smokes gonna kill us, but we wasnt even cooking! She also kept talking a bunch about her grandson, Rick or Vick or something. Oh, and wine. She really wanted a vintage 1990 from her cellar. Kept asking for it. She also wanted to listen to the radio- Cellar? Officer Jackson interrupted after rifling through his papers. We searched the entire property, there are no subterranean rooms. I did a double-take. What? She said it was outside! Did you see it yourself? Officer Jackson asked. No, but she kept asking us to go! Why didnt you go? Hmm? Why didnt you go get her wine from the wine cellar? Oh, umbird viruses, I mumbled, fidgeting with my muffin wrapper. Officer Jackson took off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose, sighing, so I quickly added, Maybe it aint her cellar? Shes senilemaybe she forgot? You can ask her family. Do you know her family? Officer Ross asked. No. She only talked bout her grandson, Mick or Dick or something. And some Ronald who knows bout wine. But we didnt ask no questions cause it aint our business if she aint wanting to share. Well then, son, let me introduce you. Officer Ross pointed to Nans photo. This is Mrs. Arlene Jones-Marshall, affectionately known as Nan by her grandchildren. She went missing over a year ago. What?! Exactly, son. When I overheard Officer Jackson talking about his case, the location caught my attention. It was a long shot, coming to see you, since this case is cold. I certainly wasnt expecting the connection to be so solid. You can see why I am very interested in your story. Well, I can tell you she aint missing, I confidently stated. She lives right in that cabin. Ask her grandson. Victor Marshall has been checking up on the cabin every Saturday evening since her disappearance and never once encountered his grandmother, Officer Ross said. But she talked bout him! She was there yesterday! Isis she missing? Is that it? You didnt find her?! My voice squeaked with panic. Shes technically been missing for over a year, Officer Jackson pointed out. Did you see her secret room? I asked. She hides there, its in the back bedroom! Yes we did, and it was empty. There is no- Maybe she ran away after she saw the murders! I interrupted. You should look for her in the woods! Will, as much as we would love to believe your story, there is no recent evidence of Mrs. Jones-Marshall in that house at all, Officer Jackson replied. Maybe its cause we cleaned up? I suggested. The place was a damned dust factory! I aint got no clue how her family can leave her like that! Maybe thats why she hides from them! They should be arrested forfor old people abuse! Officer Ross tried to mitigate the tension. All right, son, calm down. So, you met Nan. Did she tell you where shes been hiding? No. But I bet she hides in her secret room. Did she tell you why shes avoided contact with her family? No. But I bet its cause theyre assholes. Did she mention a child? A baby girl? Her granddaughter? Natalie? What?! No! I replied, confused. And why are you wasting time?! You have to find her! Shes lost in the woods, all old and afraid and senile! Ive got to say, Will, this story of yours is starting to seem like quite an excellent adventure, Officer Jackson derided. I cringed, wishing I had used a more obscure movie for name references. Officer Ross added, It looks like you and your friend Theo are ghosts and this doesnt help us one bit, son. No ID. No records. Fake names. Scars. Shaved heads. Alphanumeric tattoos. Unidentifiable uniforms, one doused in bleach. Who are you, exactly? Who are you hiding from? You boys dont have any priors, son. Why dont you talk to us? Youll be relieved. Its obvious you and your friend have been through something stressful and we can help you. We will keep you safe, trust me. II aint got nothing to say. I wanna see Theo, I mumbled. I didnt think theyd allow it, but I actually ended up being escorted to Jakes room. I soon realized their compliance wasnt for my benefit but for theirs. Jake was conscious, but claimed he couldnt remember anything, not even his own name. The officers were understandably frustrated and hoped that seeing me would dispel his amnesia. I entered Jakes room and my heart dropped when he didnt recognize me. Id never seen him look so scared and lost and my emotions rapidly mirrored his. Without him, I wouldnt know what to do out here. I shakily sat on a chair next to his bed and looked at him expectantly with wide eyes, silently willing him to remember me. I was prodded to engage Jake in conversation in order to jog his memory, but I had no idea how to do that without revealing our past in front of the surrounding officers. Instead, I blurted out the same story I told Officers Jackson and Ross. Officer Jackson sighed in exasperation, but Officer Ross gently said, Son, the only way your friend will regain his memory is if you tell him the truth. Your story will only confuse him. I know youre afraid and youre protecting yourselves, but you can trust us. Youre safe here. I turned to Jake, desperate for guidance, but he just looked back at me in utter bewilderment. A chill clutched at my heart. Jake was the smart one. Hed risked a lot to get us out. Hed promised to look out for me. Now, I was alone. I wouldnt know how to do this alone. I wouldnt know how to protect Jake. My distress and vulnerability overwhelmed me and I broke down, crying into my hands. A nurse quickly transported me back to my room, where the officers informed me that they would return once Ive had a chance to relax and think things through. Before my dread and desolation could suffocate me, I jumped up in my bed in disbelief as Jake hobbled into my room later that afternoon, fully dressed and on crutches. He hurriedly approached me and began pulling out my IV, allowing no time for small-talk as he curtly said, Get dressed, were leaving. I barely suppressed a relieved laugh. I should have guessed he was faking. Hed have known I wouldnt have been able to keep my mouth shut and he didnt want our stories to clash. I quickly followed Jakes orders and we managed to get the hell out of town. "
139,vulnerability,nosleep,"On Christmas Eve, My Serial Killer Brother Broke Out Of The Hospital",1,9lowtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9lowtf/on_christmas_eve_my_serial_killer_brother_broke/,2018-10-06 04:31:13,"It's not easy being a nurse. Particularly when your work never ends. My days consisted of doing the rounds for Stanwyck Hospice by day. And tending to my father by night. My dad lived with me, and as much as I loved him... well, he could be a real pain in the ass. Don't get me wrong, I was a dearly devoted daughter. I always had been. A real daddy's girl if you will. But at seventy-eight years old, my father had become overbearing. Not just from having to care for him. But his Alzheimer's had made him difficult to interact with at times. He could be belligerent. Or get out-of-line. You know, like a kid. I know what you're thinking. And trust me, I'd heard it before. Put him in a nursing home, Janet. There's no shame in that! But I couldn't do it. This was my father we're talking about. Not the family dog. I still loved him, and no one could take better care of him than his own damn daughter. Five years earlier, my mother passed away. She was the same age as my dad, but unlike him, wasn't lucky enough to avoid terminal cancer. Her death devastated me. And honestly, I'm surprised it didn't devastate dad to the point where it killed him. But I knew it hurt him far more than it had even ravaged me. He wasn't the same afterward. His Alzheimer's only got worse from there. He remembered me, sure. But he couldn't recall much else from the recent past. To him, I was still thirty. Not thirty-eight. Hell, sometimes he'd still ask me about my ex-husband Max. Talking about awkward. The stress of caring for him only grew from there. Particularly around Christmas. You see, three years ago, my younger brother's dark secrets were unearthed before us. Me and Tod were close growing up. But over the years, our relationship became more strained as he became more troubled. With mom's death and dad's declining health, I couldn't deal with the stress. I couldn't take care of Tod and dad. Tod had dropped out of school so many times and was constantly broke. He had an okay office job, but the guy couldn't save money for shit. I mean yeah, I'd help him make ends meet when I could. But I still had to take care of dad. I didn't have time for another patient. Dad was my life. And when I cut my hours at hospice, he became my full-time job. Besides, I had no idea how deeply disturbed Tod was. I could've never known he was a serial killer. Bloody Rudolph. That's what the press dubbed him. Tod had been killing countless people across the state over the past few years. But he earned his nickname the night he came home. The Christmas Eve he arrived at my front doorstep. I was up with dad when Tod demanded I let him in from the freezing cold. It was dark out, and I could barely even tell it was him except for his glowing reflection from the Christmas lights. I was hesitant at first. Tod was so loud and boisterous. Maybe he was drunk or high, I couldn't tell. But dad wanted to see him. He was persistent. Dad hadn't seen him in months, and he just wanted to see his son for the holidays. I opened the door and let the monster inside. Tod revealed a long hatchet in his gloved hand. His nose was painted red. I couldn't tell if it was a joke, but when he started swinging the blade, I knew he'd lost it. He was gonna kill us. I remembered the room spinning as I dodged the many thrusts of the blood-stained hatchet. During the horror, I realized that that wasn't red paint on his nose. It was fucking blood. Dad was frozen in fear. Like the sheer sight of his son trying to hack up the family had put sent daddy into a catatonic state. And as he attacked me, Tod kept singing Christmas songs at the top of his lungs. His voice was piercing and raspy. Like a chorus of the living dead. The fucker knew my favorites too. John Lennon's ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over),"" Burl Ives's ""Holly Jolly Christmas."" Tod's voice wasn't good enough for them to sound like soothing holiday classics. They came off like threats spoken by an obsessed lunatic. I stumbled over Christmas presents, dodging each and every one of those wild swings. I could see blood flying off the hatchet. The drops got everywhere. They gave all those wrapped Christmas presents a vivid red tint. ""Merry Christmas, Janet!"" Tod shouted with unbridled aggression. Jesus, he was fucking nuts! When I fell back against a shelf, I grabbed the first thing I could find. A huge Coca-Cola Polar Bear snow globe. Once Tod went in for a kill shot, I pushed myself away from the shelf. He went crashing into it like a slapstick goof. And then I managed to hit him upside the head with the snow globe, smashing it into a million pieces. Tod hit the wet ground. Fake snow and blood swirled all around him. I had subdued my kid brother. I'd outwitted him. Once me and dad called 911, the police came quickly. Bloody Rudolph had been caught. It turned out my brother had killed his girlfriend and their kids just an hour before he came here to spread holiday cheer. I didn't even know he had a girlfriend. Much less children. Or the fact that he'd killed over fifteen people in the last five years. Ever since mama died. I guess we really had grown apart. That was three years ago. I took medicine for the nerves. For the trauma. I drank heavier. I did everything I could to block my mind from the horror. Even with Tod being locked in a padded cell out in Chattahoochee, I still didn't feel safe. And I never went to see him either. However, I did feel guilt. Maybe I could've done more for Tod than feed him useless rent money like an indifferent lost friend. Instead, I could've comforted him like the supportive sister I used to be. I could've shown him more love and welcomed him back home. But I didn't. And he became what he became. Bloody Rudolph. Nothing more than a fixture for all those holiday crime shows. Needless to say, Christmas got tougher each year. If I had my way, I'd have just ignored the holiday altogether. But it wasn't just me in that house. There was dad. About the only great thing about Alzheimer's is that you only remember the past through nostalgia-tinted glasses. You don't remember the bad memories. And you don't remember the recent past either. Dad had completely forgotten about Tod's reign of terror. He'd forgotten how Tod had tried to kill us right there by the Christmas tree. Thankfully, by the time, Christmas Day had arrived, dad had forgotten all his delusions about Tod joining us for Christmas. Over the past few weeks, he'd helped me hang decorations like always. He'd helped me put up the snow globes. The Christmas posters. And the stockings, of course. We even got a real tree this year. And there were so many ornaments. Every year, I'd wonder how dad could help me hang up all those damn ornaments. But he always had it in him. He'd always hang the ornaments with our old pictures inside them. Our family photos. The pictures of me and Tod as children. We'd line up all of mom's old figurines in our front yard. The big, smiling snowman was her favorite and mine as well. Overall, the scene was set for a wonderful Gausman family Christmas. And to top it all off, snow had arrived in Stanwyck, Georgia for the first time in over a decade. It truly was a Christmas Eve miracle. With the snow aiding the atmosphere, we had a great Christmas Eve. TCM's holiday movie marathon played in the living room. And the kitchen radio played the local Christmas station. We baked cookies together. I roasted a turkey. We opened one gift each for our Christmas Eve ritual. And then it was time for our late night showcase: It's A Wonderful Life. We'd watch the classic upstairs in dad's bedroom. He'd lie in bed, and I'd sit in a chair right beside him. I was wearing an extra-cozy bathrobe, the latest gift he'd gotten me. From my spot, I'd also gotten a great view of both the T.V. screen and the large windows showcasing the pristine snow outside. The movie was two hours of bliss. We've watched this every year since I was a little girl. And yet to this day, the bittersweet ending still made me cry. As midnight arrived, dad and I conversed for awhile while Christmas music played on the T.V. Our father daughter time. ""I can never get tired of Clarence,"" dad said, talking about his favorite character from the holiday classic. ""He's funny as Hell."" ""I know,"" I'd responded. ""It's such a great movie."" ""Maybe tomorrow we can watch A Christmas Carol."" ""Yeah, for sure, dad."" I got up, ready to head downstairs and let daddy get some rest. I felt his cold hand grab my arm. ""Janet."" I faced him. ""Yeah, dad."" ""Is he gonna be here tomorrow?"" dad asked me, his voice full of as much hope as a kid asking for Santa Claus. I flashed a smile. ""We'll see."" I got ready to leave the room when dad squeezed my arm harder. Not a tight squeeze. It was still a gentle touch. ""You said he would,"" dad said to me. ""I hope so,"" I told him. Dad gave me a smile. ""We need Tod here. Just like he used to."" ""Maybe he'll come,"" I'd responded. With tat, I gave dad a kiss on the forehead. ""I'll call him tomorrow,"" I told him. Then, I got ready to leave the room. ""Sweetie, don't go,"" dad pleaded. Dad's soft voice held me hostage. I couldn't leave him now, I thought. It was Christmas Eve after all. Why should I be in a rush? I faced dad with a sly smile. ""A Christmas Carol?"" I asked him. ""You got it,"" he responded. So that night we watched another holiday classic. 1951's A Christmas Carol. The essential version according to dad. I didn't mind. It was a great movie after all. And another one of our traditions. We were spending time together anyway. And just like I figured, I heard daddy's soft snoring about halfway through the movie. Right before the Ghost Of Christmas Present appeared. Grinning, I pulled the blankets up tighter over my father. He was sleeping well for the night. As discreet as possible, I changed the T.V. back to the soothing Christmas music. Back to the pre-70s standards. You know like Sinatra, Bing, and Brenda Lee. Nothing that'd wake daddy from his gentle slumber. I stole a glance out the window. This Christmas was gorgeous. It'd been awhile since we'd had a white Christmas in Georgia. I left the room, and as gently as I could, I shut the bedroom door behind me. Then I went downstairs. In the quiet living room, I looked around at all the presents. The decorations. The ornaments. Our family photos. Sure, Christmas wasn't the same without mom or Tod. But we were still having fun. It was me and dad against the world. I yawned, but wasn't really tired. I supposed having some peace and quiet downstairs wasn't the worst thing in the world. I loved the serenity after all. Especially with all the snow contributing to this holiday atmosphere. In the kitchen, I made myself a cup of hot chocolate. I turned on the radio to hear some holiday tunes. Holly Jolly Christmas cut on immediately. Much to my delight. Humming to the beat, I sat down at the table. I took a sip of that comforting hot chocolate. Yeah, these Christmases weren't too bad after all. They were quiet. But at least they weren't lonely. Not as long as I had daddy with me. I sat there in the room for a few minutes. Alone with my Christmas jams and hot chocolate. I placed my empty snowman mug on the table when this shrill beep interrupted Stevie Wonder's ""Someday At Christmas."" Caught off-guard, I cringed. The beep blared through the room and my skull. What a way to break the silent night, I thought. Then a frantic reporter burst through the airwaves. Their voice was full of panic and fear. All of a sudden, Christmas Eve felt like Halloween. It felt like Orson Welles's War Of The Worlds. ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" the reporter cried. ""I'm afraid we have some disturbing breaking news! Convicted killer Tod Gausman has just escaped the Chattahoochee Mental Hospital. Gausman is better known as Bloody Rudolph and is believed to have escaped during a power outage."" The news sliced through me like a knife. All of tonight's Christmas cheer came hurtling down with this horrifying holiday surprise. My little brother was on the loose. ""Repeat,"" the reporter went on. ""Tod Gausman has just escaped the Chattahoochee Mental Hospital. It's believed he's very armed and dangerous and was last seen in a white van heading down Highway 77."" The reporter's voice trembled. ""I'm sorry to say it on this holy night, but please, lock your doors and windows. Don't answer the door for anyone and don't go outside! Repeat, this is a local emergency."" Even in my state of petrified fear, I knew the report may as well have been written for me. Tod wasn't going anywhere else. He was heading home for the holidays. The reporter went on. ""Please lock your doors and-"" The power went out without warning. Silence conquered the room. No more Christmas music. No heat. No Christmas lights. No nothing. Just me in the dark with my empty mug. I wanted to believe it was just a Christmas coincidence, but there's no point in deluding myself. I freaked the fuck out. Acting on primal instinct, I stood up and grabbed a long knife. My eyes scurried throughout the darkness, but I saw nothing. I heard nothing. Had Tod cut the power? Had he gotten here this fast? Chattahoochee was forty miles away! The fucker must've came here on Santa's sleigh! Nervous, I raised my cell phone. Before I could call the police, Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" startled me. I'd never been so scared to hear my ringtone. Uneasy, I silenced Bing. And then I saw it. A voice message notification. From an unsaved number. I should've called the police right then and there. But I didn't. I played the mysterious Christmas message. A soft singing greeted me. ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)."" Even after three years, Tod's voice hadn't changed a bit. Especially his singing. He never had talent. Not in the traditional sense anyway. But his voice was sincere and haunting. Like a madman whispering a prayer. In this case, Tod was whispering a Christmas anthem just for me. I'd call it a serenade... but it was too menacing. It was just a sly threat. Before Tod could get to the chorus, the voice message cut off. And I was back in kitchen. Back in the unnerving silence. All I could do was stare at my phone, unsettled. I looked on at my home screen's background. A picture of me and dad standing in the snow earlier. I thought at the time, the snow was just a welcome addition to this year's Christmas. Now I realized it was the catalyst to my current imprisonment. I couldn't even drive in this weather. I couldn't escape. Conflicted on what to do, I looked toward the living room. The Christmas tree stared back at me like a hulking monster. I could make out our old family photos in those ornaments. The pictures of me and Tod as kids. Back when we were close. Back when the whole family was together. In my mind, all I could hear were Tod's eerie vocals. That unnerving whisper. He could make even the jolliest Christmas song sound like a funeral hymn. He sang from hatred, not from the heart. ""White Christmas"" shattered through the silence once more. I jumped back in fear. ""Jesus,"" I muttered out of frustration and fright. I muted my ringtone and saw a text message from that same unsaved number. A picture message. I opened it. And there on my screen was Mom's snowman figurine smiling right at me. Its narrow eyes piercing into my soul. The picture was taken right there in my dark yard. I could see my house lurking behind Mr. Frosty. Then to my horror, I realized the Christmas lights were all out. The lights were out inside my home. The picture had just been taken. ""Fuck!"" I yelled. Terrified, I gripped the knife handle tighter as a shiver ran up my spine. The house was getting fucking cold. A new text message from Tod appeared: Merry Christmas, Sis. I looked through the kitchen windows, but saw nothing out there. Just white snow in the staunch darkness. I looked back at my phone and contemplated responding to him. For the first time in three years, I could talk to my brother. Before I could make a decision, another text message popped up on my screen: We'll be together like we used to, Janet. All three of us. I knew Tod was crazy. I know he's dangerous. But I was still struck by his message. All this time, he'd been thinking of us. Me and dad. I closed my eyes. I tried to suppress my tears but couldn't. The last few years, I knew I had left Tod behind. And now he was back home. Back where he should've been all along. Charged up on heightened emotions, I called the unsaved number. I listened to it ring and waited with anticipation for that familiar, unsettling voice to answer. Even in this freezing house, I could feel sweat slide down my fingertips. And then through the silence, I heard Bing Crosby. ""White Christmas."" The haunting chorus drifted toward my ears. Uneasy, I followed Bing's croon to the living room. All the while, the call kept ringing and ringing. I traced ""White Christmas"" to my front door. Bing was at his loudest right behind it. I lowered my phone in stunned horror. Tod's ring tone had been set to ""White Christmas"" as well. Through the tears, I hung up the phone. And just like that, Bing's voice ended as if someone had pulled the curtains on the Holiday Inn stage. I waited there in silence. I waited for a knock. Tod's singing. A text. Anything. Instead, all I got was cold silence. Right before I lifted my phone to call Tod again, I saw a man stagger by my window. A man dressed in all white except for a large overcoat. I knew it had to be Tod. His hospital garbs practically helped him blend in with the snow. He was like a slender snowman. A white blur. And he was still pretty quick. Shit, I thought. I turned on my phone's flashlight and shined it toward the window. Letters were drawn on the window in crude fashion. Red letters. Tod had left me a message: I'll Be Home 4 Xmas I shuddered at the creepy message. It didn't seem like so much a threat as a promise. I just hoped Tod hadn't scribbled it in blood. Panicking, I double checked the front door. To my relief, it was locked. Thank God, I'd done something right... Now to do something real logical, Janet. Call the Goddamn police! I raised my phone, and as if on cue, Bing Crosby hit my ears. At least this time I hadn't jumped back in fright or screamed at the top of my lungs. I was prepared. And I answered the incoming call. ""Hello,"" I mustered out. A few tense seconds passed. ""Merry Christmas,"" Tod's harsh whisper emerged from the other end. Regardless of how prepared I was to hear his voice, I froze. He wasn't singing, but his voice was still deep and guttural. Goddamn, it sounded raspier than ever. More malevolent. But I persevered. ""Tod,"" I finally said. ""I made it home, sis,"" he said. ""Now we can celebrate Christmas. Me. You. And dad."" His voice was like a vicious taunt. But bitterness not confidence fueled his tone. I could tell Tod had only gotten angrier over the years... and I guess I couldn't blame him. ""We can celebrate like always,"" Tod went on. His harsh whisper began to explode into an outburst. ""Like you promised we always would, Janet! Just like you told dad we would!"" ""I'm sorry, Tod,"" I struggled to say. ""I'm sorry!"" ""Sorry doesn't make up for it!"" he yelled, his voice still low and raspy. I staggered back toward the tree. ""Tod. I'm sorry..."" ""I know you told him we'd get together for the holidays! You fucking lied to him!"" ""I didn't mean to, Tod,"" I pleaded. I turned and saw all the photos lined up like tombstones on the Christmas tree. I guess they may as well have been a graveyard. Memorials for our better memories. The glorious Christmases of old. When we were young and innocent. When we were close. When we were a family. ""I was never good enough for you!"" Tod said, his voice cracking with raw emotion. The kind of vulnerability I didn't know he still had. My eyes stayed glued to our old photos. I couldn't turn away from them... or the memories they elicited. ""I just wanted to come home, Janet!"" Tod hurled at me. ""That's all I fucking wanted!"" Tears slid down my face. I couldn't hold back the waterfall. Guilt swept over me amidst all the horror. I knew Tod was right. I had kept us apart. Whether I was responsible for his violence, I'll never know. But I certainly hadn't helped. I'd pushed Tod away when he needed me most. When he needed us most. ""You couldn't even let me over for Christmas!"" Tod yelled. He started whimpering. I didn't know if it was from weeping or just from him breaking down into a landslide of wounded emotions. It should've sounded pathetic on an adult. But it didn't. Not when the adult was my kid brother. More guilt overwhelmed me. I brushed away my tears, but they just kept falling like an assembly line. I saw a picture of me and him smiling under a Christmas tree. We held big cookies in our hands. There were huge presents all around us. The whole world was ahead of us back in that winter of 1990. What a beautiful Christmas it was... ""Tod,"" I began through the tears. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Tod. I was wrong. I should have been there for you. I should have done more! I shouldn't have left you!"" I said more than I thought I was capable of in this state. Judging by the silence and heavy breathing on the other end, I don't think Tod expected it either. ""But I can't do anything anymore,"" I told him. ""I feel terrible, but there's nothing I can do now, Tod. There's nothing dad can do. Things will never be like it was. It's all in the past. Those Christmases are over."" I heard him release a painful cry. A cry of anguish. ""Tod, please!"" I continued. ""I love you. I always will. Dad will always love you. We'll do what we can, but you can't go on like this. You can't stay here! You need help!"" I did my best to keep my tone firm and strong yet still sympathetic. He needed to hear the truth. Bloody Rudolph shouldn't be here anymore. At this point, Tod needed the kind of help I could never give him. ""We'll visit you, Tod,"" I reassured him. ""I promise."" ""That's what you always say!"" he yelled in that guttural, unpleasant tone. His anger had returned. ""But I mean it--"" I started. ""Merry Christmas, sis,"" he interrupted. And with that, Tod hung up. A hollow dial tone blared at me. I lowered the phone, morose. Our reunion was brief. But what else could I have done? I stared at that same Christmas photo of me and Tod as children. I knew we could never go back to that. Even if I had been more welcoming to him over the years, what would it have changed? Would Tod really have not evolved into the monster he'd become? Would those few December days where siblings and relatives gather around and pretend to be inseparable really had moved Tod off the path to becoming a serial killer? My thoughts were shattered by Bing Crosby. The Goddamn ring tone had scared me again! There was a voice message from Tod's number. I mashed play. He'd left me another performance. ""Holly Jolly Christmas."" This one wasn't done in his Bloody Rudolph voice. The harsh raspy whisper was gone. Instead, Tod had put some emotion into this performance. Human emotion. He was trying to sound good even if that was impossible. And yet, his version was charming. Reminiscent of the singing we did together when we were kids. Back when we rode in the backseat of dad's car on those cold nights looking at Christmas lights. Back to simpler times. Back to the Gausman family's glory days. I got to admit the singing got to me. I teared up. I even felt a weak smile cross my face. Tod was no Burl Ives, but I had to respect him for trying. Maybe it would be the last Christmas present I ever got from him. The message faded away, and I stood there in silence. Still in tears. Still with that smile. Off in the distance, I thought I heard a car engine start. The white van, I realized. Like Santa, Tod was about to ride off into the cold December night. And like Santa, his appearance had been quick but memorable. I started to make my way toward a window. Amidst the silence, I thought I heard more car-like noises. Even a loud clang. I figured one last glance at Tod as he made his getaway wouldn't be a bad thing. A little closure never hurt anyone. Flying out of nowhere, a large object shattered through the window. I jolted back. My foot banged into one of the presents and I fell straight on my ass. I saw the knife slip from my grasp before sliding under the tree. Now the blade looked like yet another gift from Santa Claus. My eyes shot back to whatever the Hell had flown through the window. I recognized the narrow eyes staring back at me. The permanent smile. Mr. Frosty was lying just a few feet away from me. ""What the Hell!"" I shouted. I heard faint thumps up above. Slow, lumbering thumps. Nervous, I jumped on my feet and ran up to the busted window. I used my cell phone for light to see through the darkness. I saw no one out there aside from all the holiday figurines. Their tall, cryptic shadows. And then I looked toward the snow. Deep footprints formed a trail away from the window. More chills ran through me. I pulled my bathrobe in tighter to keep warm. All the while, my vision stayed honed on those footprints. I followed them as far as I could. And then saw they came to a stop about twenty feet away. Right where a wooden ladder had been placed up against my house. Holy fuck, that was the clang! And those weren't a reindeer's hooves on the roof either... ""Janet!"" an excited voice hollered from the staircase. I whirled around. And then terrified shock set in. I wanted to scream but couldn't. The cold weather and outright fear froze me in place. Chills coursed through my body. At the bottom of the stairs stood my beaming father. A huge smile was on his face that was bigger than Mr. Frosty's. Like a giddy kid, he held the hand of his idol. Not the hand of Saint Nicholas. My brother Tod. A splash of red blood covered Tod's nose. I saw he held a blood-stained hatchet. His ""present."" ""He came right to my window!"" Dad told me. ""Our little Tod's home!"" A cryptic smile formed on Tod's face, the smile marking me like the hatchet's vicious blade. ""It's a Christmas miracle!"" Dad shouted. And he was right. We were all together again. One final family Christmas."
140,vulnerability,nosleep,Monologue of a Madman (Part Four),1,9lv3dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9lv3dy/monologue_of_a_madman_part_four/,2018-10-06 20:56:20,"Events past [Part One](URL [Part Two](URL [Part Three](URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Torture is..... so subjective. Some describe it as simply being denied access to something or someone wanted without due cause. Others describe it as the infliction of pain, mental or physical, with malicious intent. Some as imprisonment, or appendage removal. I'm not sure how she chose to view it, but that's what Em called what I was doing to poor James. She wasn't bothered by it, by any means. She simply wanted to ""call it what it was"". But I disagree. &amp;#x200B; I prefer to look at it as enlightenment. I was transforming a beaten, broken man in to something new. Something with a purpose that would live to serve a higher cause, and do so happily. I admit, however, to a level of personal satisfaction and sadism at certain acts performed. Suffice it to say the box, alone, did not work. At the end of the seventy-two days, James was still as feisty and stubborn as ever, the sight of my mask everlastingly egging him on. I knew I would have to resort to more *extreme* measures. In between longer, more sustained bouts in his box Em and I would pull him out and tie him to a chair. Her new [mask](URL from her favorite movie, hiding the fact they knew each other. I suppose his drug-addled mind lent credence to that fact as well. &amp;#x200B; After tying him up, what happened was his choice. His behaviors dictated whether he would be rewarded or punished. A simple, yet extremely effective method of psychology, not unlike what you would do with a child. Addiction has a way of forcing certain levels of regression. Punishments were not consistent, either in degree of severity, or effects. And the same could be said for the rewards. Although to a lesser extent. After his seventy-two day stint and subsequent detox had failed in breaking his spirit, I decided to go a different route. I allowed access to the drugs craved. In James' case, it was cocaine. As one of the possible rewards, I would give him small amounts, placing a shallow dish with a small line up to his nose. The first couple of times, he feebly resisted for a moment or two before breaking and greedily sniffing up the powder and licking the dish clean, and almost immediate euphoric glaze appearing in his eyes. Before long, his eagerness for the drug began deepening and he always accepted it eagerly. One day that stopped, when he broke a leg free and kicked me, so I ripped his fucking nose off with garden shears. &amp;#x200B; My other main form of reward was food. No one likes to starve, so when offered quantities of delectable food in exchange for a little good behavior... Well, it was an easy choice. Not to say he didn't ever act up. But after one time, he learned his lesson. When he got brave and spat his food out at me, my first instinct was to break his jaw. But upon sight of his noseless face, I curbed my impulsivity and decided on another route. Instead of inciting physical pain myself, I simply made him eat... And keep eating, until his stomach threatened to burst and he became violently ill, spewing multicolored globs of foul smelling food-infused bile. Then, I made him eat his vomit. As I stated earlier, he learned his lesson. &amp;#x200B; Only one other extreme punishment ever happened to poor James. After a night of screaming in his box had gotten particularly obnoxious, I resolved to remove a couple of finger nails that morning. After the deed, he was moaning in his chair quietly when I heard it. The faint call for ""Lisa"", the fake name my wife had given him. The fool was calling out to her, wantingly! Enraged and fueled by hate, I forcibly removed his clothing, exposing him. I remember thinking that Em was *mine* and **NO ONE** was allowed to even think of her. So I reached down and took his testicles in my gloved hand, and crushed them.... very slowly. It was about ten minutes before I had a completely clenched fist around the remnants of his manhood. &amp;#x200B; I admit, that was wholly unnecessary. But she is **MINE!** Besides, after that, we no longer had problems. His behavior changed to complete compliance. Over the next couple months however, he remained in his box, the ritual unchanging. At some point I started referring to him as Igor. The point was to get him to further disassociate with his former identity, and after a time it worked. He began responding to it, and ignoring his old name. I began sending him on test runs, simple tasks he could do without attracting too much attention from any one. After all, he didn't exactly look *normal,* anymore. Em followed him closely, ready to silence him if he showed any troubling signs. But all went as planned and before long I was able to train Igor in the same way as his predecessors. His unwillingness to disappoint, and fear of punishment were an effective motivator, making him an excellent student. The whole process took about 6 months. &amp;#x200B; During the time I spent molding Igor, Em had been busy. Her twenty-three kills had become thirty-nine. But she was ready to burst, and could no longer achieve her goals. It was time to allow Igor to assume his new role. After teaching him a few things to keep him out of trouble, and obtaining his new [mask](URL one of many, I'd decided to buy in bulk, I sent him on his way. He killed three people his first month, his tortured soul exacting misplaced vengeance on his victims. The first, he made eat himself to death. The second, was skinned alive, complete with the removal of nails. And the third, she was simply torn apart, and left broken and bleeding out. &amp;#x200B; The one consistency, as always, was the spool of marionette string left tangled around the body, the trademark of my handiwork.. However, it was not to last. Igors broken mind prevented him from thinking clearly, and he made countless mistakes. It wasn't long before he was caught, identified as the killer, and sentenced to die. He was never asked about accomplices, or if he was, there was no ability to place blame. He was rapidly deemed insane, unfit to stand trial, and sent to [Willard Asylum for the Chronic Insane](URL He would've been there for the rest of his life, but I found myself employed there and convinced him life was not worth living. They found him hanging by his bed sheet late one morning, when he had missed role call. &amp;#x200B; It was at this time the cops came knocking again. Only to ask certain questions about whether I had noticed any behavior indicative of his murderous urges, and questions of the like. Naturally, I had not. He had stopped coming to his sessions months before he was caught, and he had looked much different. The self mutilation and the murders were not obvious. They asked me about my mother, having been the original ""**Kite-String Killer**"" and the possible connection. I admitted to having told James the story of my mother, as a way of building a connection to my patient, allowing him to see my vulnerability and open up to me. They then thanked me for my time, and went along their merry way, never thinking twice about any further connections the two murderers may have had. &amp;#x200B; I know, now, that I may have jumped the gun, and brought myself closer in to the cross-hairs by choosing one of my own patients to turn in to my weapons. I'm going to have to be more careful now. After all, my wife and I have just had a beautiful baby boy. Its time to step up my game."
141,vulnerability,nosleep,My roommate and I were the only witnesses to a very strange phenomenon...,1,9mcku8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9mcku8/my_roommate_and_i_were_the_only_witnesses_to_a/,2018-10-08 17:45:27,"This happened a few nights ago, but I've been struggling to put it into words. I figured I'd better tell the story before I forget the details. It's better to get it out before I forget it, even if it's not great. Here goes. I was sitting on the toilet taking your generic night time shit with the bathroom doors open. My roommate and I have seen plenty of each other, and I wasn't going to be in there very long plus he was busy cooking his late dinner, so I didn't feel like closing the doors was nessecary. In the hallway there's a window you can see out of that overlooks the front yard. From my place on the throne I could see out this window, but at such a low angle I could really only see the sky, and some tree branches. Now we live in Southern Pennsylvania, a place where the northern lights haven't been known to reach. So imagine my surprise when the bathroom is filled with the purplish green glow of this beautiful phenomenon from outside the window. After a few seconds of confused admiration, though, something changed. The lights shifted in color and shape. They became more like slow motion lightning, pulsing rather than flashing, in the brightest white I've ever seen. You know that vantablack stuff? This was like vantawhite, filling the room and the hallway, coating the walls. With every pulse came this deafening buzz. It wasn't just a sound, it was like a physical sensation of immense pressure at the top of my head. I felt like my skull would pop or cave in every time. Even though I was seated, I needed to brace myself against the wall or I might have fallen over. It was like the whole world was glitching, and needless to say I was fairly uncomfortable. Vulnerability washed over me. Sitting in a dead end room with my pants down really was the worst place for this to happen. Despite this, it wasn't a painful experience. Near the end of the pulsing, fog started to roll in through the top of the window. I didn't notice it at first, since the blinding white lights made it hard for my eyes to adjust. It was like when you walk into a dark room from a really bright day, but every couple seconds. Fog isn't uncommon at our house's elevation, and we see it pretty much every autumn morning, but something was definitely off about this. It was thick, concealing, and it stuck to the ceiling like clouds. When it finally stopped and I got my bearings well enough to stand up and hobble out of the shitter, I immediately went to the kitchen to check on my roommate. The weird fog was disappating and the last of the raindrops were trickling away. That's right, rain. My roommate turned to me, still holding the fork he was mashing his potatos with, and for a minute we didn't really say anything. Maybe neither of us wanted to be the first to ask if what just happened was real. Of course it would have seemed crazy if the other hadn't seen it at all. 'You're soaked,' was the first thing I could bring myself to say. Even with the phenomenon over, the effects were obvious. 'Dude, it just rained inside the house,' he said. 'Is that normal?' He only moved to Pennsylvania this year, so maybe that wasn't such an outlandish question. Still, I could hear in his voice how stupid he thought it sounded. We talked about it, but neither of us had an explanation. So far we've just tried to move on with our lives. My roommate is the kind of guy that likes to know why strange things happen. He doesn't believe in ghosts or god or anything supernatural. 'There has to be a scientific explanation.' He hasn't really gone forward to do any research. Neither of us want to contact someone who might help clear up what happened. For me, I'm afraid of being called crazy. For him, I think he's mostly afraid of being wrong about his beliefs. In any case, we're both really shaken up over it. We joke that we might have been slipped some drugs, but having the same trip at the same time and still having to dry up the rain water afterwards just doesn't seem conducive to that theory. I just wish it had been some weird dream."

Today, I woke up in her body.",1,9n3xby,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9n3xby/last_night_i_saved_an_injured_girl_today_i_woke/,2018-10-11 08:52:39,"I have been told I am a soft touch. No, that's putting it too mildly -- I'm one of those suckers they say is born every minute. So when the girl - Alissa, she said her name was - came to my door all battered and bruised, yeah, of course I helped her. Of course I completely skipped over the part where I asked any number of important questions you ask before letting a stranger into your home. No, I just got out the first aid kit, bandaged her cuts and scrapes, and made her a cup of hot tea while she sniffled and looked at me with big blue doe eyes full of gratitude and vulnerability. I tried talking her into calling the cops or at least going to a hospital, but she sang me a song about an abusive ex-boyfriend searching for her, and how she feared for her life if she contacted any kind of authority. Predictably, *that* tune made my big stupid heart break and my *rotten stupid tiny brain* shut down completely. I told her I'd let her stay the night. I had a flight to catch in the morning, but on the way to the airport I'd drop her off at a women's shelter I knew of where she'd be safe. She hugged me, and cried, and thanked me...and I just *ate it up.* I could plead a recent illness addling my mind, but that'd be dishonest -- it wasn't sickness, it was just stupid. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised. This is a recurring theme with me. People have conned me all my life. I've been conned out of money, out of jobs...being conned out of my body was a first, though. When I woke the next morning, I found myself in the guest room -- where I'd put *her* to sleep last night. I screamed when I saw my reflection in the mirror by the bed. And for probably ten minutes thereafter. I was *her.* The battered, bruised, sunken-eyed waif I'd dragged in off the street last night...I was in *her body.* When I recovered enough to move, I ran in a panic through the house, searching for...well, *me.* But *my* body was nowhere to be seen. Nor, I discovered, was my phone, my car keys, the bags I'd packed, or my freaking *ticket to Hawaii!* What I did find after I circled back into the guest room, was a note -- in a hand disturbingly similar to my own. *I'm sorry. You seem like an okay lady.* *The thing is...well, you've got a lot of things I don't. And I've got a lot of baggage I'd just as soon leave behind.* *The one thing of my own that I do have,* *though,* *is knowledge. Old knowledge, about old ways, passed down from mother to daughter in my family for generations. I won't bore you with the details, but the gist of it is that on the day of the Vernal Equinox, when Mother Earth gets a new lease on life...so do I. I can, in effect, switch places with someone. There's no point in wracking your brain trying to figure out how something like that is possible. It's magic. You'll sleep better if you just accept it and leave it at that.* *Anyway, to make a long story short, everything that was yours, including your body...it's mine now. It would probably be best if you were gone by the time I get back from this little vacation you've sent me on -- no reason for things to get messy. I'd hate to have someone who was so nice to me arrested for trespassing in my new home.* *Of course, you're welcome to try and convince anyone you like that you're actually not Alissa Jessup -- a 'troubled' young lady with a history of substance abuse, I'm afraid -- but have only been translated into her body by witchcraft. Feel free to show them this note as 'proof', too, if you want. But unless you can find someone to listen who's as credulous as you seem to be, you're not going to have much luck.* *Feel free to take any of your stuff from the house -- I've seen your bankbook, I can always get more -- I won't report it stolen. You can even have that old truck parked behind the house. I'll sign the title over to Alissa Jessup when I get back and have time to dig up the paperwork. See? It's not such a bad deal. I think the body you have now is even a few years younger than your old one, so you've got that going for you, too.* *Thanks again -- and don't let the door hit you in my cute little ass on your way out!* *--A.* I screamed, crushing the note in my hands. I raged and wept, trying to wake up from this nightmare I'd found myself in. The reality of it sunk in. I was stuck Alissa's body. My body was *gone.* I was stuck in *Alissa's* body. Everything I owned now belonged to her, the woman I'd let into my home because I felt sorry for her. And now...I was in *her body.* My sobs slowly died, and manic, hysterical laughter took their place. I laughed myself hoarse, I laughed 'til I cried all over again, until I almost passed out from not being able to catch my breath. I lay on the bed, still shaking with suppressed mad giggles, the girl's thick, skanky-ass mascara running down my face in long black rivulets. I got unsteadily to my feet, and shambled into the kitchen, composing myself. I dialed my own cellphone number. ""Ah,"" said my voice, on the other end of the line. ""It says Home so I think I know who this is. You got my note?"" ""I did."" I managed to reply, calmly. ""Then -- not to be rude -- but I don't think we have much more to say to each other. Goodbye."" Alissa said. ""Wait!"" I pleaded. ""One more thing, just one thing!"" She sighed. ""Alright, what?"" ""I...well want to thank you."" I said. The line was silent for a moment. ""Wow...that's...that's new. Most people don't appreciate the benefit *they* gain from this arrangement. They only see the downside. That's very mature of you. If that's all, the plane is about to take off, I need to go..."" ""Of course."" I said, amiably. ""Have a good trip -- don't worry, I won't be here when you get back, like you said."" I couldn't quiet keep the edge of satisfaction out of my voice in the words I spoke next. ""One more thing you should know...though. I...have an inoperable brain tumor. Or, more accurately...now *you* have an inoperable brain tumor. The doctors say six months, max. It's why I decided to go on vacation -- to spend my last days in the sun."" There was dead silence on the other end of line. ""Don't let the door hit you in *my cute little ass* on your way out, bitch."" I snarled, and hung up. "

I love how things had been for me. My cabin had been my fortress of solitude. It had been my place of peace and solemness. The nice fresh breeze and the canopy of green sky over my head, makes for wonderful scenery outside my little cabin. The tall trees towering like brown and black pillars around my little shelter. The morning sun was just peeking against the distant mountains when I stepped outside the door, and swung my axe onto my shoulder. The night before was chilly, and so I needed more firewood to keep the warmth in during the night. I inhaled the fresh morning dew air and took a few paces out of my little area. I walked through a small grassy trail west of my cabin towards a small clearing. This was where I found an abundance of dried branches and barks that I can chop up and turn into firewood. I have a small basket that could help me carry a few pieces of wood back to my shed. I am more of an old fashioned hermit. I find using machinery disrupts the serenity in my little oasis. Although, I do have a truck that I maintain and use to go to town for supplies, I rarely use any other form of machine. I found a suitable spot at the clearing and rummaged through some bark and wood on the ground. I found a big piece of dried trunk and carried it on the spot I chosen. I grabbed my axe and inhaled, gathering my strength. I then managed to look above at the green sea of leaves against a blue background. As I glanced at the rising sun, for a second, I thought I saw a star glittering against the already bright sun. What? I thought, and rubbed my eyes. And when I scanned the sky again, the star disappeared. Thats weird. I shoved the thought of the star to the back of my mind as I chopped some wood. I was chopping firewood until midmorning and when I returned to my cabin, I then decided to have some morning tea. I spent the rest of the morning repairing the walls of my shed, and setting traps for some rodents that come at night and destroy little patch of potatoes that I had been growing in the backyard. By lunch, I ate some potato stew and steamed veggies, and decided to play my guitar that afternoon. I sat at the veranda of composing a song that I had been working on for the last year. Although my cabin is surrounded with towering trees, I still get a bit of mild sunlight. I inhaled deeply as I strum my guitar, and for a second my eyes lay upon the blue sky behind the leaves again and I swear I can see a sparkle. I squinted my eyes and, from a distance, I could see the star twinkle three times before it disappeared. I scratched my head. I checked my watch and it registered three in the afternoon. Stars shouldnt be coming out yet, I thought to myself. I shook my head and headed inside and prepared for dinner. It was around seven oclock when I finished eating dinner. Listening to my old vinyl records made me feel relaxed and ready for bed. I then marked an x in my calendar in the kitchen. You see, I was planning to visit my daughter up state, and I am pretty excited to meet my little granddaughter as well. And then as I was washing the dishes, that was when I felt it. It was like a crack in the air, like thunder, but there was no flash of light. Instead I felt something different. The ground shook, as if an earthquake started just in my backyard. I fumbled but gained back my balance as I placed a heavy hand on the counter of my sink. And just outside my kitchen window, overlooking my potato patch, a big shrivelled object appeared. My eyes widened as I peered through my window. With the light from my kitchen I could see the object, more like a figure covered in the shadows of the nearby trees. I could feel my heart pounding faster. I stared at the figure for a good five minutes, but it didnt move. I backed away from the window, slowly. The lights in my kitchen and dining room started flickering. I then went into my little study, pulled out the shotgun under my desk and a box of ammo from my drawer. It had been a while since I used this weapon, but with shaky hands and cold sweats dripping from my head, I loaded two into the barrels and stuffed the rest of the ammo in my pockets. Whatever is out there, Im sure going to give it hell before it steps into my cabin. I then went to the door and peered through the window. The figure still lay motionless on the ground. Maybe its dead? So I slowly turned the nob of my door and opened it slowly, the business end of the shotgun lay directly towards the figure. The cold breeze that swept in gave me the chills, but I slowly advanced. In the open I could see my potato patch literally destroyed, the figure was lying in what looked like a crater in the centre of my patch. The crater was shallow enough for me to see the figure slumping down, but deep enough to dilapidate my potatoes. My shotgun never left the target as I took a few paces forward. As I advanced closer, I could see that the figure was not only covered with the shadows of the trees but was actually covered in ashes. As I squinted, I could see the figure was burned, and I could smell rotten burning flesh. The soil it stood on was black, charred. I then looked up and saw a discrepancy against the canopy, a hole in the green ceiling. I could see the stars, and the clouds. And then it dawned on me. Whatever this was, it fallen from the sky. This must be those aliens those young kids in town had been talking about. I returned my eyes towards the figure. I could not make a head or arms or legs, just a slump of flesh charred beyond recognition. I shook my head. Whatever this was, it must be long dead even before it hit the ground. I relaxed my stature and my weapon. It then twitched. Instinctively, my arm pointed my shotgun and my hand squeezed the trigger. The shotgun popped with a boom. At point blank, the figure spurted out bits of burned flesh. And then it started moving. My heart skipped a bit as the figure twitched and moved. I stepped back and fired again. Smoke and flesh filled the air. The figure lay still for a moment, but then it started to move again. As I stepped back, I could make out a head, arms, and when it stretched a bit, its legs. Its entire body was covered in charred, burned black flesh. And at the areas I fired, red blood was oozing out, causing a black and red mess on the soil. The figure was not towering over me, in fact, as it moved, it was clear it was a good foot smaller than me. But its shape, the congregation of burned flesh, blood, and smoke, was a sight so terrifying that it froze me to the core. Its head was nothing more than a lump of flesh. I could not make out the eyes nor the mouth. With shaky hands, I started loading two shells into the barrels as I stepped back, my eyes didnt leave the creature, which was now moving towards me. It was standing upright, with a hunched back. My eyes widen as I saw what was on its back. Dragging against the soil were two arching wings, black as its owners body, with what looked like shrivelled feathers. It advanced with a limp. It didnt appear to have eyes, but for some reason, it knew where I was. I finished loading the ammo, and straighten the shaft. It clicked. I then pointed it straight for the creatures head. But just before I could pull the trigger, I saw it reached out its hand, revealing slender black fingers. For a moment, I thought it would lunge for me, but instead, it extended its fingers and started clawing on its face. I watched in horror as the creature started digging its fingers against its charred face, ripping the flesh from its head and spilling blood all over the ground. I still pointed my gun at it, ready to squeeze the trigger at any moment. Then to my surprise, the chunks of flesh that it pulled out dropped to the ground with a thud, revealing a face. I swallowed hard as I saw the face of a young girl, her skin was sallow, her hairline covered with the black and red mess, her eyes tired, but alive, and her lips pink and panting. Her eyes radiated extreme pain, but she stood strong. The rest of her body was still burned, but her face was perfectly unscathed. She stared into my eyes, and I felt a sort of unexpected warmth from her eyes. She then broke our gaze as she used one of her arms to rip the black flesh off over her shoulder. The flesh dropped to the ground hard, revealing her sallow neck and shoulder. She then reached out a hand towards me. Her eyes were in agony, yet they were eyes of someone who wanted to survive. Then she spoke. Help me. Then she collapsed to the ground. I was left in awestruck. I dropped my shotgun as I saw the young girls body lying limp on the ground. She was motionless, but I could hear her breathe. She was unconscious. I dropped to my knees on the ground. What had just happened here? What is this creature? What is it doing here? Why does it look like a girl? Many questions filled my head. Do I leave it here? Do I call the police? Do I call the townsfolk? It spoke. So it must know something? It can tell me. In that case did I just shot a person? I could go to jail. Get a hold of yourself Roger! I thought to myself. Keep it together! Dont lose it. Not now. Not Yet! I inhaled deeply. When I was certain that it was unconscious, I stood and cautiously walked towards it. I swallowed hard as I crouched down and placed a shaky hand over the creatures outstretched arm. It was warm. The black flesh was rough and uneven. I steeled myself and held its arm with my other hand. I grabbed a good chunk of its flesh. I closed my eyes and just pulled. To my surprise, the flesh separated without resistance, like ripping sponge. I opened my eyes and saw me holding a good amount of the black meat, and on my other hand, I was holding the hand of a child, fair, but covered in pinkish slime. What happened to you? If it was something that wanted to kill me, it could have done so. I fired two rounds on it yet it didnt show any signs of attacking me. Instead it cried out for me to help it. At that point, I didnt know what it was, nor what it was doing there. But human instinct to survive and to help another was strong. It was hard to tell my reason for doing what I did, but in some deep instinctive level, I knew that I needed to help this girl. I ripped the black mess enveloping the girl. She was unconscious throughout the ordeal. She revealed to have fuzzy blonde hair, and sallow skin, and to my surprise, the wings that I saw earlier were just exactly that. Extensions sprouting from her back that arched majestically were wings. They were longer and wider than her body. But from the looks of it, those wings were now useless. The feathers had all been burned out, leaving a sort of flesh skeleton, extending from her back, just like how a chicken wing found in the grocery store would looks like. As I cleaned the wings, and her body, she looked like a kid no older than twelve years old. I managed to carry her into my cabin, and lay her slender body on the couch. I then poured some water into a basin and damp a cloth. I proceeded to wipe the pinkish slime off her body. She was unconscious still, but the more I look at her, the more I feel that parenteral deep level to take care of her. I fired two shots towards her but it seems that her body was unscathed. The hard flesh covering her body mustve protected her. It was about midnight when I finished cleaning her up, but she remained unconscious all throughout that time. I landed hard on the sofa chair adjacent to the couch where she was lying, my shotgun resting against my shoulder and my hunting knife resting next to my leg. I stared at the girl in silence, and then sleep took me. I thought it was all a dream, a monster in the darkness, turning into a maiden in distress. It was a fairy tale that my mother used to tell me when I was eight years old. But I never expected that such a story can translate into my reality, fifty years later. I was awoken by the usual chirping of the birds and the sensation of the warm sunlight piercing through my window. I opened my eyes and saw the dream slap me back to reality. She was awake. If I didnt know about the nights events, I would have been terrified and would have fired a couple of shots to the girl sitting on the couch across me. But sadly, I know what happened last night. I know it all too vividly. She was sitting on the couch with her knees pressed against her chest. She had worn the white t-shirt that I placed on the couch the night before. Her blue eyes sparkled against the sunlight, and her bare wings extending across the back of the couch like flesh-coloured spider legs. Her blue eyes stared straight into me. I remained silent and sat straight. Thank you, she said in a meek yet clear voice. Immediately, hearing the youths voice melted my doubts. But I kept it all inside, hiding my vulnerability. Who are you?, I asked. What are you? Im Thennek, she said lowering her head against her knees. Thank you for saving me. Youre welcome, I said swallowing hard But tell me what in the world happened last night? What happened to you? What in the world are you? I didnt realize that I was firing question after question. Thennek as she called herself remained silent, waiting for me to finish my questions. Im- I was an angel, she replied. I went silent. She stood from the couch and extended her bare wings from tip to tip. I was caught in the beauty of the structure of her wings. The spiderlike extensions would have looked beautiful with feathers. Yesterday, I threw away my grace, hence my body burned and I lost my powers. What do you mean grace? Its the source of our powers, she replied I was falling, falling from Heaven. Youre an angel of Heaven?, the words sounded ridiculous leaving my mouth. But in some level, I know this creature wasnt lying. I was! She said. I hated it there. I hated everything there. Overworked and underappreciated. I left Heaven. So youre telling me that you didnt like Heaven so you threw away your powers and left for Earth? I summarized. Yes Thennek said pulling back her wings. the other angels didnt have a problem with Heaven. But me? I wanted more. I wanted more of life. So when I threw away my grace, I burned and crashed into these woods. And I am grateful that you helped me. She smiled. Her blue eyes sparkled. I wont deny that your story is out of this world, I said But seeing your wings, I cant deny that there must be some truth to your story. I know you dont have all the answers. But Im still thankful to you., Thennek smiled. What are you planning to do now Thennek? I asked. By the way, Im Roger, the local hermit. I stood and extended my hand. She just stared at my hand. I pulled my hand back. Thennek shook her head. I didnt really think that far. All I wanted to do was get out of that place she said. But as you said Roger, my wings tell some truth to my story. I nodded. Give me a knife, she said sternly. Her voice was gentle but with a hiss of malice, so I stepped back. Give me a knife. I dont want anything to do with Heaven! I dont want anything to do with those angels. Give me a knife! No Thennek! I said as I raised my shotgun. I didnt know why but my body moved to the defensive, pointing my shotgun straight at her. I want to break free from them! she said. She then stepped back, and extended her wings again, her wing gap extended across the lounge. She then stared at me, and raised both her arms. My heart started beating fast again, but instead of lunging for me, she reached for her left wing, grabbed the bony portion with both her hands and then Crack! Jesus Thennek! I shouted. The hard crack echoed across the room. Her face grimaced as she broke her left wing, red blood spilled over the floor. I could hear her breathing faster, but she didnt cry or shout. She grit her teeth. Her left wing lie limp on the ground, blood oozing from the root attached to her back. Give me a knife! she said stubbornly. I refused. She then reached for her right wing. Thennek Nono..no! Crack! She broke her second wing, it dropped slowly against the wooden floor. And blood was spilling all over the place. Her wings were dead, but they were still attached to her back. I swallowed hard as she looked at me with those pained blue eyes. I knew what she wanted. I grabbed my hunting knife and tossed it to her. She caught it with a sick smile, and then she reached for the root of her wings and started slicing. I closed my eyes I heard metal against skin, slice after slice, and then I heard a thud. I didnt dare open my eyes, until I heard a second thud. I slowly opened my eyes and saw a bloody girl standing in front of me. Her white t-shirt was drenched with blood, her hands were covered with blood, and the knife was dripping with it. On her petite feet were two lifeless appendages, twitching with the last hint of life. Thennek what have you done!? I asked. Im breaking myself free from them., she said breathing rapidly. You lost lots of blood! I said concerned. She dropped the knife, and she collapsed to the ground. That was two weeks ago. She slept for two days before she came around. I kept her in the cabin until her wounds healed. But her actions left bluish and blackish marks on her back. I thought she was mentally unstable, but as soon as she woke, she remained rational and meeker than before. I could not explain it, but she felt and looked like a different person. The nightmare felt like it was over. I took care of Thennek during the remaining days of my stay in the cabin. She ended up being my company in the cabin, filling the serenity with her calm presence and stature. I didnt care that she didnt have any paper works, birth certificates or any of those identity papers. She was a young girl, a gentle girl, and that was all that mattered. If I plan to adopt her, it was going to be a long rough road, but I didnt care. She will have a life, a normal life, after all she chose this world over how she was in heaven. But there was still one thing that held her to her former life. One day she opened it up to me. You dont want to be called Thennek anymore? She shook her head. The more you call me that, the more I feel like I am still part of my previous life, Thennek said. So what do I call you? Do you want me to give you a name?, I asked. She shook her head. She pointed to the calendar in the kitchen. The calendar had a picture of the country farm girl, Jean Sunrose. Call me Jean."

It seemed like every customer that came through the door had a personal problem with me. Especially one of our regulars. As if it was somehow my fault the tea I sold her *three days ago* didnt help her lose twenty pounds already. Perhaps I would still be employed if I hadnt suggested she drink the tea with something other than 3 super sized big mac meals a day. My manager made a big show of threatening to fire me on the spot if I didnt apologise immediately. I pretended to consider it before removing my work shirt, handing it to the manager, and flipping them both off as I walked away. A lack of self control is one of my many character flaws. The bus was late as usual as I stood there in the small crowd dumbly waiting for it, a tangled mess of rage and sorrow. City life was much harder than I anticipated and everything was falling apart. Some emo looking fuck was side eyeing me like he wanted to start up a pointless conversation based on my now exposed cleavage. Great. I was about to satiate my anger by asking him if it was the first time he had ever seen D cups in a tank top when I realized he looked incredibly familiar. I hadnt been living here very long but I had seen this guy around...a lot. I was naive enough to think we just had similar schedules. Awhile back when I caught my boyfriend cheating (again) and was riding the train to the nearest bar this guy was sitting across from me. I was doing that thing where you think the tears wont spill out if you just try really hard and dont blink. Shit never works and I lost it. Through my fuzzy contacts I only made out long dark hair and thick eyeliner offering me a tissue. Embarrassed and angry at myself, I snatched it from his hand and changed seats. Yeah, I know it was rude. But I was in no mood to deal with dude playing white knight you know? Fucks sake I had only been single for an hour. When I missed my period he was riding the bus I caught on the way to CVS. It was crowded and there was only standing room, but I think he was the guy who gave up his seat for me. I hardly registered his presence at the time, how could I? All I could think about was getting my hands on that test. My mind was too busy trying to convince itself everything would be ok and I was definitely NOT pregnant with that cheating jerks baby. Would you have noticed a random guy at a time like that? After the abortion I had to call a cab to be released from the clinic due to some lingering effects of the drugs used in the procedure. They called it twilight. How fucking poetic. As I waited outside it started to rain and I remember feeling grateful for it. I didnt deserve the contrasting joy of the warm and comforting sun. When the car pulled up to the curb goth boy was sitting in the back. I stopped approaching, figuring it wasnt my cab, when he got out and stood in front of me. Cold rain was pelting down on us but he didnt seem to mind as he handed me a small black umbrella with his silver ringed fingers and painted nails. I didnt know if it really happened or not until I woke up still groggy the next day and saw the umbrella lying on the floor. Was this dude stalking me? The squealing brakes of the bus brought me back to the present. Everyone else lined up to get on but my feet were welded to the ground by a rising panic. All of my anger at the creep had drained away leaving a helpless vulnerability in its stead. He was mere feet away from me now, icy blue eyes flicking from my tits to my face, his pale skin framed around black curtains of hair long enough to kiss his navel. I dont know what I was expecting to happen but what he did sure as hell wasnt on my list of predictions. He took off the long sleeved shirt he was wearing and handed it to me. Stunned and confused, the only thing I could manage to do was drape it over my chest and watch him turn and walk away with my mouth flapping open like a fucking barn door in the wind. Line after deliberate line of scars and cuts ran up his arms like a broken staircase of pain. He took a window seat in the back and continued to stare down at me even as the bus hissed and lurched down the street. I let three more pass me by before finally getting enough courage to go home. Everytime one rolled up a cold rush of nerves crawled over me as I fought the idea that he would be waiting for me inside. I finally caved when the sun dipped under the horizon and the approaching darkness became a bigger threat than my persistent stalker. By the time I got back to my shoebox apartment I was exhausted, cranky, and being smacked by the reality that I only had one more paycheck coming that *might* cover the rent if I didnt eat or pay any other bills with it. I decided a hot bath was in order while I could still afford one. Sinking deep into the steaming water I struggled to relax. I couldnt stop thinking about my mysterious admirer and all the times I failed to register his repeating presence. Were there other instances I had missed? How long had it been going on? He didnt seem to want to hurt me. Despite the scare factor of a man I didnt know following me around, I had to admit the obvious: his actions were...nice. The real creep out was how he knew where I would be and how he could possibly anticipate that I would be standing in the rain or would sit across from him on the train. Resolving to confront him the next time we crossed paths made me feel better enough to let it go and get on with my business. I was just about to squeeze a big glob of body wash onto my bath sponge when I felt a tickling sensation on the top of my thigh. I froze. Ruling out the possibility of bugs, as I always rinse out the tub and double check for those disgusting bastards, left me with little other explanation. Water seeped slowly through my fingers from the sponge and drip dropped in an erratic symphony as I lifted it up and away from my leg. Dangling from the bottom and slowly dragging over my skin was a long black hair. I had neglected the laundry for the week and had no clean clothes other than skimpy panties reserved for my now defunct love life. Frustrated and beyond tired I picked a red pair that was no more than a god damned string sewed to a tiny triangle and went tearing through the apartment looking for the strangers shirt. I knew I left it in the kitchenette crumpled on the countertop but found it neatly folded on my bed instead. I wasnt about to wear it after that so I brushed it off the mattress and onto floor. I fell into bed and pulled the covers up to my chin. Despite a nagging unease, sleep took me quickly. The stranger was lying next to me in bed. I gasped and reached up for the lightswitch only to be grabbed by the arm and subdued. The room remained a landscape of grey and shadow, the shape of my attacker an imposing silhouette. He didnt speak when I begged him to let me go and cried for him to leave without hurting me. He didnt react when my sobbing reached a crescendo and I was certain my screams could be heard by the other tenants in the building. Instead of silencing me he continued to work, tying my hands and feet to the corners of the bed. With the task complete he stood and loomed over me. I didnt have to see his face to know his eyes were moving up and down my body. I felt it, slow and deliberate, like a paintbrush relishing every stroke as its color grows bold and deep on the canvas. He finally moved and I squeezed my eyes shut, doing anything I could to brace for the coming violation. My bonds were tight. There was no way out. His hair brushed my skin as he climbed back in the bed and a barreling wave of goosebumps spread over me me like a quilt. I wailed and thrashed. I screamed and pleaded and promised him I could never be able to turn him in because I didnt know who he was. I tried to bribe him with money I didnt have if he would just untie me and leave. I went on and on like for a long time before I realized he hadnt touched me since securing me to the bed or spoken a single word. Nothing I did could get a reaction from the stranger. His only response was steady breathing and miniscule movements beside me. We laid there like that for hours. It felt like it could have been days. I went in and out of consciousness several times. My wrists and ankles throbbed. My face slimy from drying tears and unwiped trails of thick snot. Vomit was threatening itself as a coming reality and I fought it back with all I had, terrified of choking on it. When it didnt come I cried some more until I was almost asleep again. Before I slipped away, the stranger wrapped his arm around my waist and nuzzled his nose against my neck. The next time I opened my eyes it was daylight and I was alone. All signs pointed to the whole thing being a crazy vivid dream and the relief was indescribable. Of course I was still shaken up a bit so I decided to check my door and the small window in my bathroom. Both were locked. Nothing in the apartment was disturbed. Still, I felt edgy. My body ached and I was still really tired so I did what hopeless and jobless people do: I went back to bed. But sleep wouldnt come to me. No position was comfortable. No negative thought could be forced away long enough to slow my racing heart. I couldnt just lay there anymore. With nothing to distract me away from my problems, I decided to tackle the laundry. My building has a basement facility for residents and it is every creepy cliche you can imagine. The lighting was shit and cast ominous shadows no matter what time of day it was. The machines were all ancient and sang a constant concert of squeaky songs about years of use and abuse together. Hell even the vending machine all half stocked with detergents looked like it belonged in a B-Horror movie with its flickering panels. It was definitely not going to turn into a Tide Ad down there. As an added cherry on top of the shitshake I had to stay down there the entire time, lest my machine or clothes be taken. He was waiting for me by the door, still shirtless, and pale as ever. My feet hit the bottom step with a thud and his eyes were on me immediately. The laundry basket I was carrying fell to the floor with a clack and clothes spilled out around our feet. He walked around me and locked the door. I no longer had the option to exit. I knew I was going to die down there. But this time I was actually afraid of dying. Not like when I sliced my wrists in the bathtub. There was no fear, only pain and the desire to end that pain. That was our real first meeting. He crouched next to the tub and told me I had a beautiful face as he swirled his fingers around in the red water. He took the razor from my hands and whispered to me that I was inches from death but he wanted to give me something special. A chance he never had. Because when he killed himself after being picked on and beaten up by the world he unknowingly had signed a binding contract. He said he cant remember who he was before becoming a ferryman and he has no idea what the other side is like. He wanted me to have a choice. I could simply continue dying and possibly become like him and guide the dying to the other side, or I could live and have another chance. The only condition being I would not remember anything. Not him, his offer, my suicide attempt, or the pain. Or the omens... I took the deal of course. I believed everything he told me like a true victim would. I believed him as I overdosed in the bathroom after getting fired. I believed him as jumped off the bridge and into the river holding a positive pregnancy test. I especially believed him after I found out my boyfriend had a secret kid on the way with another woman and that was why he pushed so hard for the abortion. The problem was that I couldnt remember. Every time I could no longer live with the pain in my life I would decide to end it again. I didnt know how many times I had wasted another chance to get better. He would leave me offerings as a symbol he had saved me, but I only had so many before a bill would be due in full. He said I would know when that day was near. He would start handing them to me personally. And I ate it all up with a spoon. It didnt matter if I remembered or not right? There would be signs I would do the right thing next time I would get *better*. Right? Wrong. No one ever wins this game. Standing there in the basement in the flickering lights he grinned at me. The gun my father had given me as a gift before moving to the city for protection was still in my hands. As the blood poured out my head and down my arm he hugged me, laughing. Last call, Princess. His breath was like rotting leaves in the fall. Ill give you one more chance. Just for fun, okay? Because youre so pretty Okay. I cried. Please Can you tell me my fate? I wont remember this anyways. He smirked. Already told you that. I gave you a preview didnt I? You begged and screamed to live and I held out. For you. So why? Why he would let me do this over and over if it meant nothing and I would still die eventually? My fear. He needed me to be afraid of death. Because death prefers it that way. So before I go, heed this warning. Be brave. Keep fighting. If we must die, let it at least be in a way that death doesnt prefer. "

Like wondering if that security guard following you around the store thinks you're shoplifting, or if the people sitting behind you on the train are reading your text messages over your shoulder, or if any of your friends actually like you. I've lived on my own for many years but my anxiety has lived me a lot longer. I finally made the decision to move away from my parents when I was in my early twenties; ready for adventure, a new career and with a head full of naivety. I'd convinced myself that living independently was the sort of milestone that meant my life was falling into place and would show I was capable of making adult decisions. That's how I arrived at a small apartment in the middle of a busy but quaint English town. At the time I moved out I was in a serious relationship, one that was probably overbearing on my part and became long-distance when he decided to start working on the other side of the world. It only took a week to prove me foolish for ever thinking I could cope on my own and without someone to help me organise my life. The start-up company I was due to work for let me know that they could no longer afford to hire a paid intern, apparently something to do with financial instability. It was probably the depression that encouraged my boyfriend to give up on me too, apparently something to do with emotional instability. *I wonder if he has a prettier girlfriend now?* Naturally, I hid all of this information from my family and played the part of thriving millennial like a professionally trained actress. I didn't want them talking about my failures behind my back, and I certainly didn't want to prove their scepticism of my decisions to have been right all along. So I used my savings to continue paying rent, bought enough food to fill my fridge and cupboards for the next couple of weeks and I sat at my laptop by the window every day updating my private blog and quietly watching the people passing by as though I was one of them. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you observe their routine and they don't even know you're watching. I developed a keen interest in watching the shop across the road every few hours, my third floor window giving me an advantageous view of the comings and goings on the street. I would wait for the young blonde cashier to arrive early in the morning, a good half an hour before she opened the store, and watch as she piled the shelves with fresh bread and over-priced cakes which made me salivate with sweet imagination. There was a jealousy that ached in me as I watched; these people going about their lives were so much more successful than they even knew. Steady jobs, a comfortable income, an organised pattern of movement and routine. I began to flirt with the idea of handing in a job application, questioning whether a chance of normality outweighed another blow of rejection. *What would my family and friends think if they could see me now?* It took me another couple of days before I decided to brave the vulnerability of being outside with other people. I walked slowly along the road outside my apartment block, taking careful glances at the shop and waiting for the staff to arrive and unlock the door. I hid my eyes behind a pair of oversized sunglasses and my body beneath a thick black coat, perching myself on a bench about ten yards away. I'd gotten used to anxiety attacks by now but something about the way my heart pulsed and my mind raced told me that there was more to this  an excitement I hadn't felt in a long while. A few moments later I saw her. The girl with the blonde hair and enviable smile moving towards me, like she was dancing along the pavement to a song I couldn't hear. She stopped to unlock the store doors and took out her earphones when she noticed me approaching her. ""Hey there, you're here bright and early! Anything I can help with?"" she practically sang when she spoke. I couldn't comprehend how anyone could feel this happy before sunrise and suddenly became self-conscious of my appearance and absent gaze. I stuttered for a few seconds and then spoke as eloquently as I could, ""Hello. I am new around here and would like to apply for a job"". She gasped and beamed at me, ""Oh that's great, we don't get many people around here besides tourists so it's nice to see another young face"". She looked me up and down and raised an eyebrow, ""are you feeling okay? It's early but it's still definitely not cold enough to wear a coat!"". She touched my shoulder and smiled again, and asked ""Where is it you're living?"" *Why is she being so friendly?* I pointed to the window of my apartment across the street and flinched as I realised I'd pulled the safety net away from my secret space. The girl told me that the manager wasn't accepting job applications anymore but that she'd love to show me around the town once she finished work, which I anxiously agreed to. She gave me her mobile number and told me she'd text me if her shift overran. So I went home and waited. It was early afternoon when a sickness came over me. It was like a wave of all of my self-doubts and insecurities had bubbled up to the surface of my skin at once. I couldn't face the idea of stepping outside of my apartment again but I longed to see the blonde girl who had unwittingly become an icon of all the qualities I yearned for. I sent her a simple text, ""Hi. Can we meet at my place instead when you're ready. We can leave from here together?"" She replied within a few minutes, ""Sounds great! See U in an hour xo"". In no time at all there was a knock at the door and I was inviting the blonde girl into my apartment. She looked different now, more beautiful than I thought fair, and with skin that glowed even in the dimness of my flickering apartment light. *Surely no one can be this perfect?* She gave me a hug and moved back slightly, spinning as she took in the crowded and dusty appearance of my home. ""Wow, someone seriously needs to unpack and start cleaning"", she laughed and ran her finger through a layer of dust that had congregated on top of a cardboard box. I forced a smile back and explained to her how I'd been so busy since I arrived, which was a lie of course, but still she looked at me warmly and promised to help me unpack next time she had a weekend free. Suddenly she asked if I was ready to head out. The idea of leaving my safe space again unnerved me and I started to wobble as another wave of dread crept through my bones. The blonde girl quickly stepped forwards and placed both of her hands on my arms as though to hold me steady and looked me in the eyes, ""Is everything okay?"" I blinked slowly, trying to clean away blurred streams of visions from my eyes, but I was blinded by this feeling brewing inside me. I fixed my eyes back on hers and grabbed her hands, ""You know I think it's best if we stay here"". \*\*\* It was a few days later that I realised my cupboards were empty and my hunger was growling from the insides of my stomach. I had invited the blonde girl to stay at my apartment with me and was just about to ask about her favourite food when through the window I noticed some unusual activity happening within the store. It was still early but the manager was pacing around the shop. There were police officers writing in small flipbooks who to be asking him questions. I decided to ask the blonde girl if she knew what was happening down there and what they might be investigating. I walked over to where she was sitting on the floor of my apartment and spoke softly, ""I'm sorry but I might need to wait until tomorrow to get us some food. The store looks busy at the moment, do you know what's going on?"" She looked distracted and didn't respond when I spoke to her, her eyes pointed towards the door and a gaze that told me she was as hungry as I was. For the first time I didn't think she looked as beautiful as I originally recalled. I was much happier having someone around to keep me company and I spent the afternoon with a spring in my step and decided to unpack some of my boxes. The blonde girl looked tired so I told her to rest and tidied around her, making sure to reiterate how pleased I was that was staying. By the evening I had noticed that she was starting to smell, like an odour which reminded me of rotten fruit, so I encouraged her to take a shower and freshen up. She was too weak to hold up her own arms so I helped to wash her hair and wipe away the make-up that dripped down her face and down her chest. The blonde girl looked even more ghastly when I dried her off. I didn't want anyone to notice how bad she looked, how her skin looked older and paler, so I brushed her hair, sprayed her with deodorant and applied some blusher to her cheeks to make her feel better. Unfortunately not even the showers or sprays of perfumes could disguise how foul she smelled. How ugly she looked. I decided to make her a bed underneath the floorboards of my clothes closet, using a thick rug to hold the panels down and to block some of the smell. Of course I would still speak to her every now and again, asking her if she was comfortable or if she needed anything, but she gradually became more quiet and I was left with no choice but to try and forget about her all together. \*\*\* Its been a week or so since I last thought about the blonde girl sleeping under my closet. I realise now that it's been about the same amount of time since I last ate anything. I had caught a glimpse of my reflection in the window earlier and have to admit I was taken aback. I have lost a substantial amount of weight since I first arrived in this town, my clothes hang more loosely each day and my face is much slimmer than I once recognised it. I forced myself to look beyond my reflection in the window and forwards towards the view I enjoy the most: the street below me and its inhabitants. But it's a funny thing isn't it, when you notice something for the first time? Right above the store I realised that someone new was occupying a flat that had been for sale since I'd arrived. An adult, slightly older than me, sat at a computer by the window typing, absorbed in their world and completely oblivious to my eyes. I wondered what they sounded like, what they would think of me, if we could be friends. I have decided that I should introduce myself to them, but first I needed to carry on observing. I need to study them and watch them when they think that no one else is watching. It's actually quite easy when you know how. *Can you feel me watching you right now?*"
146,vulnerability,nosleep,Evil Sal (part 1),9,979u18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/979u18/evil_sal_part_1/,2018-08-15 02:30:05,"Session 6 February 22, 2018 6:06 pm Patient #6 Lou I got sent away again. The girl with short, dark brown hair spoke quietly, yet calmly. She was dressed in a red jumper and ripped denim shorts. She wore a pair of old red sneakers at her feet. She must be freezing, I thought to myself. It was still winter, after all. Yet, she seemed un-phased by the cold. This was how she responded to most of her surroundings, cold and stern, like the weather itself. Only, back then I was naive to the anger that raged inside her, burning like hungry flames. - - - And how did that make you feel? I asked, pulling myself back to the present moment. I couldnt let myself get so easily distracted. The situation at hand was far too important. I was furious, she said. I still am. Nobody knows or completely understands how much I suffered in that place. Those..places. She stared off into the distance. I could tell that she was angry, but the look in her eyes indicted something more; something...sinister. I decided to proceed with caution. Have the nightmares stopped? I asked, trying not to give way to any hint of unease that I was feeling at the moment. No. She looked me directly in the eyes, her dark brown orbs becoming a more potent shade of green. I still have the nightmares, almost every night now. She paused and looked down at her hands. Theyve gotten bad again. She seemed almost sad as she said this. Although, knowing her, I couldnt tell if she was genuinely sad, as she seemed incapable of feeling normal emotions, at least when it came to other people. She showed no remorse, no empathy. My guess was that the hint of sadness I sensed was purely due to the fact that this situation impacted her directly, in a negative way. If the roles were reversed, she wouldnt even blink an eye at the thought of someone elses suffering. Even so, I still wasnt prepared for what I heard next. And for how many years have you been having the nightmares? I asked, trying to keep my composure. I needed her to feel as though she could trust me, if I was to get any information out of her. However, I got the impression that trust wasnt something that she just handed out, even to those closest to her. Its been about 10 years. 10 years. Thats a long time to be having the same recurring nightmare. It wasnt like her to show any sort of weakness or vulnerability. However, as a professional, I could sense that she did feel fear. And these nightmares were only glimpses of the fear she has experienced. Sometimes they go away for a while. But, as I said, theyve been getting worse lately. And they feel so real. She took a moment to think about how to phrase her next thoughts. It was almost as if she was afraid to disclose too much information, in fear that I might think she was crazy. But why she would care about my opinion, when she clearly didnt value anyone elses, was beyond me. Unless... I waited to see if she was going to disclose any more information about her nightmares. Exactly how real did they feel to her? This question began to shed a bit of light onto the many mysteries that surrounded this girl. She didnt care about my opinion, per say. However I was in a position of power over her, not that she would be accepting of the fact. And if I felt that she was mentally unstable.. I did have the power to make her nightmares become a reality again. I was sent away again. Her words echoed in the back of my mind. She was afraid of being sent away. She was afraid of not being in control. I paused to reflect on my newfound knowledge of the girl that sat before me. I had to show her compassion. She definitely wasnt going to trust me if she knew that I had discovered her fears. In her mind, her fears were her weakness; a weakness that she knew could be used against her. I decided to change the subject matter a bit. Do you think that this sudden increase in your nightmares could be due to your mothers current condition? I tried my best to speak calmly, I couldnt let my true emotions be known to her. I had to stay professional. She finally spoke again, only one word, but it was something. Yes. The anxiety you are experiencing is normal for someone in your situation. You do know that, right? I know. I almost felt sorry for the girl. Her mother had cancer and didnt seem to be getting better. She and her father werent on the best terms. If there was anyone she trusted the least, it was him. But what she said next came as a surprise to me. ...its my fault isnt it? What is it that you think is your fault? I tried to console her. No one should have to go through what she was going through, let alone think it was by any fault of their own. She didnt speak again for a long time. Just as I was about to break the silence she said, Sal says he knows what I did but that its ok. She paused again. He says they deserved it. Care to elaborate? I asked, curious to hear more. ... Who is Sal? I tried again. ...Evil Sal. His name is Evil Sal. He doesnt like it if people dont refer to him by his full name. Only I am allowed to call him Sal. She stated matter-of-factly. Okay..who is..Evil Sal? I was caught off guard by this new twist in the story of an already complex individual. The girl paused and rustled through her backpack to pull something out. It was an old rag doll. The doll was made of stained muslin fabric. Its face was sewn into a serious expression. It had straw-like, raggedy hair. Its face was partially burnt. Is that Sal-uh..Evil Sal? I asked, trying to hide the fact that the doll, quite frankly, creeped me out. Its burnt face seemed to stare into the very depths of my being. It felt as if it were...analyzing me. Quickly realizing how ridiculous my own thoughts were beginning to sound, I turned my attention back to the girl. In response to my question the girl nodded, clutching the doll tightly between her clenched fists. Why is he burnt? I asked. Did you do that? The girl paused for a moment, as if she was listening for an affirmation; permission to continue, perhaps. From whom, however, Im not completely sure. She then gave a small nod. He told me he likes to be burnt. She stated. Again, her words came out as if she were making completely rational statements; as if she were stating facts. Who told you? I questioned. Sal did. At this point I was beginning to grow more concerned. Not only was it not normal for a girl her age to be playing with dolls, but I understood that she had been through a lot and that this doll served as some sort of comfort to her. What really concerned me was that she seemed to genuinely believe that this Evil Sal was real and that he could communicate with her. In addition, the things she claims he was telling her were starting to become violent. Why would she burn the doll? I love it, she suddenly spoke, as if she were able to read my thoughts. What? was all I could murmur, as I was taken aback by her odd, yet precise timing. Fire. the girl responded, almost before I could complete my question. Not that it had been much of question.. I love fire. I like to set things on fire and watch them burn. She stated as she, once again, looked me directly in the eyes. She seemed to beam with pride as she said this. Maybe it was just my imagination, but her now fully green eyes seemed to reflect flames from deep within. In a strange way, this was the happiest Id ever seen her...if you could call it that"
147,vulnerability,nosleep,Spending My Birthday With My Brothers Dead Best Friend,17,97ezzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/97ezzi/spending_my_birthday_with_my_brothers_dead_best/,2018-08-15 13:27:14,"By the time you may read this, the days where he spontaneously appears will be near. Ive changed my name and the people mentioned for safety purposes, and made it to protect me, my family, and friends. To start, my name is Samuel. Ive had these on and off experiences with a spirit of someone I once knew. But the time I seem to see it most, is on my birthday. background: When I was younger, I was in a garage band with my brother, and a couple of his friends. Well call my brother Edgar. My brothers friends, who well call Jeremy and Fabian, played in it. I was the youngest in the group. We played at high school parties, even though I was only starting 6th grade, and they were already Juniors. Our most popular song, because, one it was the only bass line I knew without a feeling of loss confidence and two because it was Jeremys favorite, was Hotel California by The Eagle. Everyone was able to at least nod their head to it, and it was a song that I could personally never, ever get tired of. I felt like we had it down good. For a garage band at least. It always made our connection stronger, no matter how many times we played it. Anyways, we always had a tradition of toppings and froyo for birthdays. Whenever it was anyones birthday, we would grab frozen yogurt, and for however old you are, thats how many toppings you had. You had to finish the dessert that night, or else it would end up somewhere you wouldnt want to find it. One year, my brother found his peanut butter chocolate froyo in his new shoes. The only twist, is we would find the worst toppings. So the froyo could be bomb, but we would put grass, and gummy worms, then garlic, and such, you get the idea. Well, one year for my birthday, back in 2011, Jeremy was the one to retrieve my horrible snack. We were close, and he always found a way to make my dessert more delicious than my stomach was expecting. He drove a Triumph Daytona 955i (motorcycle), something he took more pride in than anything else. He used most of his college savings on it, and never let anyone ride it unless it was him or his father. However, that night had been especially stormy, and washed out most of the main highways. He left around 7:30, right before the power went out and by the time we had heard the news, it was already 8:30. Jeremy was hit in a hit-and-run accident, presumably by a much larger vehicle, because by the time the police at showed up around 8, he was DOA (dead on arrival). I had seen nothing like it before. His motorcycle was clean across the intersection of the highway, his body seemingly crushed, his helmet nearly cracked in two. I could see the bag filled with my dessert nearly inches away from his body, and immediately I blamed his death on myself. For weeks, even after the funeral, even after going back to school, even after seeing a therapist, even after all of this, I still put myself to blame for what happened to my brothers best friend. Well, before I even notice, its been almost a year since what happened. Schools started up, September begins to shift weathers as October approaches, and my birthday draws near. This is when it began happening. September 29th, late Saturday night around 11:30 as I tried drifting to sleep, a loud motorcycle rages outside of my mothers townhouse and seems to get louder and louder. I couldnt move. My eyes darted around the room; Is the tv on? no Is my sister on her phone in the bed next to me? no Am I dreaming? I take a heavy, wheezing breath through my mouth, the noise only getting continually louder. I sit up, coughing moments later. I glanced outside. The suns up. I turn my attention towards my sisters bed. Shes gone, and her bed is made. I panted, glancing at my phone. I clicked the home button, and read it; 9:35 am. After that, even more weird occurrences began to happen. I practiced my bass guitar even after the band split, for obvious reasons, to calm myself down a bit. I would always tune it for different bands. An example would be that I tune to a darker, more metal sound when playing Pink Floyd, or tune higher when playing Led Zeppelin for the course, hard sound the bass produced. However, whenever I would lay my bass on its guitar stand, I would come back either a few hours after or a day after, and it would be tuned back to the pitch. I assumed it was my older sister, who always took interest in what I played, but I couldnt shake the feeling. The only person in the band that couldnt tune a bass by ear was Fabian, who played the drums. But Edgar lived with my dad 35 minutes away. And my sister would hang out with her friends every so often, and on days where everyone left the small house, it was still tuned to the default tuning by the time I got back. I thought it was a far reach, but I felt like it was Jeremy. Like he was taking care of me like he used to. Other things began happening too. Like the disappearance of my picks, and my vinyls being shifted around during the night. I had even had my ukulele fall completely over even after it was placed in its holder secularly. But what began to scare me, was the sleep paralysis. A week before my birthday, I began to wake up in the middle of the night, or at least what I thought the be very late, and watched a large black figure stare at me as I laid there in fits of 10-15 minute panic sessions. I would wake up in the morning, having the sensation of a thousand emotions. I felt like I had to throw up, and felt the sides of my temples burn and thump with horrible headaches. But what always confused me was my brothers texts. Edgar would say, hey, good morning kiddo, hope you slept good and feel good today. have a great day. Even though before that week, he had only texted me a picture of a dog or two on and off and didnt bother to call much. But it wasnt until the night of my birthday where my mind had pieced this puzzle together. I usually spent the day after my birthday with my dad to celebrate, even though he didnt particularly like me. It was mostly a celebration of me with my siblings (Edgar, my sisters (one through my mom and dad, two through just my dad), and my step-siblings). But the night of my birthday, I felt especially down, because I knew what today was. I felt a bad feeling wash over my body in waves all day, and it wasnt until the night where I felt it hit rock bottom. I knew what was to come, and this feeling was just something I couldnt shake. I wish I could say this was just a story, this was all fake and pretend. Because thats what I wish all of this was. But it wasnt and its still not. What happened that night is something that happens the night of all my birthdays. Something that I guarantee will keep occurring on my birthday, and something I expect to keep approaching me. That night, exactly a year after Jeremy had died, I went to sleep at 12:30am. I awoke, not too surprised at my sudden feeling of extreme vulnerability. I felt I was locked down, like I was some sociopathic patient at a ward who would stab someone with my front tooth and a spoon. My heart was at this point the only noise I heard until he was there. The dark figure was cast over me, a dark feeling of dread at the pit of my stomach, starting to churn because I now realized who this was. I wanted to whimper his name but I simply couldnt. I couldnt. His name hadnt entered my mouth in a year, and the only time I had wanted to say it, it only came out as a simple huff. I realized a quiet hum had been vibrating from his figure and I recognized the melody after a few seconds of its out of tune shaking tone. Hotel California. It could be a far reach, and maybe Im just pulling at strings when I say this because I miss my best friend. But I have a feeling he sings it to me for my birthday so no matter how old I am, I will never forget him. Since that day, the same thing has happened every year. To this day, I know I hear him humming it to me on my birthday and I refuse to believe otherwise. Because even if the humming isnt there, and the only noise audible is my heart beat, it still draws me closer and closer to him, every time I hear it. For the past two years, I found small items within my house which left me without shock, only a longing for his company. Two years again was a small receipt, with a simple 11 scribbled on the back. Last year, a small white plastic spoon. My birthday is approaching, and I know what to expect. I feel numbed. Im never prepared, but I am ready to listen to the sweet evil moan of a song I once played without a feeling of lost confidence. [Spending My Birthday With My Brothers Dead Best Friend ](URL "
148,vulnerability,nosleep,the sleeping security guard,36,98h6w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/98h6w4/the_sleeping_security_guard/,2018-08-19 12:52:11,"Ever since I dropped out of university the only jobs I ever had was in the security sector and I will be honest I didnt get my SIA security licence through legal means but knew someone who could get me an SIA licence for a price. I had contacts with all sorts of people within the security sector which is how I got jobs in the first place and in this profession its all about who you know rather than what you know. I bet you dont feel safe now knowing what the security industry is really like but its actually just reality and the types of people who tend to get jobs in the security sector are people with hardly any skills in real life nor any motivation to do anything real with their lives. We just cannot be bothered to do things and we are quite lazy and as I am admitting this I guess protection is the last thing in most peoples minds who work in security. Dont get me wrong there are some who work in security because they want to protect people but the majority are like me. The money is high and the hours are long but you get use to it and I prefer the mornings instead of nights. I just cannot seem to stay awake through out the whole night for some odd reason even when I have had enough sleep in the morning. I am simply not a night person and each security job requires every security guard to do nights and mornings. I have been caught many times by multiple managers and multiple security companies resorting to taking pictures of me sleeping on the job on a night shift. Managers always check on their security employees especially the ones working the night shift and every security job I got fired from I managed to get a new one because I knew someone. One skill I did have in this world is knowing how to make friends and making contacts. Damn it I wish I was determined to do something proper with my life but I just dont have any motivation at all. Looking at facebook picture of people I use to go to school with and seeing them travel the world and living life to the full and here I am doing hardly anything as a security guard. Any way I got fired from another security job for sleeping through out the night shift at a construction site and I got caught because I was answering my phone and my manager came down and caught me snoozing through the window. I was instantly told to go home. The worst types of people to work with during a night or morning shift are security guards who use to be soldiers or police officers because they always see everything as a duty and always so straight forward if you know what I mean. Any how I managed to find another security company through my contacts and this security company looked after old abandoned buildings and the company paying them to protect old abandoned buildings is part of the council. Some of these old abandoned buildings are over a 100 years old and there is a group of people who want to preserve them and make sure they are protected. It was all night work though because in the morning these old abandoned buildings are museums for the public to enter and learn about them and their history. Now at first it got me worried when I was told that it was all night work but when I also got told that no manager checks up on their guard at night or any buttons to press around the building I was instantly relieved. I could snooze through out the night with no fear of getting caught and each security guard is alone in each shift. Its 4 days on and then four days off. At that point it felt like I had won the lottery ticket and finally a job I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. The area was the safest area I had ever worked in and I didnt worry about burglars or troublesome kids trying to break into any old building I was guarding while sleeping at the same time. No one is going to check the CCTV cameras unless there was a break in or some kind of trouble arising and someone needing to check what had happened the night before. Overall, I felt at peace and finally found the right place to work in and I was looking forward to starting my first night shift with this company. The old building I was guarding was over 200 years old and was a popular museum for people to visit and it wasnt so big nor so small. On my first night shift I made sure to do my walk arounds the old building and just making sure everything was locked and tidy before I put my feet up in the office which was behind the reception I was supposed to maintain all night. I pulled up a couple of chairs and I brought myself a small cushion from home and wished myself a good night. The shift was 7PM-7AM and I decided to go to sleep around 11PM after making sure everything was locked and secured. As I closed my eyes and dozing off into dream world I started thinking about chat I had with the manager who interviewed me for this job. When he told me that they didnt check on their security guards at night nor any kind of check I jokingly replied so how do you know if they are sleeping or not and the manager replied well we kind of dont have to that bit of the job is already covered and I remember being confused by it but just nodded on. I was wondering by what he meant by that and as I started dozing off into a much deeper sleep and that heavenly feeling when tiredness commands are being met all I remember is being flipped into the air and as I hit the ground all I screeched was what the fuck! When I came to my senses the multiple chairs I gathered within the office were now connected to each other to make a pyramid shape on the table. I disconnected all of them and tidied up the office and made my bed again by using the chairs and decided to go to sleep again hoping nothing would happen again. I was really tired at this point and when I dozed off I could feel myself going into a deep sleep. Around 3AM I felt this horrible draft of cold air all over my body and that disgusting feeling of vulnerability you get when discomfort feeling hits you like waking up early in the morning on a cold winters morning. I then felt hardness around my head and body and when I opened my eyes I confusingly found myself not in the office but upstairs with the window open. I was sleeping on the floor and when I got up I felt terrible and I was thinking to myself whether I had slept walked but I had never slept walked in my life. I checked the CCTV cameras and it didnt show me sleep walking but when I checked the CCTV in the upstairs areas in this old building where I found myself waking up in such discomfort. At first the cameras were showing absolutely nothing in the upstairs areas and then everything went black and when the cameras came into focus again I could now see myself sleeping on the hard floor with the windows open. I was still tired but so frightened and I turned on the heater where I kept on nodding off and then waking up while maintaining the reception as I was supposed to do. The next shift I found myself more exhausted than ever and I made sure everything was locked and decided to go to sleep around 11 PM. I went into the office and gathered a few chairs and made my bed. As I started dosing off I could feel pain all over my body and it was as if something was digging its claws all over my body. I couldnt take the pain anymore and I got up and went into the bathroom where I inspected my body. I had nail marks all over my body and some parts of my body were bleeding and bruised. I got some cold water and wiped my body down and decided to try and sleep again around 4AM and when I tried to go to sleep again I could feel pressure around my neck area. I could feel my body going from deep sleep to light sleep when ever pressure was applied to my neck and when I awoke I found myself standing on a chair on the third floor with a rope around my neck. The rope was connected to one of the chandeliers which was newly installed into this old building and I managed to keep my balance on the chair and pull the rope off my neck and I jumped down on to the floor. That whole week I didnt sleep one bit and my body wasnt reacting well to staying awake the whole night and the depression I felt was unimaginable. I managed to get the contact of the other security guard David who also does nights at the same building I work at and through text I managed to learn he too has experienced the same thing. He told me that as time goes by things become more extreme and just dozing off lightly might make you end up in a situation you will not want to be. He once ended up outside in the canal water when he decided to doze off in the office. Luckily he was a good swimmer and he swam back to safety and just hearing him tell me these stories it made me re-think about working at the old building. David expressed to me that he had finally found another job and has told our manager that he was going to stay for one last month working in the 200 year old building. I was happy for him and I myself was on the search for another job and on another night shift I was so exhausted even though I had enough sleep in the mornings I was still tired. I tried changing my diet and exercising a bit more but I always felt tired in the night shift and like I said I just wasnt a night person. I fell a sleep in the office once again and that great safe feeling of sleep coming over my body and as I went into a deep sleep I could feel this horrible cold feeling coming over me. I could also feel another person next to me and as I woke up I found myself on the second floor of the building with Davids dead body next to me. I screamed and rushed downstairs trying to make sense of everything that has just happened. I phoned the ambulance and the police all the while texting my manager and when they took his body my manager came to the site. He looked at me and all he said was shouldnt be sleeping on the job and then I thought about the remark he made when he first interviewed. He said he doesnt really have to check whether his security guards are sleeping on the job or not because something else is making sure we are not sleeping on the job. I wanted to give up working for him and I didnt want to work for this security company anymore. My manager smiled and all he said was its not really up to us whether you can leave or not and he just walked away with no care in the world. When I went home I made sure to never go back but when I went to bed but then I could feel chairs under my back and when I awoke I was back in the office. I contacted my manager and all he said to me was we do not have control who goes and I hopelessly went back into the office and lying down on the chairs I tried to go to sleep. Sometimes I would get flipped off or something would be scratching my body to keep me awake. I miss just being able to go to sleep with no disturbance or fear of something happening to me and I regret ever taking this job as I am not a night person and never will be. "

After a while you don't even pay attention to the things they buy. You just scan it like a robot. Look for the bar code and push it through. Down the sliding ramp where they are hurriedly trying to pack their bags as fast as you can scan. I've reached a sort of zoned out come state. I swear someone could put through KY jelly, such take and a giant cucumber and I wouldn't even notice now. My minds elsewhere. It's mind numbingly boring. Nobody really bothers to talk and that suits me. I actually look at the clock and see it's ten to seven. I'll finish in ten minutes and I just don't want to. I'd work until midnight if I could. Anything but go home. I'm 33, with no family for hundreds of miles, no friends and just him. Him who will be waiting for me to get home and fix him a meal. By the time I get home he will be a few beers down out of an 8 pack. He works as a plasterer during the day but seems to work shorter and shorter hours and drink longer and longer each evening. It's the smell that hits me as I enter our home. The low lying stench of beer, sweat and cigarettes. He will be slouched in his chair with his ever growing gut and bloated face, almost like a sad reminder of the person he once was, he still has all that black hair. I have a faint memory of how we would fool around in the early days, and I'd tug playfully on his hair as we rolled around making love. He was a beautiful man. Now the only hair pulling is when he grabs me by mine as he pummels me with those big cruel fists, for the terrible insubordination of being 5 minutes late home. That was last week. He left me on the floor with a few sharp kicks to my stomach and slurred mutterings about me being a ""cheating lying cunt"". So yeah, I open the door (its 19.15 by my watch so I know he cant complain!) I'm hit by that smell, then as I hang my coat up my eyes look shamedly at my own reflection. Whilst I've never been model, my once bright eyes and flawless skin are starting to look tired. Lines, not laughter lines, are becoming ever deeper in my forehead and around my mouth. My once fabulous natural dark hair is now looking limp and flat with plenty of grey running through it. I know he's killing me. I know he probably will kill me. But what really are my options? To flee across the country to listen to my mom's ""I told you so's"", a refuge?, or to just run away and live in poverty on my own? There was a time I had considered all of these options and I guess I'm just a coward. Cos I just stayed. I took the weekly beatings where he's always careful not to mark my face. I take the insults and put downs that chip away at my very core. I walk into the lounge and he is sat there. The ashtray I hate so much is full of butts, the empty cans around him aren't a good sign and neither is the look on his face. Sometimes he has this glazed look like he isn't all there. I try and defuse whatever the fuck is going on in his head by saying ""I'll make us some dinner"". And without staying for a reply I scurry off to the kitchen and get out some vegetables and mince, and begin chopping up onions to make spaghetti Bolognese knowing he likes that. Hoping he likes that. As at the checkout. I'm functioning in a disconnected way. Chopping whilst looking down and not really thinking.when he comes into the kitchen. He staggers slightly as he walks and he stinks. I wish he paid more attention to his personal care. There once was a time I'd devour him he looked and smelled so good. Now nothing makes me feel sicker than the thought of his hands on me. But here he was reaching out for me. His heavy and rough hand grips me by the back of the neck. His fingers clench at me like you would pick a kitten up by the scruff. As though to show me his strength he squeezes tighter and pulls me towards him so that I'm inches away. His breath stinks as he spits in my face that he had driven past the shop and seen me flirting with a customer. I tried to plead that I was just being polite. But he doesn't listen. The adrenaline kicks in within me familiarly as his right fist smashes into my stomach, doubling me over in pain. As I begin to cry he drags me down to the ground and begins to stamp on me. He sits on me with all his weight and this time he has really lost it. His face contorted in rage as he spits out insults ""slut. Cunt. Whore. Cheating bitch"" as his fists now rain down blow after blow onto my upper body. His hands move and he grabs me by the hair with both hands and begins to slam he back of my head down against the floor. This is it. This is where it ends I think. Screwing my face up with each time my head cracks against the bare tiled floors. I cry and beg but bang bang bang he seems determined to smash my skull in. He hates me. He really hates me I think. For the first time in years I begin to think. I realise I still have the knife in my hands and without even giving it much thought I swing it up. The first swing and the tip of the knife catches him on his shoulder and scrapes down his left arm. He doesn't even notice which for the first time ever makes me very angry. I swing again and again now my body is rigid and he's lost the ability to slam my head down with ease. I stab repeatedly at that left side of his neck and shoulder and blood begins to pour down that scruffy plaster stained t-shirt that was so ill fitting his gut hung out the bottom. Now it's almost as though someone is pouring bottles of red wine down him. He stops trying to smash my head against the floor. He lets go of my head and is touches his front as though in disbelief at the blood on himself. I take this opportunity and swing the knife full force, driving it deep into his windpipe and tearing it out leaving a jagged gash that is pumping blood out faster than he could hope to stop. He tries to cry out but all that comes is a guttural squelching sound. He falls backwards slipping in his own mess. Within seconds hes unconscious. A large wet patch appears on his jeans as his bladder loses control. I know he's dead. I squirm my way from underneath his bloated lifeless body, pulling myself up using the kitchen worktop I realise how badly I just all over. I look at the mess surrounding me. The kitchen floor is simply a pool of blood. Glasses and plates and smashed and oh my god my head. I cannot even move it without agonising jolts of pain searing through my skull. He really did a number on me this time. I take hold of his stupidly short legs and pull him slowly towards the bathroom. He leaves a smear of blood behind him like some menstruating slug. But now the fire of rebellion has been lit inside me I can't stop. It took all my strength to get him into the bath. Like some ridiculous rag doll I had to yank him by the arms and drag him in. Not just a fat useless lump. But a dead weight too. My energy was gone as he flopped down against the white tub. I sat on the edge of the bath and cried. I cried for all the wasted years. Every beating. Every nasty word. I cried because I missed the man he had been. But mostly I cried in anger. He would not steal another day from me. I go to the kitchen and get the set of knives I cherished, my pride and joy I had always loved chopping up vegetables with. That I had almost fatefully kept razor sharp. The scissors I use to cut away his clothes. Those rags go straight into a large refuse sack. And then I set to work. Like the pig that he was, I began butchering him. With the sharp carving knife I cut in at the joints, sawing through sinew, ligaments and connective tissues. I had to force the n Blade through with both hands and all my weight at the larger joints. The cracking and scraping against bone made me nauseous. With his arms and legs off there were 12 pieces of him in a big black sack. I took hold of his prick and balls and pulling them firmly, with one fast swing of the knife they were off. I throw them into the bag too. The hardest part was the head. But I'd read articles about how ISIS decapitated people with knives so I knew it was possible. Cutting through the spine was horrendous. I snapped to as though waking up in a bad dream. My arms were pure red up to the elbows. I ran and threw up in the toilet. What had I become ? What had he made me do? Who was the monster now? I go and make a coffee. My mind flicks back over all the times I'd goad him into hitting me. How I played the oh so timid housewife victim, because I wanted him to push me into this. There is nothing more arousing to me than seeing the look on a man's face as he realises I have the better of him and it's too late. Of course the police will come eventually. But by then I'll have long since stripped his bones of any flesh, liquidated it in my blender and poured him down the toilet where the other shit goes. His bones I'll smash on a tarpaulin outside then casually toss in some near by lake. And this place? I'll bleach every single inch repeatedly so when the police come a knocking there's nothing to see. ""No officer I've not seen him in weeks, the last time was when he told me he had another woman and left,"" How many times has it been? 4? They are like predators these men. Like hounds. They can smell vulnerability and a victim a mile off. Before long another will come sniffing. I work through the night and still go to work the next day. I work the checkout. I could have served you. The quiet mousey housewife that wouldn't say boo to a goose. "
150,vulnerability,nosleep,There's something strange living in the wallpaper of my new home,14,8z31n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8z31n3/theres_something_strange_living_in_the_wallpaper/,2018-07-16 02:49:48,"Ever just stand back and admire the presence of even the simple atmosphere around you? The aroma, the embellishment, or the hands in motion on an old antique clock, making the room seem alive? This was my reaction as I stepped foot into my newly purchased house, with my beautiful fiance. We both grounded our feet to the hardwood floor below us; a feeling quite rewarding, as we were both used to worn out carpets and concrete basements throughout our lives. The ceiling was at a pretty high altitude, an easement of my claustrophobia. There was a fireplace tucked into the wall to the left of the room, mirroring the warmness of that instance. Spiraling stairs led up to the second floor, delivering a dramatic addition to the scene before us. There was, however, an even more elegant and interesting part unparalleled to the rest of the house. It was the wallpaper. Colored in black, gray, and white, the paper on the walls was obstructed by designs. In some areas, simplistic black lines danced just inches from the bottom of the wall. Around other corners, the designs would change to outlines of various things, like staircases and lamps. Unlike most wallpaper you'd see in a home, this house has a different look with every couple of steps taken. Almost like its sole purpose was to be offbeat to the rhythm of the rest of the building. Im sure some folks wouldnt be very fond of the look, but I found beauty within the artistic disruption. My partner mirrored my love for the place, bewildered as she turned around each and every corner. This, after all, was a much needed changed. She was still a little shaky from her divorce a couple years back. Her past marriage hit a wall, just as her abusive ex-husband often did. He was always unsupportive when it came to her art, not to mention violent whenever he drank. It was a refreshing sight to see her eyes widen above a gracious smile, with our new chapter coming to a start. We decided to get an early rest, around 7 oclock, right before nightfall. I was struck completely awake by a loud bang in the middle of the night, like caffeine manifested into a drumbeat. My fiance was still asleep, as being a deep sleeper rendered the noise ineffective. The bang was accompanied by soft, inaudible voices. These ambiguous communications eventually came to a halt and were followed by the sounds of scratches, reminiscent of a cat clawing at the walls. I contemplated my choices, but ultimately decided to cautiously search my new place of residence, just in case someone had broken in. Being a new neighbor might have meant that we were fresh target practice for burglars in the area. Exploring, to my dismay, left me with more questions, rather than the answers I was looking for. Exiting the doorway to my bedroom, I kept as silent as humanly possible, so as not to alarm the potential intruder. I was not armed, but vulnerability didn't shake me as much as my curiosity or the vibration of the initial thump. Suddenly, I spotted that sent chills throughout my body. What caught my eye, as I turned my head, made me blink more than once You'd think I was insane, but I could have sworn something behind the wallpaper moved. A mini silhouette, that seemed in sync with the black lines embedded in the paper covering the wall. The figure ran across, escaping around the corner. It'd be the first time I'd ever say this, but I followed the miniature person on the wall. Approaching the next hallway, things got even more peculiar. I swore I saw the human"" in the wall, pop out into the hallway, and dash away. Immediately after this confusing occurrence, the wallpaper turned yellow in color and became plain. Any designs disappeared, as if someone freshly painted over both sides. Overtiredness was what my mind deemed an answer to all this chaos. Trying to conjure up some comfort and at least delay the perplexity, I made my way back to bed and fell asleep, convinced that I slept walked and dreamt my adventure up. The morning after, waking up was not so easy. I only got about a few hours of sleep before my lovely lady woke me with a smile brighter than the sun, shaking me like an earthquake, and holding an odd-looking marker in her hand. She stared at me with a grin saying, Youre the sweetest man I've ever made contact with, the love of my life. You made my heart melt with the words you spoke to me in the middle of the night last night! Then gave me an everlasting kiss. This had me quite baffled. What do you mean? I asked. How silly of you! She exclaimed. You know you handed me this marker and told me you wanted to be with me forever, welcoming me into your home. You then proceeded to reassure me that nothing, not even the walls could come between us. It was so wonderful and cute to hear. Obviously, all of this puzzled me beyond belief. I knew for a fact I wasn't even in the bedroom most of the night, never mind even speaking a word to her. She was passed out. Instead of trying to explain what was on my mind, I looked her in her brown sparkling eyes and responded with, Oh of course, my apologies. I'm still half asleep. I love you so much. Hopping out of bed, still a little shaken, I took a few steps towards the door. I'm going to make us some delectable breakfast; some of your favorite bacon and eggs that I make for you, I let out while proceeding to leave the room. Okay! I'm going to sit here and draw you and I with this, a symbol of our new life together, she smiled, gesturing towards the marker in her hand. Just let me know when the food is ready. Before heading down to the kitchen, I wandered off to check out the guest room. It was on the same floor as the bedroom and still unexplored fully compared to other sections of the building. The tinted glass door was a queer choice of entrance to an interior space, nevertheless a division made for temporary residence. In opening it, my mind flipped a switch to discomfort. The walls were a deep red shade, the floor was made of (what seemed to be) paper, and the bed was in the exact same arrangement as my own. But this wasn't what made me uneasy. Roughly sketched humanoid faces, side by side across the walls, stared me down. Despite the eyes of ink surrounding my claustrophobic self, I felt alone at that very moment. I had a sudden sense of disconnection from reality and became severely cold. Moments later, I escaped this state of invasive uneasiness, but only by something far worse. A screech. One of a female tone. Panicked, I ran, stopping at my bedroom doorway. Flustered, my eyes glistening from the beginning of tears, the bewildering sight of our door stood wide open in front of me. Straight ahead on the red paper wall, a picture of my fiances face had been drawn across it in black ink, with her nowhere in physical sight. I searched all about the house, but she had vanished. All that was left behind was a letter on the floor with a repeating phrase Not even the walls can come between us. "

Its beautiful in its raw vulnerability, able to twitch just slightly below my blade  but otherwise immobile, and at my mercy. The patient came into the emergency room feeling shitty. Theres an understatement - Ive never seen an appendix look this way. A lone bead of sweat picks its way along the creases of my brow. Nimble. Precise. Deliberate. Crepper wipes the sojourner from my skin with deft professionalism. Even with the surgical mask covering her countenance, I can tell she senses something is amiss. Shes a good nurse. I have the appendix, she responds crisply. Extremely enlarged at 19.13 grams. Ill send it to- Its fine. I  Im fine, Nurse. Please  go ahead and take it yourself. I clench the scalpel slightly tighter. She responds with stoic intrigue. She knows how bizarre it was for me to request just one assistant for the procedure, and this complication cannot be explained easily. I dont have time for discussion in the middle of surgery. Go now. Yes, Doctor. She regards me for a moment longer before turning around and heading out the door. I act quickly. With the patient split open, I am able to reach inside the abdominal cavity and grab his rectum. Im a skilled surgeon. It is short work to detach the rectum from his anus. When I am done, the large intestine sits in my hands like an empty sausage casing. Well, perhaps no so empty. I can tell by the bulge in my left hand that the patient had clearly eaten sooner than the recommended twelve hours earlier. I cant blame him, though  he didnt know that surgery was imminent. Grabbing the colon like a withered toothpaste tube, I squeeze and pull the bulge along its track. Aiming it over a small metal bowl, I slide my gloved fingers nimbly around the contours of his intestine. My efforts are rewarded when a smelly brown eruption squirts from the end, looking for all the world like a blossoming flower in extreme fast forward. I empty the contents into the bowl, then get to work on the next part of the plan. I waste no time, estimating a maximum of 240 seconds before Crepper returns. But my scalpel wavers for an instant. Then I remember the photograph. My twin son and daughter, both eight, bound and gagged. My wife next to them, face contorted in agony, four of her own severed fingers stuffed into her cheeks by an unknown assailant. A very simple message: Follow these instructions during todays surgery, or Ill cut them to pieces very slowly over the next six months. I thought about what was written after that. Im a skilled surgeon. Part of that talent is the ability to shut down both tears and vomit. Though its never been as difficult as it is in this moment. Yet I begin. I quickly make an incision on the side of the stomach. Then I pull the rectum to the opening and cover it. I take a deep breath, then reach for the needle. Im able to stitch the open rectum onto the stomach very quickly. Im sewing the abdomen shut when Crepper walks back in. Doctor, I- Then she senses that I do not wish to speak. Instead, she walks to the side of the table and whisks away a rogue bead of sweat from my forehead with surgical precision. Good job, Nurse. I sigh. Well done. Stand by, the patient should be waking up very soon. I took a deep breath. Lets see if he still [feels shitty](URL [BD](URL "
152,vulnerability,nosleep,The Knig Leech,85,8zgaxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8zgaxs/the_könig_leech/,2018-07-17 10:09:51,"Named for Dr. Uwe Knig, the German scientist that discovered its existence in 2009, the Knig Leech is perhaps the least-documented virus in the world. An initial database search results in only one official document by Dr. Knig that makes passing mention of it in a 2010 article in *Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift*. The article is a review of recent research goals by Dr. Knig. Almost off-handedly - and roughly translated from German, mention is made of a concerning viral discovery has been made that may require international attention. That was the first, and only, official documentation that references *Cerebrufurem 1,* more commonly referred to by the few thousand people aware of it as the Knig Leech. The virus, discovered during the autopsy of a Malagasy immigrant in Germany that died of a brain aneurysm, was nearly undetectable, save for a small layer of evergreen speckles that lied beneath the top layer of the primary motor cortex. At first, the Knig Leech seemed to dull motor functioning, but neurological research with mice lead to a frightening discovery: the virus slowly wrests control of the brain from those contaminated by it. Much of this was discovered in increasingly unethical fashion. Functionally, it does so by first spreading across all memory-related functions of the brain, identifying key memory-related neurons and attaching to them. Once a sufficient amount of memories have been identified, roughly ninety percent, the Knig Leech seems to develop a type of consciousness of its own. It attacks the emotional functions of the brain, largely in the amygdala, before moving towards the motor various motor cortexes for movement. Eventually, and very suddenly, the virus effectively merges with the mind, taking full control of the human body. For the infected, it is assumed (but not fully known) that all consciousness ceases at this point. The only foolproof way to identify the virus is posthumously. The virus struggles to manage the primary motor cortex, and overpopulates this segment of the brain to compensate, leaving discreet green specks directly beneath the top layer of the segment. Most frighteningly, the virus can spread through any bodily fluid, including saliva, surviving roughly 20 hours after exiting the body. Throughout 2010, just fewer than 100 Germans were identified through autopsy as being infected by the Knig Leech. Dr. Knig was unable to create an accurate portrayal of how far, or where, the virus had spread. A private meeting was held in early 2011 by the UN Security Council to address the ramifications of the virus. It was agreed that, to prevent panic, any evidence of its existence would be officially erased. All research by the Knig team done so in a private research facility near Leipzig. International research rapidly grew in kind, with over 20 teams spread around the globe secretly trying to discover how to fight it. In 2012, infections were identified in China, Russia, and India, numbering in the low thousands. In 2013, the first official cases were identified in France, the United States, and Great Britain. By 2014, over 10,000 cases were identified in China, with numbers in the mid-thousands in Russia, India, and the United States. At the end of that year, a number of unethical studies were performed to identify the pattern of behavior in the virus by a country that will remain unnamed. The research team took prisoners sentenced to death and deliberately infected them to identify changes in behavior. Through mice, they had identified that the takeover stage of the virus occurred within one month of infection, and calculated that this would take roughly nine months in the human brain. The researchers created personality profiles for each of the infected inmates and monitored them throughout the following year. A number of indicators for infection were identified, including memory lapses, mood swings, and a sensation of dj vu, but these were not reported in every subject. However, what did occur in every subject happened roughly a year after infection  degraded motor function, including difficulty running, jumping, and swimming. After about a month, the motor functions restored themselves to near where they were prior. This, the researchers believed, was the key moment where the takeover occurred, as previous studies had shown similar behavior in mice. However, the study of the subjects continued. Researchers felt it was necessary to see if there were any behavioral differences before the subjects were terminated. It didnt surprise the researchers when the subjects seemed to be restored to their personalities previous to the infection  no memory lapses or mood swings  as that matched all previous research. What did shock them was that, when the infected were only in the presence of each other, all communication ceased. Camera and microphone recordings showed that the infected, once researchers had left the living quarters, ceased all verbal communication with each other, but continued to interact. In one instance, a subject left his living space and moved to the common room, quietly setting up a chess board and then sitting in silence for about thirty-five minutes. Another subject, asleep in his living space, left and joined the first subject in the common room. They proceeded to play chess, completely in silence. This behavior ceased and standard communication resumed once the subjects became aware they were being filmed. The study was terminated after a researcher was attacked by the subjects. During an interview where a researcher disobeyed protocol and entered a subjects living space alone, a group of eight nearby subjects dropped what they were doing and proceeded to the room. Footage shows that, as a group, they held the researcher down and began dropping saliva deposits from their mouth and forced it into the researcher. This continued for roughly two minutes before they relinquished the researcher and returned to their previous activities. All of the subjects, as well as the researcher, were terminated following the closure of the studies. In late 2016, seven of the twenty-three countries researching the Knig Leech pulled out of the project, citing a lack of evidence to its existence, including Germany. Dr. Knig reported that his team was satisfied that *Cerebrufurem 1* had been misunderstood in function and posed no threat to either Germany or the world at large. By the end of 2017, an additional 13 countries ended all research on the Knig Leech, including Great Britain, the United States, and Russia. The countries, almost in unison, suggested that the virus was a variant offshoot of orthomyxoviruses, better known as influenza, and posed no larger threat than the flu did. My country has been one of three continuing to figure out how to fight the Knig Leech over the past six months. I am part of a research team that has spent the better part of four years trying to identify any weaknesses  any vulnerability, at all  that can help us battle it. Yesterday, word came down that our government was pulling the plug on the project. A memo was e-mailed to us stating simply: The Knig Leech has largely been disproved by modern science, and as such this program no longer provides a needed service. Thank you for your understanding. And that is why I am telling you this now. I want you to know, those of you that arent part of *it*, that our time is limited if we dont fight. Its spreading, and its spreading fast. A cure has to exist, or some way to resist it. It can be anywhere. It can be anyone. It can mimic the behavior of the people you love, so perfectly that you would swear on your life to me that it was them. It knows that. It will tell you it loves you, that it's your friend, that it cares about you, but it doesn't. It takes every memory, every emotion, every thought a person have ever had. It spends a year gestating so that, the day it turns the lights out, it can fool every person that ever knew its victim. And then it can spread itself to all of those people, ignorant to what actually stands in front of them. It could be in you right now, waiting for the day it will be ready. Maybe youve noticed some strange lapses in memory or some intense emotional swings. Maybe youve noticed some difficulty with your movement. Maybe you dont notice anything. One day, you will be there  and then it will be there, instead. Next time you are with others, take a careful look around. One of them has it. It might not seem like it, but its watching you carefully, waiting to make you part of it, and anyone else free of its grasp. The Knig Leech isnt a virus. It might have been, but now it isnt. It is conscious, it is clever, it is singular in purpose, and if we dont act now, it will devour us all."
153,vulnerability,nosleep,I dreamed the present.,10,90069b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/90069b/i_dreamed_the_present/,2018-07-19 08:37:46,"This is one of strangest things that has ever happend to me. It is the nuances of that story, the small details that make it eerie. It began one evening after me and two friends got done working out, since i was the youngest of all three and didnt own a car at that time one of them offered me a lift. He had huge Mercedes and he liked to drive fast, we all did, we were young, stupid and boastful boys after all. I get inside the car and iam immediatly grabbed by a strange feeling of vulnerability. A voice shoots trough my mind: ""Get out of that car."". Weird, i thought. Im no coward, but i would rather walk now. I sit down akwardly, no position that i take seems comfortable. My hand reaches for the safety belt, eventhough i never use it and neither do my friends. ""Oye, its forbidden to use the safety belt in my car."", snarls Dan, the driver of the car, who has the same name as me. My answer is an akward laugh. ""Right."", i mumble as i let go of the belt and it snaps back into place. Its a short drive anyways. After Dan guns down a few cilometres we decide that we are not tired enough yet and stop at local parking lot to listen to some music, talk and smoke a few cigarettes. Dan pulls into the parking lot. The second the car comes to an halt i open the door, jump out and take a deep breath. The air feels fresh and cold and i can smell the leafy scent of autumn as this strange feeling of vulnerability that had fallen over me, dissolves. As long as stay out of that car, all is well. We do as we had planned, we smoke cigs, listen to loud russian rap and talk about drugs, weightlifting, girls and cars. Typical banter of the young and foolish. About an half an hour passes and we all decide to head home. We shake hands and say our goodbyes and Dan offers me a lift again. I tell him that id rather walk, he shrugs it off and heads towards his car. Then he turns around for one last time, looks me in the eyes and asks: ""Hey, Dan. Are we gonna see each other again or what?"". I smile: ""You can count on it, pal."". What a strange choice of words. A few hours later im in my bed, trying to sleep. My mind is restless and i spend a few hours wide awake in my bed, searching for a comfortable position again. Eventually i do fall sleep, only to be haunted by a weird dream. Me and my brother are out hiking, somewhere in the States, which is strange enough by itself. But as my brother and me are climbing up a steep hill, we suddenly hear the shrieking of car tires, which plow down the hill, towards us. No, towards me. I scream. A small red car is heading right for me, i try to launch out of the way, but i cant. The street is too narrow, the last thing i see before the car crushes my body and sends itself and me flying down the ledge of the street, is the shock frozen face of a women in her 50s, sitting in the drivers seat. My bones are being crushed and in the last seconds of my life i can hear the desperate yelling and cussing of my brother. I fly through the air for what seems to be an eternity. My body is working its way through tree branches and twigs. Finally i land on the groundm deep in a wooded valley. I feel how the rest of my insides is pulverized. Before i take my last breath i suddenly awake. Shit. Im in my bed, im alive. Im hot and my boiling skin is saturated by the salty sweat that my body produced, while my mind was fooled by a nightmare. I breathe out and wipe a drop of sweat off my forehead. Phew. All is good. My life didnt end. It was all a dream. I shake my head and take out my phone from underneath my pillow. The time is 06:26 AM. So i can rest for a few more minutes. I brush it off, im not foreign to nightmares. The school day is slow and boring and i meet none of my friends in the gym. Its their choice to be lazy. I arrive at home in the evening, when i get a message from one of my friends. He tells me that Dan has been hospitalized after he suffered a car crash in the morning. Around 06:30 AM, a women in her 50s crossed a red light and T-boned Dans Mercedes. The impact was so strong that the women died on the spot. He also send me an article from our local online newspaper, i scrolled through the pictures and saw that the women was driving a small red car. I didnt feel anything, because i didnt know what to feel in such situations. The strangeness and tragedy of it all was too much for me to comprehend. The fact that i felt extremly uneasy in Dans car, as if it was marked in a sense, as if i was feeling someone elses fate and realized that im no part of it. Dans strange question, that he formed as he was feeling something as well. The fact that we have the same name. Did that connect us in a way? And then the dream, which i must have dreamt in the same time as the accident happend. It was all too much. There were too many questions. Dan lived, with minor injuries and he is still doing well today. And i wish for the soul of the uknown women to rest easy. Since then i ask myself many questions about fate, precognition and intuition. Can a dream give a look into the future or in this case the present? Do we all have a fate? Is there even something like a coincidence? Or a mistake? Or is all life designed in all its details by some higher power? Perhaps i dont need to know, perhaps all i need to understand is that i should trust my instincts and act on them, no matter what people around me might say. Listen to your gut. And if your gut tells you to use the seatbelt, then by all means do so. "

A dark, desolate place. Our planet has been ravaged. The earth cut into, creating a wound that cannot be healed. People live in fear. The streets lie in disrepair. The landscape has become nothing more than a featureless drawl. Each day drones on, bleaker than the last. Dark minds control the bowels of this machine, creating the sparks which control this society and everyone who dwells within it. How can there be hope when it is extinguished as fast as it is ignited? How can there be salvation, when our leaders are working against it? How can this world survive, when the cracks that threaten to destroy our reality begin in our streets, our shops, our homes Our minds. My sneakers slap the pavement as I race down the darkly lit street. The only illumination is from the streetlights that turn on and off as I pass below them. Sirens ring out behind me and I can just make out the flashing red lights in the puddle in front of me. My shoe splashes the puddle, rippling them away. Josh Lester! I spin around and the police car comes to a halt in front of me. Inside lies an impenetrable darkness. A cold, metallic darkness. Stop running, we have you surrounded. The robotic voice cuts through the silence with violent precision. I catch my breath whilst weighing up my options. If you surrender yourself calmly to us now you will be trialled fairly. That monotone voice again. That. Fucking. Voice. Relentless, unforgiving. No questions asked. Is that what you said to my brother when you snatched him off the street? A brief pause, like the car is processing what Ive said. It repeats the same thing again. If you surrender yourself calmly to us now you will be trialled fairly. I stick up the finger at the car. Fuck you asshole! I kick of the wall next to me and continue my frantic getaway as I hear car tires screech behind me. I make a sharp left down a darkened alleyway between two buildings. They loom up on either side of me, nothing but featureless black squares to the naked eye. The metallic voice echoes around me, closing in like a hunter to its prey. I slam face first into something hard. Shit, a wall. Dead end. My eyes scan the dark environment around me for anything to spare me from my persuer. My hand brushes a metal bar of some kind. I find a rung. Another rung. Fire escape! Probably old and rusted, a general death trap, but an escape route all the same. I grab onto the bars and begin to climb. Im scared. So scared. Scared of what they will do when they catch me. Scared of what they have done. Scared of what is to come. My attempts are feeble. Deep down even I know that. Like trying to find a drop of water in an ocean, or counting grains of sand. You can run from the past, you can run from the present, but the future will always catch up with you. The air is cold up here. The metal stings and numbs to the touch. Each step drains a little more of my energy. I look down and see the lights of a police car far below me. That motivates me. I start to kick at the rusted platform below me. Jackpot! I hear a metallic bending sound and it goes spiralling down into the darkness. I look back up at the starless sky above me and continue my climb. I breathe out with relief as my hands grasp the roof top. My hands grab onto the edge of the roof top The ladder has been ripped off here though. I get a firm grip on the ledge and hoist myself upwards. I graze my chin on the rough concrete on my way up. I look out across the dark city. My city. Extinguished. Not even a single light penetrates the darkness. The darkness that infiltrated us from the inside, leaked through the cracks we forgot to patch up. Infecting our friends, family. I know it is pointless. Any minute now the future will come calling, and you cant run forever. I walk slowly to the side of the building I climbed up and look down into the darkness. Its too quiet. The lights have stopped flashing. Suddenly a robotic head bursts out of the blackness below me. I nearly fall over the edge in surprise. Its head snaps upwards towards me and its eyes glow red. Its voice activates. Josh Lester. You are guilty of resisting arrest, plotting with the intention to murder, attempted murder, and plotting against the future. Brute force will now be used. I shriek and kick the robots head downward. Sparks fly and it makes a piercing screaming sound. I kick it again and it goes plummeting into the darkness. I fall back onto my bottom breathing heavily. I knew they would come after me, but droids, really!? Fucking really?? At least it was only one. I can deal with one. One isnt a big problem. Right on cue a robotic hand clamps onto the edge of the roof to my right. And another. And another. Robots are climbing onto the roof all round me now. Im fucking surrounded now. FUCK!! They close in on me, their red eyes glowing even brighter in the darkness. My vulnerability intensifies. I feel like a sheep, experiencing its last moments as a pack of wolves closes in. A sheep chased until it can run no more. A sheep with nothing left, nothing to lose. Something slams into the back of my legs and I crumple to my knees. Place both hands flat upon your head. I look up at the closest robot. Fuck you. Its eyes flash. Brute force. And then somethings smashes into the back of my neck and my vision goes dark. White. Clean. These are the first thoughts that pop into my head as my eyes open slowly. Im strapped into a large padded chair. On my head is a large helmet attached to a mechanical arm protruding out of the roof. The room around me is big, and bleach white. A small control panel filled with buttons of all shapes and sizes sits on a pedestal in front of me. A sliding door that previously looked like part of the wall opens on the other side of the room and a man dressed in a grey suit comes strolling in over to me. He presses a small brown button on the control panel and a hole in the floor opens. A full-size leather chair rises out of the depths and the man takes a seat in front of me. I cant move my head but I direct my eyes towards him. He clicks another button and the front of my helmet opens freeing the front of my face. I dont know you. Of course you dont Mr Lester! See I was selected specially for this task. Somebody with no ties to you, not even remotely. My name, my background, are all a complete mystery to you. I guess it helps keep you on your toes, always digging for more information, never getting to comfortable with me or your surroundings! The man speaks in a cheery tone. Cheery, but fake. Almost intentionally, it seems. I see your wondering why Im speaking like this? How did you kn- The man interrupts me mid-sentence. Its to make you uncomfortable. I cant allow anything to feel right for you Mr Lester. That would be against protocol! He clicks his fingers and a holographic screen appears in front of us. Words start appearing down the page. It would appear you have amassed quite a rap sheet retseL rM! I frown at this strange name change, the only familiar thing in this room taken away from me. The man continues. Attempted murder. Plotting with intention to murder. Plotting against the future. All quite terrible crimes. He looks at me. Would you like me to go on? I give no response. Youre wondering why we are keeping you here. Im sorry, but that is one of many questions I cannot answer. What I will say though, is that you have committed crimes against the future and in doing so, have surrendered your human rights. There are no limits on what we can do to you. No rules. He stands up from the chair and leans in towards me. I think its time for me to ask you a question Mr Lester. What are you hiding from yourself? Just like that the front of my helmet slides back into place obscuring not only my mouth and nostrils, but my vision as well. I hear buttons being pushed. Something clicks into place. Have a nice trip retseL rM. These are the last words I hear before the blackness pixelates and dissolves into whiteness before my eyes."
155,vulnerability,nosleep,Knives.,20,8s0o8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8s0o8l/knives/,2018-06-19 02:04:37,"For the first 5 years of my childhood, I lived a comfortable life inside a not so comfortable apartment. The apartment itself had one bedroom, which my parents selflessly gave to me while they slept on a sofa-bed in the lounge. As a child I never really considered how small my living space was, instead appreciating the amount of effort my parents put in to making me a happy and healthy child. They put their heart and soul into protecting me, keeping me away from bullies and children who wanted to take advantage of my vulnerability. But they couldnt protect me from the blue boy at the end of my bed. Every night he would visit me, calling out my name until I awoke with squinted eyes, quickly realising I would not be left alone tonight. He wasnt a boy of many words, in fact, I dont recall him ever having a mouth, but it never stopped him from taunting me with my name until I screamed, crying for my parents. This however, was not the only strange occurrence happening in the apartment. Every day as I played with my toys, I would hear my mother complain about another knife going missing, to which my father would respond that it was the 5th time this month or something along those lines. Whenever I began to suggest that the little blue boy was doing it they would quickly shut me down, my skeptical father laughing at the thought of our apartment being inhabited by a ghost. That was until the babysitters started leaving. My parents both worked hard to supply us with income, leaving me with many babysitters throughout my childhood. They never stayed long however, as they all complained of hearing strange noises throughout the evening and became increasingly uncomfortable with every hour until they practically burst through the door as my parents came home. The repetitive process of hire a babysitter, babysitter leaves, hire another babysitter was exhausting until we finally decided that we had to move, and that was the end of our experience. The reason I write this is because something strange happened yesterday. Celebrating my 20th birthday, I drove home to visit my family in our village to celebrate. Its a family tradition of ours to order from the village Fish and Chip shop on special occasions, so I wasted no time in walking there after my parents suggested it. As I entered the shop, the familiar face of Samantha lit up, evidently excited to see me. Ethan! Its been so long! She exclaimed, her wrinkled face beaming with excitement. Samantha had run the Fish and Chip shop since before I was born and her welcoming and easy persona meant she always had the latest gossip regarding the village, which I was always eager to hear. After ordering my familys usual order, we chit-chatted about how the village was doing, what festivals and celebrations were soon etc, until she made a face as though she remembered something that made her uncomfortable. Ethan, you used to live in the apartment block across the street, didnt you? She said, looking at me with inquisitive eyes. Yeah, whys that? I asked, with my interest being peaked at the unusual conversation topic. Well, the current owner of your old apartment came in the other day, looking rather dishevelled. Of course, I asked what was bothering him and he told me he couldnt shake the feeling that he wasnt alone in the apartment I started to become uneasy, remembering the occurrences that happened when I used to live in the flat. Oh, really? I asked with a facade of nonchalance, hoping she wouldnt push the topic anymore. Yeah, quite strange She said seeming to brush it off which I was heavily relieved by. A few moments passed and our food was ready, Samantha handed the bag to me, wishing me well as I began to leave the shop. Oh! Ethan! I forgot to tell you the strangest part! She said, calling after me. My stomach began to knot as I anticipated what she was about to say, with dread I turned around to face her. Oh yeah, whats that? I said, my voice slightly wavering. Well, he told me his knives keep on going missing."
156,vulnerability,nosleep,Ever have that nightmare where you're naked in public?,1,8uxr46,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8uxr46/ever_have_that_nightmare_where_youre_naked_in/,2018-06-30 09:39:54,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here. I am a 22 year old geek. The kind who who will drive home 30 minutes before showering with the guys at school. The kind who will go in the pool with his shirt on, and underwear under his boxers, just incase. Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame. I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful. She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude. My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"". She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"". Yeah right. Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch. I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know. I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt. There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile. Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view. The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake. Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides. And there I was. Martin the virgin geek. Naked. Buck naked, in fact. More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves. More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf. I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty. Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born. My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air. I walked around the entire lake. The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked. Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it. ""Oh my God, you RUINED my shot!!!"" It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent. ""I've been planning this since 4:00 am, and this nude boy stumbles in and ruins it."" She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. She then said ""Or...did he?"" And then started taking photos again. Of me!!! ""Beautiful, simply beautiful."" I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds. Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery. I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me. ""You can't take those pictures!"" She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit."" I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!"" She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here."" That made me blush beat red. She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting."" As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger. I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze. She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability."" I said ""I'm no model for a painting."" She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off."" I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree. She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air."" She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress. ""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you."" My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!"" She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name. ""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months."" Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes."" She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold."" As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos. A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was. A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front. With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. Somebody bought it for $5,600. There was even a second painting. My round, plump bare ass jogging as I ran retreating to my clothes. That one now hangs in my own town's city hall."
157,vulnerability,nosleep,Don't always trust your GPS,43,8vpmdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8vpmdr/dont_always_trust_your_gps/,2018-07-03 15:19:27,"I really should have realized sooner that something was not right. I was on my way home from college for Christmas break. Finals week had been hell and I couldnt wait to get home to my family, my pets, my friends, and my queen sized bed. It was already dark when I left my last final -- unfortunately, my university had assigned the 6:00-9:00pm time slot for social science classes, and my anthropology exam had taken longer than I had expected it to. Of course, the day I was heading home had reached the lowest temperature on record in over forty years for my area, so I lugged my giant duffle bag to my car, threw on some layers of clothing, and cranked up the heat in my car. My hometown is about two hours from my university, and I had traveled to and from it many times by myself, always taking the same route: there were two or three turns where I had to get off one highway and onto another, but most of the way, it was a straight shot. Im sure you are familiar with highway hypnosis. Ive noticed myself being affected by highway hypnosis on twelve-minute drives to work let alone two hours on a relatively empty, straight highway. The turn where I should have realized something was off happened before I even realized I had made it. I was simply on autopilot, listening to the instructions given to me by my built-in GPS even though I was irritated it had interrupted my music. It vaguely registered in my mind that I didnt usually take the exit it had told me to use, but I figured I had accidentally tapped one of the alternate routes suggested by my Maps app and didnt think too much of it. Soon, Maps started taking me further and further away from large highways. I kept following it as it led me into darker and darker areas, through winding, mountainous roads and even onto some dirt roads with little more than a street light or two littering the ground next to a farm and a small house. By then I had started to feel paranoid but did not want to stop driving in order to check my GPS for fear that my car would get too cold and stall, stranding me in the middle of nowhere in dangerously cold temperatures. I considered turning around and trying to retrace the route I had used, but I was unfamiliar with the turns and did not have a clue how to get back to the highway. It had started to snow. Not knowing what else to do and due to my usual confidence that I get lucky in situations like this until things turn out well, I kept driving and ignored the nervous feeling in my chest and stomach. (I know. Im the definition of the idiot who dies first in horror movies). I slowly drove over an icy bridge and into a city that I had vaguely heard of and knew was close to my hometown, which comforted me slightly. My GPS led me through hazy and eerily inactive streets and past churches, schools, and quiet restaurants. As I was driving along a small road, my GPS announced that I had reached my destination. Alarmed, I slowed down, pulled to the side of the road and looked at the screen in the console of my car. It still displayed my own house address as my destination, but puzzlingly, the little checkered flag was at my location. As soon as I had noticed the flag, my car shut off. Quickly, I tried to restart it and was met with nothing, not even the desperate clicking that usually accompanies a car that is failing to start. I reached into the cupholder where my phone was plugged into the car, only to see No Service. My heart sank into my stomach. I knew that if I put all the clothes in my duffel bag on, I could stay in my car overnight and try to survey the area when morning came; without a doubt, my parents would become worried before it even hit midnight and notify someone who would find me. I would much rather do that than take a chance and go searching for any nearby houses; plus, I thought, I didnt know what kind of people I would be met with if I had gone to search for help. I did anything I could to rationalize my decision and decided firmly that staying put was the best idea. With another wave of uneasiness in my stomach, I threw my door open and quickly went to open the trunk. Walking around to the back of my car, I saw a figure approaching me slowly. I could tell even from a distance that the person would tower over my 56 frame. Instinctively, I put the sharp part of my key in my hand to extend between two of my curled fingers, the cold metal hidden by the long sleeves of my sweater and coat. Did your car stall? the figure mumbled to me in a deep, raspy voice. Oh, no. Im just checking to make sure I didnt forget something in my bag, I lied. I knew as soon as I had said it that it wasnt a good enough lie, and as he got closer to me, I could see the disbelief on his face. He looked like someone you might see at a gas station in the middle of the night, buying an unhealthy amount of Mountain Dews and beef jerky. Are you sure? Yes, I said, not turning my back to him. Thank you, though. For what? he asked me. At this point, I was extremely uncomfortable with our interaction and with how close he had gotten to me. I ran my thumb over my key, making sure it was positioned well enough to be effective if I had to use it. For checking. But Im fine, I smiled, hoping he would go away and that he couldnt see my teeth chattering: whether it was from the cold or my fear or both, I didnt know. You have a pretty smile, he said, lowering his voice. I could swear I saw sweat on his forehead even in the fierce cold of the night. You can come into my house and call for help. Your car is dead. No, thank you, I responded firmly, but maybe I could use your phone? I only have a house phone. At that point, it was painfully clear that he was trying to lure me into his house, and I didnt know how else to escape the situation. Oh, thats okay. Goodnight, I said, quickly going back around to my car door and getting in. The man lingered awhile, simply staring at me in my car, before slowly walking away. I let the breath escape that I had been holding in, but was cut short when the glass of my car window shattered. He had thrown a rock in my window. I started screaming. Shhh, he said, reaching in my window for me as I screamed and writhed away from him. I backed myself up against the opposite side of the car, but he grabbed my scarf, then my shoulders, then my waist, and pulled me out of my car. He had me in a death grip with his arm around my waist and squeezing my wrist, and was walking me toward a house I hadnt even noticed was there. I kicked my legs, punched at him and screamed as loudly as I could, but nobody came to my rescue. I waited all day for you to finish your tests, he whispered into my ear, making my skin crawl and my heartbeat race, dread washing over my whole body. His breath smelled like alcohol and cigarettes, and my knees shook uncontrollably. I didnt want to imagine how he knew who I was or how I had tests or, more importantly, what was awaiting me in his house. I didnt stop screaming. He dragged me inside and told his Smart home system to lock the door behind him. He led me inside, down a flight of stairs and down a hallway into what appeared to be a computer room. I eyed the terminal, and he chuckled. Somewhere in the room, his phone buzzed. You cant use the computer yet, sweetheart, he cooed at me. Not until I know I can trust you. He forced my mouth closed, covering it with a long piece of masking tape he had apparently left dangling from his desk. He finally let go of my wrist to grab the roll of remaining tape, and I took my chance. I shot my arm out and shoved my key into his left eye socket, stunning him and causing him to stagger backward. As he scrambled and writhed in pain, covering his eye with his hands, I kneed him as hard as I could in his groin and kicked him in his stomach with all the force I could muster, hoping it would be enough to send him backward and knock him out. Luckily, I had caused him to smack his head against the concrete wall in his basement, and he fell to the ground with a loud thud. My whole body shaking and my heart pounding out of my chest, I went to his computer and tried as many different combinations as I could think of for passwords. Knowing I had to work quickly but needed to be quiet, I simply typed in jumbles of letters and numbers and pressed enter. Finally, as I had hoped, his phone buzzed once more in the room. I had alerted his security system that someone unauthorized was trying to gain entrance to his system, and he was receiving a notification. As bright as he had appeared to be, he hadnt disabled the emergency call on his phone. I dialed the authorities, tried to move some things in front of the room he was in to barricade it, and retraced our steps in his house until I was back outside in my car, shivering and watching my skin turn purple in bruises left by the strength at which he had been gripping my wrist. I wasnt a very religious person, but all I did until the police arrived was pray. As it turned out, the man was a mutual friend of one of my friends on social media. She didnt know him, but allowed him to follow her; from there, he found me, tagged in one of her posts. He found out where I went to school, found my records, gained access to my accounts, and, as easily as that, bypassed any security that my car had in place. Since cars connecting to the internet and built-in GPS systems are a relatively new technology, cyber criminals (who may also be real criminals) are able to easily take advantage of even the most minuscule vulnerabilities in any device that has at one time been connected to some type of internet. Police and cyber security professionals learned that he had hacked my GPS, used the buffer overflow vulnerability, and caused it to glitch on my end, but had used coding to tell the GPS to send me to his home while it still appeared to be sending me to my own house on my console. Long story short, dont always trust your GPS. I was lucky. You might not be. "

I was 32 at the time, still single and living my life. We married each other after 2 wonderful years of dating. I was sternly against the idea of marriage at the time, believing that I'd not get married under any circumstances. That was my view, until I finally met my wife. Till then, my life had consisted of mostly one night stands, short flings and in total: a long string of unsuccessful relationships. Intentionally unsuccessful, mind you, because I didn't want any of them to succeed. I wasn't ready to settle down just yet. The abundance of nightclubs and the social acceptance of hookup culture ensured that my physical needs would always be taken care of. I was blessed with good genetics and worked hard to become a successful neurosurgeon by age 28. So, hooking up with random women, wasn't exactly a difficult thing for me. I wasn't always like that, though. I used to believe in love and happily ever after till that notion was shattered during my first serious relationship with a girl named Alisha. She was the first girl whom I thought I really loved. I started partying and going on rebounds after she broke up with me. To this day, I firmly believe that she was the one person I actually loved, till I met my current wife(of course). It was my fault and I had messed up and cheated on Alisha. I'm man enough to admit my mistakes. One day, I was drinking with with a pretty red haired girl at a friend's party, and too many drinks later I found myself waking up in her bed on the next morning. I came clean because Alisha deserved to know the truth, but she didn't give me a second chance. I was heartbroken, but it was her choice. I would've done the same to her, I guess, had I been in her shoes. After she had left me, I started spending every weekend sloshed at nightclubs. Thus, working in the hospital during the week and partying at nightclubs during the weekends was all I was used to doing. That all changed on June 25th 2012, when my soon-to-be wife joined my hospital as a fellow neurosurgeon. I had been told about her joining by my supervisors, but what they had told me differed drastically from what I saw when she came into my chambers. I was expecting a serious, experienced 37 year old woman from whom I'd get to learn a thing or two myself. What walked in seemed to be a beautiful Greek Goddess in human form. She looked like she was in her twenties, fit and almost as tall as me. She had long blonde hair, which was neatly tied up in a ponytail behind her perfectly shaped head. Her skin was fair and looked flawlessly smooth. However, the best feature were her deep, dreamy eyes. She had big hazel brown eyes that seemed to drown me in from the first glance. I had never seen anyone with such beautiful, rare eyes. It had a tinge of yellow in them, scattered around her pupil uniformly, which was only visible if you looked at them for a while. ""For a while"" was more than what I had spent staring at her eyes. Even now, as I'm typing this, I distinctly remember that first day. You never really forget the first time you meet ""the one"" of your life. Workplace romance isn't encouraged anywhere, but to me, giving up on someone like this seemed to be a far greater risk. So, as you can already guess, I asked her out after the first day of working together. The first few dates were terrific. I had fallen in love before, as you can remember, but this was different. She was different. What made me fall in love so deeply, wasn't her looks. It wasn't the time we spent with each other or her intellect. It wasn't our common profession or even our common interests. It was her darkness. It was in her choice of total vulnerability and the fact that she trusted me enough to share her deepest, darkest secrets with me. I'm aware of the fact that at 37, you're expected to have a difficult past. But her past nowhere near normal. She told me all of this after just a month of dating each other and each day since then, I've fallen deeper and deeper in love with her. What I am about to tell you now, is true. My wife has killed 6 men in the past. Six. Let that sink in for a moment. She wasn't a psychopathic serial killer, per se. She killed and slaughtered 6 innocent men for a good reason which you will start to understand, in a while. My wife's mother was a powerful witch who had bestowed upon her the gifts of witchcraft and a bottle of ancient drugs which were named IL9. IL9 was the Lifetrip Drug. One pill of IL9 is to be first wrapped with the victim's right coronary artery and then taken orally. To get someone's coronary artery, you have to, obviously, kill them. This someone should be a potential love interest, i.e, someone you want to spend a lifetime with, because: On swallowing the pill wrapped with that person's artery, you spend a lifetime with that person on your trip. The IL9 trip lasts for an hour. If you have ever tripped on LSD or DMT before, you would know that the time of the trip itself does not correlate with your perception of time while you're tripping. 1 hour of a DMT trip can feel like days while 9 hours of an LSD trip might feel like a pleasant half an hour. The Lifetrip IL9 trip lasts for an hour. Exactly an hour. But in that hour, you would trip till you died in your world. According to my wife, each trip feels like a new life. As real as the life we live and indistinguishable in every way. In that lifetime of a trip, you would get married and spend your life with the person whom you killed in real life, who's right coronary artery you swallowed. My wife had killed 6 men and had spent 6 entire lifetimes with 6 different men. If you're judging my wife right now, don't. I'll tell you why. Today, 50% of all marriages end in divorce. In fact, there is one divorce every 36 seconds in America. We all know no one marries someone unless they are really sure of them. Even then, the probability of that marriage working out is slim. With odds such as these, if there was a way to find out exactly how your entire life would be with a person, from then till death, would you not want to know? We all have just one life. Imagine all the extra time that you would have. Imagine all the different experiences you would have otherwise missed out on. Would you not want to live an entire life with someone special to you, knowing that whatever you would do and whatever that happened in that life which you were living had no consequences in the real world? Let's be honest here. Who doesn't want to live multiple lives in this short 90 year life that we all are inadvertently bound to? I know I'd take that option in a heartbeat if I had the choice. I was surprised my wife wasn't killing a new guy everyday. Sure, killing people mercilessly to take out their right coronary artery was a major drawback. You might call her cold blooded. Heartless, even. And you would be right. But you're not married to my beautiful wife. I am. I am fine with her past. I have made my peace with it. That's all that should matter. There's a saying that you learn a lot from each relationship. My wife practically had six lifetimes to learn. With six different men. By the time she had met me, she had way more experience in relationships than I would ever have. She was mature and calm. She knew how to deal with conflict effectively. She was emotionally stable and understanding. In this world of instant gratifications, she seemed to understand how important true love was. Such maturity would've been impossible without her past experiences. Of all the people she felt something with, she killed them and lived out her fantasy of living with them for an entire life. She told me about all of them. Being a surgeon herself, she never lacked the tools or skills necessary to cut people up. Why did she spare me? In her words, it felt ""right"" to settle down with me. And she had to settle somewhere along the line. Before me, no one was lucky enough to break through her shell and properly ""know her"". None of her victims knew about her secret. Then I came along and everything changed. To her, I was the one. The one because of whom all the killing stopped. It takes a lot of courage to show someone the cracks in your soul. If you're lucky, that someone will pour all their love inside your void places. That's what I did with her. It's her darkness that captivated me from the very beginning. I wasn't in love with her despite her flaws. I was in love with her because of them. With me, she didn't feel like carving my heart out and going on a lifetime trip to see how well we worked out. With me, she took the risk of her life when she really didn't have to. I'll always be grateful to my darling wife for that. As the years passed, we went on living our happy lives. We never had kids as we both realized we didn't want that. But last month everything changed. Alisha reached out to me on Facebook last week, telling me her husband had died. Poor lad got crushed under a truck while fetching her groceries. He was just 40. She was crying and said that she had no one else to contact. She was messed up and in a really bad place. She needed someone to be there for her. As much as I hate myself for this, I lied to my wife and left. I went over to hers for 2 days telling her I was visiting my brother upstate. Nothing happened between me and Alisha. I still loved my wife, and Alisha knew that. She just needed someone to comfort her for a few days. When I returned, nothing was out of the ordinary. My wife was unaware of my visit. But she soon found out. She went through my phone while I was in the shower and read all of our chats. I was initially, in the dark about all of my wife's findings. Last week I woke up with my wife pointing a gun at me. That was the first thing I saw. The next thing I saw was a plate on my bed, which was almost filled to its brim with blood. At the centre of the plate was a carefully placed coronary artery. It didn't take me long to figure out whose artery it was. ""There's a pill on your right. Swallow that with the whore's artery"" ""Baby. Is that Alisha's? Did you kill Alisha?"" ""It was what she deserved."" she said, with no remorse or guilt. ""But I swear, nothing happened between us. You know how much I love you. Why would you-"" I stopped talking, noticing her hand. She had pulled the hammer of the gun back with her left thumb. ""Do what I said. Now!"" she shouted, pointing her gun steadily at my horrified face. I looked at the dead piece of artery on the plate. I chewed and gobbled it down with the IL9 pill. The taste was unbearable. The looming fear of being shot by my wife was the only thing that kept me from throwing up. In an instant, the room changed color and I was 10 years younger. I looked at the picture beside me on the bed. It was a picture of me and Alisha. She called out to me from the kitchen, just then. So apparently we were living with each other. It all felt real, even though I knew I wasn't in the real world. In this world, Alisha was mine. We would go on to have a successful marriage and 2 very beautiful kids. The question of ""What if me and Alisha had worked out?"" that I always pondered about in my youth, was answered by the drug. I was amazed by how effective the drug was. It all felt like real life. The days, the weeks, the years- everything was as it should be. As the years went on, I was happy living with Alisha. I had forgotten about the fact that this was all a trip. By the time I was 35, I was convinced that this was my life and I should just live it as best as I could. Watching my kids grow up was an entirely different experience altogether. I can't believe I didn't want kids before. I had thought I would live to at least 70 with Alisha before dying. That was not the case. I died at age 40. It was just a Friday morning when I had gone out to fetch some groceries when a truck ran me over. I didn't feel any pain. I just woke up, into my real life. Just an hour had passed, just like my wife had described. She was waiting for me to snap out of it and when I did wake up, she came and embraced me in her arms tightly. Perhaps the shared experience of the IL9 trip had brought us together. You may choose not to believe any of this, and that's fine. Only I know what I went through. I had lived an entire alternate life, with a girl that I dated back in college. An entire 15 years of life. The realness of it all was what amazed me. It almost felt like that was the real world. I was starting to hypothesize that maybe-just maybe- the drug finds an alternate reality and sends your consciousness there. Whatever it was, it was an unbelievable experience.I had the time of my life, and all it costed was just one of my life and my first girlfriends life. But that's not why I am writing this. I am writing this to tell you that there's this new intern at the hospital that I'm falling for. I've started talking to her lately on facebook, and we've been getting to know each other. I've also removed the password on my home computer where my facebook account is always signed in, and I leave my phone unlocked and on our bed whenever I go for a shower. [======](URL"
159,vulnerability,nosleep,Why Am I Still Jealous?,266,8ez3vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8ez3vy/why_am_i_still_jealous/,2018-04-26 11:58:34,"When I was thirteen years old, I tried to murder my ""best friend"". Had killing her been my sole objective, I probably would've been successful. It would have done it nice and quick. No time wasted. But, on that particular day, simply killing her wouldn't suffice. She needed to suffer first. It was the only way to make things fair. Josephine landed the lead role in another one of the high\-paying commercials. The ones with really high budgets funded by big companies that would run them again and again \- well beyond their contracted lifespan. These were the parts that everybody wanted. Every one of these that Josephine landed padded her bank account to higher heights, well beyond what a thirteen\-year\-old girl's wealth should be. Technically, the production staff hadn't made their choice yet. But, it didn't even matter. I already knew the answer. Josephine went out there and dazzled them, just like she always did under the stage lights and in front of the camera. Her pearly white smile could light up the entire room with a surge of natural, vibrant energy. It's a certain quality that you either have or you don't. There is no replication. And what would be left for me to do? First, I'd have to get over the crushing disappointment of losing the role to her yet again. That feeling of hope I had in the car, while my dad drove both of us to the studio, would fade and leave a deep burning anger in its place. Then, I'd give her a hug one more time when we dropped her off. She lived right around the corner from us. She'd whisper to me how grateful she was to have me as a friend and how excited she was that I'd be there in one of the extra roles on set. Perhaps worst of all, was the fact that if there was anyone with an inside edge, it was me. It was my dad, not hers, who worked in the industry. He was the one involved in big Hollywood Blockbusters and had connections to all sorts of directors, producers, and industry people in high places. How is it that his daughter could never land the leads in big commercials? Maybe he'd overblown the power of his connections. More likely, however, I just simply wasn't good enough. I don't consider myself to be a violent person. But that day she struck a nerve that was too raw. And it stung so much that I wasn't thinking straight. That is if I was even thinking at all. The folks behind the camera were yawning and checking their watches while I did a little jig and rehearsed the lines I'd known cold for almost a month. Just like so many other times before, they'd already decided Josephine was the one. My audition was nothing more than a formality. I sat on a stool in one of the backstage dressing rooms. My hands shook as I rubbed them over my face, looking in the mirror. I was so sure that I was pretty \-\- beautiful in fact. And I'd worked with an acting coach for years. I was good. I had everything you needed to make it the business. So many people had reinforced that impression by telling me the same thing over the years. But so long as I was competing with my dear friend, Josephine, I was never going to get there. And if there was one thing I was sure of in the world, it's that I wanted what she had. I wanted it badly. I'd been tucking myself into bed, dreaming of being on the big screen ever since I was a little girl. So, what was it about Josephine that made her so special? And what was I going to have to do to change it? I grabbed two things off the counter. My straightening iron, which had been plugged in for ten minutes, and a pair of really long and sharp scissors I found in one of the drawers. They were so old they looked like they'd started their rusting process more than twenty years ago. Her beautiful face was my primary target. That blemish\-free skin, seeming to be permanently sun\-kissed, needed a little character. That would help level the playing field, even if it was just by a little bit. She was looking intently in the mirror, cleaning the corners of her mouth when I pushed her dressing room door open. Whatever minute and certainly unimportant cleaning job she was performing, it had her full attention. She didn't notice me as I crept up behind her. I waved my fingers over the ends of the straightener just as my reflection started to show in the mirror. It was still so hot. It blistered my skin without even touching it. Who knows what kind of mark it would have left on her face had she not turned just in time after I brought it down like a sword. I was aiming for her cheek. She managed to tip backwards on her chair and fall to the floor without me landing. I was so committed to the attack that my middle portion slammed against the vacant stool. All my weight came down on my abdomen and the wind was knocked completely out of me. I still wasnt deterred. She slid backwards on the floor, in total shock over what had just transpired. Her face telegraphed utter disbelief which turned to fear very quickly when she realized that it was who she thought was her best friend attacking her. She kept sliding back until she hit the wall. She started shrieking in a high pitched tone that pierced my ears while I stumbled towards her. I dropped the straightener and pulled the scissors from my pocket. She looked at dead at me, totally helpless when I stood over her. Then, her eyes dropped to the scissors, and she knew exactly what my intentions were. She screamed even louder. I heard heavy steps running down the hall towards us. I'm not sure I was breathing. I definitely wasn't thinking. I was possessed by a kind of dormant rage from deep inside that I didn't even know existed. I remember bringing the scissors way above my head and bringing them down on her. I remember her letting out one last blood\-curdling scream before the world disappeared. Everything went black after that. It stayed that way for a long time. When the world returned, I was leaning in one of the chairs in the front lobby. My dad sat next to me with his arm draped over my shoulder. A bunch of the crew members stood at a safe distance, watching me intently as I came back into reality. Even Josephine was there. She peered out from between the arms of the men acting as a barricade between me and her. Of course, there was no wound. As far as I could see, there wasnt the slightest trace of scratch on her. She was so perfect I couldn't even harm her. She looked back at me compassionately, like I was the one victimized. And why wouldn't she? In her eyes, I was her oldest and truest friend. Both a police cruiser and an ambulance showed up outside after a few minutes. ""Time to go,"" my dad said and helped me to my feet. ""Don't worry dear, everything will be okay."" He guided me out the main doors. He held my shoulders gently, but never released his grip. ""Feel better, Priscilla,"" I heard Josephine call out from behind the human wall. ""I'll see you soon."" That was the icing on the cake. Even after I tried to kill her, she was concerned about my well\-being. She wasn't just flawless on the outside. She was perfect on the inside as well. I walked out of the studio that day fully intending to never audition for anything again. My passion in life was just hurting me too much. For the next eight years, I held true to that course of action. Part of its execution involved avoiding Josephine at all costs. I made sure to cut off all communication and that chose a different high school than her the following year. Petty as that may sound, it really did help me get over it. I started hanging out with new people and developing different interests. I wasnt dealing with my jealousy being rubbed in my face at all times. As far as I'm concerned, by age twenty\-one, I was an entirely different person. The little girl who grew up wanting to be an actress was all but dead and gone. I was in the final year of my criminal psychology degree, fully intending to write the bar exam and start law school at Stanford in the fall. Life was good. But, as is always the case, theres that lingering feeling that it can be made better. And an opportunity for improvement presented itself one weekend when I went home to visit my parents. They put on a barbecue and invited over some of their friends. A lot of the ones my dad invited were the same industry guys who were at so many of my auditions growing up. I suppose they were quite impressed when they saw the young woman I'd grown into. One director was so moved that he invited me to come audition for a role in a movie he'd be doing the next year. Instantaneously, the old flame was reignited. Once that happened, it couldnt be extinguished. I couldn't force myself to say no. I spent two hours dolling myself up before heading to that audition. There was no point in my life that I was going to look any better than I did that day. It was coupled with a certain confidence I'd gained through academic success as well. On the drive over to the studio, I felt so sure I was finally going to land the part I wanted. The sentiment didn't subside from the start of the audition all the way until it ended. Everything went perfectly. My lines, my gestures, the facial expressions \- I could feel the camera soaking them all up. The men in the background, the same ones denying me the roles growing up, whispered and nodded in approval. They were going to give it to me. I could feel it. But, as we've all experienced before, life finds a way of disappointing you. That day would be no exception. The name they called for the next audition ripped through me like a hurricane. *Josephine Bellamy* It was even worse when I saw her appear down the hallway from the dressing rooms. She had aged like the perfect delicate flower she always was. Her smile was even whiter and more genuine than I'd remembered. She was beyond delighted to see me. She embraced me and wouldn't let go. ""It's so nice to see you again, Priscilla,"" she said. ""Please tell me youre getting back in the business. My, look how gorgeous you've become!"" She finally let go and stepped back. Her eyes widened in anticipation of a similar response. She didn't get it. I dropped my head and pushed past her. The pace of my heels hitting the floor kept getting faster until I reached my room. I sat there in silence for a long time. I could hear laughter and occasional applause from the stage area down the hall. Something familiar came over me \-\- just like it did that day nearly eight years before. It was the feeling of hope and excitement getting torn away from you by some divine force you can never overcome. I turned the lights off, leaned back against the door, and slid down until I was seated on the floor. I fully expected to cry in the darkness for several hours or at least until they dragged me out. But I didn't. My response was something else entirely. And it's something that only a person who's ever truly wanted something with all their being will ever understand. It's a feeling you get when you're so sure of what you want. You'd sell your soul to get it if it was a realistic option. It's not something where any meagre substitute can suffice. No change in perspective is going to help you get over it. I can never condone or defend what I did next. All I can do is try to explain to you how deep the roots of jealousy run when somebody so easily gets something you want so badly. It was just my pathetic attempt to scratch that horrible itch that'd bothered me in the background for so long. I stood up and turned the light back on. I made my way over to the dressing station and rummaged through all the drawers. As luck would have it, I found a straight razor in a clear plastic case. Heavy steps went passed my door and into the one next to me. Of course, she was in the dressing room right next to mine. She was probably just sitting on her stool, victorious and beautiful, just like she always was. Also, she was so terribly unaware of the dangers that lurked on the other side of the wall. I pricked the razor against my finger and blood immediately started coming out. The thing was sharp, almost like it had never been used. I wondered how much blood was going to spew out of her throat when I jammed it in there as hard as I could. I closed my eyes and passed for a while. The feeling didnt pass. I tiptoed out of my room and to her door. I pressed my ear against it, trying to see if I could identify exactly what part of the room she was in. It sounded like she was arguing with someone on the phone on the far side. Her voice was distressed and argumentative. It was the first time I'd ever heard her not sounding entirely composed. ""I don't want to do this anymore!"" she yelled. Her footsteps raced towards the door and I had hardly enough time to get out of the way before she pushed it open. Her face was all red and the area around her eyes was all puffy. She was wiping the side of her mouth as she pushed passed me, her shoulder knocking into mine. I grabbed her by the shirt and pulled her back towards me. I pressed my hand over her mouth and held it there. She was so worked up over whatever argument shed been involved in, it didnt look like she even cared. I could have sworn I saw a fragment of relief on her face when I pulled the razor out. I didnt even know it was possible for her to show such vulnerability. Id never even seen her remotely flustered before. Could the impossible really have happened? Had she faced rejection for the first time in her life? Was it finally my turn to get what I always wanted? I suppose the moment I stuck the razor into her throat was the first time I really felt like her superior. I didnt pull it out until after I ran horizontally across to her other ear. Her screams were muffled by my hand and I could feel her tongue pushing against it. Her legs kicked wildly until stopping altogether. Her eyes, which were terrified and locked on mine for the encounter lost focus and seemed to be looking right through me. I held her body away from me to avoid any blood getting on my clothing. When I was sure the job was done, I lay her body down gently on the floor. There was no need to damage the delicate flower. I'll always regret the enormous satisfaction I felt in the moments that followed. There was real bliss in there before I really had time to realize the consequence of my actions. If only that feeling could have lasted forever. I peeked inside the room. My dad stood at the opposite side, facing the far wall. His hands were busy near his mid\-section and there was the metallic sound of a little zipper closing together. He turned around and looked at me. For a moment he was shocked. Then, his composure returned. He gave me the reassuring smile that he'd given me so many times growing up. Especially after all the times Josephine had landed the role over me. ""Priscilla, what are you doing here?"" he said. ""Why are you in Josephine's room?"" ""Business reasons."" He started to walk towards me. I felt my whole body start to tremble. He wrapped his arms around me and rubbed my back. ""Be still, dear. Why are you shaking? You're not upset we're giving the part to Josephine are you?"" ""Do you love me, daddy?"" ""Of course I do, sweetheart. We've always loved you. Just not in the same way we love [Josephine](URL [J.D.](URL"

Our planet has been ravaged. The earth cut into, creating a wound that cannot be healed. People live in fear. The streets lie in disrepair. The landscape has become nothing more than a featureless drawl. Each day drones on, bleaker than the last. Dark minds control the bowels of this machine, creating the sparks which control this society and everyone who dwells within it. How can there be hope when it is extinguished as fast as it is ignited? How can there be salvation, when our leaders are working against it? How can this world survive, when the cracks that threaten to destroy our reality begin in our streets, our shops, our homes Our minds. My sneakers slap the pavement as I race down the darkly lit street. The only illumination is from the streetlights that turn on and off as I pass below them. Sirens ring out behind me and I can just make out the flashing red lights in the puddle in front of me. My shoe splashes the puddle, rippling them away. Josh Lester! I spin around and the police car comes to a halt in front of me. Inside lies an impenetrable darkness. A cold, metallic darkness. Stop running, we have you surrounded. The robotic voice cuts through the silence with violent precision. I catch my breath whilst weighing up my options. If you surrender yourself calmly to us now you will be trialled fairly. That monotone voice again. That. Fucking. Voice. Relentless, unforgiving. No questions asked. Is that what you said to my brother when you snatched him off the street? A brief pause, like the car is processing what Ive said. It repeats the same thing again. If you surrender yourself calmly to us now you will be trialled fairly. I stick up the finger at the car. Fuck you asshole! I kick of the wall next to me and continue my frantic getaway as I hear car tires screech behind me. I make a sharp left down a darkened alleyway between two buildings. They loom up on either side of me, nothing but featureless black squares to the naked eye. The metallic voice echoes around me, closing in like a hunter to its prey. I slam face first into something hard. Shit, a wall. Dead end. My eyes scan the dark environment around me for anything to spare me from my persuer. My hand brushes a metal bar of some kind. I find a rung. Another rung. Fire escape! Probably old and rusted, a general death trap, but an escape route all the same. I grab onto the bars and begin to climb. Im scared. So scared. Scared of what they will do when they catch me. Scared of what they have done. Scared of what is to come. My attempts are feeble. Deep down even I know that. Like trying to find a drop of water in an ocean, or counting grains of sand. You can run from the past, you can run from the present, but the future will always catch up with you. The air is cold up here. The metal stings and numbs to the touch. Each step drains a little more of my energy. I look down and see the lights of a police car far below me. That motivates me. I start to kick at the rusted platform below me. Jackpot! I hear a metallic bending sound and it goes spiralling down into the darkness. I look back up at the starless sky above me and continue my climb. I breathe out with relief as my hands grasp the roof top. My hands grab onto the edge of the roof top The ladder has been ripped off here though. I get a firm grip on the ledge and hoist myself upwards. I graze my chin on the rough concrete on my way up. I look out across the dark city. My city. Extinguished. Not even a single light penetrates the darkness. The darkness that infiltrated us from the inside, leaked through the cracks we forgot to patch up. Infecting our friends, family. I know it is pointless. Any minute now the future will come calling, and you cant run forever. I walk slowly to the side of the building I climbed up and look down into the darkness. Its too quiet. The lights have stopped flashing. Suddenly a robotic head bursts out of the blackness below me. I nearly fall over the edge in surprise. Its head snaps upwards towards me and its eyes glow red. Its voice activates. Josh Lester. You are guilty of resisting arrest, plotting with the intention to murder, attempted murder, and plotting against the future. Brute force will now be used. I shriek and kick the robots head downward. Sparks fly and it makes a piercing screaming sound. I kick it again and it goes plummeting into the darkness. I fall back onto my bottom breathing heavily. I knew they would come after me, but droids, really!? Fucking really?? At least it was only one. I can deal with one. One isnt a big problem. Right on cue a robotic hand clamps onto the edge of the roof to my right. And another. And another. Robots are climbing onto the roof all round me now. Im fucking surrounded now. FUCK!! They close in on me, their red eyes glowing even brighter in the darkness. My vulnerability intensifies. I feel like a sheep, experiencing its last moments as a pack of wolves closes in. A sheep chased until it can run no more. A sheep with nothing left, nothing to lose. Something slams into the back of my legs and I crumple to my knees. Place both hands flat upon your head. I look up at the closest robot. Fuck you. Its eyes flash. Brute force. And then somethings smashes into the back of my neck and my vision goes dark. White. Clean. These are the first thoughts that pop into my head as my eyes open slowly. Im strapped into a large padded chair. On my head is a large helmet attached to a mechanical arm protruding out of the roof. The room around me is big, and bleach white. A small control panel filled with buttons of all shapes and sizes sits on a pedestal in front of me. A sliding door that previously looked like part of the wall opens on the other side of the room and a man dressed in a grey suit comes strolling in over to me. He presses a small brown button on the control panel and a hole in the floor opens. A full\-size leather chair rises out of the depths and the man takes a seat in front of me. I cant move my head but I direct my eyes towards him. He clicks another button and the front of my helmet opens freeing the front of my face. I dont know you. Of course you dont Mr Lester! See I was selected specially for this task. Somebody with no ties to you, not even remotely. My name, my background, are all a complete mystery to you. I guess it helps keep you on your toes, always digging for more information, never getting to comfortable with me or your surroundings! The man speaks in a cheery tone. Cheery, but fake. Almost intentionally, it seems. I see your wondering why Im speaking like this? How did you kn\- The man interrupts me mid\-sentence. Its to make you uncomfortable. I cant allow anything to feel right for you Mr Lester. That would be against protocol! He clicks his fingers and a holographic screen appears in front of us. Words start appearing down the page. It would appear you have amassed quite a rap sheet retseL rM! I frown at this strange name change, the only familiar thing in this room taken away from me. The man continues. Attempted murder.

161,vulnerability,nosleep,You cant run from the future. (Part 1),8,8go1qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8go1qx/you_cant_run_from_the_future_part_1/,2018-05-03 15:28:45,"The future. A dark, desolate place. Our planet has been ravaged. The earth cut into, creating a wound that cannot be healed. People live in fear. The streets lie in disrepair. The landscape has become nothing more than a featureless drawl. Each day drones on, bleaker than the last. Dark minds control the bowels of this machine, creating the sparks which control this society and everyone who dwells within it. How can there be hope when it is extinguished as fast as it is ignited? How can there be salvation, when our leaders are working against it? How can this world survive, when the cracks that threaten to destroy our reality begin in our streets, our shops, our homes Our minds. My sneakers slap the pavement as I race down the darkly lit street. The only illumination is from the streetlights that turn on and off as I pass below them. Sirens ring out behind me and I can just make out the flashing red lights in the puddle in front of me. My shoe splashes the puddle, rippling them away. Josh Lester! I spin around and the police car comes to a halt in front of me. Inside lies an impenetrable darkness. A cold, metallic darkness. Stop running, we have you surrounded. The robotic voice cuts through the silence with violent precision. I catch my breath whilst weighing up my options. If you surrender yourself calmly to us now you will be trialled fairly. That monotone voice again. That. Fucking. Voice. Relentless, unforgiving. No questions asked. Is that what you said to my brother when you snatched him off the street? A brief pause, like the car is processing what Ive said. It repeats the same thing again. If you surrender yourself calmly to us now you will be trialled fairly. I stick up the finger at the car. Fuck you asshole! I kick of the wall next to me and continue my frantic getaway as I hear car tires screech behind me. I make a sharp left down a darkened alleyway between two buildings. They loom up on either side of me, nothing but featureless black squares to the naked eye. The metallic voice echoes around me, closing in like a hunter to its prey. I slam face first into something hard. Shit, a wall. Dead end. My eyes scan the dark environment around me for anything to spare me from my persuer. My hand brushes a metal bar of some kind. I find a rung. Another rung. Fire escape! Probably old and rusted, a general death trap, but an escape route all the same. I grab onto the bars and begin to climb. Im scared. So scared. Scared of what they will do when they catch me. Scared of what they have done. Scared of what is to come. My attempts are feeble. Deep down even I know that. Like trying to find a drop of water in an ocean, or counting grains of sand. You can run from the past, you can run from the present, but the future will always catch up with you. The air is cold up here. The metal stings and numbs to the touch. Each step drains a little more of my energy. I look down and see the lights of a police car far below me. That motivates me. I start to kick at the rusted platform below me. Jackpot! I hear a metallic bending sound and it goes spiralling down into the darkness. I look back up at the starless sky above me and continue my climb. I breathe out with relief as my hands grasp the roof top. My hands grab onto the edge of the roof top The ladder has been ripped off here though. I get a firm grip on the ledge and hoist myself upwards. I graze my chin on the rough concrete on my way up. I look out across the dark city. My city. Extinguished. Not even a single light penetrates the darkness. The darkness that infiltrated us from the inside, leaked through the cracks we forgot to patch up. Infecting our friends, family. I know it is pointless. Any minute now the future will come calling, and you cant run forever. I walk slowly to the side of the building I climbed up and look down into the darkness. Its too quiet. The lights have stopped flashing. Suddenly a robotic head bursts out of the blackness below me. I nearly fall over the edge in surprise. Its head snaps upwards towards me and its eyes glow red. Its voice activates. Josh Lester. You are guilty of resisting arrest, plotting with the intention to murder, attempted murder, and plotting against the future. Brute force will now be used. I shriek and kick the robots head downward. Sparks fly and it makes a piercing screaming sound. I kick it again and it goes plummeting into the darkness. I fall back onto my bottom breathing heavily. I knew they would come after me, but droids, really!? Fucking really?? At least it was only one. I can deal with one. One isnt a big problem. Right on cue a robotic hand clamps onto the edge of the roof to my right. And another. And another. Robots are climbing onto the roof all round me now. Im fucking surrounded now. FUCK!! They close in on me, their red eyes glowing even brighter in the darkness. My vulnerability intensifies. I feel like a sheep, experiencing its last moments as a pack of wolves closes in. A sheep chased until it can run no more. A sheep with nothing left, nothing to lose. Something slams into the back of my legs and I crumple to my knees. Place both hands flat upon your head. I look up at the closest robot. Fuck you. Its eyes flash. Brute force. And then somethings smashes into the back of my neck and my vision goes dark. White. Clean. These are the first thoughts that pop into my head as my eyes open slowly. Im strapped into a large padded chair. On my head is a large helmet attached to a mechanical arm protruding out of the roof. The room around me is big, and bleach white. A small control panel filled with buttons of all shapes and sizes sits on a pedestal in front of me. A sliding door that previously looked like part of the wall opens on the other side of the room and a man dressed in a grey suit comes strolling in over to me. He presses a small brown button on the control panel and a hole in the floor opens. A full\-size leather chair rises out of the depths and the man takes a seat in front of me. I cant move my head but I direct my eyes towards him. He clicks another button and the front of my helmet opens freeing the front of my face. I dont know you. Of course you dont Mr Lester! See I was selected specially for this task. Somebody with no ties to you, not even remotely. My name, my background, are all a complete mystery to you. I guess it helps keep you on your toes, always digging for more information, never getting to comfortable with me or your surroundings! The man speaks in a cheery tone. Cheery, but fake. Almost intentionally, it seems. I see your wondering why Im speaking like this? How did you kn\- The man interrupts me mid\-sentence. Its to make you uncomfortable. I cant allow anything to feel right for you Mr Lester. That would be against protocol! He clicks his fingers and a holographic screen appears in front of us. Words start appearing down the page. It would appear you have amassed quite a rap sheet retseL rM! I frown at this strange name change, the only familiar thing in this room taken away from me. The man continues. Attempted murder. Plotting with intention to murder. Plotting against the future. All quite terrible crimes. He looks at me. Would you like me to go on? I give no response. Youre wondering why we are keeping you here. Im sorry, but that is one of many questions I cannot answer. What I will say though, is that you have committed crimes against the future and in doing so, have surrendered your human rights. There are no limits on what we can do to you. No rules. He stands up from the chair and leans in towards me. I think its time for me to ask you a question Mr Lester.

162,vulnerability,nosleep,I was a gambling addict,3,8htba0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8htba0/i_was_a_gambling_addict/,2018-05-08 12:36:15,"I was a gambling addict. Its hard to say those words. I dont want judgement, I dont want empathy. I succumbed to a sickness that leeches on the vulnerability of human greed. When I was around thirty, my gambling started as a hobby. A steady income allowed me to throw a little bit of a cash on online roulette tables now and again. The wins left me with a high, but the losses left me with an inconsolable rage. Every time I lost a bet, I fucking hated myself inside. I wanted to hit the dealer and scream in their face after every single loss. I would put in 60 pounds, bet 20 pounds on red and black would appear then Id repeat. I was stupid enough to believe roulette had a pattern, three reds gone by and I think it must now be a black. There is nothing guaranteed in this life but death. My girlfriend left me when she found out I had started taking money to gamble out of our holiday fund. I lost my job when I just stopped going entirely to completely focus on online gambling. I figured if I bought a book on blackjack or roulette then maybe I could get good at it. Yet whatever I won just went straight back onto a number. I was thirty-three when I completely lost everything, the apartment, my soulmate, I had run up mass debts on my credit card, I was too ashamed to speak to my family. I was going to be homeless, but I was saved. I was sitting in a bar, drinking away the last of my cash when a strange looking pale thin guy had appeared sitting next to me. I was in a pretty bad state so when he kindly asked me why I looked so sad, I felt compelled to pour my heart out to him. I cant explain the feeling, it was almost seductive. He listened to me, he looked me in the eyes as I rambled on, I could tell he understood me. When he offered me money, a substantial amount, I felt attracted to his offer. The sickness came over me again and the only thing I remember next is being thrown out of a casino in broad daylight, unaware of how long Id been in there. The only thing I knew was I had no money at all, I had wasted this kind mans gift. He found me a few days later, sleeping rough in a car park. I never knew how he found me, but he appeared as kind as ever, towering over my slouched vessel of a soul. He wasnt angry about the money, he wanted to help me have a place to sleep instead. He was happy that I had invited him into my life to give me assistance by telling my story. I went to his house, I was given a warm bed, shower and a hot meal. We spoke about the meaning of life late each night, during the days my time was my own. I felt happy and complete staying in this place. Slowly I realised that I was becoming more dependent on this man yet that only filled me with a curious warmth inside. The sickness inside of me slowly faded away as the weeks progressed. My host told me one day that I would have to repay him for the gifts he had given me. Those kind wise eyes could get anything they wanted. He asked me to cut myself in front of him and let him taste me. Naturally I was repulsed but, again, I was compelled to give this kind man what he wanted. There was no pain when I slashed at my hand with a razor blade. I held my bloodied palm to his face and he licked my wound like a thirsty dog. I had let him to taste my lifeforce, and I would be rewarded for doing so. Every night, I was ordered to draw blood from my body and let my host lick the wound dry, it gave meaning to my empty life. He brought another man back one night and they both sucked at the ever-increasing collection of fresh cuts all over my body. Another night, my host returned from his travels with a sleeping woman. I watched as he showed me how to draw blood correctly from a wound. He slashed her neck with my razor when he had finished with the rest of the wounds. I never saw the aftermath of what happened to her body, I only remember fading into sleep whenever my host told me to do so. When the time was ready, he said he would change me for the better to serve him as my master. I was always in love with those eyes, staring deeply into them while the rest of my body squirmed in terror. The bloodletting continued for months, I was draining myself of life to please another. Deep down, I knew my body was ravaged, my host had given me a wheelchair as I could no longer walk unassisted. I always asked when he would change me, but he only told me to keep calm. I was sedated from fear and love. I still am. I still wait for when he will transition me into a better person. Im mostly bed bound now, Im too weak to do anything but cut. Ive been told not to do them so deep now, I will always follow masters rules until the end. Until I am changed. Last night, I begged him as I removed the tips of my left index and ring fingers to promise me that I would be changed soon. He told me There is nothing guaranteed in this life but death. "
163,vulnerability,nosleep,If No one Reads this I WILL DIE!!!,0,8j1g4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8j1g4m/if_no_one_reads_this_i_will_die/,2018-05-13 14:04:02,"Hi. I am sorry if the title comes across as click\-baity. It is just... well you can see why I would be invested in someone, *anyone*, to read this. But before I tell you why, I have to say you shouldn't read this, in fact, you* reall*y shouldn't read this, and if you don't like me by the end of the story, I'm sorry. I used to have stage fright as a kid, I went up on stage once, I had to read a line: ""J is for JellyBean"" and I messed it up, everyone laughed. I can remember seeing a friends dad I think in the audience. For a while, this was actually my most embarrassing memory. In highschool I would get over my stage fright, I had too much of a desire to be on stage, I had to much of craving for attention I guess. I learned that we crave attention because human's are social animals. I hear that is true, it is something I heard a lot in college. I don't go to college anymore. I did something. Because this is a confession, I'm going to tell you that you are not going to like what I did. I murdered someone, they were someone that I actually liked. It was ruled that because it was technically a suicide, I got off scott free. It was a friday, I had said something hurtful. Something that was personal. I used something, something that I knew about them, something they had shared in a moment of vulnerability, the kind of thing you would otherwise take to your grave, and then I used it against them in a fight. I had got real drunk. I had a show on monday, and I was really nervous so I got drunk with my friends. I went back to my room, and my roommate was there, crying. They had told me that they had tried killing themselves recently, and when I should have been comforting them, I instead got mad and told them that maybe they should. I was drunk and that was what I said. I was drunk and told my suicidal friend to kill themselves. I was mad at them because I cared. I knew what you were suppose to say, I had even been trained in this sort of thing. I was *suppose* to know how to handle this kind of thing. They weren't even planning to do it again, so just a ""that is rough, I am here for you if you want to talk about it"" would have been *more* than fine. It wasn't even hard to say, not really. Saying the right thing is surprisingly easy if you focus on *why* they have gotten to that point and just *listen.* If I had even one less drink the words I would have said would have been ""I am too drunk, when I am sober I want to talk"" and that would still somehow have been better than what I said. After the fight, I texted I am sorry to my roomate in the next morning. I knew the moment I said it that what I said was wrong, but it was too late to apologize. That saturday morning, I had awoke to see a hanging corpse. It was too late for apologies. It was too late to say I am sorry. I am not proud of how I handled it. I left the room, I texted friends. Eventually the police would be called. No one knew what I did, but I had talked to way too many people so word was getting out. The worse part wasn't that I let people know, it was that I still went to my performance on Monday. It was a comedy, and even I saw my roommate in the crowd, I didn't even think to stop joking about how cute and funny I was. How great a person I was. She was right there and joking about how great a person *I* was. I get texts from people a lot now. Basically everyone knows what I did. I dropped out. I couldn't face anyone anymore. They knew I was joking and laughing with my roommate right in the audience, they all *had* too know she was right there, in the front row, just off to the side. They *had* to have put the pieces together. But since I dropped out, things have been getting worse. My skin has started to fall off, I'll go to scratch my hand and it will start to bleed, but I can't stop scratching it. I will get up to walk and my legs will be too asleep to even move. And I have a *non\-stop* headache. My ears ring constantly. I didn't even notice it now but the skin under my eyes, just above my cheeks, has turned green, and my eyes seem to a shade of yellow now too. What I have, I don't know. I live alone. I used to have so many friends, now I can't even call anyone to ask if I should go to the doctor. I can't afford to go to the doctor anyway. I think it is because I don't get out much. I can't go outside because my roommate is standing at the door, and she is giving me the silent treatment. I told her I was sorry, but why won't she forgive me? I think it might be the guilt, but I don't want people to know what I did. I know everyone knows anyway. I am telling you because I am not technically a murderer, but I still feel like I murdered my friend. Everything reminds me of them. Everytime the TV plays this song that I can't remember anymore if she liked or disliked. I would ask her, but she isn't talking to me anymore. I am not mad at her, I am mad at myself. It isn't her fault for what I did, I just wish she would yell at me, tell me how awful I am, tell me that I shouldn't have been drinking, that I took her for granted. I feel bad when I imagine yelling at her. I want to not feel bad, but that if I didn't feel bad I would be some kind of monster. I noticed too, that my veins seem to be turning black. They always used to stick out, but for some reason now they are darker. I tried cutting myself, and everything felt better. I am sorry for using clickbait in the title. I am sorry if I am exaggerating some of what is happening to me. I just want to be told I am healthy, I want to be told that I am okay. I want to be told that one action doesn't define you, even though what I did ended up leading to the death of a human being who was greater than me. I want to be told that my life isn't a net loss, that I am innocent and likeable and funny and cute. I want to be told that even though I have started to smell, I haven't brushed my teeth. One time, my roommate recommended me a toothpaste. I had been upset I couldn't afford it and they took me to the store and bought it for me. She is dead now, and it was my fault. Can someone forgive me after reading this? Can you talk to her? Ask her if she is still mad? I know what I did was awful, but at least tell me how she is doing, I worry about her. She was starting to get overwhelmed with school because she had such a high workload. I want to know if everything turned out okay. She isn't at my door anymore, she left a while ago. I just feel like she might read this if enough people see it. Please don't be mad at me anymore. I am sorry for what I did, I still wake up because I have nightmares about it. I worry that maybe I don't feel bad enough, so right before I go to sleep I try to force myself to have nightmares. It is always the first thing that I think about in the morning and the last thing I think about before bed. I hope she doesn't read this. I don't want her to remember I still exist. I want her to think that I died, that I killed myself because of the guilt. That I cared so much about her that I was dead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know I lied in the title but please don't be mad. I know what I did was wrong but I did it anyway. I just want her to see this and know how much I feel bad. I try cutting myself but I am worried I might get an infection. I just don't want to die. I'm sorry, please don't be mad. I'm sorry that I am such a bad writer, I am awful. I can't do anything right. This is awful. I'm sorry I just need someone to tell me I am okay. Please tell me I am okay? Please tell me you understand? I just want someone to understand. I just want her to understand. I want everyone to understand. Please tell me I am okay?"
164,vulnerability,nosleep,A Late Night Conversation,450,8j1kt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8j1kt5/a_late_night_conversation/,2018-05-13 14:30:15,"Its been a long day. Midterms are done for the students, which means theyre just starting for me. I only managed to finish grading the papers for my Intro to Archeology class at 9:57 p.m. It was brutal work. I need to remember to add a new section in the syllabus on writing papers: If you are typing up your paper and you see a squiggly red or blue line under a word, *please accept your word processors help*. Those lines appear for a reason. There is already a very lengthy section about proper citation, so the infamous red pen was just slashing through anything Wikipedia or Yahoo! Answers related. For a moment I just sit in my silent car, staring at my house with a mix of longing and loathing. Food, shower, and my bed, thats all I want. But I know hes waiting inside for me, ready to show me his own special brand of attention. With no other good choice, I sling my bag over my shoulder and slide out of the car. From the box in the backseat I grab a slender gray aerosol can. I untangle my keys as I head for the door. The lock is turned, the can is clutched in one hand, and I take a deep breath before shoving the door open. Hot, moist air rolls over me, carrying with it a sickening scent of sulfur and dying flowers. My stomach heaves slightly but I manage to control it. I thrust my arm over the threshold and let loose with a heavy spray from the can. For a moment there is a battle between the rancid breath of hell and tropical breeze air freshener. My finger stays firm on the trigger, sending in an ever-greater deluge, and finally pineapple and coconut drive back the reek of hell. I step inside, kick the door closed, and drop my bag and half-empty can of air freshener onto the table. Im home! A hacking cough is my only greeting. Hes curled up on the couch, both hands over his face, and he is letting me know in no uncertain terms that this new brand is not up to his standards. If it werent for him I wouldnt have to use enough aerosol to burn my own personal hole through the ozone layer daily, so screw him. As he puts his head down on his knees for even greater dramatic effect I pick up the shredded remains of todays mail. You better not have destroyed anything important, I warn him. Remember when the house was going to be inspected? The coughing is giving way to heaving gasps. You tore up the notice and left it all over the floor, and I didnt have the time to put it back together, and we had a stranger show up unannounced to *search our house*. Pathetic wheezing sounds are all I get in return. I roll my eyes as I try to fit three pieces of envelope together. It will take forever to completely recreate the entire thing, but if these go together then I can possibly make out the logo in the corner. Is that for the electric company, or? What would you have done if that woman had managed to get in here? We didnt have a gas leak, but what was actually giving off that smell was a whole lot weirder. Is a whole lot weirder. She could have called her superiors or the police and we would have had to move house, again. And there would have been days, maybe even weeks, in a *hotel*. What would you have done if she got in here and saw you? I would have eviscerated her with my teeth, wore her guts for garters, and then danced a cancan on your kitchen table, he snarls at me, finally abandoning his melodramatic death throes. In your favorite black high heels. Ass, I mutter under my breath. He slumps back onto the couch and proceeds to sulk. When I ignore him and make my way into the kitchen I can hear him clumsily scrambling to his feet to follow me. Everything he does is clumsy, but that cant be helped. With three inch razor sharp claws on his hands and feet, his body is not made for modern furniture. Hes also hell on hardwood floors. The refrigerator door is closed, but still I eye it with uncertainty. I have found things in that refrigerator before, things that should not be in a kitchenat least not in that many pieces. There has also been an unnatural amount of food spoilage, and one particularly exciting evening there was food reanimation. Try explaining to your boss that you cant teach your 9:00 a.m. class because of a ham related injury. Where have you been? he grumbles behind me. Its late. Before approaching the refrigerator, I carefully pick up the long carving knife. My other hand dips into the drawer that never closes properly and comes back with a pot lid. Thus armed, I advance on my target. I can hear his unhappy hissing, then the sound of claws clicking together. That was not a rhetorical question! Its rude to blatantly ignore other people! The stainless-steel surface is cold to the touch. Good, its still running. I manage to maneuver my pot lid so that I can use that hand to open the door. I fling it open and leap backward, my knife at the ready and a wordless shout of defiance echoing through the kitchen. All is quiet in my refrigerator. Feel better? he asks. Considering that I need to sniff everything I take out of here, no, not really, I tell him. Normal people dont have to approach everything in their own house like its a potential hazard. What if I promise I didnt do anything to the food at all? Pivoting on my heel, I merely stare at him with one raised eyebrow. He shrugs and folds himself onto one of the kitchen chairs. Arms crossed over his chest, he tries to affect a pose of indifference. But it doesnt work. It never works when he tries to mimic human stance. Its not his lack of humanity that makes me turn away so quickly, though. Its the way hebends. Have you ever seen a hypercube? Of course not, its a four-dimensional object that cant be properly observed by our three-dimensional human brains. But, you might have seen a computer model of it in class or on YouTube. If you havent, imagine eight cubes somehow fused together into one single object that looks like cubes within cubes. Now imagine rotating it. As it turns, though, it seems like its somehow passing in and out of itself, turning inside out without any kind of possible end. Lines and angles dont behave the way we think they should. This object is twisting and turning in a way that our minds just arent capable of handling. Now add four limbs, some claws, some big teeth, and what might be hair or tentacles on top of a freakishly round head and youll have a very vague idea of what my roommate looks like. Staring directly at him for more than a minute gives me headaches, and thats on a good day. After hours of reading through poorly edited and improperly cited papers, I just cant handle geometry that extends beyond three dimensions. Even when I wont look at him, he wont be ignored. Its late, he tells me again. Where have you been? The package of roast beef seems safe, as does the Havarti cheese. I grab these and a loaf of bread and head towards the counter. You know we arent married, right? I remind him as I build the sandwich. Both slices of bread are carefully studied. I dont have to tell you where Ive been or what I do. Actually, if we were married I still wouldnt have to answer questions barked at me like that. There is the slight screech of his claws digging into the table in his frustration. Hes been spoiling for a fight for weeks now out of boredom, but I never give it to him. My studied indifference rankles him, and that puts a smile on my face for the first time all day. I didnt ask for this, you know, he says. This is not what I wanted when I woke up that morning. You think youre the only one who didnt expect their life to turn out different? With my back to him, he cant see me roll my eyes. This is far from the first time hes given me this diatribe. I could recite it along with him. I did, once, but then he was hell to live with for a week. So I take my first tentative bite of my sandwich and let him continue. You get to live where youre most comfortable, he continues. You get to go to work with people like you, and everyone on the street is like you, and even that nosy bitch who thought I smelled gassy is like you! I dont get to have that. When was the last time you think I saw someone who looks anything like me? Well, there was that thing that came out of the lake and carried off those two frat boys. I know it stopped here when it was dragging themwherever it was going. He shifts behind me, the chair groaning as it tries to support whatever perversions of geometry are happening on its seat. You dont know it stopped here, he mutters. For an inhuman being of darkness, he is a lousy liar. Why would it stop here? I shrug without turning around. Maybe our place is just along the way. I dont know why it was here, but I know that I saw mud and moss and crushed beetles all over the yard and the walkway up to the house, and I know that the neighbors across the street looked out their window and saw some misshapen mass turning out of our driveway and carrying two young men with it. So, unless whatever monster stopped here was just asking directions, I feel secure in my assumption. So I had a friend drop by, he says. If you were home more often then I wouldnt need to talk to a wyrm. As much as they can talk. Its more of gurgling sound, really, or a groan. The groaning might have been those kids, though. Where was it taking them? I ask, even though Im fairly certain I dont want to know. It didnt know. Thats wyrms for you, though, just doing their jobs. Cant fault someone for doing their job. And were back to his favorite topic. I sweep up the crumbs on the counter and toss them into the sink. Its been years since I bothered using plates. They always wound up smashed somewhere and it was just too expensive. I take longer than I really need to before I turn around and look at the newest claw marks on the kitchen table. I was grading papers, I finally tell him. I cant bring them home to grade them, not after what you did last time. He throws his hands up in exasperation and I have to close my eyes against the unnatural directions his limbs move. I was *trying* to be helpful, he insists. Youre supposed to be imparting knowledge to these kids, and I was adding to that! Glaring in his general direction, I snap, They didnt need to know how each of them was going to die. You didnt even put your *helpful insight* on the right papers! Michelle Harris found out that Jeremiah Carter is supposedly going to die from falling into some kind of pit, and she didnt even know who Jeremiah Carter was because they werent in the same class! Meanwhile Jeremiah is wandering through my East Asian Archeology class looking for Libby Daniels to let her know that she should probably stay away from ski slopes if she doesnt want to be disemboweled! Oh, and that obnoxious Wickman kid sends Michelle an e-mail asking her if he can visit her parents home in Madison to see, quote, that delightful grotesquerie in the basement before you all succumb to the inevitable. I nearly lost my job, several kids wound up in counseling, and Michelle pepper sprayed Vernon Wickman the next time he got within range. You were never in danger of losing your job, he says with a dismissive wave. You have tenure. Nowhere is it more important to have tenure than at a school like Fulton University. Once you have that, you can do everything short of calling up one of the Fallen Ones without fear of losing your job. Of course, Professor Moreau had pushed that one boundary and tried to call up something anyway, but when she made a mistranslation the University hadnt bothered to fire her. It hadnt been necessary and her widow needed the pension. Maybe I couldnt be fired, I admit, but trust me when I say that Dean Vaughan can make my life miserable. Thats what I have you for. Risking a glance at his face, I see his mouth do some weird somersault in different directions, a twist that I learned is a smile. I offer him my own flat smile in return, and move to open the refrigerator once more. I dont hesitate when I pull out the two cans of beer. He never messes with the alcohol. His fingers, or whatever they are, have difficulty opening cans so I pop the tab before sliding it across the table. Its somewhat amusing to watch his concentration as he tries to lift a small three-dimensional object towards his yawning maw. What looks like several writhing snakes is actually just his tongue. I can only watch his first two attempts at getting the beer to his mouth before I feel a dull ache beginning behind my eyes. So I close my eyes and let my head fall forward onto my crossed arms in exhaustion. I try, you know, he says. I frown, but otherwise I stay still as I mumble, You try what? To get *all* the beer into your mouth for once? No. Well, yes, but thats not what I meant. I really do try to make you miserable. You just make it so damn hard. Nothing bothers you anymore. Actually, my poker face has just gotten better. When he firstarrived, every little thing could get a reaction out of me. The destruction of my personal property, the disruption of my social life, the death of my fish, the harsh breathing outside of my bedroom door as I tried to sleep but only an empty hall every time I dared to lookThe usual signs of an infernal visitor. But seven years has given me time to build up a level of defense against the unending onslaught of his personal attention. Youve done a great job, I reassure him. My family is on the other side of the country and rarely speaks to me, I havent had a date in four years, I dont have a pet, I dont have dishes, and you are almost the only person I ever talk to about anything other than work. Whoever sent you must be very proud. I hear him heave a sigh of frustration, even though Im not sure he actually needs to breathe. Its hard enough to comprehend the outside of him. I really dont want to think about the working of his internal organs. Or if he even has organs I *cant* tell you who sent me, he says yet again. Its part of the whole summoning process. Im not even technically the one they made a pact with. We have a hierarchy, and if you think Dean Vaughan can make your life hell you should see what my masters can do to me. My cheek is still pillowed on my arm as I shrug. Cant fault me for trying. Someone took the trouble to send a nearly unimaginable horror to torment me; I think that deserves recognition. Something along the lines of fire ants, honey, and zip ties. His hand is careful against my head. Those claws can cleave a mans leg off with one swipe, but theyve never hurt me. Its solid and still, without any of the strange bending and twisting I usually associate with his shape. And strangely, his hand is somehow the same temperature as a humans. I cant tell you who sent me, but if Im ever free, Ill hurt him in ways you cant even comprehend. It will be much more creative than fire ants and honey, and Ill do it for free, he promises quietly. A smile appears against my will. Its a strange show of affection, but one that means more than flowers or chocolates ever could. I crack one eye open and brave a glance at his face. You big softie, I whisper. Dont let it get out, he warns me. If anyone thinks Im getting soft on you I could lose my position here. Then its back to the swirling, shrieking abyss from whence I came. I close my eyes again so I dont have to watch his face ripple and give him a thumbs-up. Not going to be a problem. I dont want to have to break in a whole new demon anyway. Im not a demon, he reminds me again as his claws toy with my hair. I should pull away, hes made some truly astounding knots in the past, but Im just too tired. And I so desperately miss being touched. Not the kind of touching that generally happens behind closed doors, though I miss that pretty damn bad, but just feeling something else alive making contact with me. He and I have an agreement that as long as I push my family away he will leave them alone. I guess it hurts me enough that he doesnt feel he needs to improve on the situation. The lack of human friends is my own choice, as anyone close to me becomes another tool to torment me. It isnt a perfect system and sometimes I become so lonely that Im willing to drive to another town, hit a bar, and completely lose myself in booze and a one night lover. The morning after, I come rolling in with a hangover and enough self-loathing that he mostly leaves me alone. Hell still wait until Im almost asleep and slam a door, or open the blinds in my bedroom, or turn the garbage disposal on and leave it running, but otherwise its a fairly quiet day. One Sunday I was *serenaded* by some kind of thin, shrill piping, but a threat to never bring alcohol home again brought that to a sudden halt. So now here we are. Two overworked people who just want to get through the day, have a drink, and torture each other a little. Maybe we are married One of the envelopes came from Hawthorn, he says suddenly. I raise one eyebrow without moving my head. A few days ago, in the mail, there was a letter from Hawthorn College. I dont suppose you bothered to look at it before you shredded it, I grumble. Do you have any idea how hard it is to open something that flat? I cant evenhow can you even move in just three dimensions? I interrupt him, asking, Then how do you know it was from Hawthorn College? The seal was on the envelope, and *that* I can at least see properly, he explains. It has that lion-headed angel. You know what thats actually a picture of, right? No, and dont tell me. I still need to be able to get some kind of sleep. Was there just one sheet of paper? This is important, I tell him, opening my eyes. His hand stops moving against my hair and withdraws back to his side of the table. Hes strangely still as he watches me. Despite how sickening his geometry can be, when he is not twisting or bending is when he actually unnerves me. I dont show it, my mask is too good for that, but I sit up and force my eyes to stay on him. Who was it from? he asks me. The letter? Its from a professor at Hawthorn College. I needed his advice on something, I tell him. He continues to stare at me, and I try to return it with that same steadiness. What is he a professor of? he continues. Archeology, I say. Like me. Which is why I e-mailed him. There is a slight shift in his form, and I think he is relaxing. He takes a few swipes at his beer can before he can properly pick it up, and then downs whatever is left. I take the opportunity for a long drink of my own. When I set the can back down he is looking at me in that strange way again. So this professor isnt in the library? he asks slowly, as though to clarify. He doesnt work with books, recordstexts? And the penny drops. I fall back in my chair and groan. Im not trying to exorcize you again, I reassure him. Amongst other things, I cant afford to. Do you have any idea how much those nuts from Connecticut cost me? Plus, Ill probably just be cursed again, and were back to breaking in a new demon! Not. A. Demon. I throw up my hands in frustration. I dont know what the hell you are! I dont even know your name! Names have power, he reminds me once more. If he hadnt known your name, he wouldnt have been able to curse you! You should have been more careful with your name! Anyone can find a full name! I shout. This is the age of the internet! Five minutes with Google and youre lucky if all someone finds is your name! Well, that was a dumb invention then, wasnt it? he growls. Yep. This conversation actually just became that childish. Thats not unusual for us. As long as weve been together there are some arguments that just never end. But the crushing weight of futility crashes back down on me and I let it go. I run my hand over my face and drop my head back down to the table. All I wanted when I came through the door was food, shower, and my bed. Ive had the food, and I can put off the shower until morning. Its getting to bed that seems daunting all of a sudden. For a moment I consider slumping down to the floor and just crawling to my bedroom. Walking seems like too much trouble, and its not like I can be humiliated in front of my shadow monster any more than I have been. Or maybe Ill just stay here all night There is a sound like a sigh, and then the scrape of a chair and the clacking of claws. I feel his warm hand wrap around my bicep and pull me upright. Then my arm is draped around something, maybe shoulders, and hes half-leading me, half-carrying me down the hallway. Whats waiting for me in my bed? I ask him without bothering to open my eyes. Ah, just some dried leaves, he says. I was having a lazy dayyou know how sometimes you need to take things easy. My bed is, in fact, filled with dry leaves. There are also some pinecones and part of a birds nest. We dont have any pine trees in our neighborhood, but that is not something I feel up to questioning right now. Slipping out of his hold, I gather up the sheet and blankets and toss them into the corner. I can deal with that mess tomorrow. Clean ones are found in the closet, and I barely manage to keep my eyes open long enough to tug the fitted sheet mostly into place. I collapse face down without bothering with pajamas and just lay there. It is only when my toes get cold that I realize he has pulled off my shoes. I hear my closet door open and the sound of something dropping to the floor. Then there is the sound of claws tapping back and forth, drawers opening and closing, and water running somewhere. I am just awake enough to wonder what surprise he might be preparing for tomorrow morning. His infernal creativity never ceases to amaze me. Why didnt you ask me? There was a time when just the sound of his breathing sent me flying out of bed in a panic. Now his voice is almost soothing. Ask you what? I mumble into the mattress without raising my head. Whatever you asked the professor, he says. From whatever angle, or angles, he is looking at me, he can clearly see my confused frown. If its some question about an ancient monument or dead society, dont you think I might be a better source than some guy youve never met? I mull that over for a second as one of my hands shuffles across the bed for my quilt. When something soft brushes against the pads of my fingers I pause uncertainly. Fur, fungus, or fleece? Fleece, he tells me. Like I said, it was a lazy day. Is it *my* quilt? Yep. Did you do anything weird, disgusting, or unnatural to it? No, already! His wounded tone just makes me roll my eyes without even opening them. I drag the quilt over enough of my body for sleep and use my free arm as a pillow under my cheek. Pillows are also something you find that you can do without, especially when you cannot afford to buy yet another because somehow there is now a *living squirrel* in your expensive memory foam model from that sleep store in the mall. I still miss that pillow. You cant give me a human perspective, I remind him in answer to his question. I need to know the human history of a site to teach my students. Whoever you had stationed in an ancient city to torment someone a thousand years ago really does not help my class. He growls slightly, then says, Thats racist. I try to come up with an argument against his claim, and I am alarmed that the only thing that comes to mind is, *Wouldnt it be speciesist?* But Professor Wright knows this Mesopotamian culture like no one else does. I sent him a few pictures of an artifact in I pause for a yawn. Sorry, in one of our e-mails. Its kind of like a spireI mean, a spear, and it has a spokespikewhatever. Its a thing that he recognizes. Professor Wright? I hear him say softly. His hand once again goes to my hair, carding his fingers gently through it. Mesopotamian culture? How many e-mails have you shared? My voice is slurring as I mumble, I dunno. Bunch. Hisheeshe is so interesting. Knows about religionsecretspots. Lots about pots. Pots are important, he whispers, whatever passes for breath moving my hair. Professor Wright of archeologyHawthorn Collegereally. Claws are clicking across the floor, and then he closes the door softly behind him. He does not want to wake me back up as he heads for the computer. While I know there is a good chance that tomorrow I will need, at the very least, a new keyboard, I smile. Robert Wright, professor of archeology with a specialty in ancient languages, is a dick. There is no nicer way to say it. He likes his young students, male and female, and if he cant get what he wants from them he will go to great lengths to make their lives a living hell. He is pretty good at it, too, driving at least one girl to wash down her anti-anxiety pills with cheap beer. But he has no idea what hell on earth can really be. In the first few years of my unorthodox relationship I tried, twice, to date someone without my infernal roommate catching wind of it. It did not work out. I never realized those failed attempts at maintaining some form of happiness in my life could lead to such a moment of satisfaction. My e-mails to Professor Wright started out just the way I said, two professionals exchanging information. He was friendly and interesting, we shared some laughsAnd then one of my colleagues mentioned Professor Wrights issues with his younger students. It didnt take too much digging to find the rest. Robert Wright is a white man with a cultured accent, an expensive degree, and a level of arrogance that is just slight enough to seem attractive. The odds of him getting fired on the word of a student, or even a handful of students, are basically zero. A few of his victims have tried, all to no avail. There was an actual F*ck Robert Wright Facebook page, but not surprisingly, it got shut down. Then I read about a student that had tried something else, something that involved an ancient tome borrowed from the college library, several different kinds of herbs, and a long knife. She was not as successful as whoever had damned me, and she had ended up half out of her mind and covered in bites. The campus police blamed whatever herbs she had used, which had apparently sent her into fits of psychedelic psychosis. There is some debate over whether that is real or not, but I certainly found nothing to support the idea that it might be brought on by mugwort, anise, or rosemary. The student was expelled, spent some time in an overcrowded mental health hospital, and has not been seen for months. SoI had an idea. The clattering of claws on keys would usually make me wince or swear or threaten things I cannot actually do. Tonight, it is like a gentle lullaby. My e-mails with Robert Wright have become flirtatious, and Im even beginning to show a little vulnerability. Ive mentioned not sleeping well, and that my life has been very unhappy for the last seven years. Professor Wright is sympathetic and consoling, while still being a condescending prick. My oddly protective tormentor *hates* condescension. Tomorrow, when Robert Wright calls me before I leave for work, I will be awkward and alarmed. The conversation will be quick, just long enough to plant some seeds of interest into the ever-fertile mind of my bored monstrosity. He might catch onto my lie, in which case I will just try to ruin Professor Wright in some other way, but then again it might work. Or he might be too glad about someone new to torment to care. There is a snarling sound, and then I can hear my keyboard hit the floor. Its cheap, just like everything else in our home, so I dont really begrudge him his frustration. His claws clack and scrabble around on the floor until he picks up the keyboard. He is muttering obscenities in English, French, and a few languages I dont know. He could be at this for a while. Sighing softly, already beginning to drift, I find another smile sneaking onto my face. My hellish friend had let something slip. ""If he hadnt known your name, he wouldnt have been able to curse you."" That is the first time in seven years that he has mentioned one defining attribute of whoever cursed me. *He.* My list of suspects has been cut almost in half. A few ex-boyfriends and a few jealous colleagues have already made their way to the front of my mind as I begin to drift off. Between this little gem he has let slip, and the knowledge that when *I* send a demon to torment someone they actually deserve it, this might be the best sleep Ive had in seven years. "
165,vulnerability,nosleep,My Stalking Experience,27,8586yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8586yq/my_stalking_experience/,2018-03-18 12:16:59,"I am a 35 year old woman. 5 years ago, I had to deal with an obsessive stalker. The whole ordeal was so terrifying that I still need to go to professional counseling to this day. This is the 1st time that I am publicly sharing this story. I hope writing this story out will be excellent therapy for me. It all started when a really good looking co-worker of mine named Joel asked me out on a date. Due to having quite a crush on Joel, I gladly accepted it. We ended up hitting it off quite quickly, and he became my boyfriend. He was such a wonderful boyfriend, as he made me feel like the most special lady in the world. Joel was a bit possessive and clingy, but I loved him. So I tolerated his behavior. However, his controlling behavior got more and more unsettling to me as the months went by. He wouldnt let me hang around my close male friends. He would get crazy jealous even if some random guy merely waved at me. One time, Joel threw a major tantrum at me just for hanging around my brother Samuel. I was like Dude, I am just hanging out with my brother. Me and Samuel are not Jaime and Cersei Lannister here. Other bad signs I got from him, is that he always needed to hack into my emails, facebook, my phone contacts, etc. It was like my privacy was an unfathomable concept to him. It got too overbearing for me. The last straw was when I confronted him about his behavior, and he punched me in the face. I drew the line right there and then. There is no toleration for a guy that physically abuses me. He was dumped on the spot. However Joel would not let me go so easily Joel kept calling me anywhere from 50 to 170 times a day. One time, I found out that I missed exactly 359 missed calls from him. He would also bomb with messages on facebook and my phone. At work, he would sexually harass me, until he got fired. Even that did not deter him from stalking me. He would break into my house and leave threatening handwritten notes. Joel would follow me home from work every other day. When he killed both my pet cat and my dog, thats when I fully realized that my life was endangered. Ever since Joel started to stalk me, I never felt safe anymore. I always had to watch my back. The restraining orders I threw at him never deterred him. The police never seemed helpful. Being stalked causes feelings of isolation, loneliness, and vulnerability in people. I was no exception. I couldnt get any meaningful assistance from my parents because they lived thousands of miles away. My friends offered me support, but they never really helped me much. Samuel did the most to help me. He even threatened to kick Joels ass if he kept up with his behavior. Sadly, Samuel got in a nasty car accident, and he spent several months in the hospital. Obviously, he couldnt help me anymore. Joel kept up this behavior for 4 months, and I didnt think it could get any worse. It got worse. One night, I was sleeping in my room. I hear footsteps next to my bed. When I woke up, I see Joel in my room. My heart stopped beating when I see that he is holding a gun, rope, and a pair of handcuffs. I wanted to scream, but nothing came out of my mouth. I was frozen in fear, just like a deer staring into the headlights of a car. He got me out of bed and he tied me up. Joel tied me up by handcuffing my wrists behind my back, and tying a few lashes of rope around my waist. He then walked me over to his car. As he was trying to stuff me into his trunk, my fight instincts kick in. I dont know what he was going to do to me, but I didnt want to find out. So I kicked him right in the balls as hard as I could. I then body slammed him, knocking Joel to the ground. He clutches his crotch whimpering in pain. I fell over and land on the ground with him. Being tied up, I couldnt get myself back up. This left me very vulnerable to Joel, once he recovered. But I screamed bloody murder to get someones attention. My screams must have disturbed the whole neighborhood. A crowd of people gathered around, and my life was saved. Joel was detained by the police, and he got 8 years in prison for stalking and trying to kidnap me. The whole ordeal shook me to the core, and I need therapy to help recover from the trauma. I slowly recuperated from the whole experience. I married a wonderful man named Alex. Together we had twin baby boys, pregnant with another child, two cats, and one dog. I never been more happy to raise a beautiful family with Alex. I hope I never hear from Joel ever again. Despite all my blessings in my life, I still feel the need to watch my back. Just in case Joel is released, and decides to go back to his stalking ways... "
166,vulnerability,nosleep,Outtake Riding Lessons Ever After,10,85heoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/85heoj/outtake_riding_lessons_ever_after/,2018-03-19 17:19:26,"[related](URL **Authors note: this one isnt nice. It shows a particularly ugly side to Autumn, Devlin, and even Li. I suppose maybe I wanted to portray that not everything is as it seems, and even perfect relationships seldom are. Hence the title  Ever After, instead of Happily Ever After.** The trouble started when Christine showed up for lessons, and decided she was going to have Devlin and Li both in her bed. No one really paid her that much heed, since she was a small, mousy-looking woman. But Christine had years to perfect the art of appearing meek before she took down her prey. She projected an aura of being abused, mistreated, to hook guys in. When she was sure she had their sympathy, she played it up until they were ready to do anything to make her smile. It was an act that had never failed her, not once. Devlin and Li alternated her lessons between them. She had a pretty black gelding that looked to be part-Arabian, and it was obvious she took good care of him. Her tack was always in proper order, as were her boots and riding attire, earning her points with them both. What she didnt count on was me, though. I kept watch on her discreetly, never making it known to her that I was paying any attention at all. The wounded dove routine might work on Devlin, and possibly Li, but it would never work on me. I knew the signs of abuse intimately. I knew the fear that a man was going to hurt you again. I had *lived it*, unlike Christine. She tried to make friends with Iblis and Necromancer both, but neither stallion wanted anything to do with her. That was telling also; at least, to me it was. That both of my horses didnt like her spoke volumes. I was working the Dead Horse next to the arena Li was giving lessons to her in, and the moment she saw the enormous black stud she froze in her saddle. What is he? I heard her ask Li. Dont worry about what he is, Li said. Youre here for lessons. It was the first time Id heard Li be the least bit short with her and wondered what had happened. I quit wondering when she turned on the tears, and I *heard him fucking apologize to her*. Taking a deep breath and then exhaling rather forcefully, I let the Dead Horse wander around the arena. Men are fucking stupid sometimes, I swear, I muttered darkly, angry that she had made Li apologize to her. The Dead Horse said nothing, but I saw him turn his head to look at Li when we wandered near that side of the arena again. I also saw the almost guilty expression Li shot him in turn. I didnt confront Li, though. I let him go on thinking I had no idea what was going on between him and Christine. Inwardly, I seethed though. Devlin, I could understand somewhat. He was human. Li was not, and never had been, though. When the three of us had started out, I had told myself I wouldnt be jealous, because I knew they wouldnt stray. But right now, I was questioning that. I was questioning that hard. Christine was much younger than I was. She had flawless skin  I didnt. She was also about fifty pounds lighter than I was, maybe more than that. She was gracefully slender, something I had never been. For the first time in years, I questioned whether I was enough to keep a man. And that didnt make me feel good. But watching how gently Devlin and Li both handled Christine, and then seeing how she just ate up the attention they gave her like a starving dog, ripped open wounds I thought were long scarred over. The smiles, the hand stroking her back or her hair, or even her fucking *leg* when she was mounted, the soft tones they used on her made me feel like I was no longer wanted. It also brought forth that red haze of rage, because I fucking *knew* she was playing games with them and they were both too goddamned stupid to see it. I had thought Devlin, and certainly Li, smarter than this, but they were proving me wrong. I kept it all bottled up, though. I hated confrontation, and I was afraid of losing them both, so I said nothing. I went on about my duties at the stable, my face a mask of indifference and my tone completely neutral when I had to speak. Back at the cabin, however, I began withdrawing from them. It was easier than I thought it was going to be, and that didnt help matters any. Both Li and Devlin seemed more interested in talking to each other and watching whatever caught their eye than paying any attention at all to me. Our sex lives might as well have been non-existent, and that cut deep. If they werent with me, were they with her and I just hadnt caught them yet? Was that bitch fucking them? Friday evening came, the night we usually went to DeSades, and both of them approached me as I was grabbing my jacket to head back to the cabin alone. Hey, Autumn, Christine wants to come to the dungeon with us tonight, Devlin said. She wants Li and me to top her. I find it ironic that a woman with a history of abuse would want something like that, I stated, and turned on my heel to walk off. Devlin looked at Li, the ice in my voice having been felt by them both. What the hell was that about? he asked, confused. Li didnt respond, his gaze going to me stalking up the path to the cabin. Come on, he murmured, heading after me. I went inside, yanked my boots off, slung my jacket on the floor, and then headed down the hall to the bedroom to lock myself in. Fuck *both* of them. If they wanted to play with that lying cunt, well, they could fucking well do it without *my* goddamned gear. Upon finding I had locked them out of the bedroom, they realized there was a problem. Autumn, open the fucking door, Li called. Or I am going to open it myself. Go fuck yourself! I spat, going into the bathroom and locking that door behind me too. Jaw set, Li exerted just enough energy to unlock the door, and then he was through it after me. Finding the bathroom door locked, and hearing the water running, he growled and unlocked that door too. What the hell is your problem? he demanded. Get out! I screamed, pointing at the door. Get the fucking hell away from me! In the blink of an eye, he shifted form and walked up to me. The second he was close, I drew back and slapped him. I told you to get the fuck away from me, I hissed, rage coursing through me. That I was angry enough to slap him and tell him to get away from me was telling. I will *not*, he retorted, fighting to remain calm and not lash out at me. He didnt fucking understand why I was so openly hostile towards him. Not until you calm down and tell me why. I uttered a harsh bark of a laugh, shaking my head. If youre so fucking stupid that you dont goddamned know why Im so angry at you *both*, you dont fucking deserve me telling you! I yelled. Throwing up his hands, he reverted back to his human guise and left me alone in the bathroom. When I finished my shower twenty minutes later, they were both gone, and theyd taken my gear with them. That mindless rage still riding me, I picked up my cell and called Red, Rhi, and Selene to tell them exactly what was going down tonight. All three of them were more than happy to help me, thankfully. Especially Rhi, though. Let me invite someone I know to the dungeon, she said. Someone to give you the attention you need, and *hopefully* get the point across to those fucking assholes you live with. Who? I asked, curious. Autumn, its best that I dont tell you who it is, she told me. But dont worry  he will have explicit orders that this is just to test some boundaries. He will not be allowed to touch you if you dont want him to. I give my word on that. I agreed, and then got dressed. I got dressed in the exact same outfit Devlin had seen me in all those years back  black velvet catsuit with a black leather underbust corset cinched down as tight as I could get it, and then thigh-high boots. I put on just enough make-up to make me look like the sadist I was, and then I left for the dungeon myself. This was going to be a night that neither of them ever fucking forgot. Selene, Red, and Rhi were waiting on me at the front desk when I walked in. Youre going to like her friend, Selene told me, eyebrow raised. He walked in and six different women tried to get a scene with him. Where are they? I asked, arms across my chest and nostrils flaring. In the room you always use, with the door closed and locked, Selene replied. But I do have a key, Autumn. Well, lets go meet this friend of yours, and then Im probably going to want *my* fucking gear back, I stated flatly, and headed into the main room with the three of them. Rhi led me into the lounge area, smiling at someone sitting in the corner. Dmitry, this is Autumn, your date for the night, she expressed, and Dmitry stood up to walk into the light. If Nik had let his hair grow out, Dmitry could have been his fucking twin. Are you Russian, by chance? I asked, unsure if I really wanted him to answer me. Dmitry smiled. No, Im not, he expressed, his voice a low, smoky baritone. There was energy in that voice as well, telling me that he wasnt human. His energy was warm, washing over me like a blanket. Okay, I said, trying to get my bearings. Dmitry reached to cup my face, those pale blue eyes staring down at me intently. I saw what they went into that room with, he told me. They dont deserve you. Know that. Okay, this man was dangerous. That simple hand on my face felt a hell of a lot more intimate than it should have, and the way he was looking at me was like I was the only thing that existed in his world. Lets go get my gear back, I said. Ill probably have to throw most of it away, though. Red, Rhi, Selene, Dmitry, and I crossed the room to the locked door my *former* partners were in with that lying bitch. We could all hear them talking from outside, so I waited a moment to see what was being said inside. Im so happy the two of you were able to come tonight, Christine told them, smiling. Ive got a  question, I guess you could say, Li began. Youve said repeatedly that you were abused, badly beaten by an ex. Why would you want to submit to two sadists? Oh, I want to do more than submit to you, she said, and I nodded to the door. Selene unlocked it and threw it open, and I walked in with Dmitry right on my heels. Im here for *my* gear, that you didnt ask me if you could use, I stated, giving both Devlin and Li a significant look. Who the hell is she? Christine cried, trying to cover her breasts. Didnt they tell you? I asked, turning to look at her. They *live* with me. Or, they did, I guess I should say. Since they seem to prefer your skinny, lying ass over me, I guess they can fucking have you, cunt. You could have heard a pin drop when I said that, and I felt Dmitry put his hand on my shoulder. Shes not worth it, babe, he said, and locked eyes with Li and Devlin with a predatory smile. Neither are Devlin and Li, since they seem to prefer her over you. Wait just a fucking minute, Devlin expressed, looking irritated. Autumn, what the fucking hell is going on here? I let that rage surface, stalking over to Christine to snatch her off the bench by her hair. *This fucking cunt has been playing you both!* I screamed, shaking her hard and making her shriek. And both of you just played right fucking into it! Do you honestly think that a woman who had been abused as badly as she *claims* would want to get the shit beat out of her? God damn you Devlin! Use your motherfucking head for a change instead of thinking with your fucking dick! Shes lying! Christine yelled, scratching at me and kicking. I slammed her into the wall hard, my hand wrapped around her throat and my eyes turning black. The *hell* I am, I growled, and my power rose to lash out at her like a whip. Open that goddamned worthless cocksucker one more time to tell a lie, and I will fucking *end you*. The truth, Christine, Dmitry said, those pale eyes boring into hers. Screaming, she broke. Okay! she yelled. I lied to you both! I lied! I just wanted to fuck you  I wanted you both in my bed! I lied about being abused to get close to you, to get you to trust me! Oh god, please dont let him hurt me! Please! Black talons erupted from my fingertips at those words from her, and I dug them into her neck hard enough to draw blood. Devlin and Li were *mine*, do you hear me? I snarled, teeth bared. And you fucking *knew* that, you worthless fucking whore! I didnt know I was in tears until Christine passed out and I was forced to drop her on the floor. Screaming, I doubled over on myself, sobs tearing their way out of me. Dmitry scooped me up in his arms and carried me out the door away from a stunned Devlin and Li. So, was it worth it? Red asked them, her voice not belying the anger she felt at what theyd done to me. You just completely fucked your relationship with Autumn, so Im curious if it was worth it. No, Devlin answered, looking shell-shocked. Who  who is that with her? Lucifer, Li answered, shifting into his actual form and stalking out of the room. Oh, my fucking god, Devlin exclaimed, going after an enraged Belial. Umm, maybe inviting Lucifer wasnt such a good idea, Red told Rhi, who looked horrified. Belial looked pretty fucking pissed, Rhi. Lucifer had taken me back into the lounge, and sat down with me on his lap to hold me. Im so sorry, Autumn, he murmured, stroking my back and hair while I cried. He could feel the pain I was in, and despite his reputation of being an utter bastard, it bothered him. When Belial swept into the lounge moments later, flames burning in his eyes and tendrils of red hair turned to tiny red serpents that hissed and snapped, he sighed. Rhi hadnt told him Li was *Belial*. This was going to get ugly fast. Then Devlin came flying in on Belials heels, and Lucifer realized that was the understatement of the year. He was going to have to deal with Belial, plus his priest, and then likely me too since he had figured out I was Belials priestess. Damn it, Rhiannon, he muttered, not liking the position shed put him in. *Get your fucking hands off my woman,* Belial snarled his energy lashing out violently at Lucifer. I flung myself off his lap, facing Belial and Devlin both through a haze of tears. You dont have any fucking right to me anymore! I yelled. That ended when you decided that fucking bitch in there was more important than *me*! We didnt touch her, I swear! Devlin yelled back, itching to just dart in and yank me away from Lucifer. Autumn, please! Please, come back to the room and talk to us! The same way you talked to me for the last two weeks? I countered. *Neither fucking one of you has said more than two words to me this whole fucking time! How the fucking hell do you think I feel right now? How the fucking hell do you think I feel, huh?* Selene wisely closed the door to the lounge, to give us some semblance of privacy. Devlin went to his knees, tears spilling over. Im sorry, he choked out, still holding a hand toward me. Autumn, please. Im begging you, please come away from him. Come away from the only man in two weeks to not treat me like shit? I asked, incredulous. Who has been nothing but nice to me? God damn it, Autumn, that is *Lucifer,* Belial spat. I froze. What? I echoed, turning to look back at Dmitry. Lucifer uttered a heavy sigh, closing his eyes for a moment. Belial is correct, he confirmed. Im Lucifer, Autumn. Rhiannon left much out in the telling, it would appear. Oh, god, I muttered, and hit the floor in a dead faint. Lucifer caught me before I hit, though, picking me up to carry me to Belial and hand me off to him. And you once told me that *I* didnt have a clue how to handle women, he expressed. What does this right here say about you, Belial? You *broke* her, both of you. I hope you can sleep at night, knowing that. At least I didnt torture, rape, and kill her, Belial hissed, handing me to Devlin and then stepping up into Lucifers face. Tell me why I shouldnt end you right fucking now. I cant give you an answer, Belial, Lucifer told him calmly. But I will ask you to think about what you just said. From my perspective, what youve done to Autumn is just as bad as what I did to your consort all those years ago. You *tortured* her by paying more attention to that worthless piece of ass in that room right now. You *raped* her feelings by ignoring her and continuing to buy into that bitchs lies. But Belial  you *killed* her spirit, worst of all. I felt something inside her die, and I dont know if you can rekindle that. That said, Lucifer walked around Belial and went out the door, closing it quietly behind him. I never thought Id be saying this, but  hes right, Belial, Devlin forced himself to say, holding me tight against him and fighting not to break down again. We both  we did this. First time for you, but this is the second time Ive fucked up now. I wont get a third chance, I dont think. His breath hitched, and he buried his face in my hair. I dont want to lose her again. I cant. I cant go through that pain again. I fucking cant. Belial took a deep breath, looking down at Devlin holding me. Lets go home. When she comes around, maybe shell listen to us then. All we can do, is try. I slept until late Saturday afternoon, worrying them both to no end. It was only then, when my exhaustion was in their face, that they both realized just how badly they had fucked up. When I was lying there comatose, circles under my eyes and a pallor to my skin that they hadnt seen before, fitfully twitching in my sleep. What happened to us? Devlin asked Belial, softly. Ive never been in a relationship like this before, Devlin, Belial answered, his eyes on my face. Im afraid that we were both taken in by lies, though. Were equally at fault, here. He paused, a furrow creasing his brow. That woman has obviously had a lot of time to perfect her act, to lure men in. And as much as it galls my pride to admit it, it worked too well, even on me. I should have seen the signs, and I didnt. I fucking didnt. Even with Autumn screaming in my face, all but telling me something was wrong here, I wasnt listening. It wasnt until that bitch looked at us both in that room and said she wanted more than to just submit to us, that it began to dawn on me something wasnt quite right. And then it was too late, Devlin said, uttering a dry, humorless laugh. God, I feel like something has reached in and ripped my fucking heart out, stomped holes in it, and then tried to put it back. I can  relate  to that, Belial admitted softly, brushing his fingers against my face. When I finally opened my eyes, the clock beside the bed read a quarter till three in the afternoon. Taking a deep breath, I exhaled and looked around the room. Neither Devlin nor Li were in there with me. Feeling like Id been beaten, I dragged myself out of bed to go into the bathroom to get a shower and wash the night off. Devlin and Li both were sitting on the trunk at the foot of the bed when I walked out of the bathroom. I wont lie and say that the sight of them sitting there, with identical apprehensive expressions, didnt pull at me. But they had both betrayed my trust in them, and I needed time to think. Im going to stay in my old cabin, I made myself say. I think we need to be apart. Please dont leave, Devlin begged. I cant stay here, after what you both did to me, I told him. Maybe with me gone, youll understand what you put me through. I called JB, told him I needed some time off and some space. Rhi must have told him something, because he gave me a week and told me to take care of myself. Going back into the bedroom, I packed enough clothes for eight days and my toiletries, and then I left. I got in my car  idly wondering who had driven it home for me  and I left for my old cabin. JB had put a bed in it, along with a couch and coffee table, and there were a few dishes, but nothing else. After putting my toiletries in the bathroom, I sighed and left again to go to the store. I would need food, after all. And better sheets, and towels, I realized. Rhi was the first one to call me on Sunday. How are you holding up? she asked. I sighed, blinking away the sting of unshed tears. Im at my old cabin, for now. Maybe with me gone, theyll figure shit out. I wish I had known what that bitch was doing, she told me. Maybe I could have put a stop to it. I *did* know, Rhi, and I did nothing, I admitted. I didnt feel like theyd listen to me or take me serious. She hooked into them but good. I cant believe she got over on Belial, she said. He should have known she was lying, manipulating feelings, whatever the fuck she was doing to them to crawl into their heads like she did. I cant believe you invited Lucifer as my date for the night, I stated. Im guessing you didnt know the history between him and Belial. No, no I fucking did *not* know that, she replied immediately. Oh, Jesus, Autumn. If Id known, I would never have done that. I was just thinking attractive male, create jealousy, honest. Nik could have been his twin, I commented. Well, at least there was no fighting between them, I dont think. Selene hasnt called to say her dungeon is gone at least. They didnt fight, Rhi told me. I dont know what happened in the lounge, but Lucifer came out shaking his head, told me to have a better night than he was having, and left. Red called me next to check on me, see if I needed anything, and then Selene called. Neither Devlin nor Li called or came by. It was hard being in that cabin alone. I was used to sleeping with someone now, used to there being noise when I woke up or went to bed, so being there alone was hard. The silence was almost deafening, and I took to sitting outside as much as I could. The weather was starting to turn  we were getting a few warmer days now, and not just the bitter cold. Thursday night, I was sitting out on the front porch when the Dead Horse walked up alone. *I am not excusing their actions, so dont think thats why Ive come to you,* he said. *They both miss you terribly, Autumn. I dont think Ive ever seen Belial so vulnerable, in all the years Ive known him. Devlin is faring worse, though.* You are older than I know, I said, looking at him through the tears I refused to shed. You have seen much. What would you have me do, knowing what they put me through? Knowing that they both made me feel unwanted by them? He stepped right up to me, his head lowering so he could meet my eyes. *I would at the very least hear them out. If conditions could be met, I would go back. If I didnt feel like they were being honest with me, I would leave*. I sighed, resting my head against his and feeling the first tear slip free. Alright, I finally said. Ill see how this goes. Dont tell them, though. Ill go home tomorrow while theyre at the stable. He rubbed his muzzle over my cheek, a gesture of affection I knew. *Youre strong, Autumn. I know in your heart you still love them both. And I know they still love you as well. I cannot speak on what made them do what they did, but having watched them both this whole week  regret doesnt come close to what they must feel.* Friday morning, after I knew they were gone to the stable, I packed up and went home. I half-expected a mess when I walked in, but everything was neat and orderly. A glance in the trash can did show me at least one of them had hit the bottle, though. I saw two empty scotch bottles, along with an empty wine bottle. Making myself a mug of hot tea, I took my things to the bedroom to put them away. I changed the sheets on the bed also, and took them to the laundry to throw them in the wash along with my dirty clothes. Needing to stay busy, to keep from having a panic attack, I set about deep-cleaning the cabin. Cobwebs were gotten out of the corners, the baseboards were dusted and wiped down with lemon oil, and the floors were swept, mopped, and then had a thin coat of polish put on them. I scrubbed the bathroom but good, taking an old toothbrush to get in the cracks and crevices, and I cleaned the bay window over the bathtub. I cleaned all the windows through the cabin, dusted, shook rugs out and vacuumed them, and then turned my attention to the spare bedroom and bathroom. No, I didnt have a method to my madness. I was just trying to stay busy, to keep from thinking too much. When I had gone over the entire fucking cabin from front to back and top to bottom, and all the laundry was done and put away, I still had three hours before they walked in the door. What the hell was I going to do for three hours? Well, there was always the internet. Sitting down at the computer, I booted it up and put on a playlist to listen to while I mindlessly browsed through different sites and forums. Finding a nifty little free room design program, I settled with that to pass the time. And that was the sight Devlin and Li came home to  me sitting at the computer, completely absorbed in the room I was currently working on while listening to Lamb of God. There was a glass of wine sitting on the desk, and a discreet look in the kitchen showed the bottle was mostly empty. Unsure of how to approach me, they hung up their jackets and removed their boots and waited for me to realize they were home. When it became apparent that I was too into whatever I was doing on the computer, Devlin gave Li a look and warily approached me. Now that he was close, he could see the room I was working on. He could also smell wild cherry blossoms and had to fight not to go to his knees and bury his face in my hair. Feeling heat at my back when I sat back from the screen to contemplate the room, I realized they were both home. Taking a breath, I picked up my wine to take a sip and slid my eyes to the side to figure out which one was standing over me. *Devlin*, I echoed, seeing the scar on the back of his left hand. Do you understand yet? I asked quietly, not looking at him. Taking a shaky breath, he knelt by my chair. Yes, he murmured, tears stinging his eyes. I turned around, meeting wet, green eyes. Be very sure of what you say to me, I said, keeping my voice even. Why did you do it? I wish I knew, he said, not taking his eyes off mine. Autumn, I fucking wish I knew. Her seeming vulnerability, that scared look she almost always wore somehow *made* me want to protect her. I cant fucking explain it. I have *never* had a woman do that to me before. I couldnt fucking get her out of my head  it was almost like she crawled in there and tried to erase you. Rhi did some digging on Miss Christine, I stated, sitting back in the chair to regard Devlin mildly. Would you care to guess what she found out? She was using a spell, Li said, not moving from the chair and not meeting my eyes. I went back over the last two weeks and realized what she had done. He sighed, looking down. After it was too late, of course. Christine Smith had quite the collection of occult books in her house, when the police raided it, I said, not changing expressions. Somehow, she had gotten hair from you both, and was using that to keep you sniffing after her. Well, on top of that ridiculously stupid act she was pulling. Now I looked to Li, and my brow furrowed. I thought for sure the Dead Horse was going to hop the fence that day and bite the ever-loving *shit* out of you, when you apologized for making that sorry whore cry. I would have more than deserved it, Li murmured, not looking up. You cant even look at me now, can you? I pushed. Slowly he raised his head, and the light glistened off his cheeks. Well, so you *are* capable of feeling, after all, I commented. I was beginning to really believe that you didnt give a shit. Devlin, I can see clearly regrets what he did. But *you*, Belial? I snorted. Ever so fucking stoic, cant let that mask slip lest some stupid *human* find out you have feelings. Alright, stop it, Autumn! he snapped, his face displaying the hurt he felt clearly now. I havent even fucking *started* with you, I spat. You fucking *knew* something was wrong, and you did nothing. Not once did you fucking *ask me* if I was okay. No, you *demanded* that I tell you what my fucking problem was, you asshole! Uttering a half-frustrated, half-anguished cry, he dropped the human guise and lunged to his feet to pace over to the table in the kitchen. Propping himself up on it, he shook as he struggled to find words that wouldnt piss me off worse. I didnt know how to process your rage towards me, he got out, digging his nails into the wood in an attempt to gain control over his emotions. I didnt understand why you were screaming at me, why you were telling me to get the fuck away from you, and it *hurt*, okay? God *damn* it, Autumn, you dont just lash out, you fucking eviscerate! Yes, we both fucked up so badly that even *I* dont have words for it. We didnt fucking *know*, though. As much as it pains me to admit it, she fucking fooled me too. I was in the same fucking boat that Devlin was in, and I couldnt fucking stop it. Both of you, thanks to the way you hung on her every word, not to mention how touchy-feely you were with her, had me convinced that I was too old, too fat, and too ugly to want, I stated. That girl was half my age and looked to be half my body weight as well. And I *cannot* compete with that. Every emotional wound I had, every last fucking insecurity, you succeeded in ripping wide open again. I was in therapy for four years, for PTSD, body dysmorphia, and an eating disorder. I thought I had it under control. The two of you proved me wrong. Now Belial turned to me, the expression on his face shattering something inside me. Maybe you dont want me around anymore, he forced himself to say, but dont walk away from Devlin. I found him unconscious on the bathroom floor, Autumn. He had drunk an entire bottle of scotch and taken I dont know how many sleeping pills. Without you here, he clearly didnt want to be here either. I forced him to vomit it up, to keep him alive. I wasnt sure you were gone yet. I turned to Devlin, tears blurring my vision. I think you did that once before, believing I was gone for good, I murmured, reaching to run my fingers through his hair. Please stay, Devlin breathed. I drew him up against me tight, nose in his hair. Why do you think I came back? I asked, feeling him wrap around me. Belial looked at us for a moment, and then turned to go down the hallway. Belial, I called, and held one hand toward him. In that one moment, the mask fell off completely and he let me see just how vulnerable he was. He looked so torn, so utterly *human* right then  Faltering, he slowly crossed to where I sat with Devlin, sinking to the floor beside him. Gingerly, I touched his face and felt him start to lean into it and stop himself. I dont want you to go, I murmured, fingers threading through his hair. You have come to mean every bit as much to me as Devlin. I cannot imagine my life without you in it now. All of the tension drained out of him, and he leaned into my other side with his chin on my shoulder. We stayed like that for a while, not speaking or moving. But finally Devlin leaned back, along with Belial, and the two of them exchanged a look. This week has been absolute hell, Devlin expressed. I botched half my lessons, and mistook him for you the night he found me on the floor. Mistook  Belial  for me, I echoed, confused. We dont look anything alike. Belial sighed. I stayed with him, that night, he explained. I wasnt sure he wouldnt try again if I left him alone. He gave Devlin a disgruntled look. My thanks was waking up at four am with him nearly on top of me snoring in my fucking ear. It wasnt intentional, Devlin said, looking uncomfortable. Thank goodness neither of us were nude, Belial muttered. That really would have been awkward. That doesnt make me feel any better about it, Devlin groused. It wasnt supposed to, Belial shot back. Good grief, I muttered, shaking my head. Look. I dont think any of us have had proper sleep or anything else this week. Why dont we get a shower, go get something to eat, then come back here and just go to bed? Together? Belial asked, looking at me like Id grown another head. Uttering an exasperated sigh, I gave him a look in turn. I know good and hell well neither of you have *any* interest in each other like that, and I will stay in the middle, I clarified. Honestly, as many times as the three of us have played together in varying degrees of nudity, and you balk at sharing a shower and a bed. Okay, okay, Belial said, a smirk appearing. Its not like there wont be enough room. Look at it this way, Devlin began, grinning. You wont wake up with me snoring in your ear. Youll have her instead. I do not snore, I retorted, indignant. Ah, actually, you kinda do, Devlin countered. Not just that, but you You know what, if you two are going to start telling me every little thing I do in my sleep, I am going to sleep in the spare room and the two of you can share the bed again, hows that? I interrupted, hands on my hips. Belial and Devlin eyed each other and turned to me. Yeah, thats a no-go, Devlin stated. Well behave, Autumn. Or I will, at least. What he said, Belial told me when I gave him a pointed look. Right, I muttered. Come on you two. Shower, food, and then sleep."

The house was unnervingly quiet and felt intrinsically evil. Her heart was racing in her chest as the ominous black carpeted floor of the dining room came into focus. The door was slightly ajar, and from glancing in she could see the results of a struggle. Two oak dining chairs with red cushioned seats lay scattered across the floor atop broken white ceramic of what could have been a plate or a bowl before it was smashed. Resting her hand on the ancient door she pressed against it, feeling it give way to reveal the rest of the dining room. Tall darkwood cabinets carrying plates, cigar boxes, bottles of aged wine, and various trophies adorned the four walls. The top halves were made of a green tinted glass, lending an eerie atmosphere to the items that had been painstakingly arranged inside them. The bottom halves of the cabinets were large wooden cupboards with sliding locks on the outside. In the middle of the room sat a huge oval table made from some unidentifiable dark wood. It had been heavily polished, giving it a beautiful lustrous shine which reflected the tiny smitter of light entering through the single cobweb adorned window. In the right of the room a door led to, what she presumed, to be an adjoining kitchen. ------------------------- The players watching the dining room cameras saw several new options flash to life on their screen. Among the usual choices of close the door were a range of new ones. Two of the white lights that marked an option suddenly changed colour, one over the table glowed a bright orange, the other marker over a cabinet changed to a vibrant red. A bidding war quickly erupted between those wanting to activate the orange lit trap hovering over the table labelled 'Leather Binding Trap', and those who wanted to activate the red one hovering over the cabinet's lower cupboards reading, 'Release the Fingerman.' The first action to win the bid however, was the ubiquitous 'close the door.' They watched as the girl swung around in her uniform, her red hair cascading about. The door behind her had slammed shut and locked. She was frantically trying to pull it back open, terrified at the mysterious happenings in the house. The anons watched with glee as their second action got enough bids to launch. 'The Fingerman has been released' appeared in big bold red letters on their center of their screens. On the cameras they saw the girl shriek in terror as an urgent, rapid, and delicate tapping erupted from the obese cabinet to her right. It was as if someone was inside it, gently hitting the wooden door with a dozen pieces of fine stony marble. As the quick pattering rose into a crescendo they saw Lily step back from the cabinet, grabbing a solid bronze candlestick from the table behind her. Name: Lily Monroe Date of Birth: 12th February 2008 Occupation: Senior Schoolgirl Clothing: Burgundy Blazer White Blouse Pink Bra Burgundy School Skirt Pink Cotton Panties (wet) Burgundy Tights (damp) Black Shoes Orgasm: 100% Horniness:34% Mental Fortitude: 98% Stress:16% ----- Lily clung to her improvised weapon for dear life. The lock on the cabinet at the other side of the room had begun to twist and turn sharply, eventually wrenching itself open with a solid *clack*. She drew in a deep breath as the mahogany door slowly creaked open and a dark, smooth hand emerged. Impossibly long fingers curled around the edge, constantly wiggling and tapping, never resting, never stopping for even a second. The terrified schoolgirl backed into a clammy corner as a second hand emerged, followed by the lanky body of a tall creature, devoid of any facial features except an oversized grinning mouth baring huge white teeth. It's skin shimmered like onyx, pulsating with dark waves, almost as if light couldn't escape from the surface. It stood on two monstrously muscular legs, smooth as the polished table before them. At full height the creature was over seven feet tall, hunching over to avoid bumping its nightmarish head against the plastered ceiling. A shadow as ominous as church bells at midnight crept over Lily's trembling body. She stood stone statue still, petrified by the monstrosity towering over her now. With hands trembling, and heart racing, she attempted to let out a scream, or run, or raise a fist. But she couldnt do anything but stare and gape, victim of her own mind's imagination come true. This WAS the figure that lurked under the bed, the unseen entity in the closet, the malicious malcontent that watched from the other side of the mirror when lights were low. It pounded forward towards Lily with three unholy strides snatching out at the schoolgirl with elongated arms and wriggling fingers. The pallid smile never opened or moved, the teeth never gnattered, and no warm breath blew from within. It was as lifeless within as a spectre from the grave. She felt the creature cling to her blazer, picking her weightless body up and roughly tossing her onto the solid dining room table. As soon as she hit it the table began groaning and creaking beneath her weight. The teen came to her senses and suddenly began attempting to roll away from her captor. Before she could escape four leathery belts shot out from the underside of the furniture like snakes from a river. In an almost sentient act of horror the straps snapped and wrapped themselves around her wrists and ankles, pinning her vulnerable body to the table below. *Clang!* Her candlestick fell onto the floor, banging off one of the table's legs as it tumbled down. She began writhing and thrashing about in a bid to break the belts, but it was no good. They were made from a high quality material. Whoever or whatever created this abomination of a trap never intended her to escape easily. ""FUCK! Stay away from me! Get the hell away!"" ------ The anons watched and cheered in their chatlog as their bid for the table trap worked! She was at their mercy, and the Fingerman could now get to work on pleasuring her delicate flower. 'hope she doesn't work out that the straps stop tugging if you relax.' 'She won't, Fingerman will keep her busy.' 'Yeah, love the new Fingerman, Diablo! sweet jesus that thing is fucking terrifying The camera zoomed in on Lily, now bound spread eagle to the table while the Fingerman prowled around at the bottom to get at her pussy. On the Nightmare website a new button appeared, a demonic red face with two glowing blue eyes. The man clicked it and immediately he was seeing through the non-existent eyes of the Fingerman. From this perspective he could just about see up her short skirt, unfortunately covered by her thin, dark tights which obscured any hope of seeing her panties or puffy cameltoe. Seizing upon the opportunity he had, the Fingerman unleashed his dextrous digits upon her assailable thighs through her tights. The viewers were in the low hundreds now, having been diverted from some obscure thread from 4Chans /b/ board. They watched in shocked awe the girl writhed on the table, trying her best to close her thighs and halt the leisurely climb of her molester's fingers. They were a third of the way up her thigh when she felt her right arm slip free of the leather belt strap. It seemed that one of Diablos traps had broken earlier than expected! It happened sometimes; the anons were in no alarm though - there would be plenty more at their disposal. The schoolgirl used her free arm to take a swing at the Fingerman's low head. Shock and horror filled the chatroom as they watched her clenched fist fly through the air at the creation they had donated hundreds of credits towards. Her fist soared down, just grazing the edge of its head. A cheered relief followed this near miss, as the Fingerman ducked out of the range of further blows.

Its fingers were only a few inches from her pussy now and the fear of it touching her most private area was driving her crazy. She had swung at the monster and horribly missed, now it was out of reach and all she could do was struggle against the three remaining straps that held her down. She tried her best pulling against the leather restraints, but she couldnt close her thighs. Soon the creature's fingers reached the sensitive 'v' between her legs. She drew a deep breath and closed her eyes, wriggling frantically against the restraints The tapping and tickling abruptly stopped. Huh? she muttered in confusion, opening one eye. The tarmac black monster was still there, pearl-white teeth glistening in an unnervingly perfect smile. It stared at her from between her legs, no eyes to blink with, no nose to smell, no ears to hear. Lilys heart sank when she saw it begin to cruelly extend a single finger into the air between her legs. The Fingermans head tilted to the right ever so slightly as the single long digit dropped down to her crotch again and initiated the perfect caress of the thin slit at the center of her tights. Wh-what! Dont touch ther- ohh! The Fingerman traced his finger up and down the outline of her pussy, watching cruelly as her wetness continued soaking through to her tights. The pleasurable sensations paused for a minute as she watched the Fingerman lower its head between her legs - the razor sharp teeth filling its mouth, slowly opening up to reveal an infinitely black maw within.AHHH!! she screamed, emptying her lungs in a second. The creatures mouth clamped down over her tights - the needle sharp teeth slicing through her tights and gulping down the elastic material.GET AWAY! GET AWAYYY! she howled, writhing and panicking, banging her fist against the creatures solid head with little success. *Rrrrrriiiip* She felt a warm air flow over her sopping pussy, followed by a cool breeze. Her heart sank as the creature stood up again with a pair of tattered, damp pink panties clenched between its teeth. After ensuring she saw them and knew her naked vulnerability the Fingerman flung its head back. *GULP* The walls had been breached and the Fingerman bent back down, returning its curving finger to her moist pussy. She reached down with her liberated arm, but the monster snapped at her wrist forcing her to withdraw it quickly. EEP! Pl-please dont!The Fingerman raised a different finger this time, slowly showing his captive the intricate surface. This one seemed to have some kind of sucker on the end - much like the tentacle of an octopus. Content that she had seen his weapon of choice the Fingerman returned, slowly lowering it to her exposed clitoris and clamping down with the sucker. Lily felt it attach itself, squirming and squelching over her little nub as if it really were some fleshy sucker from a tentacled sea-beast. Ahh G-god! *Squelch* The tentacled sucker began throbbing against her clitoris as the Fingerman bent his digit back and forth, sending blood rushing to her engorged button, and offering rhythmic pulsations akin to a blowjob.S-stoohhh! Stop! OHH! Oh my Ohh. Lily moaned, tossing her head back against the table and biting her bottom lip to contain her slutty moans. Her ginger hair cascaded over the table as she thrashed about, her free hand clenched into a fist. She was too afraid and too horny to strike the creature - the carrot and the stick; if she punched out it might bite her, if she didnt strike then it would continue pleasuring her. *Tap tap* The quick rap against the table made the teen open her eyes again, staring down as the Fingerman pulled the sucker off her clitoris with a sudden pop. AAAAAHHH! she screamed as a convulsion of pleasure wracked her body. -------------------------- The voyeurs continued watching the game stats. Her orgasm was rising faster than they ever expected it to. It seemed she had a more sensitive clitoris than most of the predecessors in these houses. Her stress had skyrocketed up too though, probably the presence of the monster. Name: Lily Monroe Date of Birth: 12th February 2008 Occupation: Senior Schoolgirl Clothing: Burgundy Blazer White Blouse Pink Bra Burgundy School Skirt Pink Cotton Panties (Destroyed) Burgundy Tights (Hole torn in crotch) Black Shoes Orgasm: 152% Horniness: 62% Mental Fortitude: 98% Stress: 49% Activated Monsters Fingerman: 6/6 HP Special Attack: 28% charged. Hurry up and charge you bastard! one of the anonymous users screamed into the chatbox. He was referring of course, to the Special Attack meter. A small green bar slowly filled up with a percentage at the end - when it hit 100% the monster would perform a unique attack on the girl which usually left long-term effects that would weaken her for the rest of the game. The man watching picked up his cold beer and took a long sip, fondly recalling the Fungalweed Monster in the Cheerleaders house. The special attack had released spores which poisoned her with some kind of hallucinogenic effect; the poor girl saw her boyfriend in every other monster in the house until it finally wore off. Haha, remember the cheerleader? he typed. LOL! She the one who sucked everything off? XD the first reply came. Whr cn i gett vido? Chk out homepage. Sells for 200 credits, bt u can torrent on pir8bay. His attention drifted back to the assault at hand. He had the monster-eye view maximised on his screen as he watched the schoolgirls soaking slit drip onto the table as a third type of finger approached. It was much more slender this time, and covered in a patchwork of wriggling villi, each no taller than half a centimeter. They seemed to move on their own like seaweed fighting an invisible tide. For a brief second Lilys blush red face appeared on screen, she saw the new finger approaching her wet hole. At first it was hard to tell whether the quick breathing and wide eyes were from nervous terror or excited anticipation. *Shliiiick* The finger slipped inside and her moans betrayed her mood as the latter - she was loving the incredibly skilled assault of this creature, engineered to be the perfect pleasuring machine. They watched as her juices trickled continuously over the table, forming a small puddle around her naked ass cheeks. As the pleasurable attack continued they saw her hips begin to rise and fall - whatever those villi were doing inside her had made her horny enough to almost give in. --------------------- Lily had always thought that the g-spot was a sex myth; much like anal orgasms, true bisexuals and tentacle hentai. It was the stuff of locker room chitchat and dirty humour. The latest pleasurable finger worked to prove her ever so wrong. Less than a minute after it entered her pussy she felt the Fingerman push upwards towards the roof of her fleshy love tunnel. As the villi wriggled across the surface an unfamiliar heat began spreading, less sharp but deeper than that when the sucker was clinging to her clitoris. W-why aaahre you doing this? Mmmm! she groaned, desperately clenching her lips as the dancing villi in her pussy drew her closer and closer to a cathartic climax. There must have been at least a hundred swishing along the finger and brushing up over her newly discovered g-spot. When she was younger she had overheard in the locker room that some girls used their toothbrushes to masturbate. She always thought it was peculiar, Why would anyone want bristles in their pussy? It never did click with her that perhaps they were using the other end, or maybe even a vibrating brush. It didnt matter now, she had felt the Fingermans bristles against her pussy and the tiny seed had been planted in her mind whether she realised it or not - when she escaped from this and got home she would try out her toothbrush against her g-spot. Ahhh. Uhhh Ohhhmmmmm. AAAAAAHHHHHH! It had her now, the relentless molestation sending her spiralling uncontrollably into her first ever orgasm from fingering. She felt her cunt clamp down around the finger inside her, forcing the wiggling villi even closer into that sensitive spot atop her pussy.AH C-C-C-CUMMMMMINNG! she stammered, pushing back on the Fingermans head, trying to get it to leave her hypersensitive cunt. ----------------- Her screams grew louder and louder as the monster persisted. They watched as she broke 200% orgasm and surged forth straight into the 300% territory. This girl wouldnt last long in Diablos mansion - a shame really as he had booked the night off work. With his fingers wrapped around his fat cock he began pumping faster, determined to blow his load before the Fingerman was finished with her. OH MY GOD! OHHH! S-STOP! ITS TOOO SENSITIVE AAHHHHH! She was spasming uncontrollably now as the counter hit 300%, her legs kicking out and her free arm, hammering at the Fingermans head, unafraid of those rows of teeth. Finally it took the finger out of her pussy, letting her collapse back on the table completely drained. Suddenly the restraints around her remaining limbs flopped to the floor, releasing her ankles. The man stopped wanking and quickly began typing furiously into the chatbox. GET THE FINGERMAN OUT OF THERE! Why the fck did he stop?! Pandemonium breaks out as their captive lashes out with her left leg, kicking the Fingerman in the chest and sending him reeling backwards into one of the cupboards.. *Thud* *SMASH* Brass trophies and ceramic plates thundered down over the Fingerman, sending the HP counter on the game ticking down from 6 to 4. The mood of the voyeurs online quickly changed to a more cautious one. Their expensive monster was being beaten! A small group of viewers called for an emergency vote for the Fingerman to retreat deeper into the house where it could hide and ambush her again later. After five seconds the results came in: Continue Molesting: 87.4% Retreat and hide: 12.6% With orders to continue fighting, the Fingerman approached the girl again as she scrambled off the table. It lurched high in the room this time, towering over her, and for a second it looked like the horrific monstrosity had won. Suddenly Lily leapt forward, shoulder barging into the chest of the creature and knocking it back onto the floor again. *Thud* There was a veritable frenzy now as they watched the teen sitting on the Fingermans lap punching it repeatedly in the face with her bare hands. It was a fairly tough devil - but it wouldnt hold out being abused like that. A second vote was called and the viewers frantically cast their ballots. VOTES: -Continue molesting: 34.8% -Retreat and hide: 65.2% The screen flashed, showing the final vote tally in green numbers. With that the Fingerman swung to the right, tipping the girl to the side and prancing on its nimble feet out of the dining room. One of its long arms curled around the door, slamming it shut behind it. It took several more minutes before the schoolgirl was able to catch her breath and stand back on her feet. The viewers watched as she instinctively reached under her skirt for her abused pussy. What the fuck was that thing?! Aww, crap my panties she whispered in a mixture of despair and fear. Her chest heaved as she examined the dangling leather belts from the table, Oh Melody, I hope youre safe Im gonna find you, I promise. The stats window in the lower right hand corner of their screens now read: Name: Lily Monroe Date of Birth: 12th February 2008 Occupation: Senior Schoolgirl Clothing: Burgundy Blazer White Blouse Pink Bra Burgundy School Skirt Pink Cotton Panties (Destroyed) Burgundy Tights (Hole torn in crotch) Black Shoes Orgasm: 312% Horniness: 43% Mental Fortitude: 86% Stress: 53% Activated Monsters Fingerman: 2/6 HP (HIDING) Special attack: 89% charged. They watched as Lily began creeping towards the kitchen door at the far side of the room. It seemed the terrified teen had absolutely no intention of pursuing the Fingerman into the hall. As she entered the kitchen the viewers began switching their cameras to the hidden ones rigged up in the corners of the kitchen ceiling. For such an opulent manor the kitchen itself was rather narrow. Dusty cupboards and antique appliances lined the walls on either side, leaving scarcely half a meter to shuffle from one side to the other in. At the back corner of the room a single window, barely big enough to squeeze an arm though, allowed a sliver of daylight into the hellish house. Several new options flashed onto their screen, offering the viewers a chance to continue putting pressure on the poor schoolgirl. Lock Kitchen Door - 250 credits Unleash the Scuttling Swarm - 600 credits Kill the Lights - 300 credits Reveal the poisoned food - 200 credits Almost immediately upon stepping into the cramped cookery the girls eyes stung upon a rack of sharp knives displayed upon an old pinewood chopping board. They watched as she fumbled around with them until she snatched the largest one she could find in her hands, wielding it as a weapon. Thisll do she muttered to herself as her attention shifted to the drawers. *Creeeak* *Thud* *Creeeak* *Thud* None of them seemed to contain anything she deemed to be useful to her endeavours to rescue her sister from the clutches of this mysterious manor. As she opened a final drawer beside the long-defunct refrigerator she saw something, a glittering glass circle that gleamed against the single ray of sunlight beaming through the tiny window. She picked them up a battery-powered torch, holding it under the ray of sunlight and quickly testing it. It worked, casting a sharp beam across the room, Great, I can check around upstairs now, the schoolgirl spoke to herself. There was a sudden flash of orange text overlaying the computer screen, *LILY HAS ACQUIRED A FLASHLIGHT AND A BUTCHERS KNIFE* Very few Anons had been voting while their target scoured the kitchen. The Scuttling Swarm had seen a lot of action in previous games and had proven somewhat less effective than they initially hoped it would be. The promise of poisoned food was a new thing - it was most likely an incredibly powerful aphrodisiac that would render her incapable doing little more than spreading her legs and plunging the first phallic object she could find into her drenched cunt. Uninspired by the options before them, and wary of increasing Lilys stress any further the viewers held off, watching as the timid girl stepped out of the kitchen, returning to the dining room and placing her hand upon the hallway doors handle. *Click* *Creak* The door creaked open as she pulled the handle down. Lily now found herself standing in the lonely hallway from earlier. It was eerily silent with no trace of the lurking monster that had fingered her ever having passed through. Perhaps the front door would be open too? she wondered, quickly running forward and rattling the handle. *Rattle* She shook it quickly, tugging sharply against the heavy wooden slab; but it was no good. The door was solidly locked. Shit she whispered under her breath. Her heart was beginning to race now, adrenaline pumping through her veins as she debated where she should go next. Her torch meant she could go upstairs, alternatively there was still the door she hadnt checked out on her left. After debating for a minute she decided to head through the unidentified door. *Clack* Her heart sank as it refused to budge; another locked door. Shit she whispered, turning around. She had barely reached the base of the stairs when she heard a near-inaudible moan escape from the locked room. The hair at the back of her neck stood at end - she recognised the voice. Rushing back over to the door she pressed her ear against the solid wood, Ohh Mmm P-please ohhhhhhh! Melody! Is that you?! Open up Im here for you! Theres a monster running around out here! Mmm ahh f-fuck MELODY! Can you hear me?! Ahh ahhh AHHhhhh! the moans from within the room grew louder with each passing second. Shit! Hang on! Im getting you out of there, sis! Lily spun around, scouring the hallway for any sign of keys that could release her sister. In a frantic flurry she bombed back into the dining room, flinging open cabinets and sending the fragile contents within crashing to the filthy floor. ""Where's the fucking key?!"" she bargained angrily with God. Her rampage led her into the adjoining kitchen where she fruitlessly shattered several pieces of crockery in her aggressive hunt. ""Ahh! Not my little asshole! Ohhh... fuck!"" Melody's lyrical voice hollered over the cacophony of chaos composed by Lily. With the downstairs floor completely searched Lily hurried back to the base of the dark stairwell, gazing up into the pitch abyss. *click* A brilliant sword of light shone from the flashlight, slicing into the thick darkness of the upstairs landing. Concern for her sister trumped her growing fears as Lily bounded ahead into the unknown. Five wicked closed doors ominously blocked her paths into the other rooms. As she swung her torch around she settled on the closest one straight ahead, reaching out with adrenaline-fuelled fingers. --------------- Name: Lily Monroe Date of Birth: 12th February 2008 Occupation: Senior Schoolgirl Clothing: Burgundy Blazer White Blouse Pink Bra Burgundy School Skirt Pink Cotton Panties (Destroyed) Burgundy Tights (Hole torn in crotch) Black Shoes Orgasm: 312% Horniness: 43% Mental Fortitude: 86% Stress: 53% Activated Monsters Fingerman: 2/6 HP (In Parlour) Special attack: 100% charged. The voyeur watched the girl progress through the trapped manor with alarming success. She had picked the door to the study where she would find the key to rescue her sister. A torrential waterfall of ideas cascaded down the scrolling chat log. Final consensus eventually emerging that they should save their credits to buy a second monster or trap later. *click* He tapped his left finger as the cursor hovered over a glowing box reading ""Camera 43."" Nearly instantly his screen flicked over to a pallid parlour with two figures closely entwining with each other. The detailed bio for the girl flashed and changed from Lily to Melody. Name: Melody Monroe Date of Birth: 21st March 2003 Occupation: Trainee Beautician Sexual Biography: Heterosexual Seven prior boyfriends. Has had intercourse with 3 of them. Currently dating guy named Jack for 2 weeks now. Clothing: Black Bra (half off) Orgasm: 776% Horniness: 89% Mental Fortitude: 4% Stress: 63% The Fingerman was dangling the nearly nude girl upside down by left ankle. Her clothes had long since been torn apart by the other horrors of the house that had milked her mounds and pummelled her pussy. Her last shred of dignity lay in a black bra that dangled precariously from her shoulder, barely covering her left breast. The right hand of the wicked creature was jack hammering her soaking pussy with two agile fingers. The quick motions elicited a series of loudening screams from Melody - each bang against her g-spot making her orgasm meter rise by a couple of points. ""Ahhh! S-sttooooop! T-t-too sensitive! Ohhhh! Fuck! Fuck! My pussy is burning! Ahhhhhh! The man licked his lips eagerly and clicked on the Fingerman and opening a drop down menu. Among the multitude of options and commands he picked, ""Activate Special Attack: The Shocker."" ""It's time to break this bitch,"" he typed into the chatbox. In the spur of the moment he was joined by a cacophony of fellow perverts, all voting with him to activate the special attack. A few seconds later it had passed with 94.2% voting in favour. The Fingerman briefly paused its attack on her pussy before withdrawing its hand and extending the fifth digit on its hand and lining it up with her tight, puckered asshole. The other two fingers began pressing up against her puffy vulva; it was glistening with a sticky wetness. She was nearly broken, after this attack the slut would do whatever she could to feel more pleasure. ""N-no... N-*gasp* Not my ass! Noooo! Ohhh fuckkk! As ahhhh! Ugh! Uh! Uh! Ohhhh!"" The Fingerman unleashed its powerful finisher on the quivering girl sending her hips spasming and toes curling. In the bottom corner of the screen the voyeurs saw a tiny camera implanted in the hand of the monster. Each time it thrusted into her cunt they were greeted with a moist, fleshy image of her abused pussy. From this angle they could see tiny tentacles extending from the edges of the Fingerman's digits to stroke and stimulate her glistening vaginal walls. ""AHHHHH! FUCK! UGH! NOOOO! I'M GONNA CUM! I'M CUMMMMMING!! EEEYYYYAAAAAAHHHH!"" Melody's thighs clenched together, blood rushing to her head as she was dangled upside down. The perverts watching saw her twist and shake, her fingers digging into the heavy woolen fabric of the carpeted floor. A split second later a geyser of clear fluid gushed from her pussy, squirting up across the Fingerman's arm. ""AHHHHHHH!!! HYAAAAAA! STOOOOP! AAAAAHHHHHHH UUUUGGHHHH!"" Her body thrashed violently while her asshole clenched and rippled around the finger wriggling inside. When her orgasmic contractions finally subsided her limp body slumped to the carpet she had soaked with her own juices. Bold red letters flashed at the centre of the screen: 'MELODY BROKEN!'"

This story is extremely graphic and, rightfully, at any time can be removed for it's content. This is the kind of story that won't give you a single nightmare. It will give you at least several. Although this story may sicken you more than it does scare you. What scares me is that stories like these are unusually kept quiet. Unusually the norm. Which it shouldn't be. We get too used to shootings and various murders in everyday towns we even use the term, *everyday* or *at least once a year* right before *a mass shooting* or *another terrorist bombing.* The voices breathing behind you at night and the shadows that move toward you in your sleep are simply your imagination. I'm terrified at the things that go on in this world and they are not imagination. Our thoughts are much kinder than that. I know I am taking a certain risk faking a removal before it actually can very well happen and lying through my teeth about that announcement but nobody would allow it if they should see *what* this is, yet I want more people to *be aware of it.* I am taking a much bigger risk going into certain details that tarry with me wherever I go, and it's only natural I provide some outlet of this experience, no matter how inappropriate or shocking it may be. It might even be illegal to post this. If I'm lucky, I'll get a slap on the wrist. If not, well... it's been a pleasure sending that first reader this message. What is this all about you may ask? An awareness of something... and someone disgusting and I hesitate to say who and what. I cannot say her name but know that I had worked with her for years in several charities and organizations. Her YouTube channel (which I cannot give) is filled with her rants against sexual advances on women and how she works to put a stop to them. She is slightly masculine, which makes for the first impression that she must be a lesbian. I can kind of find that impression homophobic in that general area of cliched expectations with prejudice, all based on appearance. She sure kept up that appearance... In high school we both worked at the same job. She and I both worked multiple jobs, as the rent never matches the pay. That was an issue in which she helped me through on countless occasions. But I can tell she really gets creative with her YouTube show, as it went on her budget increased. On her show she even brought people to her studio. I never imagined that her being such an obscure content creator could partner with YouTube and actually have that to add as an income. She also has given some of her money to charity on live stream. She had real passion when she would speak. I know some people who can talk your ear off on a topical issue, and yet you know that they just want to gossip. They don't care, and it shows. With her, there is a real sincerity there and several abused women have come forward as guests on her show each with open arms as she would embrace her and her staff would take her and give her the emotional and mental support she needed. I was lucky to work with her a little and at one time or another, I would find myself congratulating these women as I held them and they each tearfully thanked me. I understand these women, they are never truly victims unless they continue to believe that they are. We have keep fighting. We are always fighters. Always survivors. Never victims. Never again. She taught me that... I was one of those women. I trusted her, too. It must have been painful for her to go through the past and bring up that she was raped when she was barely a teenager. She lived in a dangerous neighborhood with a lot of criminal activity, but it wasn't some criminal or gang member that raped her. It was the police. I remember she said she was walking home from school and a squad car followed her home. They forced her, even pulled theirs guns on her. They handcuffed her, tasered her, and then raped her right there in the backseat of that police car while the other kept watch. Her parents were both drug addicts, and barely gave her the time of day. She said her dad got arrested a long time ago and her mom was always on the couch, sleeping from drinking or passed out from an overdose. Every time she'd try to talk with her she was asleep and when she woke up startled she would just scream at her face, always accusing her of something unintelligible. She hated her life. She wanted to end it, but something kept her going. I know what it is now. What kept her going all those years. To this day I wish she hadn't told me. In my own case a guy was harassing me at work and I wanted to quit that job, but I had to keep going. Every day at work he would ask me horrible sexual favors and I learned to simply ignore him. He made rude jokes and sexist comments all the time. My live-in boyfriend at the time got irritated and texted me whenever I had to work an extended shift, and I wasn't paid overtime. However, before I broke up with him I got pregnant. We had a big fight and he acted like a jerk. I remember staying at a friends place and never wanting to go back home for hours. I didn't want him to know. I remember my friend telling me the best thing to do was to just give the baby up. I remember holding it in my hands. It was tough to say goodbye. Recently she and I spoke out about both of our own allegations during the ""Me Too"" movement and since then I wanted to open up on how something like I'm going to tell you was possible. If women everywhere are no longer afraid to speak what atrocities befell them, I should do no different to go further. It's not just us that seem our voice go unheard. There are much smaller voices that sadly seem to falls on deaf ears. However, I again hesitate to say this so I must ask that you prepare yourself before the following. It sickens me so much that I seriously want you to feel the same. I can't go on alone. I will never forget the day she had me come over to a new place she wanted to use as a ""studio"" and to bring something over she gave to me to hold on to as a friend months ago. I had in my apartment for awhile now and all this time I had simply forgotten about it. It was a messy, large dark green hiking backpack. It's a bit heavy to carry. When she called me over, she said for me to never disclose any names or locations. She also told me to never, under any circumstances, open the bag. At our town a long, long ways off there is a section of the city that is out of business. Signs like ""For Lease"" and realtor ads are posted everywhere. Stores windows are boarded up, and some look like they never finished being fumigated. Graffiti like ""Thanks Obama!"" and ""Make America Great Again!"" graced both the walls and the glass windows. The ones that aren't broken, anyway. There it is. A thin hotel squished in the middle of two buildings. It too, had a ""For Lease"" sign. I give it that the realtors simply gave up. First, there's the entrance. It's guarded by these large bouncers who resemble 800-pound gorillas. Yes, they wore black suits and sunglasses. And yes, they were armed. The idea of one of them chasing me down after figuring out I'm a squealer still gives me nightmares. I am a coward. I once thought I was strong. When you approach them, you must give them your membership card. Membership cards vary, from the regular white card which I had received to even enter in the first place, to the shiny gold card that allows you to be a full patron. Patrons are able to enjoy the... things that go on in there in full. I'm sorry. I feel sick again. Each card has a serial number embossed and a chip like a credit card, along with an image of a simple outline of a woman in the same seductive pose you see on every trucker's bumper sticker. A very small woman. She reminded me of me. I stand at 4'7"". The lobby is just like a grand hotel. I kept looking around for a bellboy to carry my things but I had to deliver this backpack myself. She told me that I must do this for her. At the time, I wanted to help her. Paying it forward was how I put it. Upstairs, there are more bouncers. This time holding their guns out to their sides. One of them wolf-whistled at me but I couldn't say or do anything in my defense for fear of literally being target practice. Holding the heavy strap of the hiking backpack, I simply had to keep walking. When men have guns... Ignoring them, I made it through the double doors and into what looked like an abandoned cafeteria. I take one of the elevators at the center of the room to the left and hit the fifth floor. It was a bar and lounge area. The upholstery was in mint condition. Not a speck of dust anywhere. The air was hazy. There were fancy gold lamps on small tables and I was confused at the smell. It led to a stage where a brass band was playing swing. The tempo was slow and a bit clumsy. I knew they weren't professional musicians. They were just there for atmosphere. Then for a minute I froze where I stood. There were children dressed up as what can only be described as ""classy"". The boys were only wearing a top hat, platform shoes and black dress pants that cut open in the front and back, flapping open whenever they moved. A small shiny black bow tie was around their necks, tight. The girls were actually topless as well and I saw their underdeveloped nipples bruised from what I can sadly guess from constant twisting and abuse. The girls also had a small black mini-skirt, platform sandals, and they as well had a small top hat and bow tie. I warned that this story will sicken you. I saw a girl bend over and I realized in shock that these girls are not wearing anything under their skirt. The same went for the boys. They had them dressed in provocative clothing without underwear. Keep in mind that these children were all around the ages of 8 to 12. Typing this makes my fingers feel too heavy. They had make-up on and even in the dim lights I saw their facial expressions. They didn't have any. They didn't smile. They didn't show fear. They could only feel nothing. A feeling I got all too familiar with years ago. They were serving as waiters and waitresses. The patrons were sitting in their chairs, stretching their arms out to grab at them. I was startled when I saw one man in his late forties flip a 10-year-old's skirt and pull her close to him. She wobbled as she tried to keep her balance with a the flimsy click-clack of her platform sandals as her little feet were too small to stay in the large straps, so she began to fall towards him. He caught her, and pulled her closer and closer to his waiting mouth. I felt so cold and so sick at the moment I shut my eyes tightly. After hearing some slurping, I heard him say ""she's a wet one, ain't she? Ya she is! Look at that little pussy go!"" I heard the disgusting man spit and jeer about the small girl before him. I can't, but I have to finish this story. It's why I took this risk. To tell you in the first place. That this place is real. That these are sick people. Real people. Really. Sick. People. And to painfully tell you that these are also real children. I looked past that couch to my left and saw a scrawny young man walk slowly into the bar. He had dirty blonde hair that looked like bed hair, as it stuck up in the air like he had just rubbed a balloon on his head for the static electricity effect I learned as a child. His face was thin and his big green eyes were sunken and bulging. He sat a bit tentatively and waited. A shy, timid little 9-year-old waiter came up to him and he picked up the little boy in his arms. He pulled his own pants down and stroked the child's chest a bit as the other hand was buried in between his legs before he looked around in a panic. There was a real fear in his eyes. He trembled. He put his hand away. Pulled the other hand out. Pulled up his pants. Put the child down. And he ran. I heard the door slam and then I saw a bit of a stir with the bouncers on their cell phones. After exactly 4 minutes I was startled to hear a very, very loud sound. A small earthquake happened. The walls must be paper thin. It shook the entire lounge. The kids all ducked and held their hands to their heads. It was like an explosion. Then when it settled, everyone slowly rose up. The little waiter got back up, dusted himself off, and walked over to the next patron with his large serving plate. The music stopped and then I saw this masked man walk onstage. He was dressed in a full tuxedo, in keeping with the fashion of the theme at this disreputable place. He held a microphone in his hands and then he said the following. ""I want thank you all for coming here, and I hope that little shake-up we just had a little earlier,"" he said with a bit of laughter, ""didn't ruin your pleasant experience here at our lovely establishment. Am I right down there?"" One fat man previously snoring on the couch said, ""Sure gave me a bit of a fright, but now that I'm awake I can enjoy the company,"" as he fell back to sleep while two little girls lay down around his lap like a harem. ""Come on! Bring on the little ladies!"" shouted the slurping man from earlier. ""Good, good. Because if it didn't already, I'd like to ""shake things up a bit"" with our next act. She's ready, willing, and this is her first time so let's give a big warm welcome to McKenzie."" And there she was, a lithe red-headed girl about 7 or 8 years old. Dressed in a sparkled gold sleeveless sequin dress and glittery gold high heels, McKenzie was a girl who looked just like me when I was around her age. Petite, with a few freckles on her cheeks and also a hint of nobility in her proud posture before she held the microphone and started singing. She wasn't a great singer, but I could tell she was trying. The music was smooth, slow. It was relaxing to hear, but the lyrics to her song made my skin crawl. &gt;Little girls are so delicious. &gt;Just once bite is so nutritious. &gt;We are not at all suspicious. &gt;At all your disgusting wishes. &gt;We will wiggle like the fishes. &gt;Ready to be served on dishes. &gt;If you give me more than kisses. &gt;I'm prepared to be your missus. With each verse she would remove an article of clothing until she was stripped completely naked. With one verse she slowly stepped out of her heels and the next she kicked off her dress and as it flew from her tiny bare foot it landed on the fat man as he lay snoring. She then knelt down on her knees and attempted to start masturbating in front of the crowd of onlookers, stopping abruptly. With that the song ended. A large bed was on stage as the stage lights hit it into our view, dimming the rest of the room. The little naked McKenzie lay down on it, facing upward as stiff as a board. She slowly opened her legs. The small audience cheered as men and some women shouted at McKenzie and chanted to the masked man. ""Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck her!"" I knew what was going to happen next, but when I made a motion to run onto the stage to put a stop to this, I froze when I saw the bouncers glaring at me, as they held their gun holsters. The masked man who was onstage came over to her, pulling down his dress pants. He put a knee at the edge of the bed and there were cameras positioned everywhere so you can see all the angles. I forgot to tell you this club featured large LCD screens all over the place ""showing the action."" If this ""action"" is something you are comfortable with or even enjoy, you are no longer human. I know this breaks online rules of comments and death threats, but if you really enjoy something like this, I honestly hope someone kills you... and I hope you feel every minute of it. That man... molested McKenzie in front of all of us... .... .... .... .... ....I'm so sorry, McKenzie. I didn't stop him.... .... .....couldn't. .... I-I failed you, I...... ..... The camera zoomed in and when I looked away to face another screen that showed a small amount of clear white liquid trickle down her thighs and onto the floor below her and proceeded to drip down as though the edge of the bed were crying tears. I stood in absolute shock before any semblance of a thought of action was possible. I raised my tiny purse to my chin and proceeded to throw up inside. I didn't eat much, so it spattered some like a sneeze. I had to do something. But what? The fat man was still asleep. I now had an idea. I leaned over to take his gold card, but then something surprised me. One of the little girls at his side actually handed me over his gold membership card. Now that I have it... Suddenly it hit me. ""Wait!"" I yelled at the top of my lungs. Everyone looked in my direction. The crowd silenced. McKenzie was clearly scared. The man rose from the bed and turned to face me. He seemed to know who I was. He first looked at the backpack in my hands, then scanned his gaze up to mine. Then when he saw my gold card he had a confused look on his face. Probably because he knew someone gave me the white one, and he knew I had somehow taken this gold one. ""I want a turn with her backstage,"" I held up my gold card and began to wave it in the air. The perverted crowd of child-sex offenders gave approving moans, as they collectively were engaged with various waiters and waitresses. Even a nearby bouncer looked at me with an unsettling smile. ""Sure, go on back! Enjoy yourself."" He said, looking one more time at the backpack he asked me to bring. I ran to the side curtains and bolted for it. The area backstage was dimly lit with some fold-up chairs scattered around the cold hard cement floor. I saw little McKenzie sitting in her chair, sniffing back sobs as another girl who may be 8 or 9 years old held her hand and told her she did a good job. Sadly, I took notice of her, with a black eye and some bruises all over her shoulders . ""It was worse with my first time"", I believe she said, ""they didn't like it when I tried to get away. That's why they hurt me."" When the girl saw me she brushed her hands on McKenzie's knee, ""Just hang in there, McKenzie. Okay?"" McKenzie began to speak for the first time. All she said was, ""I think I might be okay now. Thank you, Sheri."" Then she looked at my face. Sheri's voice was braking and she stuttered. ""Don't.... Please don't...."" With that, Sheri slowly left the two of us alone. When I was alone with McKenzie, she looked up at me. All I thought of was the horrendous things she just went through, right in front of my eyes no less on big screens for everyone to see! I had so much hatred for those men and women, and that masked man in particular. ""Oh, it's you. You're the lady who wants me to..."" Onstage, and in the lounge the children had to hold everything back. They had to be machines. Only here could they let it all out. Only back here could they remind themselves that they were human. She was finally showing emotion, and they were ones I knew. Fear. Disgust. Self-loathing. Confusion. And the strongest feelings I'm sure were sadness and betrayal. I stood in front of her, putting the backpack down on the floor. ""Can I just sit here with you?"" The girl nodded her head. I know what she went though, right in front of my eyes. Why didn't I stop it from happening? Maybe that's why I deserve what happens in the end. I look at her for a long time before I spoke again. She wasn't facing me. She was more interested in the wall. ""You know, years ago I got pregnant and had to..."" I looked away from her. ""I gave the... baby up for adoption..."" She was looking at me and I felt I was finally breaking some ground. Now I knew my story was worth finishing. ""I was young and I was so scared. I didn't know what to do... or who to turn to... or anything..."" She kept listening. It felt so cold in that room. ""McKenzie I.... I want to tell you something. Something important."" ""What?,"" she asked, turning to look directly at me. I brought my hand to one of her cheeks and moved a finger across. I looked straight as her. ""I'm your mother McKenzie. I know that face. I know who you are. You are my daughter."" She shook her head, and began to ever so slightly tremble. Then her eyes became gentle. When I saw them, I only saw my little girl. I heard her too, and I will never forget they way her eyes shone as she gave her first excited whisper. ""....what took you so long?"" My body moved on it's own, as I approached the small girl and stretched out my arms. Some things can't be said with words. I will not attempt to put them here. Bending down to my knees, I grabbed her. I held her small frame in those same hands that held my baby years ago. ""I..... I'm so sorry McKenzie. It's my fault. It's my fault you...."" I broke down and cried, *hard.* Her defenses lowered, she was finally able to be a child again. ""Mommy,"" she spoke, ""can I call you mommy?"" .....""Yes, dear."" I said in between sniffles as I wiped my face. ""You found me. So everything is okay."" ""You're right McKenzie. Everything is alright now. I have you. I'm not letting go."" ""...You did once. You didn't want to be my mommy any-"" ""I want to be your mommy now... And I said I'm not letting go, remember? You heard me McKenzie... I'm not letting go."" Tears rolled down my cheeks as I choked out the words. The little girl wrapped her small arms back around my waist. ""Forever and ever. I should have loved you the minute I heard I was pregnant. Every day I would hold you in my arms just like I am now."" ""Can you keep holding me, mommy?"" She asked, as though I ever held anything tighter or closer to me in my life. I didn't answer her. I just kept holding. My child. I'm so sorry you had to wait for me to love you, but now you can stop waiting. I held this cold, shivering girl in my arms, barely understanding that this would be my only time with her. McKenzie and I felt motherly love for the first time, as we took it in like a flower greeting the warmth of it's first sun. Not knowing what a sun is, flowers still feel the heat of a quiet light. They do not need to know what it is. They simply need to *feel.* She could feel the love I have for her nourish her very soul to the core. It would have to last a little longer, but this moment was a small eternity. A small eternity which, like water slipping through my fingers, spills and trickles aside without ever once staying. She is finally loved. *Why wasn't she earlier?* We simply held each other, neither ever wanting to let go. As though a wind were about to blow the two of us away at any moment. Broken and sorrowful, I was also filled with the precious belated joy of what I once thought to myself to be so silly, the simple joy of being a mother. In this one moment, we were finally a family. The other girl, who I had just noticed come in, kept a straight face until she saw me hold McKenzie. That was when she lost it. As they who never once let any of those men have the satisfaction of their real emotions, after all the disgusting abuse they went through, both of these brave young women... were choking back tears. I could see her bruised and broken body come close to me, and I felt so sad just looking at her. I knew these men damaged her body and soul. Then she asked me something. ""C-can you be my mommy, too? I lost my real mommy a long time ago. People took me away and I never stayed anywhere. They always took me away from nice families and made me stay in bad ones. Then they took me here."" There were never enough tears rolling down my cheeks. I freed my other arm and brought it over to Sheri. I held them both close as I also saw a red light glare my eyes briefly. All I could do is comfort them. I didn't want either to know the truth. I did hold a baby in my hands. A stillborn. I think she would be 22 today. McKenzie and Sheri... they needed someone. Someone in this terrifying place. I just wanted to give these poor girls a mother, if only for a day. McKenzie deserved that much. Sheri deserved as much. All of these children did. I lost my child years ago, but I could be a mother of two today. ""Of course I can be your mommy. I love you too, Sheri."" She rested her heavy little head on my small shoulder. I never felt so large and powerful. I kissed her and then another red flash hit my eyes. Then suddenly I felt big strong hands easily grabbed me as they pried me away from McKenzie and Sheri. A bouncer. Then I see the fat man get up and he walks over to me, grabs the card from my hands, and asks, ""Where did you get this, bitch?"" I said nothing. Another bouncer bend down to pick up the backpack that was laying on the floor. The fat man looked at it and then looked back at me. ""You know you were supposed to give this thing to the boss, right? Let me take you to 'em."" They march me away from McKenzie and the others as they cried and cried. ""Aw, shut up! Get dressed and start serving our guests. Whiny little cunts..."" I was crying too, that was the last time I ever saw McKenzie. I'll never forget the look of new fear and new vulnerability on her face as I left. I heard them hiccup and sob as I was led upstairs. There was one door. One room. They knocked on the door and then someone let us inside. A cold and quiet tear froze my face as my mind was stuck on and continuing to play out in my head this one single phrase. *How could she?* I saw the woman sitting at her desk. It was her. The woman I started this post talking about. I also saw the masked man take off his mask and when he did I did recognize him. He worked with me when we assisted children in a community center. He was standing there with this woman and I knew they were both social workers in the foster care system. I remember from volunteering all the time to help them. They needed my credit card from time to time and I signed a few forms for them to help them with their children's programs. I wondered why they were there. ""Where's our money? We brought these kids in for you and it was hard. Really hard. A few years of moving paperwork, keeping our noses clean and keeping the heat off our backs is enough work in and of itself, but we had to be REAL social workers! We went to school, we got licences to work with children. Hell, we both had background checks and had to take courses on preventing child abuse. For fucks sake, I had to give up membership to your club for that one!"" Then the woman spoke, ""Do you have our money or not?"" The woman at the desk chuckled and said, ""Patience, patience. I got your money, it's on its way."" She looked at me and saw me with the backpack. She smiled at me. I don't like her smiles anymore. ""It's right here,"" she said, pointing to me. The bouncer took the backpack from me and slammed it onto her desk. The bouncer unzipped the backpack and everyone in the office saw its contents. Money. ""Is 2 million dollars enough?"" Money... the one thing that can solve all my problems, paid to ensure the children's problems. Both of them zipped it back up, and were about to walk out of the office before I cried in desperation, ""Please! Please I beg you to take these children back and place them in homes! Don't let him keep them here!"" I was frantic now, but for some odd reason the bouncer let me continue. ""I know both of you, I worked with you all these years. Please! If that time means anything to you at all, then you have to let the children go!"" I enunciated the following, "" *You have to let them go.* "" They both looked at me with a hint of sadness. Then they turned away. I guess there was still good in them, but they weren't good enough to give up 2 million dollars. After she payed the corrupt foster system they left, then the woman told the bouncer, ""you can go, I need to speak with her alone."" ""Okay, boss"" the bouncer said. After I heard the door close, the woman began to laugh. ""Hello again. I never did doubt that you can make it here on your own. After all, I didn't I tell you how strong of a woman you are?"" It's shameful. She was once the only friend I really had. So any more connections I have with the world are through her. My new friends, for example, are people she is just as familiar with as I am. Some of those friends have children that she hasn't taken a fancy to yet. I do not want to take that chance. I sort of already am with posting this, but with any luck, it could also be removed, reported, and I am anonymous. I wish to remain that way. I don't know how else to put it. I had had real respect for her. I trusted her. We had been volunteering together since 2014. I had opened up to her, and she betrayed me. She was determined to end exploitation and violence against women but all this time had no problem doing the same to children. Saying she betrayed me makes me feel selfish. I cannot imagine how much she betrayed those children. However, she still puts on her own mask. Adored and comforting to her listeners and YouTube subscribers, she doesn't have as many as you'd think, but she is responsive to comments and puts on the act that she is a completely different person. Like she is the person I have known for years. *Not the person I now know she has been all this time.* She is slime. Yet, people admire her. So in this sense, nobody could tell the difference. She assumed all people are idiots. She thrived on that. How else could she have gotten away with a secret so revolting and so despicable? In fact, the thought of her boisterous outcries against injustice and rights for abused women, in its marvelously shameless hypocrisy, makes me feel nauseous. I still want to vomit yet my throat's well has already recently been emptied. I still can't believe it. She actively runs a child pornography empire. No matter what she did, or what she said, or what she stood for, it's all gone! It doesn't matter! Nothing changes the fact that this woman needs to be either behind bars or in a grave. ""LET THESE CHILDREN GO YOU INHUMAN MONSTER!!!"" She was calm, and after a second or two of an unspoken staring contest she then proceeded to go on about how she kept this from me all these years, and how hard it was for her not to laugh in my face every time she felt he needed to ""empower"" me. I was going to strangle her neck but as I leaned forward she stopped me dead when she slapped 2 photos on the desk. A couple of photos I don't remember being taken... until I remember the red flashes to my eye. It was 2 photos of me holding McKenzie and Sheri. The other was me kissing Sheri. If taken out of context, it could look like I am using these poor girls the way the rest of the club does. It was jeopardizing enough to warrant an explanation or I simply needed to destroy the pictures. ""I heard what happened back there. It was very touching. I almost felt something."" She wouldn't wipe that grin off her damn face, ""Too bad this will be uploaded, sent, and with my help, it will make sure to keep your mouth shut since you have been upgraded to our gold card. If you wanted it so fucking bad you should at least pay for it. Now I know you don't play with the children like we do but there are rules and you still have to keep them. After all, none of this is free. Membership is $5,000 each month. I took the liberty of paying for the rest of this year. It's my insurance that you be a member of this club or else... I can't use it when I testify. And speaking of insurance..."" She actually gave a monologue. ""There is your old credit card, it is what payed for many of our expenses, and all of this is in your name. All of what you saw today didn't just materialize from thin air. Now, we are technically not supposed to be here as we did not in fact, pay this lease. This is temporary. However, I found a much better location with much more children and understaffed shelters. My job will be to offer my employees to assist them. After all, they need the help. Don't they?"" Her smirk twisted my innards as I clenched my fist. I was ready to punch her. I am small, but I know how to bring on the pain. I wanted to bring her down... but I can't. I also can't tell you. The reason I cannot disclose who she is is because I now know where she gets the children. Because I've worked there. Because she blackmailed me I can't go to the police, I can't go to child services (I saw that at least 2 people work with her) and I can't tell my friends or family because then she would expose this place with me as a financier. She even had a shot of me bringing in the money backpack. ""But here's the thing. If we are exposed I can't hide from all this. So if you bring me down, we both enjoy that same ride."" She was still smiling. ""Those children... should no longer be victims-"" Her smile dissipated. It was replaced with a scowl. Her eyes became wide and her countenance pierced me to my center, making sure to display her dominance. ""You want to play the victim card, huh? You all like to, do you? Yes, all women! You want to be the next Maya Angelou and sing in your little fucking cage and expect everyone to be fucking moved to tears by it! You want me to say it!?! Want me to spell this out for you you cunt! YOU WERE NOT THE ONE WHO GOT RAPED!"" It was at this point when I realized she had lost it. ""You think we were all victims? That using ""Me Too"" as a solidarity movement suddenly makes everyone on equal grounds? Fuck no! You have no idea how infuriating it is to hear you and other women equate themselves to someone who has been suffering for years. You think just because someone flirted with you at work, you are right with me as a ""sister"" when I talk about how horrific my rape was. Might as well interrupt Shabana Basij-Rasikh's talk on overcoming the traumas she experienced in her life with a Kardashian complaining about a hangnail. You cheapen the real issues with that line of thinking you bitch!"" For a brief moment I understood her rant. Do we compare matches with torches? The same burns? I hoped I had a good response, because I said it anyway. ""So you think having these children exploited is your perfect outlet? Does this make you better than the men who raped you?"" ""Yes. Because I honor my family. I honor my father who ran this club and he passed it onto me while he was sent to rot in prison. I was at a low point, but I knew I have no place in this world as a women. But here....here is where I have control and know when a world favors friendly voices. My voice was screaming, and no one was listening for more than a day because there is always a new distraction. I tried to speak up before but everyone was too busy doing the fucking ice bucket challenge! This club, this establishment, exists solely because people are too distracted to see a real business."" I had enough! If I wasn't going to get through to her, or at least kill her, I had to leave. I stood up and reached my arm for the doorknob. She instantly stood from her chair, and grabbed my arm before I tried to leave. ""These children are not victims. They are workers. You wouldn't want them out of a job, would you? You wouldn't want to be responsible for what happens to them after they are out of my hands? Who would be the one who make them victims then?"" She let me go and I was never happier to shut a door in my entire life. I left the place, walking through the poor children. I didn't see McKenzie or Sheri anywhere. I went down the elevator, went through the lobby, and went outside. It took me just about 4 minutes, exactly. That was when I saw it. A car was in shambles, black, and smoking with fragments of metal and some remnants of flesh smeared against the asphalt. A cab was waiting for me. The driver got out and pointed at the wreck. He had a thick Eastern-European accent, struggling to speak English. ""See that? A pipe bomb exploded. Now you aren't going to... how-you-say? 'Be a nark' or tell anyone anything about this place or the one under my car goes off. I am sorry, but I don't want to lose this job, and I don't want to lose my life. So please keep the quiet. Okay?"" Bending down, I saw that the bottom of the car did in fact have a pipe bomb underneath. I saw them under all the cars in the lot. Every one of them could go off. Scared for my life, I kept to myself the ride back to my apartment. My tiny purse was crusted with dried vomit and tears. When I was home, I went straight for the stove and set the gas on and off in the kitchen. For a good second or so I was breathing in the fumes. Then it hit me. I realized I do not want to die. I want the world to die. Kill this world. Kill everyone. All of it. We have to die. Make us extinct. Both the predators and the prey. It is hatred that has kept this world the way things have been all these years, and it is hatred that will finally set us free. Set those children free. Free from living in this world they call hell. I know there are good people too who will read this with as must disgust and shock as I have had writing it. You want to, desperately want to help them. I have to be realistic and say that you cannot simply free all children in the world from human trafficking. You can't stop this any more than I can. But please... Please set me free. Every time I close my eyes, I can still see their faces, and they frighten me. Frighten me because I cannot comfort them, as a mother. I can't comfort anyone, really. I actually need someone to comfort me. Why am I the one who has to see these children and has to look each straight in the eye? In that darkest corner of my mind which I never dare to look, there they are staring right back at me. McKenzie, Sheri, why am I haunted by your faces and other faces while those sick women and men are not? Can you answer me that? That woman who took McKenzie, Sheri, and all these other children. The woman who runs the show, and ran it behind my back. The men and women who turned these children in for money. The men I saw sitting at their couches, jeering and smiling. The laughing men. The slurping men. The men who wear masks. People who enjoy these children's mortifying humiliation and traumatic vulnerability. These... These are real monsters. Enjoy your other ""horror"" stories here on nosleep. I hope you never sleep again."

I should have been in bed hours ago. But I couldnt, it was too much. I didnt want to retreat into that subconscious lair of thoughts we call dreaming. Not yet. I had things to do. Things to do. Ha. What a lie. I never had anything to do. Just sit and stare and sit and stare and hope something changes when you know it wont. Why would it? Why should it? Bed is warm. Real warm. Uncomfortably warm. The kind of warm that tugs at your skin, sticking to your body like an overused bandaid, just asking to be torn off. Id get up, but its late. Later than normal. I already pointed that out, didnt I? Im going in circles. When did I get back in bed? I stare at the room. Black. No shit, its night. But why black? Why not dark, oozing shadows? Or cascading claws of night dragging across the walls. Was it that? I cant tell. Maybe it is just black. Black with outlines of shapes, shapes I know and recognize well. My table, my bookcase, the edge of my bed, the door. The door. Was it always open? I need to close it. Why? Its late still. Why is it late? I need to sleep. I need to sleep. I need. What time is it again? I just need to sleep. But I cant. I just cant. Why cant I sleep? I dont know why I cant sleep. Maybe Ill try again. The bed. So warm. So uncomfortably warm. Its like a bandaid. No its not. Its like a furnace. Its worse. I cant stop trying to sleep. When will I sleep? Will I sleep? Im out of bed. Its late. I cant sleep. How is it late? HOW IS IT STILL LATE? How much time has passed? How much hasnt? Why cant I sleep. I just need to sleep. That wont solve anything. We both know it wont solve anything. Rooms spinning. Clawing darkness, everything is moving. Why wont I sleep? The shapes keep moving, the shapes keep moving, the shapes the shapes the I forgot the mirror. The mirror in the room. Its large. So large. It stands stoically, ever vigilant, a vanguard in the night. Its so beautiful, so clean cut and there. Its actually there. I could stare at that mirror for hours. Have I been staring at the mirror for hours? I dont remember having the door open. Its cold. So cold. The breeze rakes at my skin, tearing down its vulnerability. It eats away at it, chewing it slowly, making me feel every prick of chill. Its better than the bed. At least I can stand the cold. I cant stand not sleeping. I never noticed the mirror in the dark. Staring into it, all I see is the shadow. Me. Im that shadow. Its so dark and impure, its shape malformed and bent at odd angles. Is that really me? I cant tell. Maybe I shouldnt be able to tell. I give up on time, but it wont give up on me. I feel its ever watching gaze bearing down on me with each passing of a second. I cannot ignore it. It demands my attention. What time is it? WHY DO I CARE? Its past late now. Hopefully. I cant stand it being late. The mirror wont stop staring. Or is it me who wont stop staring? The form in the mirror wont move, yet I wont move either. Is that really me? I still need to close the door. We wont close it though. We already let in what we wanted out. We already see whats in the mirror. We already see its eyes. Its pure imperfect eyes. We see it staring. We know its staring. We know why its staring. Can you say the same? Screaming. Its morning. I should go get some coffee. "
170,vulnerability,nosleep,Strange things have been happening ever since I got that girl's number from the gas station..,2,864do7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/864do7/strange_things_have_been_happening_ever_since_i/,2018-03-22 05:16:58,"Ok, well. Where do I start? It all happened a few months ago... For what seemed to start off as a normal day, I had no cares in the world , 25M , shouldn't have any worries, troubles..ha, well for now things were looking pretty good to me. Living the dream, seeing different shows at different bars, playing video games on the weekends and spending time with my charity work really does keep the time off my job filled with new and exciting things to try, even though sometimes I miss the time I used to spend...alone. For what it means to any of you is beyond me but I guess you would consider me an extrovert. Outgoing and full of resent from my last few flings that I have had in the past. ""Excuse me"" I said after pulling up to the gas station to fill up my car later that day on my way to work. ""What can I help you with?"" Said the cashier. ""Just a pack of cigarettes, Marb red 100's, one of your twenty dollar scratch off tickets, one of the lucky ones, these here potato chips, and fifty dollars for old Shelly there on pump 7"". ""That'll be eighty dollars"" I looked down at the floor as I reached to grab my wallet out of my back pocket, noticing the ring of the lovely girls finger who looked so desperate for a job that she probably didn't get paid enough for. Silence hit me like a wave of heat when I realized I hadn't felt my wallet where I usually kept it. Dammit! It must have fallen out somewhere. There wasn't much time before my shift started, and I couldn't have left it at home, ""no..I had grabbed it off the nightstand this morning after cleaning the apartment"", ""insert random mumbles here"" ""Is there a problem sir""? ""I think I may have left my wallet in my car, let me go check really quickly, I'm sorry to keep you waiting"". ""It's no problem sir"" Exclaimed the girl. Trying to create the illusion of patience. I had walked not two steps out of the store before I witnessed the best and worst thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. When I saw her hair, then her face, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I didn't notice the scent of death on her masked by all the perfumes, quite exotic at the time, but creepy if you asked me after what I know now. Sage,patchouli, and rose blossom filled what seemed like the entire earth as her beautiful gold locks radiated waves of an angelic presence along side her slow, concentrated movements on every simple task. ""Excuse me, could you just keep an eye on this pump for me while I go get some coffee?"" She asked me, as we were the only two up and at the gas station in this small town, besides the cashier at four forty-five in the morning. To which I politely agreed kind of humored by the chance to talk to her. ""Sure thing, but first could you tell me what you're name is? I feel like I've known you for a long time but i can't seem to recall your face, I'm sorry. I smiled. ""I'm terrible with names"". ""Lilith"" ""Lilith.um..that does seem familiar..well wait a second, I remember something in the newspaper about a Lilith, if that's the only Lilith I've heard then wouldn't that make you the girl who went missing a long time ago that everyone was on a manhunt for? ""Yeah that's me, but it's all in the past now for me at least"". ""I'm sorry I didn't mean to bring it up, but I felt like I knew you from somewhere"". She trodded off with a gesture of kindness with despair tucked away under the bags in her eyes that complimented her already awkward smile that didn't seem to fit her face. Those eyes which seemed to defy everything else about her, I mean everything! Nails, hair, skin, was just flawless. But I could tell she had been disturbed, and I wanted to know more. See I always had an interest for these kinds of things, the comforter. The advice I would give would be short and sweet, if at all, and I would listen like a teddy bear for the next few months and know deep workings of the world that I just couldn't seem to satisfy the hunger for by browsing internet content. The connection, trust, and power all gave me the greatest high I could imagine. Alongside a lot of beautiful women that seemed to make life worth living even more. ""Thank you so much, this is for you"", she handed me a business card after coming out of the store with her coffee. The card had a company name and phone number on it. It read the name, ""Lilith, Yuki-Onna"" "" Co founder + Internal Source Code director B-37A, Section 7, Gold division, 1-800-999-***7"". I've never really seen such a mix of character, at one end she seemed to be a laid back and relaxed, and the other half was tense and full of business related stress that seemed to be a conflict of her self to say the least. ""just follow the operator to direct your call to my division, and I can give you a discount on our services, we offer advice, and opinions on a lot of different matters, think of me as a personal assistant, and nothing more. You may call as often as you like, and there is no limit to the call duration. The discount will apply on the fee that is charged for things like ordering food or furniture for you, I'll just need your credit card information whenever you choose to sign up and we can discuss things at a later time"" I should have guessed it was probably drugs that was in her eyes, I could feel an evil presence clinging onto her, all she needed was my credit card information for her fake business that she probably uses on anyone gullible enough to think with their dick. Whatever, shes hot enough, and I'm smart enough, I'll just play along with her little game, and maybe, just maybe I'll get her to a hotel room along the coastline and take one of those personal paid-to-get-laid days off where we sit around drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes way past sundown talking about nothing and everything. Worst case in my eyes was prostitute, but she seemed to hot for that, either way, me being 25, and seeing the attraction in my eyes a blind person could see how many fucks I gave at that point. ""Ok!"" I looked again at the business card at my hand, thinking about what she had just said, before hearing her reply ""Ok, well I'm in a rush, I'll talk to you soon Daniel"". That's weird, I couldn't remember giving her my name. Whatever, I tend to forget things easily anyways, it must have just slipped past me as one of the other thousands of things the pile up in my brain clouding even the most basic of thought at times. I then remembered I hadn't returned with my credit card to the cashier yet kind of ironic that by her saying the word credit card had reminded me to grab it, I completely forgot, to which I near sprinted to my car, swinging the door open in the process, and finding my wallet laid out on the dead center of my seat. ""found it"" I exclaimed to the cashier. After pushing the front door open ringing the decorations that were hung from it, with a look of manic in my eyes from the realization I had probably been out there for fifteen minutes. ""Eighty one forty seven"". I quickly swiped my card and collected my things while apologizing again basically under my breath. I had just but walked out the door all while seeing out of the corner of my eye what appeared to be an apparition of a man, about six foot two. Looking at me, as I blinked the image faded from my view. Must be all the energy drinks, drugs and caffeine mixed with sleep deprivation. I reached for the nozzle and started filling my car up with gas, opened my door and found the first usable ridged coin I could find in my center console, threw in my chips , and pulled the lottery scratch off out of my pocket. ""Triple Six, Big win, 100,000,000 Jackpot, Win up to five times!"" And a bunch of other lottery nonsense written all over it. I pulled out a cigarette, lighting it while I stood next to the pump, (which I later was scolded for doing so another time). And started scratching the first box on the ticket, seeing that it was definitely a winner. As I went to scratch the amount on the bottom, it had read, ""Jackpot"" As I scratched all of the other prized on the ticket they all read the same. Overwhelmed with joy I had read the back of the ticket once before, and seem to remember something about going to the lottery officials office to claim prizes over a certain amount. It had not occurred to me, the feeling, you know? Of death, creeping down your spine. Flexing at every inch of your weakness measured by your shivers. My blood was cold, and my heart had but near stopped beating when I heard my phone ring at the exact same time of winning the lottery, I started seeing stars, my head went light, and I near fainted. Luckily I didn't answer that call. I got into my car after hanging up the pump. I called my job and quick the very same minute. Drove immediately to my apartment, and sat there. On the kitchen table, contemplating everything that was going to change, the things I was going to be able to do. When my phone rang again. ""hello Daniel it's Lilith , I really would like to get that credit card information from you to get this application process going. I'm looking forward to working with you"". My card had a fixed no overdraw limit, and as long as I didn't accept any charges from the scam, I could get my money in a refund back from the bank even if it did get stolen, besides the card was dead to me now that I was going to have a huge sum delivered to another bank account for interest purposes. I figure this is probably the only way I'm going to get to meet up with this Lilith girl again. So I give her the number, meet up, kill the card, good to go. right? ""Ok, the number is ****-****-****-****"" ""okay great Daniel, thank you so much. We will keep this in case you need anything delivered to you, at any location in the world, now secondly, I need you to listen to me. I am going to tell you this once, and once only, we do not offer any suggestible favors or advice, and any of that kind of behavior will not be tolerated, and result in a termination of your contract with us, to which you will electronically sign with your voice by saying, ""I Agree, or I Disagree"" To the terms of service of *insert company name here for your safety and mine* ""I Agree"" I say, and I say immediately after kind of laughing at the whole thing. ""Perfect, she replied"". ""Now just one more thing, I know you're trying to meet up with me Daniel, I have reservations at the diner across the street from you. And I will be there at the first table on the right in fifteen minutes. I like roses, But a kiss will do"". She said after abruptly hanging up the phone. There was only one diner in town, and this was not the typical place to have reservations, whatever. She must have just been one of your typical upscale party girls now with no idea what a legitimate job is , especially after all of that money she must have pulled in from her families support. And she must not understand money enough to realize what is fancy and what is comparable to a unwashed Denny's table after the midnight bar rush-kind-of-lavish. But I wasn't going to turn town the opportunity. even though I needed to cash in my lottery winnings, which I wasn't going to get right away anyway, so I was ready to go. I grabbed my nicest pair of shoes from out of the hall closet and made my way out the door after locking it and checking to make sure all the lights appeared to be off, even though there was a luminescent glow I can't seem to put a pin on that would light up the rooms at night from the reflection of the lake my apartments were nestled by, absorbing the moonlight like a wear-wolf or another otherworldly creature, that seemed to really stand out tonight. And what I can't seem to figure out is how It got dark so fast either, I must have sat on that table all day. The shock nearly was wiped off my face when I turned to see the most beautiful girl I had ever witnessed in my life before my eyes. Right on time, with her Leather boots, black skirt and white t-shirt caressing her, sitting with her leg crossed over the other at the table, her hair perfectly straight, fallen down past her shoulders. Seemed to know exactly when I was there because she turned to look at me. ""Hi Daniel!, over here!"" ""I had walked over past the waiting room, and sat down at the bar, smiled, and waited for the manager to look at me and ask if I was looking for a long island iced tea tonight for the lady, and a whiskey on the rocks for myself. To which is agreed, and ordered several more appetizers in one fluent motion. Turning to my date, and almost stuttering the words, ""Can you tell me who you really are?"" ""I'm kind of curious how you keep coming on to me with all your know it all attitude and also, why me, the random guy you met at the gas station specifically is given all these special treatments, i feel like there's some kind of catch I'm missing? ""She laughed and told me not to get ahead of myself and she could explain everything in time"". But I wanted answers to who this company was, not so much as to get to know the girl first. Which...I did, well I really did. We hit if off at the bar so well, what seemed like a perfect date. Lead by her almost exclusively. We ended up going back to my apartment. And when I woke up, she was gone. I can't remember if this is the part where it got weird or not because I don't actually remember too much from the last time I had written this down. I've had some trauma, just this morning on my way to make some eggs I fell down on some water that was spilled on the floor and sunk my face into the corner of the table, literally popping my eye into my skull. Rushing myself to the emergency room, which gratefully was not more than fifteen minutes away from me. And being told there is nothing they can do besides get me a glass eye. To which I was horrified to hear. I had reached into my pocket to grab my wallet for my ID, I noticed a small slip of paper, that read ""it will sleep within you, it will awake within you"" in red ink. With my signature on the piece of paper with some foreign characters I still have no idea of the meaning. I figured if any time I was going to call someone i slept with to complain about anything it was going to be this girl who left creepy shit in my wallet. So I rang her up from the hospital as I passed the doctor my identification, my eye bandaged, just sitting alone in the room now as he went to the registry desk outside, to be greeted with a wonderful sound of screeching dial up sounds that appeared to be screams under white noise if heard from a non "" phone noise"" perspective . Now I've confirmed my scam theory, and this insane deranged tormented soul of a girl knows where I live. great. Plus, now I only have one eye. It just occurred to me that I have a lottery ticket waiting for me, so not all hope is lost. The doctors had finished up with me and sent me on my way, telling my that I would have to call a cab and have my car towed to another location at a separate time, to take my medications, and get plenty of rest. To which my work was very unhappy to hear, and fired me immediately after claiming some kind of bullshit about tax increase and decrease of labor. I had returned to my house, to find my lottery ticket in the exact same place I had left it, but there was a difference, this time the lottery ticket had no winning jackpots, and instead was a dud, I was completely stunned, had I been drunk at 4:45am that day? Am I going crazy too? Did Lilith swap out..no...how could she have known about that! I never told her. I went to go search her name up on the internet, in my desperation and agony. Hoping that the scent of a woman would soothe the fire in the pit of my stomach after searching for the lottery ticket to no avail. But that's when I made the discovery that the name Lilith was a very common name to be given to a Goddess of hell. Sent from Succubus, the mother of all that is unholy, these demons rain hell among men/women while breeding the energy of suffering through the lands. Draining the life, and feeding them directly from your own lust. Understanding all of your feelings, and intentions in the process. Knowing exactly how gullible you are, and can even manipulate your movements. ""It"" refers to the seed of your own demonic presence, I guess like a zombie. You become what has bitten you, and now according to these discussions, I must live out my days in slavery, and may enslave others with the same manipulation tactic, but if I choose to not feed on the souls of the kind hearted, my soul will slowly be sucked out of my body, leaving nothing but a dark eyed, angelic looking, carcass for any body less demon to inhabit by overpowering my strength. Living in many people you pass every day, taking pieces of your soul without you even knowing, and the ones close to you leave you dead, and everyone takes pieces of others souls even without noticing it, purely by acting in greed. ""What a load of shit"". I said to myself after reading the articles. Just then my phone ran again, I answered there was no name, the call immediately destroyed my cell phone service. Now things have been happening lately that I can't explain, despite that life has been somewhat normal since all of this, the worst has shown itself. lights on when I left them off. Lights shorting out, electronics glitching out. Shadows out of the corner of my eye. Things that I am not used to. But I will find any rational way to explain these things besides the supernatural, I mean, I haven't gotten a good nights sleep in a long time. And I think that it has something to do with the fact I can't remember things as easily anymore. I think I damaged part of my memory from the impact. But I'm making a lot of excuses for someone who is as smart as I claim to be. For the last few days the only eye I have left has been sinking into my skull, near mimicking those of Lilith's. I have joined a few ...um..""satanic communities"", looking for any vulnerability for these demons, and a few other religious consultations. I have spoken with numerous scientists, and gotten a hold of my phone company to find any records of the number that I had gotten from Lilith, but they were clueless on what I was even talking about, as they explained I had not even had my name entered in to the system for cellphone service, which they could clearly tell that I was calling them from a phone, but when they went to check the number, it was for another company. They then told me there was nothing else they could do for me besides look into it for a manager and i politely declined. And hung up the phone. Desperate for an answer, but hungry ...almost keeling over at the pain, I had tried to buy a sandwich earlier, but my credit card had been wiped as well. I now had returned to my apartment where the door has had it's locks changed, because mine wouldn't fit anymore. And when I banged on the door, another family opened the door and explained they had been living here for quite a few years, to which I tried to explain my situation, but quickly realized I hadn't seen any of my stuff there since I had last left my house. All of this is getting incredibly overwhelming, and I'm starting to seriously consider my sanity. I'm starting to see them now, everywhere I go..they follow me.. watching me. from every corner and turn, i see them laughing at me, talking in tongues, breathing stench nobody else can smell, coming closer, driving me out of my body completely minute by minute, day by day. I don't know what else to do, I feel lost at this point, if there is anything you can learn from me, it's don't let someones appearance fool you. This will probably be the last update to this post I make. Thank you all for reading, but they have come for me, I hear them taunting me, telling me eternity has no mercy. My time will be soon, my face and body have completely shriveled to near lifeless. I had a dream last night of Lilith, with her golden hair swept around her shoulder, but with only one thing to say, and that was, can you hold this for me? after handing me my severed eye, and proceeding to laugh hysterically, while eating my chips. I woke up today with no idea what to think. On one hand , i feel like somebody is out to taunt me, and on the other, I feel like there really is some kind of supernatural presence, the evidence is just piled up. If anything changes, I will let you know, but for now I'm going to hide as long as I can. That was a few months ago, things have progressively gotten better since then. I still to this day believe it was some kind of set up for Lilith as I now know her as a stalker, seeing her pacing outside my apartment doors at night. There really isn't much I can do, Hiding in that closet only got me so far, I had to do it, there was no choice. Her soul or my life. She would still live,just another life. She was only the maintenance girl. I've never been so happy to see someone in my life. She saved me with her sacrifice. Only one more of us, no big deal. Just a few every month, then a couple on the side, just to keep me going. I've found peace living this way, but I don't believe I'm doing anything but prolonging the inevitable. But some nights, I still wake up and dream of Lilith standing at the foot of my bed, with my eye, by its cornea in her hand. Looking down at me, whispering. Then screaming at me, for being so clumsy. And I will never be able to see how much of a failure I am now, and I never will know if any of this is real or not. I wish you all the best of luck in life. maybe you'll come across my winning lottery ticket, but for now..pray we don't meet. "
171,vulnerability,nosleep,It's Hotter If We Don't Use a Safe Word,1295,86ae9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/86ae9w/its_hotter_if_we_dont_use_a_safe_word/,2018-03-22 21:11:43,"Theres no going back after this, Dennis explained calmly from above my head. I nodded and opened my mouth. I love you, he added comfortingly, before placing the ball gag in my mouth. The thing held my jaw open wide enough to elicit a thin trickle of drool from the corner of my lips. I shifted slightly, but with my hands and ankles tied to the four corners of the bed, I was unable to wipe it away. The blindfold offered no light, of course. But I could feel my husbands thumb gently flick away the drool. It was oddly intimate and comforting. That was the idea, really. Theres something just so *snug* about being bound in place. The ball gag completed the embrace; my body was now entirely under Denniss control, with no escape possible until he released me. It was the first time wed ever decided to eliminate the safe word. The thought caused a completely different set of lips to spill their drool. I suddenly realized that I was totally fucked if I had an itch. Tiny prickles emerged from all over my body. I began to squirm. The thought was banished when I felt strong hands on my throat. My skin grew hot as fingers squeezed my flesh; the ball gag had prevented even one final gasp of air. My reflex was to take a sharp inhalation of breath as my nipple was aggressively twisted around. Such a breath was impossible, of course, and the feeling of complete submission overwhelmed me. Pain flowed through every nerve as my oxygen-starved brain began to feel like it were floating. Thats when the first safety pin went through my right nipple. Do you have any idea how many pins $19.13 could buy? We intended to use them all. Holy shit. Thirty seconds in and I was about to hit the first orgasm. I tried to beg Dennis to keep going, to let him know that I was finally going to cum without having my clit touched, when I was again reminded that talking was not an option. My crotch began to tighten. Sobering air flowed into my nose as Denniss hand was ripped from my throat. My lady boner deflated almost completely as his hand left my breast as well. The nearly-assured orgasm scampered tantalizingly into the dark. I tried to whimper, but it came out as nothing more than a huff through my nostrils. *What the fuck, Dennis? Youre edging me now?* He couldnt hear my thoughts, of course, so I squirmed in the few inches that my restraints would allow. *How long will you tease me before you get back to work? Fucking TOUCH ME!* My breathing got shallow. He was driving me- STOP! *Let me go!* Lynn  Lynn! His voice was coming from the ceiling. My husband started to scream. I pulled against the bonds, but moved no more than an inch. We had made sure to buy only the best toys, and they were proving their mettle now. I tried to shake off the blindfold, to chew through the ball gag, anything. But I was stuck. And so, apparently, was Dennis. Lynn! Lyyyyynn! Oh, God, AHH- his voice shot from one end of the ceiling to the other. There was a crashing sound as Denniss body slammed into the corner at the very top of the wall. I shook in the bed I lay still. There was simply nothing I could do. Stop it! PUT ME DOWN! NOOOOWWAAUGHH! *CRACK* Dennis howled in pain. I realized that nothing besides a snapping leg bone could possibly have made that sound. I began to hyperventilate. The room was suddenly dominated by what sounded like wet dishrags being torn apart and summarily slapped onto the ground. Dennis screamed louder than I had thought possible. The heat under my skin turned to ice as the noise of Denniss screams-turned-whimpers inched along the ceiling. It stopped directly above my head. I had never heard true panic until the moment that Dennis started begging. Nonononono please please please please STOOOOO *SPLORCH* The sound of a crunching cockroach magnified a million burst from the ceiling. My naked body was covered with a blast of hot liquid and warm goo. A strip of what felt like bacon rested on my cheek; it stuck there and was impossible to shake off. The blindfold was damp. Something furry was on my neck. And I had felt his tongue *more* than enough times to know thats what was resting on my navel. The next hours were the worst of my life. I knew that Dennis was dead; he would never have left me to suffer in silence. The only occasional sounds to reach my ears were the squishing noises that came from my struggle to move in the human soup that covered the bed. There was nothing I could do but squirm. The furry thing did not leave my neck. Would the monster that had killed my husband come for me? Was it standing, watching as I struggled, hopeless and naked? Or was I alone? I didnt want to die. But I didnt want to live and face what would be waiting for me when I took off my blindfold, either. I twisted my wrists in the restraints. The goo acted as a lubricant as I rotated my arms. I thrashed, hard, on the rope. I was trapped. * I had no way of discerning the passage of time, but it must have been hours. The goo dried on me. It made me chilly. I wished wed left the ceiling fan off. After the two hundredth yank, I was able to dislocate my thumb. With a *squish* so painful that I swear I could see through time, I slipped my wrecked hand through the slime and free of the bonds. The other restraints and ball gag came off next. I was almost too afraid to remove the blindfold. But what choice did I have? I peaked out from underneath its cover and looked up. Blood spattered nearly the entire ceiling. I tried to look away, but found myself transfixed by the fan. It took me several seconds to understand why. Denniss eye was dangling, by its ocular nerve, from the edge of one of the blades. It was spinning wildly around, as though looking all around the room once each second. I raised my hands to my mouth in shock. Thats when the furry thing peeled itself away from my throat like a banana and landed on my crotch. It slowed to a stop as it got tangled in my pubic hair. It was Denniss scalp. It was the final caress that he would ever give me. As his hair trickled down the edge of my pussy, the fear finally won out. The most intense orgasm of my life racked my body. The combination of vulnerability, the knowledge that this was Denniss final touch, and the belligerently raw *fear* kept the spasms going for a full minute. When I was done, I felt sick. What the fuck was wrong with me? I vomited onto the mattress. The heave was enough to peel back the flap of skin that I had forgotten attached itself to my cheek. I sprinted from the room at that point without looking back. It was hard to keep my balance as I slipped back and forth on a floor that was coated in my husbands blood. So now what? Theres no point in calling an ambulance. And what are the cops going to do? Both of my parents died years ago; should I call *his* family? Who is going to believe my story? How long can I keep this a secret? Is it coming for me next? [Help](URL [BD](URL "
172,vulnerability,nosleep,Encounter at my father's birthplace,2,86pln4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/86pln4/encounter_at_my_fathers_birthplace/,2018-03-24 11:41:04,"I open up this subreddit for the first time in years and breath in the dark and cozy atmosphere it emanates. The ""submit your story"" button calls out to me and I intend to answer its calling. I come from the exotic North African country of Morocco where superstition reigns supreme. I might share some of our tales or urban legends in the future but tonight, I'll tell a story that I've been meaning to share ever since it happened. It was the summer of 2016. I'd gone to a desolate place in a small mountainous village in the whereabouts of Tiznit, known under the name of ""elbow"". It was my father's home town. The house where he'd grown up, if you could even call it that, is almost as primitive as it was back in the late '50s. A house constructed with uneven rocks, primitive materials and litres of sweat. Every corner in the house is a potential hideout for the venomous scorpions that plague the area, but so far I have yet to see a live one, something about which I certainly can't complain. I visit this place every summer and 2016 was no exception. The house has a relatively vast terrace; a flat roof surrounded by a wall that stops at waist-level. Despite the difficult conditions and the lack of an internet connection, the place is calm and the view is magnificent. By day, it sets a perfect mood for reading. Reading in the shade while sipping a glass of mint tea remains one of my fondest memories. At night, however, the atmosphere shifts entirely. The silence that was once appreciated becomes unsettling, and on clear nights, the moon casts an eerie glow on the house. The summer heat sometimes forces me to sleep on the terrace, much to my father's disapproval. He often recommends that I don't for a reason that he refuses to explain. And while I don't necessarily agree with it, I don't disagree either. Whenever I do sleep under the sky, I get invaded by a feeling of vulnerability that I can't shake. On one of those nights, we dined on the roof as usual. We drank tea after dinner and, as per the nightly routine, I listened to the grown ups discuss matters of business and politics. After our guests left, I lingered for a moment while my father went to bed. I stood on the terrace, inhaling the fresh air and taking in the ominous vibe this place gave. The hills were as dark as they were silent. Being a horror aficionado, I found this to be blissful. I went downstairs and went straight to the bathroom, all that tea I drank was screaming to be expelled from my body. The bathroom was set up in such a way that if you stood facing the toilet, your eyes would be looking at an unfinished window that opened into another unfinished part of the house. That part still has no electricity and at night, it's shrouded in darkness. Looking into it, I was reminded of Nietzsche's quote about gazing into the abyss and the consequences thereof. But I refused to look away for fear that whatever lurked in the shadows would sense that I feared it. For some reason, I believed eye contact to be a language that transcended the conditions imposed by the realm of the living. Surely the malicious spirits would interpret my failure to maintain eye contact as a weakness. As I was standing there, penis in hand, pondering the social cues that govern human-monster interactions, a slight movement caught my eye. I immediately wrote it off as a trick of the light. I was feeling tired and I was obviously seeing things. I was about to let the golden ceremony commence, when a dark shadow suddenly emerged from the window. I barely dodged in time for it to fly into where my head was a mere second ago. This timely reflex surprised even me. I stood at a safe distance while the winged creature silently circled the sole lightbulb that hung from the ceiling in the center of the bathroom. It flew around for a while before leaving from the same window where it initially came. I promptly stuffed a brick in there and resumed peeing, my heart still racing from the whole experience. After I calmed down, the rational part of me took over and I came to the conclusion that the shadow must have been a bat. It was my first time seeing one. That's why I didn't recognize it from first glance. I went to bed that night, my mind buzzing with business ideas that involve renting the bathroom to those who suffer from constipation and sending in a bat at the opportune moment because, as far as I was concerned, the encounter nearly made me soil my pants."
173,vulnerability,nosleep,The home invasion,27,86q4b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/86q4b9/the_home_invasion/,2018-03-24 13:08:44,"I am a 42 year old single father. I have a 12 year old son named Mark. Just 3 years ago, I was subjected to a horrific home invasion. Mark and I almost lost our lives that day. I dont know how were survived the whole experience. One particular night 3 years ago, I was sleeping in my room. I then awoke to a major disturbance in the kitchen. My dog Fillis start barking very intensely. He barks in a more fearsome and terrified tone then normal. Suddenly, I hear Fillis scream and whimper in pain. This alerted me that there is a threat in my house. My son Mark was sleeping in his bedroom, just a few feet away from the kitchen. I knew, in order to protect Mark, I needed to confront whatever was in the kitchen. Although I was trembling in pure terror, I gathered up my courage. I slowly emerged from my bed, while clutching a baseball bat in my hand. Slowly, I crept into the kitchen. When I walked into the kitchen, I see Fillis laying dead in a pool of blood. He twitches his legs, but he is clearly dead. Although it was quite dark, I could clearly see stab wounds in his side. My kitchen had totally been ransacked. All the drawers were violently tossed around the entire kitchen. Suddenly, I hear footsteps walking in the hallway towards my sons room. My heart stopped beating, as I feared for my 9 year old sons safety. Seconds later, my son starts screaming in his room. As I watch in horror, a dark figure emerges, dragging Mark out of his room. From what I could make out, the figure was definitely a young man, maybe mid 20s, and quite skinny. His face was concealed by a goalie hockey mask. The figure then pins Mark to the wall, holding his throat with one hand, and pointing out a switch blade at his neck. The figure starts whispering in a threatening tone to Mark. I have a hard time catching on what he was saying, but I could pick up that he wanted money and Marks phone. Although, I really wanted to do something to protect my son, but I was too frozen in fear and shock to do anything. It was almost as if I was magically turned into a stone statute. My son looks at me with tears in his eyes, silently begging me to intervene, but I just couldnt. All of a sudden I feel someone grabbing the back of my shirt. Then I feel a small metal object touching my back. I turn around to look, and there is another intruder holding me at gunpoint. This guy had a dark hoodie and a bandana that concealed his face. Unlike his accomplice, this guy was very bulky and well muscled. He ordered me to drop my bat, and I quickly dropped it. Both of the men then proceeded to drag me and Mark in the living room. They had me sit on the sofa, with the hooded guy sitting next to me, while still holding me at gunpoint. Meanwhile, the intruder with the hockey mask sits on the recliner with Mark seated on his lap. The man still has a knife to Marks throat. They demanded me to give out my financial information, such as my credit card number, where I kept my cash in the house, my social security number, etc.. If I did not share that information with them, they would slit Marks throat in front of my very eyes. Not wanting to lose my precious son, I obliged to their demands. The hockey masked man still decided to cut open Marks throat anyway. Before I had time to react, the hooded guy shot me twice. One bullet hit my neck, while another one hit my chest. Moments later, I passed out from my wounds. I dont remember what happened afterwards, but I woke up in the hospital 3 days later. When I woke up, I was greeted by both of my maternal and paternal half siblings (I have no full siblings). I asked them on what happened, and they revealed to me that the neighbors were alerted by sound of the gunshots in my house. They called the police. 10 minutes later, the police found my son and I lying grievously injured on the living room floor. The ambulance arrived, and drove Mark and I to the hospital. Both of us survived our wounds, but with great physical costs. Mark forever lost his ability to speak verbally, while I permanently became a paraplegic. The men that attacked us were never caught. I dont know what became of them, but I hope that they were arrested for some other crime they committed. These bastards need to have some justice served to them. Despite this horrific ordeal, we still managed to continue living our lives. Mark has managed to become a rising soccer star in his middle school. Although I still have yet to find a wife or a girlfriend to help raise Mark, I still manage being a parent to him alright. My job is paying for his needs, and we are still living a healthy middle class life. The demons from that incident still haunt us to this day. Despite all of those years, feelings of vulnerability still lingers on from time to time. From that night on, I never allowed him to sleep alone. I almost lost my son that night, and I never want that feeling ever again. "

The solid oak frame, needed a little push before it gave way. Amber street lights made a narrow line across the bedroom floor. The light switch flicked on with a dull click, illuminating the cozy space. The walls were covered with a blotchy brown paint, and the carpet was stained in multiple spots. These things are expected when spending so little on a place to stay. The room smelled faintly of copper, most likely due to the old appliances. The molding at the base of the walls was chipped and splintered. The room has seen better days many years back. Like many things in this part of town, its hay day was a distant memory. This room is so quaint. she said We can pretend to play house for the evening. She looked around the room excitedly, her face lit up with beautiful radiance. She softly tugged at his coat sleeve. Its not much, but I kinda like it. he said, closing the door behind him. He locked the deadbolt into place with a loud thunk, sealing them away from the outside world. He took a peak out of the window before he shut the blinds. She walked up behind him and grabbed his shoulders. He jumped and clutched his hand to his heart. Why the hell are you so jumpy? she said as he took a few deep breaths. Both of our parents think we are going camping with friends, there is no way they will be able to find us. Please relax. He smiled and regained a normal meter of breath. I just know that your father would kill me if he found out about this. She scoffed at such a notion and kissed him on the cheek. Tonight is about us, and no one else They looked around the minimally furnished room. Dark wood panels framed the drab brown walls. A leather chair in the corner looked incredibly tired and worn. The armrest was missing chunks of fabric and stuffing was curling out like clouds. She draped her jacket across the back of the chair. A microwave, refrigerator, and a coffee maker cluttered the corner of the room. All the amenities a traveler may need. There was a closet tucked away in the corner next to the chair. The television looked like it has been around long enough to broadcast a world war. Setting down their bags they let out a big sigh of relief, sprawling out on the hotel bed. They kicked their shoes off. Both sat up cross legged in front of each other. I cant believe we are finally spending some alone time together. Its so rare that it is just the two of us. he said, a smile brightening his face. His hand reached out to grab hers, his fingers tracing her own. Our first night out together, what do you propose we do?"" Her voice so calming and garnished with passion. His hand paused with a slight jolt. He cleared his throat, and shifted uncomfortably on the bed, avoiding her gaze. His cheeks were starting to turn red, barely noticeable under his long hair. Its okay to be nervous, Im nervous too. Youre not the only first-timer here, remember? she said with a bashful smile, outlined by golden freckles. She nuzzled his neck and then proceeded to blow a raspberry. He playfully pushed her away to avoid another blast of air. You always know how to cheer me up! he said amid laughter. ""It is so easy to spend time with you Cara."" He lifted her hand and kissed it gently, slowly moving his eyes to meet hers. The girl named Cara got up and made her way to the bathroom. She riffled through her bag and began to whistle a tune. It sounds a little bit like Labamba, but it was hard to tell. The melody floated through the hotel room as she got into the shower. ""I love your whistling Cara."" ""Thank you so much Franklin, I've been practicing."" She said over the water pounding on the tile. The boy named Franklin sat up on the bed. ""What did you say?"" She didn't react, she must not have heard him. Franklin shifted to his side and rested on his elbow. His arm bulged just a little underneath his flannel. A curious expression came over his face. He slowly peeked over the bed and cautiously looked underneath, ever so slightly pulling up the comforter. Franklin was relived to see that there was nothing there. He sat back with a light chuckle slightly shaking his head. What a silly thought that someone would be hiding under the bed. He then nosed about the bedside table. Riffling through the drawer, he produced a Bible. Franklin leafed through the pages. There seemed to be scribbles throughout the book. Nothing legible, just zigzags and Xs in black ink. He fanned out the pages and a folded piece of paper gently glided down. Opening the note carefully he discovered John 1:29 printed in the same black ink. Flipping to the page he noticed that the scripture was blacked out except for that passage. Under his breath he read; The next day he saw Jesus coming towards him, and said... How does this look? Cara emerged from the bathroom wearing emerald green lingerie and his jaw nearly hit the floor. She looked so beautiful and pristine. Her red hair like fire as it bobbed gingerly on her shoulders. He sat in awe and slowly placed the book back in the drawer. She crawled towards him on the bed and rested her head on his chest. The room was silent except for the sound of faint breathing. The way you care for me makes me proud to be who I am. Franklin said as he ran his fingers through her curly hair. She kissed him tenderly, steadily growing with ferocity as they held each other. She stopped abruptly as her coat fell on the floor with a soft *huff*. I almost forgot to hang my jacket. Cara said, as she made her way to the closet door. Franklin clutched her hand and pulled her back to the bed. I think I know what I want to do tonight. Minutes passed by as clothes slowly fell away. They were soon bare to each other, both of them studying the other in a moment of vulnerability. They made love for an hour with coy trepidation. They were a whirl of flesh as they desperately tried to please the other. They would apologize ever so often or ask if the other was enjoying it. So much uncertainty for a primal human act. She wept for some of it and he attempted to console her. He was only moderately successful. Laying in each other's arms they tried to catch their breath. I love you Franklin. her words drifted off as she fell asleep. I love you too Cara. he whispered, as he rolled over to hold her. They kissed goodnight as he reached up to flick off the light switch. What a beautiful moment. Its a shame they didnt notice me. They would have had time to run, to hide, but it is too late now. He should have read the pages. It was plain as day. He should have read the pages. If he loved her, he should have read the pages. He should have read the pages. He should have read the pages. If she loved him she should have check the closet. She should have checked the closet. She should have checked the closet. She would have seen me if she checked the closet. Now its too late. Far far too late. Now I must cleanse this room of sin. This room is unclean. The walls will be stained by the cleansing. I will bathe in the cleansing. This room is unclean. Constant cleansing. Constant cleansing. Constant cleansing. I love them both so much and that is why I must cleanse them of their sin. With love, Lamb"
175,vulnerability,nosleep,"What will you do when ""they"" come?",7,8awle7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8awle7/what_will_you_do_when_they_come/,2018-04-09 17:09:22,"What will you do when ""they"" come? It's a simple question, really. One that I wish I'd have given more thought to. Not that it would have changed anything, but I'd have liked to be more mentally prepared. More individually prepared. Their arrival in our skies was an abrasive one, and it didn't take long at all for us to realize that it wasn't without strong hostility. I happened to be outside and looking up when they came, so my first feeling was curiosity. For those who didn't see them, though, their first experience with the invaders was fear and pain. The speed at which they commenced their attack was astonishing to say the least. With barely enough time to comprehend what had just entered my vision, the explosions began. Their attacks left the immediate vicinity incinerated instantly. No less than hundreds of thousands dead without the ability to even know what had happened. Shortly after their initial attacks, they spread out. I didn't even have enough time to run when I saw the horizon, end to end, bathed in flame. I can only hope that they have not yet found the other 3 planets we inhabit in this star section, but that hope is waning. Before we could offer any type of retaliation, it seemed doom was upon us all. Not that we would even begin to rival their weaponry. Our society has long since replaced our war-mongering ways with peace. When we're young, we're taught about the days of old. On each rock of our home planet lived separate societies. These societies were governed by individual leaders, and many of these separate groups would commence war on each other. One species, perpetually killing itself. Obviously, in our early years we learn this in a palatable way, leaving out many of the harsh details. But as we grow older, we are capable of learning the true reality of how life once was. It's important to realize this so that we never repeat our same mistakes. Over generations we have learned, slowly, how to interact with each other in a way that is beneficial to all and malevolent to none. We have since abolished leadership, taking lessons from every different type of society and culture and combined them into a cohesive and stable worldly environment. There are still those that wish to hurt one another, but that is a trait I fear will never disappear. Luckily, we have been able to eliminate that on a large scale, leaving only individual qualms as opposed to societal and cultural war. This has allowed us to explore areas of space we had never dreamed possible. We have fully inhabited 3 other planets near to this home planet, and we all share the same approach to life. Our general well-being is at its highest point, and our medical technology would be absolutely unfathomable to those that lived in the dark times. Unfortunately, this means that we have had no reason to advance our weaponry capabilities, because we believed it was no longer needed. We were wrong. We've been forced to reevaluate our purpose of being. According to my educators, this concept was pondered incessantly by our more primitive ancestors but we've always thought they were far less intelligent than our modern civilization. Our reasoning is that, as a culture, we've decided that the question of our purpose has been answered in the form of peace and altruism among our species. When the aliens came, they shattered all we have come to know as truth in regards to our existence. Are we, in some ways, just as primitive as our ancestors? Maybe even more so? Because at least they had the discernment to realize that such a question is not easily answered. Have we been so ignorant that we've allowed ourselves to embrace absolute vulnerability in exchange for the seemingly ""right"" way to live, learn and progress as one entity? These are the kind of doubts that burrow themselves deep inside me, refusing to be dealt with properly. I am completely absent of any sense of optimism, although some have since shown to be much more hopeful than myself. After a while, we started attempts to develop a means to bolster our protection, but progress is slow due to the fact that this research must be done in secret. Individuals have attempted to retaliate to the invaders countless times, but have never even scratched one of their ships. Without a large scale offense with appropriate technology, we could do nothing but watch as our once majestic planet disintegrated, comfort and tranquility were replaced with blinding light and deafening roars. The death these invaders were able to spread in such a short time is nothing short of boundless, and once they were able to ascertain that we were no threat to them, they started to depart from their ships. You see, it's been discovered that these aliens have come to our planet with the intent of staying, and our diplomacy was met with the highest degree of callousness I have ever been witness to. The brave souls who attempted to make peace with them were met with death, sometimes quickly and sometimes, well, not so quickly. There is talk that they sometimes choose to conduct experiments on us, with no regard paid to our own lives. I have seen friends being pulled onto their ships, never to be heard from again. I have seen others obliterated and destroyed before they could even utter a single plea for mercy. Just like their ships, these aliens exhibited such ferociousness that they couldn't even be harmed. Unfortunately, being met with unavoidable death, we have started to turn on each other in exchange for mercy from the aliens. Our once peaceful society has degraded into an amalgamation of paranoia and malice. To trust your neighbor, or even your own family, could mean your fate. It seems that we are more closely related to our violent ancestors than we had once believed. Existentially, the aliens' arrival was a death blow in and of itself. Soon enough, a growing majority formed with the intent of relinquishing our current system of living and adopting principles we had up until then considered dangerous. While I understand the necessity and incentive behind this severe restructuring of morals, It would be untruthful for me to say that I'm not hopelessly disappointed. I'll never forget the first time I saw one. It's hard to picture it exactly because my entire system of perception was altered by the fear of coming face to face with the thing that was responsible for the death of my planet, even though it failed to notice me observing it. It was smaller than me, but grotesque. The first thing I noticed was its skin, which is strange because their skin is the least threatening part about them. It's thick and soft, ranging from white to dark grey to black. I don't know what the purpose of having such thick and abundant skin is, but I'd imagine it was developed to cope with whatever type of living conditions that exist on their home planets. They can move at many different degrees of speed, propelled on long tendrils that dangle below them. Some of them have tendrils that seem far too long to even keep themselves upright, but somehow they do. The next thing I noticed was their head. The consistency and texture of their skin goes up to just below their head. Everything above that point is covered in an external shell, and it seems that this shell is in fact most likely an extension of their body skin that has been hardened for means I am not aware of. I'd venture to guess this is an evolutionary trait formed by an obviously violent culture. Its face is devoid of any features, except for a single large eye covering its entirety. From what we can tell, their means of communication seem to be telepathic which is in stark contrast to how our species communicates. They refuse to listen to us or use our species' way of communication, and any attempt at connecting with the aliens via telepathy has failed. We've recently started suspecting that there may be a form of communication between the aliens and their ships, allowing for complex coordination. We've found this to be true, so we've begun attempts at constructing any kind of strategy against the aliens. Unbeknownst to them, along with secret weapon development, we have also been able to successfully trace a line of frequency based communication between their ships and their home planet. Expecting to find a massive presence in their star system, our research of their home planet and surrounding planets have uncovered something unexpected. We have never seen them anywhere near our star system, so our assumption was that if they came from a great distance they'd have the technology to populate multiple planets and would inevitably do so. However, this does not seem to be the case. In fact, of the 8 planets in orbit around their local star, all but one are barren. The only evidence of them having settled outside of their planet is in the form of rudimentary machines abandoned on its orbiting moon and an unmanned vehicle on an adjacent planet. However, there are so few instances of these objects, we've agreed it's not possible that any long term migration ever happened. I've been given the responsibility of leading a team comprised of our greatest diplomats to the home planet of the invading aliens. We will commence a last-ditch attempt to enter negotiations before our entire population is destroyed. Should we fail this mission, I only ask that our species accept defeat with the grace and honor we have spent so long cultivating inside each and every one of us. "
176,vulnerability,nosleep,I Was A Serial Killer's Type,15,8bkuf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8bkuf4/i_was_a_serial_killers_type/,2018-04-12 07:36:28,"I sat in my office across from Mr. Andrew Spencer. Four months ago, he killed a man. His punishment was twice-weekly appointments with me: Dr. Simon Fuller, Court-Appointed Therapist. ""You look like him, you know."" Andrew shifted in his seat with nervous energy, positioning his hips against the arm of the chair and leaning to one side. ""It might be the glasses."" I sighed and plucked the wire frames from my face, taking the moment to clean them on my sweater. ""A lot of people wear glasses, Andrew."" ""I know,"" he said, shifting his blue eyes from my oxfords to my face, ""but there's something else in there too."" ""Okay, then,"" I said in the soothing voice I had spent years training. ""Why don't you tell me what it is about me that's been making you so nervous? We can talk about that; that's a start."" ""You don't make me nervous, Dr. Fuller. You just remind me of John Barber."" ""Do you think that's guilt talking? Fear, maybe? Is it whats causing this divide between us?"" Cases like these usually lasted three to four sessions. My work involved rehabilitating people who had gone through life changing trauma. I was damn good at my job but Andrew remained silent, just as he had appointment after appointment, appraising me from his seat. ""Mr. Spencer, I'm sure I don't need to remind you that these appointments are court mandated and I can't legally end these sessions without discussing the reason you're here. We're going into our third month now."" ""It hurt when my skull cracked open,"" he smiled. ""There. I discussed it. Can we chat now?"" Per our usual dance, he refused to tell me anything that I didn't know already. I read the case file, not to mention the headlines: Lover's Quarrel Takes Deadly Turn. A little melodramatic, but that's how you sell papers. After irrefutable evidence of his injuries surfaced (the cracked skull, the tumble down the stairs, the multiple stab wounds), the voluntary manslaughter charge was dropped to manslaughter. Obvious self-defense, the paperwork said. Obvious PTSD, the paperwork said. Make sure hes not a danger to himself, the paperwork said. ""We're chatting now,"" I could tell I was allowing my frustration to take on an audible characteristic. I took a moment to collect myself. ""Tell me why I remind you of John Barber. We can start there."" ""Your hands look like his, for one. Quite a bit."" Andrew twisted his fingernails together, using one to collect the lint under the other. I nodded. ""Does that make you feel frightened? I paused. No answer. Safe?"" Again, no answer. At this point, I was reaching for anything to make him speak. ""Aroused?"" A low chuckle escaped him as he flushed a bit and stared at the floor. ""It makes me wonder if you play piano."" ""I don't,"" the words fell from my lips before he had had the chance to ask the pointed question that was brewing on his tongue. Andrew looked at me with an expression of suspicion; his blue eyes squinted ever so slightly. ""He did, though? John?"" Andrew relaxed his position and leaned back in his seat with a sigh. ""What type of music do you like, Simon? Classic rock? You seem like a classic rock kind of guy."" A few weeks ago, I had started a game of tallying a mark in the margins of my notepad every time he avoided answering a question. At this point, the margins looked like doodles of dark tornadoes. ""For the last time, Mr. Spencer, you dont get to turn this around on me."" ""Okay,"" he laughed. ""Fine. I like classic rock and was hoping we had something in common. Maybe after all of this we could catch a concert or something."" ""I'm sure you're fully aware of how that is not only stepping over legal boundaries, but also completely inappropriate."" ""Why?"" He protested, jolting forward in his seat. ""You're supposed to want to help me, right?"" I discreetly jotted down a note about the glaringly obvious attempt at emotional manipulation: exploitation of perceived vulnerability. This was the first recordable and definitive symptom of something different seething inside of Andrew Spencer. ""I do want to help you, but were out of time for today. I stared at the clock on the wall behind Andrew. There were still fifteen minutes until the hour. I hoped he wouldnt notice. As I stood to escort Andrew from the room, he grabbed tightly onto my wrist and stared at me with watery, blue eyes. He gingerly pet the ends of my fingertips where blood was collecting and swelling from the constriction around my wrist. These are pianist hands, he said as he stood with a smile and left the room. I locked the door behind him and held my breath. It wasn't until I heard the outer door shut with a small chime that I exhaled. I crept from the room, creaking open the door before hurrying down the hall to another office. As I slammed the door behind me, the name placard of Dr. Matthew Kearney fell off the door and clattered onto the grey carpet. ""Matthew, I am done with him,"" I growled in the quietest way I could, hoping not to disturb my colleagues or their patients in adjoining rooms. ""Did you make progress?"" ""Did I make progress? What the fuck do you think: did I make progress? This was supposed to be two visits - maybe three tops, but he's been drawing it out. I think,"" I stumbled through my thoughts like thick mud, ""I think he's trying to draw out the sessions because he's obsessed with me."" Matthew let out a deep, throaty laugh and leaned back in his chair. ""That's preposterous."" I could feel the color drain from my face. ""No, listen to me. I know it sounds-"" ""Crazy,"" he interrupted, standing as a sly smile stretched onto his thin lips. My face fell slack and my eyes narrowed. ""Yes. Crazy,"" I replied. ""Look, whatever the situation really is, I don't think this is appropriate anymore. I can't be his therapist. He compared me to John Barber for Christ's sake; that can't be conducive to helping him."" ""What did he say exactly?"" ""That I look like him. That I look like Barber,"" I said, adjusting my glasses on my face. ""Objectively though,"" Matthew cocked his brow at me as his voice trailed off. ""You do a bit, I suppose."" ""I can't believe you,"" I scoffed. ""Why was I even put on his case then? Did you not even consider that?"" Matthew exaggerated a quelling sigh. ""I didn't realize it until now. Besides,"" he placed his hand on my shoulder, roughly patting the seam of my sweater, ""you're the best on the team for these kinds of cases."" ""Flattery. Clever."" I rolled my eyes and plucked his hand from my shoulder. ""I still want off the case,"" I smiled. ""He invited me to a concert with him. He wants to spend time with me outside of this."" I waved my hands in gesture to the building. ""Oh, he also tried to emotionally manipulate me when I told him it was inappropriate."" Matthew paused, tapping the back of his pen softly against his lips. ""What concert?"" Fire crept onto my cheeks, radiating from my jawline to my lips. ""Well it wasn't a specific concert,"" I felt my voice sputtering before falling flat, ""just the idea of one."" ""Come on,"" Matthew droned. ""He's in a venerable place. He's probably just seeing you as a hero. That happens. You of all people should be familiar with the phenomenon. Maybe this is the best outcome. Maybe 'the transference which seemed in every case to constitute the greatest threat to the treatment becomes its best tool'"". As a smug grin wove onto Matthew's face, harsh lines carved themselves into the hollows of his cheeks ""You're quoting a man who also recommended cocaine as a cure for morphine addiction,"" I added. ""You cannot be serious."" I held his gaze and his smile remained unchanged. ""I don't feel good about this. Have him transferred."" Matthew waved his hand dismissively. ""I'll see what I can do."" ""It's been going on for weeks,"" I pressed, tension solidifying my jaw. ""You're overreacting,"" he patted my shoulder. ""Maybe you should just take it as a compliment."" I shrugged away from his hand and walked towards the door. ""Nowhere in my job description does it say I have to take compliments. Either fix this or I'm leaving."" With that, I left the room. The sun had set by the time I pulled into my driveway and the trees that surrounded my house swayed in the breeze. As I pulled my car into the garage, I noted that a few of my outdoor bulbs had burnt out and the faade of my house was particularly dark. As was my front stoop as I unlocked the door and locked it behind me. I grabbed a beer from kitchen and sat down with a stack of papers at my piano. Yes, I did play piano. Quite well. From ages seven to twenty-five, I was very accomplished. I filled concert halls by the time I was fifteen. I quit playing professionally because I hated it, to be honest. But why should Andrew know any of that? I tucked the cold bottle of beer between my knees as I sat at the edge of the bench, arranging the papers on the music rack. I organized the sheets for a moment, sorting them by priority, patient, effective date, etc. Three additional patients had been added to my dossier today. One had been signed off and released from my care yesterday. All very run-of-the-mill cases. Just as Andrew Spencer had been expected to be. After signing *here* and initialing *there* a few dozen times, my thoughts grew fuzzy, insulated inside the warm glow of my second beer. As I stacked the paperwork into their appropriate files, my elbow slid across the keys of my piano, resonating with a stark echo. I smiled. I straightened my posture and plucked a few notes, slowly at first. A melody grew from my fingering; the beginning of Bach's Sonata No. 1 in B minor. The measures just before the violin joins in. The wind had picked up and the bushes beneath my window raked their gangling tendrils across the glass. The pane whined as the branches stretched and swayed. As my playing slowed, my eyes drifted to the movement outside. A neighbor's car was pulling into the subdivision and as the headlights shone into my living room, I caught the brief glimpse of a silhouette, backlit and pressed against my window. I jerked back, the remnants of my drink cascading onto the floor. My eyes followed to the pool of amber at my feet as my hands brushed over the hard line ironed into my trousers, trying to slough off any extra liquid. I glanced back up to my window and saw it void of any face or figure. Though the face was obscured by the glare on the glass, the brevity of the silhouette looked like Andrew Spencer with his wild hair and slender frame. I double checked and triple checked that all of my doors were dead bolted and even then, I barely slept. The next morning, I marched into Matthew's office fuming. Before he had the chance to look up from is paperwork, I had already slammed the door behind me. ""He was at my house, Matthew,"" I shouted. ""I fucking saw him through my window."" Matthew rolled his eyes as he met mine. ""Andrew Spencer? You saw his face? You could one hundred percent identify him?"" ""It was dark,"" I snarled. ""You *have* to believe me."" I pleaded and my voice rang out in a higher pitch. ""Look, he told me yesterday that he knew I played piano."" A soft chuckle escaped Matthew. ""You do though."" ""But I told him that I didn't."" ""Why did you do that? Never mind,"" Matthew pressed the tips of his fingers to his forehead, leaning heavily over his desk. ""Anyone with access to the internet can find out that you do play piano, Simon. So using Google is now a sign of psychopathy in your professional opinion?"" ""Matthew,"" I begged. ""Matthew just fucking believe me. It's not like that,"" I stumbled through my words, tonging my lip as I searched for a point. ""I was sitting at my piano last night. He was watching me. He's been watching me, I know it."" Matthew let out an exacerbated sigh. ""Fine,"" he said. ""I'm not saying that I believe you but you're clearly not in a position to help anyone if you truly feel this way. I'll agree that this isn't a conducive environment. I'll reassign him."" As I let out a heavy breath, my shoulders slumped with relief. ""Thank you."" The following appointment with Andrew Spencer was brimming with uncomfortable suspicions. On both his part and my own. I could read it in the way he shifted in his seat and the way his eyes darted from my face to the door. I had asked him to come in a few minutes early, which he met with considerate misgivings. ""Andrew,"" I grabbed his attention with a comforting smile. ""I need you to know that this isn't your fault."" I lied. It was entirely his fault. ""I'm failing you and that's not fair, is it?"" ""So you don't want to help me anymore?"" He wore an unfitting and incredulous grin. ""I do want to help you,"" I explained, ""but you're going to have to work with me. So you dont want to be my friend. I could feel myself cringe with a mixture of irritation and pity. ""I'm not going to be your therapist anymore, Andrew."" ""Great,"" he laughed. ""So we can hang out now."" I cocked my head in disbelief, trying to twist my motions subtly into the more innocuous action of adjusting my glasses. ""I'm afraid that's not what this means, Andrew. We had a professional relationship,"" I said, my voice sounding sterner than I had wanted, ""and that is the only relationship we had. It is over now."" The door clicked open and my associate walked in. ""This is Dr. Irene Cho and she will be taking over for me. Goodbye Mr. Spencer."" As I stood, Andrew's eyes tracked me indignantly, like a serpent tracking movement to strike. I walked past Irene and locked eyes with her in a brief and cautionary glance. She nodded. That night as I was drifting, I was shaken awake by the violent vibrations of my phone on the bedside table. Groggy, I picked up my phone and looked at the screen; it illuminated my bedroom in a vibrant glow of blue. It was a number I didn't recognize. ""Hello?"" My voice was still thick with sleep. I could hear Bach's Sonata No. 1 in B Minor humming quietly through the phone. ""Hello? Who is this?"" ""Simon,"" his voice was weak and glassy with tears. ""I know you want me to leave you alone but I had no one else to call."" Adrenaline coursed through my veins, sending a jolt of energy raging through me. ""Andrew?"" More sobs poured out of the phone. ""Andrew, what's happening?"" ""I can't do it anymore,"" he whimpered. ""I don't want to die but I don't what else to do."" ""Okay,"" I cautiously replied as I crept out of bed and began dressing myself. ""Why don't you walk me through what's going on right now,"" I coached. ""How about you stay on the phone with me, tell me all about it, and I will be there in twenty minutes. How does that sound? Does that sound okay?"" He whimpered a yes as Bach's Sonata repeated, started back at the beginning, louder during the piano solo. When I arrived twenty minutes later, the front door was ajar and the same piano music I was hearing over the phone poured out from the hairline crack. Giving the door a light nudge, I walked into the house. I don't know what I was expecting from Andrew Spencer, but this wasn't it. It was a very plain, suburban house. It looked like it belonged to a family of four and not the unstable man currently residing in it. I walked further inside and the music grew louder. Through the kitchen, I saw an open door. It led down into what looked like a dark basement. I could hear Andrews panicked breaths now, through the door and through the phone. ""It's just me, I called out. I'm walking into the basement now. Okay?"" When I spoke through the phone, I could hear my own voice echo from downstairs. He had me on speaker phone. As I descended the stairs, I saw him crouched and whimpering with a gun pressed firmly into the sweat that dripped down his temple. ""I'm going to hang up now."" My words echoed when I spoke, bouncing thrice around the room. I hung up and held my phone out in the air like a hostage. The way he was kneeling looked like prayer as he sat in front of a wall of photos. They were photos of me. Of my house. Of my car. Of me playing piano through the window. Of me mowing my lawn. Of me arriving at work. A newspaper printout of me accepting a music award twenty years ago. Some of the photos fell loose from their pins and fell onto the woodshop table. ""Why are you doing this, Andrew? I cooed. ""Don't you realize? I killed him. He pulled the gun from his head just enough to allow a few drops of condensation to trickle over his cheekbone. ""You didn't kill him; you saved yourself. You did what you had to."" My eyes kept darting behind his pathetic crouching to the photos, searching them idly. ""No, Andrew pressed. I killed him. It was a choice I made."" A smile crept onto his face as he slowly pointed the gun in my direction. My heart pounded in my ears as I calculated the situation. ""But the self-defense wounds,"" I said as I carefully lowered my phone to my side and thumbed the screen discreetly. ""It's pretty easy to throw yourself down some stairs, Simon. As he stood, he braced himself with his free hand on the table. You know, these four months have been a nightmare. You've been watching me way too closely. It's been no fun."" I looked more closely at the wall of photos. They weren't all pictures of me. I recognized another face in the photos: John Barber. The fastest contact I could reach was redialing Andrew Spencer. The next name down was Matthew Kearney. ""No fun? I thought we were having fun, Andrew."" ""My name's not even Andrew,"" he interrupted, waving the tip of the barrel as he spoke. He pointed to a third gentleman in the photos, who also resembled me in a Monet sort of fashion, ""That's Andrew Spencer. He owned this house. He had a beautiful wife. She stayed soft,"" he chewed his lip as he searched for a word, ""pliable for a lot longer than most do. I wonder why. Do you know how that works?"" *Pick up, Matthew. Pick up.* ""Why Spencer? Why Barber?"" I asked, trying to sound fascinated, trying to keep him talking as the gun peered directly at me. He ran his tongue across his teeth, creating a suction as he thought. ""You want an answer about giving them a life they would have never had otherwise. You want to hear that they were willfully unhappy because they didn't let out that darkness and that I gave them that darkness. You're going to be disappointed,"" he sighed. ""It's a lot simpler than that. I just like blending in. People don't pay attention to people like John Barber, or Andrew Spencer,"" he stared intensely into my eyes, ""or Simon Fuller. I guess you can say I have a type. That's hardly unusual for people like me. You should know that."" ""So the headlines,"" I led. ""Those must have been embarrassing, right? I mean, who even was John to you?"" He started laughing as if the question itself was insulting. ""I was bored of being Andrew Spencer and I saw John. So I wanted to be John Barber. But his neighbors had to ruin that for me."" He scoffed. ""Thank God they'd seen me lurking around his house a few times; they thought I was his boyfriend. How ridiculous is that? I heard the sirens and I did what I had to."" ""I can't imagine stabbing myself. That must take extraordinary willpower."" ""And cheap flattery must take extraordinary training."" He smiled at me, eyes wild and teeth bared. ""So when you were trying to get to know me,"" I laughed nervously, ""it was with great tact that you didn't ask for my mother's maiden name. Are you going to run off and live as Simon Fuller the psychiatrist or as Simon Fuller the pianist?"" ""You know, piano just isn't really my thing. Besides I've had four months of practice being a therapist. I dodged questions; you asked them a different way. It's like I shadowed you and you never even realized it. I'm pretty sure at this point, I can fake it 'til I make it."" ""Okay,"" I nodded breathlessly. ""I could give you a few pointers if you'd like. If you're going to run off and become me, I could at least tell you a bit about myself first. My mother's maiden name was Barros, for instance."" ""Oh, fuck off,"" he growled. ""Now that I'm going to kill you, you want to be friends?"" *Matthew, please be hearing this.* ""You're not going to kill me,"" I sighed, slow and gentle. *Please call the police.* ""You live in Willow Hall; it's a subdivision. Someone's going to hear me scream."" *Please know where I am.* ""Why haven't you screamed already?"" ""Because you're not going to kill me. You're going to let me walk out of here and I'm going to forget I ever met an Andrew Spencer."" *Please know who I'm with.* ""Goodbye,"" I said firmly, garishly turning my back on the gun. ""Goodbye, Simon. You too, Matthew."" My heart stopped. My mind raced to find an explanation or excuse but everything went blank. I don't even think I knew my own name in that moment. I took a deep breath and bolted up the stairs, taking two or three steps with each stride. My ears were ringing loud enough to drown out everything else and then I fell. I couldnt tell if I tripped over my own feet in my mad dash to escape or if a tendon gave out but I felt a deep, pinpointed pressure in my leg. It was like a percussive jolt into my body and I felt it in the same millisecond that I heard the gun fire. I hate guns, Andrew groaned as he walked up the steps behind me. My phone had landed just out of my reach and I tried to crawl, my arms grasping out onto the carpet of the main floor and clutching fibers like fistfuls of hair to drag myself away. I could feel myself slipping; gliding over a thick puddle that grew beneath me. There was no friction to push against. My own blood was fighting against my escape. Theyre practical, dont get me wrong but they take away all the fun. He stepped over me and kicked my phone further. He paced down a few steps, predatorily and wrapped his hand around my ankle tightly, as he had done with my wrist a few days prior. He began pulling me back down the stairs. I felt every hitch, every step crashing into my ribs and my face as I couldnt fight it. I felt cold. Alright, Andrew straightened himself, took a deep breath, and smiled. Lets get this party started. He took a folded tarp from the table and threw it down next to me. It planted itself with a plastic thud and a small gutting knife trickled out from between the folds. What do you think? Gotta do this fast because the police are probably on their way. He smiled at me before looking back at the table. As he ran his hands along the woodshop tools, I heard them clink together. Shoot me, I panted. Thats quick. I watched as his shoulders slumped at the suggestion. A heavy sigh of disappointment left his lips. Simon, when youre right, youre right. He cracked his fingers and pulled the gun from the waistband of his pants. He bent down and lifted my head, almost motherly, to place the tarp beneath me. It was oddly comforting, like being tucked in before bed as the recording of Bachs Sonata in B Minor sang me peacefully to sleep. But I wasnt going peacefully. As Andrew mulled over his tools, I had grabbed the gutting knife. He took a step back, looking down at me over the penetrating gaze of the gun barrel, and I dashed for his ankle, slicing the tendon through. He collapsed backwards, screaming like a pig for the slaughter, still clasping onto the gun. I crawled toward the gun, making as many punctures as I could along the way. I sliced into his thigh, tugging until the femoral artery ruptured. Blood was pouring out of him. He kept screaming. I carved into his wrist and pulled until he could no longer control the muscles in his fingers and let go of the gun. I grabbed it. The gun was in my hand but I just kept stabbing him. I stabbed him under his right eye and the nerve was clearly severed because his eye jostled a little further out every time I stabbed again. I could hear sirens in the distance. It was a few months before I was even allowed to return to work, court mandated therapy and all. Obvious self-defense. Obvious PTSD. Make sure he isnt suffering emotionally as a result of the temporary handicap. I was an easy case. In and out. Three appointments at most. However, I do have an interest new patient. He looks like Andrew Spencer. They both have blue eyes. A lot of people have blue eyes, I know. But there's something else in there, too. Im excited to get to know him."
177,vulnerability,nosleep,My Candle,30,7z5i3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7z5i3u/my_candle/,2018-02-22 00:25:54,"As the candle gasps for breath the pain from my wound intensifies with every pump of my heart. The hot stinging in my arm is a reminder of the cuts depth. With all the adrenaline in my body used up my senses return to normal. The flickering savior dances in front of me slowly burning itself away. The wax is now an inch tall and the wicks life is fading but the glow keeps them at bay. The barrier of light this small candle created has given me an extra few hours of life. It is my weapon. My savior. My god. As this light burns with life it brings itself closer to death . . . and closer to my death. Pain streaks through my arm and a wail escapes from my mouth. The noise doesnt matter, they know Im here. I can hear them walking around just outside of my vision. The night is dark and with my candle I can see several feet in every direction but the crunch of leaves gives away their presence. The occasional snap of limbs lets me know many are in the trees . . . waiting for the opportunity. Twice now a face has emerged from the darkness close enough for me to see. The lifeless black eyes and dagger shaped teeth sent shivers coursing through me. Pain drove them back into the darkness after they came too close to the light. Although dim, the light coming from the small flame is enough . . . enough to cause them fear . . . enough to cause them pain . . . enough to cause them death. Continuing on, my walk is slow but cautious and every step is complimented with good balance. One trip and my candle could be extinguished. The trees are annoying obstacles but this way was the fastest route to safety. If I can just get there then I could call for help. The realist in me knows safety is an illusion right now. What help would I call? Everyone is fucking dead. EVERYONE. An entire town ripped from existence in one night. No one could have prepared for what happened. Gun blasts ripped through the night but for every shot were ten screams. I dont care if they looked mostly human, no human can move that fast. Even the ones people managed to shoot seemed barely effected. Screams of agony . . . answered by claws. Pleads of mercy . . . answered by jaws. The optimist in me knows safety is what I will find at the complex. I heard one group instructing others to meet there so we could come up with a plan. Strength in numbers right? They will have guns and plenty of lights. Everyones cell phones will be working and I will find out the army has already been called. Some people in town must have escaped and alerted the government. With the electricity out I havent seen the news, but I know our small town must be on full coverage with every network. Pain in my arm forces me to my knee. I am careful not to drop the candle. The woods breathe in heavily with anticipation while I hear tongues cleaning teeth in preparation. The survivalist in me knows safety is attainable but I must attain it with force. I pull myself up with the assistance of a nearby log and continue through the darkness towards the complex. I have made it this long into the night so my will to live, no, to fight, is strong. I dont know how many are following me . . . a few . . . a dozen . . . all of them . . . but they know who I am. I am the one who fights with a flame the size of my fingernail. After passing a large tree I see the complex on the hill, albeit with no exterior lights on. Everyone is dead. No, everyone is just hiding inside. Regardless, I must make it there . . . keep going. The trees end as the complex property begins. I crawl through one of the many holes in the fence and begin walking through the knee high grass field leading up to the building. The grass is wet with dew and my shoes slosh with every step. Halfway across I stop to take a breather but the sloshing continues. I hold my flame high to remind them of its presence. Then a cloud decides to show me what fear really looks like by moving away from the moon. The moonlight is faint but my eyes have adjusted enough to see my situation. At least fifty surround me and those are just the ones I can see. A potential eruption of violence is hidden beneath their calm human-like face and my spine runs cold. Most of them, still covered in victims blood, only continue walking when I do. Predator mimicking prey. I hold the light above my shoulder again to remind them of my weapon. They clink their fangs together to remind me of theirs. Once I arrive at the complex I search for a way inside. The large roll up door is locked so I try, unsuccessfully, with two side doors. High pitched scratching of claws on metal let me know they are on top of the buildings and shipping containers. Clinking fangs echo around the metal structures creating a dizzying effect. I find another door but become nervous when finding it locked as well. As the flame dances with the small breeze I know my time is running out. An open vent seems to be my best solution so I hold the flame outward and reverse down the shaft. Using my muscles in this unique way is challenging and my worming motion is slow, but I inch my way down the metal shaft and into the heart of the complex. Suddenly a breeze is funneled into the shaft and my candle goes out. Smoke fills my nostrils. The scent of vulnerability. Immediately I hear them clawing through the shaft to my location. Remembering I used the last of my matches already I worm backwards as fast as I can until suddenly my feet become weightless. The low deep growl is inches from my face when I tumble down the vertical drop getting knocked unconscious on the way down."
178,vulnerability,nosleep,A Thousand Bodies Tied to Trees. All Alive and Well.,301,809e2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/809e2r/a_thousand_bodies_tied_to_trees_all_alive_and_well/,2018-02-26 12:55:57,"All around the world, there are locations that are off-limits to the general public, like a staircase roped off to those unworthy of ascending. My fascination with places like these started as a hobby. Finding local sites that were fenced off, marked no trespassing. Breaking into abandoned amusement parks at night. Trekking through federal reserves cordoned off to wandering spectators. The adrenaline rush of being somewhere I wasnt supposed to be far outweighed any motivation to do anything reckless while in these places. Thus, my associates and I were more than respectable and polite while also being criminally invasive. It didnt become a viable source of income until I was hired to find a series of abandoned mining shafts for a venture capitalist, bursting with spendable cash, and looking for some buried treasure. We didnt find anything. The magic of these places lies not in what you find, or what you can steal, but rather in the mystery of what could have been there. What went on in these places before your virgin senses had taken the surroundings and monuments of Identity these places had to offer. It was about nostalgia, not criminality. But one place, had something. An evil that was real. And I am here to tell you about what I found six years ago. _________________________________________________________________________________ I am not going to give you the exact location, for reasons that will become obvious later. I will tell you it was in a European country heavily affected by both world wars. I was hired by a man, I think. I have never met them, whoever they Are. Ive never seen them in person, or even a picture. They called themselves Harrison. Everything was done through dead-drops, and shady dealings over the phone. Through which they first reminded me of a settlement Id heard of called Rymmoit. Rymmoit, as far as I knew it was a fabled war relic, shrouded in Mystery. Something that wasnt real from things I could compare the stories to. Even the most haunted or history-filled places I had found and explored proved to be nothing more than full of embellished stories. Rymmoit was not. Rymmoit was supposed to be inhabited by a group of radioactive cannibals. Id also heard new-age necromancers that kidnapped hikers and tourists, turning them into an undead army. Even a theory that the residents were given immortal life in order to guard an enormous buried treasure of Nazi gold. None of these were true. The truth was far worse. I had 24 hours to prepare, then I was picked up by some very official looking men in a black SUV. We drove for about three hours, and then we stopped on the shoulder of the road. The two men pointed to a gravel path that lead into some woods. I got out of the car, pulled out my GPS device and began to plan a route through the trees using the path. One of the men handed me a gas-mask, as my GPS loaded what looked like a segmented-aerial snapshot, with large swaths of land blurred out, and certain coordinates not registering on the device. The men got back in the car as I was waiting at the path entrance, and Drove off, in the opposite direction than the way we came. I figured, I was on my own. I followed the gravel path for about a thousand meters, when it came to an abrupt end. I thought that was weird, so I pulled up the GPS to map out where to go from here, but it was of no use. I pulled out my compass, and the needle spun wildly in all directions. I could still faintly see the road behind me, as the forest cut out most of the light from the afternoon sky. Looking from what I could see on the ground, it looked like a sparsely used path was apparent on the left, with a clear path through the trees, to the right. I looked back and forth, and settled on the left, as I was going where few had traveled willingly before. The path was crowded with overgrowth, and I lost the trail a couple of times, Eventually coming out into a barren field. The grass was a brownish green and the landscape was pockmarked with fairly large holes, and trenches that had been overtaken with weak vegetation. This was some kind of battlefield. I knew of the dangers of unexploded munitions and forgotten landmines, so I carefully made my way across to the farther tree line. After safely making it across, I stopped for a quick breather, and to check if the GPS was working again, since I had such a clear view of the sky. When I loaded the program, it cut out after only a few seconds, and sent me back to the main menu. I sat there unable to get the map to load, to find my coordinates and to make sure I was headed in the right direction. I was technically lost, but I wasnt ready to Admit that to myself. Thats when I noticed the markings. Arrows, pointing Deeper into the woods. Simply informing me to continue on with my journey. The arrows showed the path pretty clearly, but as I went deeper in the forest, the harder it became to breathe. Then I could see a noticeable drop in plant life, the sunlight poking through the permanently decaying canopy. I took the gas mask the man had given me before they left, and put it on. It made it easier to breathe, but it added a sense of vulnerability with my vision and hearing dulled. I continued walking, following the arrows, marching like a good little soldier. The feeling of adventure had waned throughout the trek, and for the first time, a feeling of survival and fear washed over me. Thats when I saw a man tied to a tree. I stopped and wondered if it were real, as I hadnt seen any living creatures save for a few flies and mosquitos thus far. No birds chirping, no rodents scurrying on the forest floor. This area was supposed to be void of all life, hence why it was restricted. I thought then, he must have been kidnapped, so I approached the man. Hello. he said rather cheery. Are you alright? I asked. Well, why wouldnt I be? he said rather confused. His face had this twisted smile, but it was dark. It felt dark. Mate. Youre strapped to a tree. Youve barely got clothes on. Were just fine, boy. his voice slid with spite. His smile dropped, and there was no expression on his face. Would you like me to un--  I began. I SAID WERE FINE BOY! His Voice echoed with a guttural undertones. The trees felt like they were shaking in fear. The sound hollowed out inside my gas mask, as I watched his smile return. March on. The devils on the other ridge. he said. Devil? I thought to myself. This couldnt be right. The fantasy in these places was never real. It was just hype. But who was this man, and what was going on? It appeared he didnt want help. I shuffled back, away from the man, stumbling over a tree root, and falling into a tree behind me. I felt a pair of hands catch me. There you go. said this crimson voice. Its syllables slithering into my Ear. I turned and looked to see a woman, chained to the tree. Her legs were wrapped tightly with rope that wound around the trunk. The rope was so tight that it had cut off circulation so badly, her legs looked dead, and bloated. The wounds looked old, as if she may had been suffering there for years. Get up. she said. Get up. said the man. Get up. Get up. Get up. they alternated. I stood and frantically tried to Regain balance and move further into the woods. Within a few feet, I saw a young boy chained and gagged to the tree. A swastika was craved into his forehead, the blood dried. I ran up to him and grabbed the chains, trying to pull them off and get him down. Youre gonna be okay. I said to the boy. I took off the gas mask and put it on his face. We are going to get you out of here, and back to your family. And I am going to tell Harrison he can shove that money up his ass. The boy was unresponsive, but his eyes were open. I found a large padlock behind him. All of the chains passed through it, but there was no way to break it. As I came back around the tree, I found the gas mask on the ground. I looked back at the boys face. His eyes were a soft gray color. As I approached, I could see something moving around behind his eye. I got closer and saw that it was a small gray worm that had burrowed Deep into his head. Get it out. he moaned as I jumped back, falling to the ground again. What the fuck?! What the fuck! I mumbled as I tried to stand up. I began to run, slowly noticing the bodies tied and bound to trees all around me. Hundreds of them. Moaning and crying. Some were laughing, some singing, some repeating mantras and praying. Men, women, children. Grandparents, aunts and uncles, friends and family. All appearing as if their bodies had been in these woods for many, many years. I turned in between two large trees, where two men had been tied together, the flesh of their skulls sowed so that they appeared to be vertical mirrored images of each other. One was crying, one was laughing. The laughing man was on the bottom, and his voice sounded like there were a handful of stones in his throat. I kept running. At this point the yellow fog had gotten thicker, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to breathe. I collapsed to my hands and knees, the burning fire in my chest, the pain behind my eyes. My blood felt as if it were boiling. I crawled as far as my arms would take me. Then, the air cleared. It was a miracle. I had made it to a clearing, and crawled out into the field. Heaving lungfuls of clean air. It felt like a spot of heaven in what surely was hell on earth. That was Until I looked up. Thousands of bodies tied to trees. All alive and well. They looked at me. All were silent. Then in unison, they all proceeded to open their mouths. This high pitched whirring sound started to pound in my skull. I clawed at my brain, Needing to arrest to pain of the pitch. Thats when I passed out. ___________________________________________________________________________________ When I came to, I was inside of a small room. It was a log cabin or old house of sorts. A fireplace was crackling as I sat up in the bed. The room was dark, except for the light from the fire. A faint glow came through the dirty windows. A thin gray smoke poured from under the door. In the chair next to the bed, was my gas mask. I stood up, dizzy and dazed, but destined to do my duty. I felt this burning desire to serve something bigger than myself. I donned the gas mask and opened the door. I could hear faint gunshots, as quieted explosions lit up my horizon. I could see the bodies, stacked and bleeding, lining the ground. Bullet casings, dirt and shrapnel dressed the dead, as their bodies pointed the way through the battlefield. I walked as fast as I could which was limited to a slow trudge, all while seeing the outline of a large beast in the shadows across the field and bursts of light in the midst of large explosions. The silhouette appeared to follow me as I made my way across the scene of carnage. Bodies lined every inch of my path. Some brutally slain, while others held on to life with bloodied hands. The silhouette grew larger as I approached it. Then it began to speak. An unearthly sound rang out over the muted waging of war around me. Have you come to know the true face of hell? I stop dead in my tracks, feeling the bass of his voice shake my mortal bones. What is this place? I ask. This. The very meaning of pain, and evil. A place where hell hath spilt out on to the earth. Am I dead? I ask. Do you wish to be? I remained silent. What do you want with me? I ask. You have come in search of what horror truly is. Have you not? I came to find a town. A settlement. Rymmoit. The beast is silent, as he is partially illuminated by a nearby explosion. Blood splatters across his lower abdomen, his face hidden in smoke and shadows. Then go. Thats when I woke up in the field, the yellow fog sitting at the edge of the trees. I stood up with what strength I had, and turned to face the thousands of bodies, but nothing was there. No bodies. Just empty, dying trees. I decided then I had had enough. I wanted to leave, and quickly. I started walking in whatever direction I could, eventually coming to a road. After a few minutes of walking, a black SUV pulled up behind me, and one of the gentlemen who dropped me off, stepped out. Are you ready? he asked me. For what? I asked, still dazed. He handed me a cell phone. Hello? I said as I put it up to my ear. It was Harrison. He asked if I had found Rymmoit. I told him that I had failed. Did you see the beast? he asked. I was stunned. The smoke. I thought that was a dream. I said. That was no dream. That was a true doorway to hell. A portal that was opened when the blood of those soldiers was shed. I was at a total loss for words. Then I asked, So now what? Youre alive. You have a connection to it now. Wed like to know how that works. I looked back at the two men, as one was approaching with an extended metal baton. Okay! I yelled, as I dropped the phone. Okay. I put my hands up in surrender. Just dont hurt me. Ive been through eno-- Then it was lights out."
179,vulnerability,nosleep,Number 258,4,8154t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8154t6/number_258/,2018-03-02 00:10:55,"The name is Daniela, Ive been experiencing some beyond strange experiences the past week, so let me fill you in. Have you ever felt that feeling of someone watching you? The way your skin prickles at the feeling, the gut wrenching panic of eyes watching your every move. The way your hair stands on end and for a moment you feel vulnerable? Because although you know youre stronger than whatever faces you, you not being able to see the person scanning your every move is terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. I ask you this because its relatable, whether you like it or not you have sensed that vulnerability rise in your skin. Well, that is barely a scratch on the surface of what I have been feeling the past week. Let me take you back to Wednesday. I had woken up at the peak time of seven am. My alarm was as annoying as usual and I had slapped it off like any ordinary human being. It seemed darker than usual in my room, but I ignored it. Winter is near and its an expected thing for the sun to rise later. As I had slugged out of my bed and quickly got ready for the work ahead I grabbed an apple and left my condo. The apartment building was deserted at this time, but that was not unusual. I tend to be the first to wake and leave the building as well as the last to arrive after work. I was just busy all day everyday so I rarely saw my neighbours. But today, I just felt strange about the eery silence. Its normally quiet, but it was never this quiet. I had shrugged my shoulders in response to my raging thoughts and left the building. Whatever was going on in those apartments was none of my business. I had arrived to work and my day carried on like any ordinary day, I had to deliver files to the manager, send emails to he directors warning them that the computers were shutting down and that someone from IT will be there shortly to fix the problem. And I had my typical break at the coffee shop across the road. My work had begun slightly slow due to the complications of the useless computers, but overall it has gone by pretty quick and without a problem. As I returned back from my break an IT van caught my attention in the car park, the van was stalling on the side entrance. The van was still running, as the lights had not been turned off and I could hear the slight vibrations of the engine. It was still dark outside so the lights was obviously difficult to ignore. I was confused, I didnt understand why the male/ female who were parked there doing nothing when they knew that the computers had to be fixed immediately. If we didnt get those computers starting again, our system could get easily over run. That just wasnt an option as a lot of the files held on our laptops/ computers held private information on our customers. That info just couldnt be tampered with. I had weighed by options and chose the latter of heading towards the van and knocking on the window to alert the driver. Maybe they had fell asleep? The window was dark and I couldnt see anything on the inside; only an outline of a figure could be seen moving about in the drivers seat until the window was pulled down. The same feeling from this morning rose up into my throat. I had blamed it on the cold chill of the November air before speaking to the shadowed face. I had mumbled hastily, desperate to return to the comfort of my office building. Hello? I see youre IT if you would like to go through the side entrance the security will take you where you need to go. The IT male (the broadness of his shoulders and the strong scent of his deodorant had stung my nostrils when speaking to him which could clearly show he was a male) had only nodded before the squeak of the window had been rolled up again. He remained in his van and continued to stare out of the window at me. I had rushed away, a sense of discomfort tingling my toes as I could feel the eyes of the stranger when I walked. Who ever that guy was, he gave me the creeps. I had attempted to push that small encounter to the back of my mind because every time I thought about it, the feeling of anticipation and dread set on me. But I just couldnt deal with that now, I had a job to do and so I continued finishing the files on my desk. It had been a good hour or so and the encounter had been completely forgotten until my manager called me and my other coworkers into his office. I had walked in prepared to talk about how the computer system will be rebooted and that we would have to work on paper until they had fully set up. My manager (Jordan) had paced around his office before speaking to us all, The IT people havent showed up yet as they have all their workers sent off to other buildings like our own who are having the same problem. I have just got off the phone from their manager and they should be sending some people early tomorrow morning. Until then please work with the paper files. I was confused, genuinely confused. How could they not have enough workers if I had just met one outside not long ago? After leaving the office with my coworkers who chatted among themselves an idea had popped into my head. Maybe not a great one, but an idea overall. Like any curious person, I walked to the security section of our building where the footage of the cameras could be seen. I had slid my pass across the key pad before entering and walking towards the laptop showing the footage of the side entrance of the building. The camera number was written in the corner of the screen 258. I skipped the footage to a few hours ago when I had my break and met the stranger sat in his van. However when I had scrolled around the times of when the van approached, the side entrance remained deserted. There was no footage of the van pulling up to the side entrance of our building, there was just me who walked into the view of the camera and straight through the side entrance without a fault in my step. It was as if the past event never happened, but how would that be possible? "

It's the best thing you could ever do with it anyway. I've been a lucid dreamer since I was a kid. Control of dreams came naturally to me, but as I got older I began having weird dreams that became more and more unpredictable. In one of those, I was in my apartment after what felt like a party of some sort. I awoke early in the morning to the middle of a pleasant night. I've been a night owl my whole life. I was alone and walked into the living room and was surprised find my front door wide open. The door didn't look to have been forced but rather as if someone had gently entered or left my apartment as I slept. I remember not being alarmed. The atmosphere was tranquil, and so I walked through the door and found myself in my car driving along a two-lane road that was perfectly straight as far as the eye could see. I thought it was strange on the right side there was a towering, dense forest with trees that had grown all the way up to the side of the road. To the left, there was a busy city full of confused activity. I could see cars in the distance, hear sirens, and helicopters were flying all over. I thought immediately of all the annoyance of living in a large city like LA or London. I reckoned I probably drove for about a half hour. Eventually, my eyes were drawn to the right side of the road: where I saw a figure that came out of the forest ahead and stood right on the edge of the road as if waiting for me. I pulled over right after it. It walked to my car, opened the door, sat on the passenger side, and casually buckled up. ""it's been a while, Sebastien, I've been waiting for you"" it said to me, its voice was hollow, like listening to someone in a cave almost ethereal a little distant but obviously close to me - when it sat in the car the weight of the car shifted as if something really heavy had just entered. I remember looking at this hitchhiker, but I could not see its face and the unshakable uncanny valley feeling creeping in. The voice evoked a sense of mundane calmness like being at the beach back home in Australia - reassuring and familiar yet not all recognisable if that makes any sense to anyone. You remember your friends, siblings, parents, a relative but nothing came to mind with my companion nothing matched; this thing next to me but yet I knew it somehow. I was raised Christian, but as I got older I felt discontent with religion; remembering the scriptures one thing came across loud and clear the Devil. I finally was able to muster the courage to ask ""are you the beast?"" (and it laughed - not maliciously but as if amused, like when a parent laughs when their child has asked a silly yet surprisingly perceptive question.) In calm voice it said to me ""is that what you think I am...do you want me to be?... rest assured I am not him"" There was nothing malevolent about it and part of me knew it too. My companion related to me ""We've brought you back three times. We were there the day you were born and died minutes later as an infant"" it said, recalling how they'd whispered to my ear to breathe. The day I got knocked out unconscious while riding a horse that required keeping me in an induced coma for a week due to Cerebral Edema. But most of all, it was there the night that I tried to commit suicide. It said ""I know you saw me, I waited on the window sill. We brought you back then and always will. We are not allowed to died and why should you?"" Part of me wanted to screen while another part of me wanted to cry and this thing knew it! With a deep breath and winded voice it said, ""I'm not here to talk about your past, Sebastien, I'm here because I'm concerned about your future."" I asked slightly agitated... what! Are you going to save my life again? I could feel a sense of indignation laced its reply. In a hoarse voice, it said "" YES, take the understanding of our pain because you are attempting to save them and that is not your role, you cannot stop the shape of things to come as you must know by now, there is not such a thing as a single truth in this world. Good, evil is all a matter of perspective in their fly life existence, they are either living or dying. Living is doing whatever you want to do. Dying is everything else. You are just a vessel, Sebastien a gate... and hidden in an unexpected place... a perfect sculpture of imperfection the form of formlessness you can give but you can't take. Receive yourself out of disgrace and contrition and seize the moment from those which are good even though in disgrace and shame and come forward and open the door of knowledge."" His words left me with the basic human vulnerability that we would all find familiar but still somehow surprising when we notice in others. An open question really, why we think in such confident terms but yet have such private doubts. Maybe that contradiction is what keeps us moving, wanting to be more than what we are, and never be satisfied. Maybe it lets us keep our distance, to avoid too much friction as we brush past each other. Or maybe it's what draws us together, the only irreplaceable thing we still need each other for, just one last excuse to keep stopping by, so we can prop each other up, and remind us that nothing is set in stone, not even who we are, or who we pretend to be... It tapped me on my knee and its hand felt like coarse sandpaper. I stopped the car it opened the door and stepped out and it said to me.""Before I go, when the day comes you will see this in the sky"" It moved its hand to the back seat window and drew a spiral on the foggy glass. It was clockwise but on its five o'clock it had a little swoop backwards ""We will be here for you."" and walked back into the forest. You may ask me if I feel any better than before the dream. The short answer is No. The long one is... it is how frustrating not to know yourself... you spend a whole lifetime thinking you're gaining an understanding of yourself, like peeling an onion - coming closer to the centre then realising that this me is not me but a permutation of myself. I hope one day I can look back on this revelation with complete comprehension, and think maybe it should be like skipping a stone across the surface of a lake. It doesn't matter where it ends up, it just matters that we're here on the shore. Just trying to have fun and pass the time, and see how far it goes. "
181,vulnerability,nosleep,My kidnapping experience,17,84jn2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/84jn2f/my_kidnapping_experience/,2018-03-15 14:50:58,"Warning; There is some disturbing elements (i.e., sexual assault) in this story. Reader discretion advised. I am a 33 year old man. Around 13 years ago, I had the most terrifying experience of my life. It still gives me chills just typing my ordeal out. During that time, I was a security guard at my towns local mall. I had previously lost my driver license, due to a few too many DUIs on my record. So I was forced to walk home every night. The mall that I worked at was a good 8 miles away from my apartment. My security job at the local mall paid for my rent, but I was never on good terms with my few co-workers. Thus, I could never hitch a ride with them. They had a tendency to treat me like shit for a vast variety of reasons. However, going into details would take up a story of its own, but it made work miserable. Despite the toxic atmosphere, I couldnt find anywhere else to work. So I was stuck with the job. I was just getting home from a particular shift. I think it was around 7 PM when I got off. It was a fairly hot day, to the point where it was almost unbearable to walk. After an half an hour worth of walking, a car pulled up right next to me. The driver, a very attractive girl around my age, rolls down her window and asks me if I want a lift. She had curly long black hair that reached her waist, and wore a dark blue dress. There was another girl in the passengers seat with her. She was also incredibly beautiful, with a curly short black bob that touched her ears. The 2nd girl wore a green T-shirt and a pair of jeans. I was really tired of walking home for several hours at a time, and I wanted to spent some...um...time with those girls. So I gladly accepted their offer. That was the worst decision of my life. I climbed into their car, and I sat in between them. It turned out that those girls were twin sisters and were coming home from a late night drive. The passenger was named Margaret and the driver was named Lacey. The girls chatted me up a storm, mostly asking about my relationships with friends and family, my work, my schooling, and my dating life. I revealed to them that I was living alone, and I virtually had no family. My only relative that I knew was my mother. Even then, she committed suicide after I graduated from high school. So I was living on my own with no family, and very little (if any) friends. They gave me condolences, and offered me to come to their house. Being the lonely (and horny) guy that I was, I agreed to go home with them. 25 minutes later, we arrived at the girls home. They lived in a cheap home that was located in a somewhat secluded forest a few miles away from town. I walked inside, and immediately rested on the couch. Lacey turns on Jim Hensons the Dark Crystal for me and her, while Margaret was cooking some lasagna. Soon dinner was ready, and all three of us sat on the diner table. As we were eating, I took a drink from my milk. Without warning, my head started to become incredibly dizzy. After what felt like an eternity (which was probably only for a few seconds), I blacked out. I woke up on a bed with a splitting headache, and feeling very nauseous. I tried to get up, but I couldn't. To my shock and horror, I realized that my wrists were tied to the bed frame, while my ankles were tied together. Within milliseconds, I notice that I have been stripped completely naked. I have never felt so damn vulnerable and violated in my life. I felt a scream coming, but it was muffled by the silk scarf that was gagging my mouth. Suddenly, I noticed Lacey and Margaret standing in the corner of the room. What I saw the look on their faces chilled me to the bone. Both of those girls had the most demonic grin imaginable. I got a sickening feeling in my stomach. They started to walk towards me in such a predatory manner. As soon as they got within a foot away from me, they stripped themselves nude. Due to the sheer feelings of fear, anger, and vulnerability, I was not even remotely aroused by that sight. Instead, it just made me cower in pure terror. Lacey tried to get on top of me, but I managed to kick her in the stomach. She had the wind knocked out of her, but she quickly recovered. Margaret grabbed a kitchen knife, and held it to my throat. She threatened to gut me like a pig if I tried resisting them again. So I submitted, and let them rape me. My god, being violently raped by those two girls was a soul crushing experience. No words can accurately describe the true horror of being sexually assaulted. It is among the most dehumanizing things in this world. On top of it all, it was physically extremely painful. After they were done doing their deed, they tucked me into bed, and left the room. I spent the rest of the night tied to the bed, in a miserable state of struggling to stay awake and not being able to sleep. My attraction for Margaret and Lacey stopped abruptly after that encounter. The next day at around 6 in the mourning, Margaret woke me up and untied me from the bed. Then she tied my wrists and my elbows behind my back. She then escorted me at gunpoint to the kitchen upstairs. When I reached the kitchen upstairs, I observed Lacey cooking some eggs. Margaret then gently placed me on a chair. In a couple of minutes, the eggs were ready. Due to being tied up, I was spoon fed like a child. The eggs were quite delicious and well made, but they obviously never got my mind away from my situation. I begged them relentlessly to release me and let me go home. Their response made my stomach churn horribly. I cant recall exactly what they said to me, but it went something along the lines of This is your home now. You are our little toy, and we will do whatever we want to you. You are never leaving us. Do you understand?. I started sobbing profusely. Margaret and Lacey were completely unmoved, and started to mock me for it. After I was done eating the girls made me quit my job at gunpoint. Then they imprisoned me in a dog cage for the rest of the day. Margaret eventually left for work. I am unaware of what her job is, but she often worked from around 7 AM to around 2 PM. Once Margaret got home, Lacey would leave for work. I also dont know where Lacey worked, but she was usually out of the house from 2PM to 8PM. So I was never alone in the house, and they monitored me like a hawk. That made coming up with escape plans quite difficult. Other than Lacey and Margaret periodically sodomizing me, the rest of the day was uneventful. Unfortunately for me, Lacey and Margaret were very into bondage. They were quite fond of tying me up in a wide variety of ways. So I basically spent 95% of my ordeal chained or tied up in a some way in the basement or attic. To make matters worse, they never followed any safety rules. I cant tell how many bruises I got from being tied up so much. It was a miracle from the heavens that I didnt suffer permanent nerve damage or even lose a limb. I also almost choked to death on my gag twice, but I was saved both times by my captors. I also was kept in miserably cramped cage for quite a bit of the time. There are only a few things that are more miserable then being bound and gagged in a small cage meant for medium sized dogs. After 3 days of pure hell, I finally saw an opportunity to escape. Margaret and Lacey were busy arguing about something that I did not care much to know about. Meanwhile, I was laying on the couch with my hands and ankles tied. I saw the backdoor was only partially closed. I took the opportunity to push myself off the couch, and crawl towards the door. I managed to drag myself outside the house. Once I hauled myself out of their house, I crawled on the forest floor. I hoped that I could encounter some hikers that could rescue me. Sadly, it took them only 10 minutes to figure out I was gone. It only took an additional 10 minutes for my kidnappers to find me. Once they found me, they tied me to a large pole, and carried me back into their house. Lacey then tied me to a tree next to their house, as Margaret ran upstairs. It was a 5 minute wait until Margaret walked out of the house to fetch me and her sister. They then walked me to their upstairs bathroom. I turned out that Margaret was filling up the bathtub in order to torture me. As a punishment for my attempted escape, they repeatedly dunked my head into the bathtub for a few minutes. I literally thought I was going to drown in their bathtub. This had to rank among the most terrifying experiences in my captivity, along with the first time they raped me. After they were done dunking me, Margaret and Lacey dragged me into the basement. They then tied me to a chair. I was tied from shoulders to ankles with rope. The ropes were tied so tightly that I thought I was going to asphyxiate. The next night, I woke myself up. Tired of all the abuse I endured, I decided I was going to escape or die trying. I chewed through my ropes, and untied myself. I quietly sneaked out of their house, and walked into the woods. I hiked through the forest trails, looking for signs of civilization. I eventually reached town and found my way to my apartment. As soon as I walked into my place, I collapsed on my couch. I turned on John Carpenter's The Thing to help calm my nerves. Man, it felt good being home. It was like a weight just was thrown off my shoulders. Embarrassed by being kidnapped and raped by two girls much smaller than me, I foolishly never contacted the authorities. I blamed the whole kidnapping and rape on myself. When I reluctantly open up to people about my experience, they would always tell me that I was somehow lucky that was raped by women. Lucky!?!?!....ARE YOU SHITTING ME!?!?! Lucky is literally the last word I use to describe being violently raped without mercy and treated like a living doll. It took me years to get a peaceful night of sleep. My sense of security took me even longer to recover. I was left with incredibly low self esteem. There would be times that I seriously contemplated suicide. My already alcoholic tendencies increased dramatically. On top of it all, I couldnt find another job, which left me evicted from my apartment. Which in turn left me to live a homeless life for around 9 months. I was stalked by Lacey and Margaret for a few weeks, obviously hoping to recapture me at some point. Without warning however, they suddenly stopped and left me alone. I had no idea why, but I was just relieved that they were out of my life. Around 6 to 8 years later, I found out that the sisters had kidnapped a 13 year old boy. Lacey and Margaret had abducted him around a few weeks after I escaped their clutches. Interestingly just around the time that they stopped stalking me. They did the same shit to him as they did to me, but he wasnt as lucky. The kid survived, but Lacey and Margaret held him captive for nearly 5 years. I cant remember their prison sentencing, but they are still in jail. They will be for several more years to come. I am now a manager at a local Italian restaurant. Although I never started a family or entered a relationship, life has been treating me well. I have plenty of money, a stable home, and I completely recovered from my alcoholism. I found the time to pursue my hobbies in military history, paleontology, politics, and sci-fi and fantasy. All in all, I am completely satisfied with my life now. "
182,vulnerability,nosleep,Appearances Sometimes Really Are Deceiving,0,7qlfiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7qlfiw/appearances_sometimes_really_are_deceiving/,2018-01-16 04:59:57,"I was a member of a creative writing group for some time; twenty people, representing all walks of life. No career writers, just amateurs enjoying the writing experience. We were part of a Facebook group at first, and then some of us thought it would be a good idea to exchange creative writing ideas in person. My first impression was a clich: people werent as *fabulous* in face-to-face interaction, as theyd portrayed themselves on social media. Yeah, imagine my shock. The management of a library in the city center was kind enough to let us use one of the library rooms from 4 to 5 P.M., on Wednesdays. We were supposed to have twenty meetings  one meeting for each group member, so that everyone would have a chance to have their work critiqued by others. There was a bookshelf compartment in the room, where we kept our notebooks for the next meeting. It was 3:45 P.M. I was almost always late, so coming in early was a nice break from the routine for me. I said hello to library staff, and picked up my notebook. Thats when I saw a piece of paper with the ominous message glued to the front. *You stole my idea. As a result, youre going to be punished severely for your bitchy deed. You wont see it coming. See the basement? See the chains? Your guts are going to be hanging out, just like in this drawing. As Stalin said: no person  no problem. There are twenty people in this group. Youll never guess who wrote this!* The message had been printed out. There was no way to tell who had written it. Wait. Did I just pick up someone elses notebook? Check. No, its mine. *What the hell?* Was someone in the group playing mind games with me? Perhaps. We didnt really talk about our personal lives; the group was about exchanging creative writing ideas, not free therapy sessions, so I didnt really know these people. Did someone take their creative writing ideas a step too far? Sure, the line between writing and reality isnt always clear for everyone. Did it point to a psycho? I couldnt rule it out. A psychopath? Well, that would be the worst case scenario. Theyre even worse than malignant narcissists Competition permeates every facet of our lives. Finding a vacant parking spot can be a daunting experience, as many of you undoubtedly know. We live in a competitive society, where psychopaths and narcissists thrive. Did I steal the narcissists thunder? Oh, they hate it! A psychopath hiding behind the mask of sanity? My mind was racing, coming up with all sorts of macabre scenarios. I thought itd be best to shrug it off. But then, I thought: hey, why dont they just check the surveillance? The surveillance, of course, turned out to be a joke. A dead end for my investigation. There was only one sensible course of action left: observe the group members, watch their body language. Panicking, waving hands around  that would be childish and counterproductive. As the group members were walking into the room, I was watching their body language, scanning their movements for any signs of abnormal behavior, which was a difficult task, given the fact it was our fifth meeting. The chairs were arranged in a circle. We all sat down. Do you want to sit in the middle of the circle? I asked Mark. Im fine right here, replied Mark. I wanna stay where I am! Mark was an odd duck. His Facebook profile didnt reveal much about him, but it was pretty clear to everyone in the group, that he must have undergone trauma of some sort. I couldnt put a finger on it, and there was no psychiatrist in the group as far as I knew, but his behavior just screamed PTSD to me. Mark had a high-pitched, shaky, voice - bringing forth all sorts of phantasmagoric imagery. I felt sorry for the guy, whatever his story was. As Mark was reading, we were taking notes that would serve as a foundation of critique later on. Except, I was more interested in discreetly scanning the room. It didnt make any sense to me. Was the psychos mask of sanity so perfect? An hour and a half later, as I was walking to the subway, I was looking around nervously, trying to get to the station as fast as I could. But then it hit me - if this nut job was following me, I couldnt just go back to my apartment! I began walking to a local shopping mall instead. I knew, that  if there was the psycho following me  I had to confuse the heck out of him. I knew I had to lose him in the crowd somehow. I then chose another subway station - with more people around  beneath the mall, so that I wouldnt have to leave it; the psycho was most likely waiting outside. Finally. I got to my apartment complex. I said hello to a security guard, and took the elevator to the seventh floor. I opened the apartment door, carefully eyeing the surroundings. Damn, I muttered to myself. I forgot to tell security not to let any whack jobs anywhere near my apartment, Im gonna have to call them! Meh. Calling could wait. I was safe. I put pasta in the microwave, set the timer to three minutes - and waited. I heard the bell ring. I looked at the timer. 15 seconds left. For fucks sake, I shook my head. Let me eat! Must be the security guy. Except, it wasnt. My gut feeling was right. It was the librarian, contorting her body like a bitch-possessed. I can see you, I said. Video intercoms are awesome inventions, you know? How the hell did you get past security? Youre in serious trouble, lady! Youre a stalker and a nut job. A plain Jane hiding in plain sight! Doesnt get any more clich than this! Now I know what theyre based on! Surprised? the middle-aged woman said. Arent you? You thought its one of your friends, oh, Im sorry  acquaintances? Hiding in plain sight is the best defense. Theyre not my friends, I asserted. Ive no idea how you know where I live my gut feeling was right all along! You stole my idea, the woman hissed. I listen to your chats, you know? I read your story ideas, and you keep stealing my ideas! You wanna steal my fame, my money! I deserve to be published, not some mediocrity like you! I keep working in this fucking library, listening to stupid fuckers  and for what? You say your gut feelings right? Well, guess what, bitch  Ill make sure you wave hi to your guts  gasping for breath, choking on your blood! The wicked must be punished! Well, I paused. Our group meetings are private, theyre none of your business. Youre not the manager, youre just a worker bee. If anything, youre the one stealing ideas, not me! For example, if you see a movie based on a story youve posted on social media, do you really expect to be given credit for the movie? Youve posted the story  its out of your hands! Dont be nave, wake up! Youre just an irresponsible brat, whos green with envy, because she cant come up with her own ideas, so youve developed this victim mentality as an excuse! Pathetic. Securitys going to be here momentarily, by the way. IM COMING IN, BITCH! the woman started pounding on the door. See this butcher knife? Ill gut you with it! Like a pig that you are! A few seconds passed. I wasnt sure whether security was actually coming. I was terrified, mad, and determined to save my life. Fortunately, I was right. The woman spotted a security guard - and lunged at him with the knife. The guard tackled the woman to the ground, but she had managed to injure him in the ensuing chaos. He wasnt bleeding heavily; shed missed all the major arteries. Still, the security guard failed to question the woman properly. If he had questioned her properly, if he had informed me, none of the above would have happened. His excuse? *She was such a nice lady, how the hell could I know?* The librarian was an exceedingly rare kind of psycho: the psycho that follows you back home and wants to actually hurt you. Not only that, she was a woman; women rarely use such violent methods to settle the (imaginary) score. Most psychos operate on the web these days, doing their dastardly deeds under the veil of apparent anonymity. Still. I wasnt convinced. Something just didnt sit right with me. The librarian wasnt a smart woman, it was more likely someone in the group had manipulated her to fixate on me. How? By showering her with compliments, of course; by telling her how beautiful she was, by giving her attention she had craved. She was desperate for validation as a human being, and one of the group members had come up with a plan to use the poor woman as a puppet. Why? I wish I knew. I left the literary group on Facebook, blocked every single group member I had any interaction with on social media  and they never saw me again in the library. One of them was a psychopath  and I didnt want to take any chances. And then it hit me. At one point, Mark had this grin on his face, but we all felt sorry for him, so nobody was paying attention. ''Holy hell,'' I covered my mouth. ''It's him... *duper's delight*... he's the psychopath! Feigning vulnerability to get what he wants!'' Mark was on the prowl for his next victim, no [doubt] (URL "
183,vulnerability,nosleep,Lock the door!,651,7sazu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7sazu6/lock_the_door/,2018-01-23 12:56:13,"I had the strangest roommate in my freshman year of college. Despite being otherwise normal and even a bit shy, Eddy would, every so often, become frantically possessed by a sudden overwhelming need to lock the door. It didn't matter which door, either. Wherever he was when the fit came upon him, he would leap up, run to the closest entrance, and lock it. People who stood in his way were screamed at. Anyone who tried to stop him would get attacked. He became a ranting sweaty madman until his mysterious sense of vulnerability passedbut the moment it was gone, he would apologize profusely, sink timidly into himself, and scurry away embarrassed. For that reason, it was hard to hate him. But it became a little easier to despise him each time I returned home to find myself locked out. Similarly, each time I brought him to a party and he had one of his episodes, I inevitably lost potential romantic interests and friends because I was roommates with *that Eddy guy*. Halfway through the year, after the third almost-girlfriend ghosted me because he scared the shit out of her, I put in for a dorm room transfer and washed my hands of the poor guy. That was almost seven years ago now, so when Eddy messaged me on social media and said he was in town and had run into some travel issues, I decided to give him another shot. I'd always felt sort of felt bad about how I'd treated him in the end. So, I drove half an hour out to his broken-down car and picked him up around one in the morning on a normal Wednesday night three weeks ago. I remember pulling up to the edge of a high cliff-side road to see a skinny silhouette waving at me. He was leaner than I remembered, and somewhat more in shape. My headlights illuminated him fully; I saw his face glisten, and I laughed. That was Eddy alrightsweat was sort of his hallmark. He hefted a duffel bag and ran up to my passenger side before fiddling with the door handle repeatedly. ""Don't pull it when I'm unlocking it,"" I told him. He waited a tick; I pushed the button, and he tried the handle at the same time. ""Oops!"" ""Wait,"" I said again, hitting unlock as I did so. ""Ok, now."" He finally got the door open and clambered in with a nervous laugh. ""Sorry, man."" His long legs folded up a bit as he got situated, and I could see his exposed ankles. ""Thanks for picking me up."" I shrugged. ""No problem at all. Do you know what's wrong with it?"" ""Yeah, the alternator's been having trouble. I think the cold weather finally did her in."" ""Cool."" I gave a slight cough to clear my throat, and we drove in awkward silence until he brought up a joke from the past. Just like that, we slipped into that first semester seven years before, with all its new experiences, hilarious misadventures, and surprise pressures. By the time we reached my place, I'd remembered the good things about him, and I was glad I'd decided to help him out. On the way in, I pointed to the couch. ""That's probably the best spot in the apartment. I'm trying to save money these days, so the place is pretty small."" ""Rent these days, eh?"" he asked, before placing his duffel bag down and sitting carefully on the couch to evaluate its softness. ""This'll do fine. I can't thank you enough. I'll get out of your hair in the morning as soon as the repair shops open."" ""No problem at all, Eddy."" ""Actually, I go by Ed now."" Good for him. He'd definitely grown as a person from the socially fearful outcast I remembered. I grinned. ""Then no problem at all, *Ed.*"" I went to bed back in my room without a single worry. It seemed like his issues had been resolved by maturity or medication, and who was I to judge someone for trouble beyond their control? That was in the past. Of course, I was completely wrong. Around four in the morning, I awoke and got up to get a glass of water from the kitchen. I knew my own apartment, so my footsteps were pretty much silent, but Eddy still sighed and stirred on the couch as if something was bothering him. I stood by the fridge, glass in hand, as he whimpered, struggled, and then leapt up. In a mad terrified dash, he ran to my front door and slammed the deadbolt. He gave out a deep breath of relief and remained there with his head down while I tried to figure out the best way to let him know I was present. Well, if he was having a fit, there was no good way to do this. ""Ed?"" He seized up mightily, gasped in as much air as his lungs could hold, and then slowly turned around. His face was obscured in dimness, since the only light came from various red or green pinpoints on the television and microwave, but I could tell he was sweating profusely. After a long moment, he managed to breathe again. Finally, he said, ""Oh. Hey. Didn't see you there."" ""Yeah."" I put my glass down on the counter. ""You alright, dude?"" He meant his laugh to sound nonchalant, but it just came out nervous and high-strung. ""Same old, same old, you know how it is."" I went around the counter and approached him. He moved back a few steps, and I touched the door. ""This is a safe neighborhood. There's nothing to worry about."" He nodded awkwardly. Unsure I believed his calmness, I moved my hand to the deadbolt. I wanted to make sure he wasn't going to get weird while I was asleep if I went back to bed. He made a sudden half-halted leap toward me, hand out. ""Don't!"" At that moment, I was starting to remember the times I'd seen him attack people during an episode. ""There's nothing out there!"" I gripped the deadbolt to turn it back toward me, but a very slight shadow moved somewhere in my vision. The hell? No, it couldn't be. Reacting rapidly, I put my eye to the peephole. My brain made sense of the curved panorama just in time to see a sliver of a silhouette disappear along the sidewalk to the left. Eddy moved closer, bringing the smell of his panicked sweat with him. ""Did you see something?!"" ""No,"" I lied. I kept staring out through the peephole, watching the quiet night in my otherwise unremarkable neighborhood. The asphalt glimmered darkly under the stars while distant lamp posts cast long shadows across grass. ""Remind me again, what makes you suddenly want to lock the door?"" Now that I wasn't actively trying to unlock it, he seemed slightly less manic. ""I never told you because I thought you were starting to hate me, but, uh, when I was eight years old I had a sudden feeling that I should lock the door. I didn't, and, uh"" He shivered. ""some men broke in a moment later and robbed us."" I frowned at his glistening shadowed face. ""Jesus. Was anyone hurt?"" He nodded between audible breaths. ""My mom."" Another three breaths passed in the otherwise silent darkness. ""She didn't make it."" ""Damn."" I didn't know what else to say. ""Justdamn. No wonder."" ""No wonder?"" Before I could elaborate, the sound of something skittering outside reached us. He turned and listened in one rapid motion like a startled animal, and I had to admit, I was none too calm either. Still, I couldn't risk amping up his anxiety. I *did* want to sleep again at some point. He whispered, ""Where was that?"" ""It sounded like it came from the back."" I whispered, too. ""I'm sure it's nothing. Let's go."" I led the way, and we crept through my apartment. He made sure to mimic my steps, but he was still louder than me, and I nearly winced at every creak. By the time we entered my bedroom and reached a rear window, my nerves were raw. The window was fitted with stops that prevented it opening all the way; I usually left it open for the breeze, even in the winter. We sat in total darkness in front of that thin rectangle of cool air. Looking and listening, we sought any sign of what had made the noise. Have you ever actually listened to the sounds of the city at night? What I'd gotten used to as silence was actually anything but. Soft wind stirred a rustling in the nearby bushes. A train blew a horn in the unknown distance. A dog barked twice. Briefly, an ambulance siren trekked across the horizon. Under it all, a constant low haunting wail emanated across the world from the nearby highway. I'd always hated that noise whenever I'd accidentally become aware of it because I thought it sounded like a thousand ghosts screaming from very far away, but I wasn't about to tell Eddy that. It was about that time that my gaze landed upon something among the trees. When I'd first seen the closely bunched collection of white pinpoints, I'd assumed they were reflections from somewhere. Now, though, as I watched them carefully, I was nearly certain I was seeing them *rotate* upward. It was as if someone was spinning a wheel of lights whose narrow side was facing us; from the size and distance, the wheel must have been two or three feet in diameter. I whispered, ""What *is* that?"" After finding it with help from my pointing finger, Eddy's stare deepened. ""I've never seen anything like it. What could that possibly be?"" I couldn't make sense of it. While I watched, it grew slightly dimmer, then slightly brighter. ""It's definitely casting light around it. I think I saw some leaves above it."" ""Is it changing?"" Eddy clutched my wrist as he stared at those strange up-wheeling lights. ""Is it getting bigger?"" I couldn't be sure, but how could it be getting bigger unless Jumping up, I placed my fingers on either side of the window and brought it down swiftly and quietly. Then, I turned the latch and locked it before pulling the nearby cord and sliding the blinds down. ""Whatever it is, we're secure in here. We'll be fine. It's probably just some kids playing with light toys or something."" He sighed and opened his mouth to speak, but a visible change came over the silhouetted contours of his head. An instant later, he leapt over and slammed my bedroom door shut. The boom echoed loudly in my ears. I demanded to know what he was doing as he locked my door. Eddy turned around and put his back to it. I could tell he was wild-eyed from the way he whispered. ""Be quiet! It's in your apartment!"" The adrenaline spike from the slammed door made me a little angrier than I wanted to be. ""*What?* What's in my apartment?"" His frantic whisper was nearly a hiss. ""I don't *know!* I just know that we have to keep this door locked!"" I was fuming, but if I spoke, I would have said something I regretted, so we stood there in the dark for a solid few minutes. I began to calm down as those minutes passed, and, once I was in control again, I opened my mouth to whisper. ""Hey, I'm sorry, I"" The floor creaked outside my bedroom door. I froze. Eddy backed away from the door and faced it alongside me. It was nothing but a dark rectangle in front of us, but I stared at it for *any* hint of motion or change. The crazy thing was, I had no idea what I was even looking or listening for. What could possibly have been out there? Not only had we left the front door locked, there'd been no sound of entry, forced or otherwise. If there *was* someone or something out there, how had they gotten in? Dim light began to move across the walls of my room, and I waited for the sound of a passing carbut none came. As we watched the door, brighter light began to roll upwards around us, again as if someone was spinning some sort of lit wheel. It didn't take long for us to realize that whatever we'd seen in the distance outside was growing closer to my window. Beyond the blinds, something was coming nearer, but neither of us dared look away from my bedroom door for even an instant. Then, I saw it. Between moving lines of shadow and light, I could have sworn my door handle had changed angles. I backed away; a look at the blinds showed *definite* lights spinning closer, as if they were right outside the window and about to come up against it. Grabbing Eddy by the shoulder, I pulled him with me into my tiny one-person bathroom. He closed and locked the door the instant we were inside. My heart was hammering in my chest to the point of actual pain. Grunting my whisper, I asked, ""What the *hell* is happening?"" He shook his head. ""I have no idea."" ""Are you sure?"" I asked him, squeezing his wrists. ""This all started with that robbery and attack on your mom, right?"" ""No,"" he whispered back. My bathroom door was flush to the outside carpet, but hints of rotating light began to appear beneath, as if that insane impossible wheel had somehow entered my room without opening or breaking the window. None of this made sense! ""It has to be you somehow."" ""No!"" ""It has to be!"" I shook him violently. ""Is your fear making it real? Is something after you?"" ""You don't understand,"" he whimpered. ""I didn't finish the story. It didn't *start* with that incident. I'd been getting the urge to lock doors for years before that. The first time I didn'tthat's when they came."" I couldn't understand exactly what he meant. ""The robbers?"" He shook his head. Oh, god. ""They weren't robbers, were they?"" He shook his head again. My voice dropped to a razor hiss. ""*What's out there, Eddy?*"" All he could say was, ""They want in."" Something about the way he said it finally made me understand. ""It's not about the bathroom door, is it?"" I looked out through it, thinking of my bedroom door, and my apartment door beyond that. ""It's not about the literal entrance to the room you're in."" The rotating light below began intensifying as whatever was out there approached our hiding spot. His panicked grip on my hands told me I was right. ""Then why do you lock real doors, Eddy?"" I shook him until he looked at me despite his fear. ""Is it a metaphor? Does it make you feel better? Does it close them off somehow? *Why isn't it working this time?*"" He began to cry, sending mixed drops of tears and sweat onto my forearms. ""I couldn't take it anymore. I'm tired of the constant struggle."" The high cliff-side curb where I'd picked him up flashed through my mind clear as crystal, and the fear that had been building since the moment I saw him wake suddenly left me. He'd gone to that cliff for a reason, and he'd probably had second thoughts as he stood there alone in the dark. Completely calm, I asked, ""Your car didn't break down, did it?"" He shook his head. ""You messaged everyone, didn't you?"" He nodded. ""And I was the only one that responded."" He rocked back and forth in front of me. ""I just couldn't take it anymore. They want in. They're always out there. They want in. I always lock them out, but they never stop. I'm tired of being terrified every minute of every day!"" Air began moving under the door as the lights reached peak intensity outside; whatever it was, it was almost upon us. ""There's nowhere to go, Eddy. Let's open that door. Maybe you're constantly terrified because *they want you that way.* Let's face them. Let's be unafraidand it might just work."" He didn't respond, but I dragged him to his feet. I had never wanted to do anything less in my entire life, but there was nowhere else to go. With a firm grip on his wrist, I reached forward with my free hand, unlocked the door, and flung it open. I don't care if you believe me. That's not the point. But I'll tell you what I saw: the lights were *eyes*. They were bright enough to obscure the grotesque *moving* body beneath. I still can't understand how it was spinning like that. Snakelike curves connected things in shadow. Every blazing pinpoint swung up, flashed us with images of hatred and fear and paranoia, and then continued past, moving on too fast to process. That was the thing: the images were lies. My girlfriend was cheating on me. My teachers at school had thought of me as a failure. My boss hated me and only put up with me because he hadn't found a replacement yet. But each individual lie raced past too quickly to pick apart and resist. I knew they weren't true, but they just kept coming. At the heart of this creature, I sensed a hunger for fear; I kicked a wide grasping mouth away and jerked Eddy out with me, getting a few feet past whatever the hell that thing was. It turned toward us again as I flung the bedroom door open. I'd been right about the door handle turning. That much I knew in that instant. The madly spinning shadows and light failed to illuminate the beast that lay beyond that door. Immediately, I knew the thing behind us was just a servant to *this*, because this was so, so, so, so much worse. The only thing I truly registered was a melted face. Its misshapen gaze seized the beating heart muscles in my chest and filled me with absolute terror, as if it had the power to reach inside me and dredge out all the blackness and animal fear in the corners of my human soul. I knew: these things didn't want in to my apartment or my bedroom. It wasn't so simple as that. They wanted in to *our world*, and Eddy was some sort of conduit for that nightmarish goal. He always had been. I had the knife-keen vicious sense that I needed to kill him immediately. But maybe that urge came from the emotions those creatures were giving off. As the sludge specter with the melted face began a rising scream that threatened to deafen me, I did what I had to do: I grabbed the heavy lamp from my nightstand and smashed my window clean through. I threw Eddy out a moment after, and then pulled my arm from a burning grip of caustic acid to escape. I could only lay on the ground screaming as Eddy did the rest by dragging me away from that place. That was three weeks ago. The burn from the grasping hand of that sludge creature refused to heal. The doctors at the emergency room couldn't make heads or tails of it. Something had burned the shape of a melted hand around my forearmand continued to burn as they studied it. They could find no acid, no catalyst, and no heat. Eventually, they had to release me. Of course, their lack of understanding didn't lessen the hefty medical bill any. I parted from Eddy the next day, telling him to stay strong and remain unafraid. We'd beaten the forces of hatred and paranoia personified and escaped with our lives by charging through rather than hiding. He seemed unconvinced, and repeatedly said that *we* hadn't done anything, that *I'd* dragged him out of there, and that without me he didn't know if he could do it. ""But I have a life to live,"" I told him. ""Gotta pay off that ER bill and find a new place."" He understoodor at least, he said that he did. Today, I saw Eddy again. He didn't know I was there, because it was just a chance encounter on a city street. He was in a bar watching a television above and drinking a beer. I stood outside and watched him through the window for a moment, awed at the change. He was sitting with new friends. He was wry, confident, and completely ignoring the door of the bar instead of nervously looking at the entrances every so often. It was such a positive change that I actually went inside with a smile. But I stopped about ten feet behind him as, over the noise of the bar television above, I began to hear what he was talking about. His words floated in the air with a nearly perceptible stench; sludge dripped from the back of his sentences, burning the ears of those near his group. His new friends agreed happily and haughtily, replying noxiously in kind. A disgruntled customer nudged me as he passed. ""Ignore those assholes."" I turned away with misting eyes and walked out into the chill night. I hadn't saved Eddy at all. He'd found refuge not in standing up to those creatures, but by going down a path I hadn't even considered. I looked through the window of that bar one last time. The misshapen creature that had burned me with its touch grinned back from the shadowed corners behind the television. It had found the entry into our world that it had craved for so long. I'd unlocked the door, but it was Eddy that had let them in. --- [Blog](URL [FB](URL [Tw](URL"
184,vulnerability,nosleep,Liberian Fever,12,7tijsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7tijsw/liberian_fever/,2018-01-28 16:54:51,"November 2017 When I was starting out as a journalist I spent days hanging around courts, trying to get into the gallery in hope of finding a good story. In a weird way this feels a bit nostalgic; the smell of the polished oak tables, the contrast of harsh steps on wooden floorboards and muffled movements cushioned by the gowns of barristers and judges. Its like returning to an old school classroom. If I close my eyes I could just about convince myself I was back in Mrs Whites class in Aberystwyth. Oh God I just want to go home. I just want people to stop looking at me. The hum of chatter is dying as the clocks approach 9. Must hold my nerve; this wasnt my fault. Or at least not all of it, and it was certainly not intended to be malicious. Breathe. Remember to just tell the truth of what happened. Ive got all my clippings together. Together they tell most of the story. But not the important bits, not the human side of what happened. I cant bring myself to think about that. Ms Bethan Cerys Williams. Please stand. Oh God, oh God its back to school again, having my full name read out by an aggrieved teacher. How nice that would be now compared to this stern judge staring me down right now. I think Im standing up, its hard to tell what my legs are doing to be honest  my body feels very small and far away right now. I can hear my solicitor speaking on my behalf. She maintains my not guilty plea. She was an innocent young professional, Your Honour, caught up in something she didnt understand. She couldnt have known. Thats what scares me the most; maybe I did know what I was starting. I told myself it would be a sociological experiment, I sold it to my editors as such and said wed be one of those small groups that become part of urban legends. But on some level I must have expected, or wanted, for it to get out of hand. That was the whole point, show the silly British public how easily manipulated they could be by the tabloid press. I shuffle across the courtroom to take the stand. Im too scared to walk properly, scared that if I let my feet leave the floor too much Ill give in to the spinning in my head and drop like a sack of potatoes. Somehow I make it and clear my throat, ready to plead for mercy. It started in February of this year. Thats when the first germ of the idea popped into my head. It was so simple, sitting on the tube one bleak Wednesday morning, listening to my fellow commuters sniffle and cough in our confined carriage. The last of the winter bugs were still doing the rounds. I wrapped my scarf up over my nose and mouth and tried to push the image of the viruses floating through the air out of my mind. I blame those cleaning product adverts, the ones that show germs in luminous green and if you dont buy their product half of the green will remain forever. The man next to me sat reading the mornings free newspaper, opened to a page on the dangers of flu being passed by shared office appliances. They had run out of stories to write about people needing to wash their hands more and had decided to rehash the story but this time focus on photocopiers and printers and warn people that these were harbouring all the bugs that their dirty colleagues werent washing off their hands. Exactly the sort of rubbish to pique the interest of germaphobes like me. Ignore it Beth youre not falling for that crap today. I had only been working at the newspaper for a month at that point, and I was struggling to make my mark. I knew I had to produce a good story soon or I could kiss my internship and any chance of a proper career in the media goodbye forever. It was that morning after leaving the tube that the idea began to percolate, and by mid-morning Id cornered Spencer at the kettle during a quick tea break to ask his opinion. The idea was simple: was there any journalistic value to conducting a bit of an experiment, looking at how easily influenced the public are when it comes to reporting illness? Spencer took a bit of convincing but as I explained more about the implications, the fact that it could be conducted like a psychology study, that doctors and researchers and the government could all be interested in what it showed, I could see him start to take it more seriously. I think he, like me, had been drawn into that new American show about the FBI mavericks studying psychopaths  they started with an unusual idea didnt they? If we could secretly influence behaviour motivated by fear imagine the implications! And what if it worked for other scenarios  it could be used in future to encourage people to behave in all manner of different, more positive ways. It could test the real power of the media. By that afternoon Spencer has called our editor Mr Richards to request a meeting. I went along ready to pitch the idea all over again but it turned out that Spencer had already gotten there first and explained a great deal via email without my knowledge. I liked Spencer, but bloody hell, these posh boys are always the same; entitled, ambitious to prove themselves, regardless of whether they were actually doing so or just stealing ideas from others. I knew going into it that modern journalism was a rich kids game, especially to work in the nationals. There wasnt much competition for spots on the local papers back in small town Wales but here in London I was one of maybe about three people under the age of 30 who didnt have a dad or an uncle or an old family friend in the business. One day this will pay off I told myself, just suck it up for now, campaign for equality in your 50s when your career is safer. Right now no one is going to listen to some 25 year old girl whos going to be regarded as some moaning harpie with a chip on her shoulder. Whatever, I thought, the main thing was that my idea was being heard and it was time to get to work. We created a small team of people, with strict rules about who was allowed to know what we were doing; any leaks would make the whole thing a silly joke and we could forget any chance of getting any real results. We worked late into the night, under the fluorescent bars of the conference room, brainstorming the basics of our new creation. Eventually we settle on a few key basics: - It would be named Liberian Fever (after Ebola any illness associated with Africa spiked the fear response in the public, and we wanted a country that people knew of but didnt view as a holiday destination). - It would have some vague symptoms that could be anything (stomach cramps, high temperature, a sore throat). - Importantly it had to have at least one stand out symptom so that we could separate out the people who were genuinely ill from the hypochondriacs who fell for it. Eventually we decided that a couple of key symptoms of Liberian Fever would be blood shot eyes and sudden hair loss. - Of course we had to say it was highly contagious. - In terms of severity I was wary of being too cruel, and of course we didnt want to be accused of trying to start mass panic. Sadly Spencer and the others did not agree and I relented. We added a high fatality rate to the list. Im ashamed to admit now that we laughed at it. The next morning wed planted a small piece a few pages into the paper; New African flu the latest health worry. It was enough to plant the seed but was brief on the details. There were a lot of comments from sources, alluding to an outbreak in an unspecified region of West Africa, and we made sure to include concerns from government insiders that immigration could risk spreading it to Europe. In 2017 its as easy as ABC to stoke fears relating to immigration. Sad but true. By the evening edition, it was on page 2 of our daily rag, slightly bigger article this time, hinting at a couple of symptoms of this new and potentially catastrophic disease, as well as officially Christening it: Liberian Fever. By the third day we figured that enough people had probably seen the first couple of articles that it was time to hit them with it. Front page news. Threats of an imminent outbreak. Scaremongering claims about the various routes into the UK from West Africa. Most importantly, it was time to give the public our symptoms; Top things you need to watch out for! It didnt take long for other news outlets to pick it up. In the old days of journalism some of them might have tried to verify the claims, but now everything has to be reported 5 minutes before its announced, and there are more journalists out there than you can count, spewing any old clickbait crap onto the internet, or stealing content from Reddit. Even the reputable sources are getting sloppy about their due diligence in an effort to keep up. Within a couple of days it was the subject of daytime TV phone in discussions, from frightened mothers wondering if they should keep their kids out of school and what to do with Nana in her care home  is she safe? What measures are hospitals and care homes putting in place to prevent an outbreak? Government ministers were flustered and caught off guard, trying to figure out where the reports of the disease had come from. As with the journalists, the politicians in 2017 Britain are not known for their intelligence or ability to respond well under pressure. From out office break room we would watch the news report and feel both like naughty school children who had played a prank, and like intellectual wonders who had tricked an entire country it seemed. People would be so impressed when we told them. In the age of fake news this would be a much bigger headline when we revealed how easily duped they had all been. Sure it caused a little worry, but we would have exposed bigger problems; in the media, in politics, and amongst ordinary people and their vulnerability to manipulation. We were excited and organised a meeting for the following week, ready to decide on when and how we would reveal the truth. We never got to that meeting in the end. People like to accuse journalists in London of being part of the elite and out of touch with reality, which I really hated as a struggling new arrival to the city, living in a cold bedsit, eating cereal for dinner, but in this case we really didnt know what was going on. It took so little time for people to start showing up in GP surgeries and A&amp;E wards, listing their symptoms and clutching at copies of tabloids, sections highlighted. Some of them had plain old regular flu and had been scared by the news stories. Some were fine but had managed to convince themselves they had this new plague. A few sleepless nights and a few tears will bring on those bloodshot eyes, and some people had even been fussing with their hair so much that the sudden hair loss was starting to appear. This was technically what we had intended to happen, to highlight how easily swayed people were, but it got out of hand so much quicker than expected. Hysterical people looked for reassurance from medical professionals, who themselves didnt know what to say and couldnt offer any treatment. The hysterical people became apoplectic. Then the first suicide occurred. As soon as the news reached us, Spencer and I were determined to shut this down. Id doubted Spencers empathy at times but I could see that he was scared by this and felt bad for judging him. We both ran straight to Mr Richards office to plan the emergency announcement and how best to get it heard by as many people as possible. We were ready to apologise, to explain. Mr Richards wasnt having any of it. Until someone proved a link then it was just hearsay. The sort of person who did that after a few news reports clearly had other issues. The lawyers, he reassured us, would make sure that no direct responsibility could be traced to us. Spencer and I sat, mouths agape, as we listened to our editors cold, business-like response. It was a running joke in the office that he had no respect for the general public, calling them the great unwashed or oiks, but to see it so clearly was horrific. I could have sworn I saw a little smirk across his face as he proclaimed this silly woman to be deranged and not our problem. Julie Rutherford. That was the name of the silly woman. Theyre reading her name in court, along with other heart-breaking details I already know. 48 year old mother of two, a history of anxiety and depression, working a stressful job. Our work pushed her over the edge. Thats not what the court is saying, but its what I know. Julie, Timothy, Pamela, Tracy, Gordon. The names of victims and all the details are relayed for the journalists around me, who look down on Spencer and I as if were scum, as if theyre different from what we were. How many of them work for papers that repeated our claims? How many bothered to check their facts, on that or any number of scare stories before or since? Mr Richards has had his day in court. His paper has been fined to the tune of hundreds of thousands. A drop in the ocean of his wealth. I guess that was the reason for the smirk that evening in his office, he already knew he was safe with his millions. Spencer and I, however, well our careers are over. But fuck that, we know what we did. It might have been an accident but we know that ultimately we started the chain of events. This was us, and career prospects are the last thing I can think about right now. Its been 3 months since the trial ended. No jail time or fines for me as an individual. The judge did at least try to show some sympathy for my financial and life situation, and my statement seemed to get through to him. He believed that I was sorry, that I regretted everything; that my life was destroyed too. It didnt do much to assuage my guilt that he could see I was sorry, it doesnt change the past. It didnt change the way other people felt about me either. No matter what the truth, no matter how unglamorous my life, I was still always portrayed as that stuck up, posho journalist bitch. A short time copywriting in London and apparently I had reached the upper echelons of society as far as the public and the press were concerned. With no job prospects and my face in the press I quickly realised the London dream was over. I packed up and headed back for Wales, hoping to find friendly faces of my hometown, people willing to listen to my side of the story. But when I arrived it was worse than I could have imagined. My own parents had been targeted by vandals, spat at in the street, ostracised by their small, beloved community. Because of me. I couldnt watch them suffer, and I could see it was making it worse to have me around. They tried to pretend otherwise but I could see it in their eyes  the shame they felt when they talked about selling up and moving elsewhere. I had to get out. Thats how Ive ended up here, in my small rented cottage in Dorset. I left in a hurry, packing only a few items. I found a picturesque house near the Jurassic Coast. I used what money I had to pay for a 5 night stay, and filled the house with good food and wine. 4 days of bliss, walking the beaches alone, eating well for the first time since I left home at 18  a few days of what life could have been. And here we are, my stay here is almost up. The news has moved on to other scandals by now. Another politician caught in a compromising position. But for anyone who cared to google Liberian Fever, they would forever see the name of its victims: 5 needless deaths. And tonight one more to join them. Hopefully now people will know that I am truly sorry. "
185,vulnerability,nosleep,One Million Cats (part 1),5,7vjt4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7vjt4z/one_million_cats_part_1/,2018-02-06 12:28:26,"When I was 15, my dad moved our family from Texas to Michigan. An up-and-coming clinical psychologist, he was given the opportunity to open his own practice up in Livonia (about a 20-minute drive from Detroit, for those unfamiliar with the area) and we all ended up living around there for a few years. Eventually we moved back to Texas when my dad got an even better offer, but I remember those three years feeling almost like an entire lifetime all on their own. It was almost as if, for that brief period of time, reality itself just seemed to slow down and my family lived in this totally different world for a while. Or maybe things just seem to move more slowly when youre a teenager. Who knows. In any case, high school was my life back then, just like it probably is for pretty much anyone that age, and Id just finished 9th grade at Georgetown High a few weeks before the night my dad gathered us all in the kitchen to sit at the table while he told us the news. I remember being completely devastated, and pretty angry with him and my mom for doing this to us (I was pretty dramatic back then, a habit I still retain to this day albeit somewhat tempered nowadays). It only makes senseId had the same friends since about 6th grade and gone to middle school with all of them and was only just starting to get a hold on navigating through the pitfalls of high school, and suddenly my mom and dad decide to drop this giant fucking bomb right on top of me. And what about Jesse? My little brother had just graduated 6th grade and was headed into middle school himself, but now we were moving to the complete other ass-end of the country and hed have to make new friends. No 11-year-old wants to make new friends, much less in a completely different state. When I said all this to my parents, hoping in vain that my sad pathetic protests would change their minds, my mom reminded me that she had friends and family all over Texas as well, and that my brother and I werent the only ones who stood to lose something here. She also made the fair point that the only one who wouldnt be sacrificing anything would be Chloe, my sister, who I think was only about 5 at this point, and she was just kind of a free spirit who didnt really care too much about things (a trait shes also carried over into her adult life, at least in a more reigned-in, subdued fashion). While my mom was trying her best to be all hard-ass about the whole thing (shes always tried to mask her sadness and vulnerability by acting tough, something she probably picked up from *her* mom), my dad decided to play good cop, and so he seemed to be very apologetic and sad about the whole thing, saying things like I love you all so much and I just want to take care of you all and yadda yadda, all of which I remember finding really irritating at the time, even more irritating than my moms tough love bullshit, because in my mind, this was his fucking fault anyway. Now that Im older, I totally get why he took the job. Matter of fact Id probably jump at such an opportunity if it ever came my way, and even back then I could see it in his eyes that it hadnt been the easiest decision for him. Im sure he didnt want to completely uproot his childrens lives, but of course I didnt understand that at the timeand how could I? I was 15. Im almost 30 now, so Ive thankfully matured somewhat (somewhat being the operative word here since I still live with the folks, but hey whatcha gonna do). And so for the next couple of months or so, we gradually started packing away all of our things, all our furniture, all our keepsakes, our silverware, our TVs, radios, my PS2 (which doubled as my DVD player at the time), my bros Gamecube, my soccer gear, Jesses baseball stuff, the family room dual-deck DVD player that also played VHS tapes (pretty sure they stopped making those like a year later or some shit), our DVD and tape library, photo albums, garden tools, books, beds, dressers, everything you could think of. Slowly but surely it was all shipped off to what was to be our new home, the house in Livonia that my mom and dad had spent the previous few weeks picking out and then flying out to tour the thing before deciding that it was the right fit. Theyd taken several photos of the place with my dads digital camera, and uploaded it all to the computer after coming home so us kids could see it tooand I had to admit, the house looked rather nice. My thought at the time was that it would probably be a *great* house for someone to live inyou know, some *other* family that wasnt us. But I still didnt want to go. As I watched our old house steadily become more and more empty over the next several weeks, I can remember feeling a heavy lump in my throat, and a horrible sinking sensation deep down in the pit of my stomach. What was supposed to have been another relaxing summer with my middle school buds had now become a sad summer of goodbyes, my last summer with them, probably forever. This was it, this was all we had, and despite spending every single possible free moment I could get my hands on with my friends those last few weeks, I still felt like I hadnt done enough with them. Those last days ticked on until they were finally over, and there was nothing I could do to stop them. The sad truth about life is that theres never enough time. Not much later, our house reverted to its original empty state, with its off-white walls and hardwood floors and overhead incandescents being the only things of note in terms of visuals, ready to be moved into and occupied by the next person, whomever it would be, and whomever it *would* be I knew I would hate them forever for stealing my home. *Our* home. On our last day there, I stood in what had been the living room, now completely emptythere wasnt even anything hanging over the mantle above the fireplace anymore, which was something I couldnt even fathom after years of looking at the various random knick-knacks and collectors items my mom and dad had put on display there. The whole entire building was completely bare. Naked. Exposed. And Id probably never see it again. I remember very clearly that brother and sister both had their own different reactions to all this: Jesse was definitely a little sad to be leaving his friends, but he was also really into geography and learning about new places so he also saw this all as a great opportunity to experience life somewhere else, even if it was just another state in the same country. I swear hes got those wanderlust genes inside of him, because hes still quite the traveler today. He even went to college in Seattle, which I was kind of surprised by personally since hed shown some vague interest in Austin after we moved back there. I guess the travelers spirit just never left him. I enjoy traveling too, but I can rarely drag myself out of the house to actually go somewhere. Im a lot more lazy than my siblings, which might be a bit sad considering that Im the oldestbut fuck it, I guess. My sister Chloe did not, and still doesnt, give a fuck. She was only 5 and living in her own little world of toys and games at the time when all this was going on, and I think she figured that as long as she could still keep doing things her way, she didnt give a flying hoot in hell where we lived. Out of interest, and since Im documenting all this, I have asked her a few times if she remembers any of it very clearly, and she says she remembers glimpses of the old Georgetown house, but other than that her earliest decipherable childhood memories are those of Sterling Heights, and Oakland and Macomb counties. She actually had a little bit of an emotional crisis herself when we finally moved back to Georgetown but from what I remember she managed to get over it pretty quickly. Lucky her, I guess. Before we left to catch our flight to Detroit, I stood there in the emptied-out living room, staring at a corner where the off-white walls met. This was the corner where wed always put our Christmas tree, every year, for as long as I could remember. The sinking feeling in my stomach sank even further, and an overwhelming sadness came over me. My parents had bought this house before I was even born. This was my point of origin, my genesis, my stomping grounds. As a little kid Id imagined whole rooms in this house to be other worlds, the back yard a desert where Id been a traveler searching for the lost oasis, in truth a patch of grass. Our pool had been the ocean and Id sometimes pretend to be a pirate, and my pirate vessel had been a big pink floatie raft Id gotten for my 6th birthday. Sometimes the floor of the living room was an active volcano, and Id hop from one couch to the other, trying not to fall in and succumb to the deadly molten rock. When Id gotten older Id had my 12th birthday here, the first one right before middle school, and me and my friends thought we were hot shit for not being in grade school anymore. The year before that Id had my first period, which at the time was *not* so cool, in fact it was pretty fucking unpleasant to be honest, but at the same time I felt that it was a sign of my maturing, of my growth as a person and as a woman, and I looked forward to my teen years head-strong and with nervous excitement. Even with the toughness of middle school and other seemingly horrifying changes that puberty brought with it, through it all I felt that the house was my rock, my stronghold, and I would always be safe there. And finally, as I approached the 9th grade, it was now to be the place in which I would practice having my own home, as I was now trailing not far behind from adult life. This would be the place for more mature (or so I thought) activities, like high school parties and boyfriends and cooking, and all that other bullshit I thought made a person grown-up. This place had been my reality, my entire universe. And now it was time for me to leave it, for good. As my mom, my dad, my brother, and my sister all came downstairs and took long looks of their own, they started filing out the door one by one, and I took one last long look at the entire area, running through every memory in my mind, every holiday spent here, every milestone, every thing my dad or my mom did that made me laugh, or cry, or whatever, just everything I could remember, and as it all went through my mind I just knew that I couldnt take it anymore, and I started crying. I felt my face bunch up and tears start to stream down my cheeks, and I tried to stay quiet so no one would hear me. I was too old for this, I thought, 15 was *way* too old for someone to cry like this, but I couldnt contain my sobs. When it started to hit me that once I turned away and walked out that front door, I wouldnt be coming back, I cried even harder, and felt my entire body just kind of lock up, paralyzed, physically refusing to take the next step. I couldnt go. I wouldnt. And then I felt something reach around me, wrapping around my shoulders, hugging me. I stopped crying momentarily, mostly out of confusion, and looked down to see that it was a pair of arms, my mothers arms, I turned my head and saw her face, looking right past me, staring at the same empty walls Id been staring at. Her eyes were red and puffy like mine. She was crying too. She kept holding me there for just a minute or two, and I held onto her as well, looking back at the walls, and neither of us said anything to each other. Then we both sort of just knew it was time to go. She led me out the front door, holding my hand, and we left our old house for the last time. Ive driven by that house a few times now since we moved back, just to check it out. Its only about six blocks away. These days, a 30-something married couple with a preteen son and a toddler daughter live there. When I was 15, the mere thought of someone else moving into my old house made my blood boil. But now I dont feel anything. No anger, no attachment, no nostalgia. Nothing. Its just a house.  Fast forward a couple years. By this point wed moved to an even newer house just slightly north of Detroit, in beautiful and quiet Sterling Heights (mom and dad had rented the Livonia house so they could spend some time saving up with the intention of buying another place, and this new place had been their purchase of choice). It was mid-November and Id just started my senior year at Sterling Heights High School, sitting right there on 15 Mile, in an open and airy residential neighborhood, right across from the park where my sister Chloes junior softball team played. Despite experiencing a period of low-grade depression when wed first arrived in the area, Id managed to settle in quite nicely and make a decent amount of friends in school (staying at the same high school for 2 years straight probably also helped out a ton with that). My teenage angst had proved to be unwarrantedI liked Michigan. A lot, in fact. The area we were in was gorgeous for one thingLivonia and Sterling Heights and all the other surrounding towns were just as pretty and serene as anything back in good old Texas, if not even more so, and the houses here had a lot more color to them than the ones in our old neighborhood. Even better, since it was now the middle of fall, the leaves on all the trees were bright orange and bright yellow and the look it gave the neighborhood couldnt be more gorgeous. Im not exaggerating when I say thisquite often it looked like we were living in a painting. And I loved it. We didnt get these picturesque autumn seasons back in Texasusually wed just get a little bit of rain and then suddenly the trees were all barren and then everything turned gray and dead until about March. Yes, it was freezing cold in Michigan, and yes, it would more than likely start snowing soon, but I was fine with that toowe didnt have snow back in Texas, either, at least not in the area wed come from. And much to my own surprise (as well as that of both my parents), I found myself really enjoying the snow. I liked playing in it with my brother and sister, I liked walking through it with my friends, hell I even liked shoveling it out of the goddamn driveway. It was fun. Who would have expected that? By now youre probably wondering what the point of all this is. I admit Im harping on about the good old days somewhat, but I just want to paint a clear picture in your head of what my life was like back then. Because as much as I enjoyed my familys time living in Michigan, it wasnt exactly all perfect. Most of the people who lived in our neighborhood and on our block in particular were really nice and really friendly, including our next-door neighbors on both sides, and how often does that happen? One of the neighbors right across from us, however, was not so great. And her name was Noreen. Noreen was an old lady, like super old, probably in her mid 80s though I never really cared quite enough to ask. Did anyone even know? Maybe she was only like 50, but had bad genes or something. It could happen. The first thing to know about Noreen was that she was fucking *mean.* Like one of those crazy mean old bitches. Shed sit out on her front porch with one of her cats, and give anyone who walked by a dirty look for no reason, and my mom said if you ever ran into her at the grocery store or something and said good morning to her shed just roll her eyes and groan and walk away. At first my mom thought it was just a personal thing, but she and my dad quickly came to learn that it was something she did to *everyone.* Noreens rudeness was indiscriminate, which I suppose is a good thing? All other people were equally shit in her eyes, under the law of Noreens world. Admirable, in a way. The second thing to know about Noreen was that she had a fucking shitload of cats. Like I mean, a FUCK TON of goddamn cats, like so many cats you really had to wonder how the hell someone could manage to acquire that many cats and yet shed done it, shed found a way, and now she had like 20 motherfucking cats living in her house. Totally illegal by the way, and according to my dad a couple people had actually called the authorities on her a few times. But somehow, some way, she always knew when they were coming and shed managed to either hide away most of the cats or send them somewhere else and upon inspection, neither animal control nor the cops could find anything. As far as they could prove, she only had 3 lovely kitties, Jimbo, Cleopatra, and Flora (I came to know there names as you could frequently hear her calling for one or more of them from across the street most afternoons), and that was all. After the third time they stopped responding to calls about Noreens cats, probably because they didnt really care that much and plus the cats didnt really seem to be the source of any real problems, other than being another annoying aspect of Noreens existence (and knowing her, most of those annoying aspects were probably completely intentional on her part). And you couldnt really bust someone for being annoying, so the cops pretty much left her alone. There was this one time though when my mom and Noreen almost seriously got into it, and the police *did* end up getting involved. It wasnt anything terribly serious, mind you, but it was enough to cause a stir around the neighborhood that summer. What had happened was this: My mom had gone shopping, and shed taken me and Chloe with her (it was the late afternoon so my dad was still working, and Jesse was over at some friends house like usual). Basically, Noreen had backed her Camry out of a parking space in the Kroger lot, right smack into us, causing a fender bender on the front bumper of my moms 2007 Ford Freestar, which was still a relatively new minivan at the time, so my mom was understandably a little pissed off. If that werent bad enough, my little sister hadnt been buckled into her car seat, and ended up getting a minor injury. See, we lived just around the corner from the Kroger, and my mom was admittedly a little too lax when it came to the whole car seat law thing. Chloe was almost 8 now, and in my moms day she would have been old enough sit up in the damn passengers seat much less stop using a car seat. So sometimes she stubbornly just ignored the rule altogether, if she knew it would be a short trip. Unfortunately on this particular short trip, my sister ended up hitting her head on the back of the drivers seat when Noreen backed into us. My mom was outraged, probably because deep down she knew it could have been avoided if shed just done what shed been supposed to do. But she still decided to take it out on Noreen, and when she turned the engine off and stepped out of the car, she tore right into the woman. Dont get me wrong, Noreen was an absolute bitch, but my mom went kind of far this time, seriously like projecting her guilt right onto the poor lady. Well, poor lady is a bit of stretch. If she was as old as I thought she was, then she probably shouldnt have been driving anyway, and she seemed like someone who hadnt even been a particularly good driver in her younger days. The worst part was that you could tell Noreen was enjoying it, savoring it, almost like she was getting off on it in a sick twisted way. A shit-eating smirk on her face, she phoned the police and since the cops in this quiet town werent exactly that busy most of the time, a squad car arrived on the scene within a few short minutes. She told the tall, dark-haired, probably 30-something cop that this woman, my mom, was yelling at her and swearing at her, which was unfortunately true. I could tell that my mom wanted to protest, to explain to the officer that Noreen had actually backed into *us*, and that my sister had gotten hurt, but she didnt want him finding out about the car seat, so she backed off on the subject, and instead just agreed to give Noreen her insurance information and let the whole thing be over with. The last thing I saw before we got back into the car and left back home to go get some ice for Chloes head (thankfully she wasnt hurt badly, just a small bump), was Noreens nasty, victorious smile. The next night, I asked my parents if I could spend the night at my friend Katherines house, and they said sure. What was cool about Katherine (other than that she was pretty funny and also 18 which meant she could buy cigarettes for me and our other friends) was that her parents had bought her a car that summer, specifically for her 18th birthday, and so she could drive us all places. Id told Katherine about what had happened with my mom and Noreen, and the two of us came up with a brilliant idea: burrito the bitchs house. Now if youre not aware, to burrito someones house is exactly what you probably think it isyou buy a burrito, preferably a large one from like Chipotle or somewhere, full of cheese and sour cream and salsa and stuffed full of it so that its just a perfectly wet, perfectly ticking time bomb of a smelly mess, and you smash the whole thing right the fuck onto someones front door and leave it there, dripping and greasy and putrid and amazing. Its the perfect revenge tactic if you pull it off right. And we thought we had. It certainly seemed like it. Wed pulled up just around the corner from my house around 11pm, undetected by my parents or by anyone else, and under cover of darkness (and carefully avoiding any streetlights) we slowly strode up to Noreens place on foot, myself holding the burrito, Katherine keeping watch in case someone came driving by. But no one did. We were extremely lucky, we thought. I carefully tiptoed my way up the paved walkway up to Noreens front porch, her front porch light casting a dim greenish glow that barely illuminated me. When I got to the door, I felt myself shaking with nervousness, I mean this was an old lady after all, should I really be ding this? And what if we got caught? But then I remembered her spidery smile when shed essentially ruined my moms day and gotten my sister hurt, and thought to myself, fuck it. I raised the unwrapped burrito, smooshing it in my hand, and pressed it slowly but aggressively onto Noreens front door. Quietly as possible, I guided it along the surface of the door with the focus and precision of a brain surgeon, wiping and spreading all the creamy ingredients all over the place until I felt that the door had been sufficiently covered in slop. When I was done I turned around and gave Katherine a thumbs-up, and she nodded and returned it in kind. We started back, and as we both made our way back across the path, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I felt my heart leap for just a second but I dared not make a sound. I looked to my right and saw a pair of greenish-goldish, almond-shaped eyes gazing at me from out in the darkness. Cats eyes. The tension in my body suddenly went away, and I breathed a quiet sigh of relief. It was just a cat. It was one of Noreens stupid fucking cats, and that made me give even less of a shit. I shrugged and gestured one of my middle fingers right at the cat, and kept walking. And then I heard it growl at me. It was a low rumble of a growl, long and guttural, the growl of a jungle predator. I froze right where I was when I heard it, and whipped around instantly to see the same exact cat, standing in the exact same spot on the front lawn next to the driveway where Noreens Camry sat parked, still staring right at me. Its long low growl had ended, but before I could turn to leave again, another long, stretched-out, angry growl escaped from its jaws. I dont know what it is about a cats growl, but its one of those things that just automatically makes me nervous. Maybe because the usual sound a cat makes, a normal meow sound, is so soft and sweet, and the striking difference in intonation when a cat goes on the attack puts me off in a way. I dont fucking know. It just creeps me out. Standing there, frozen in irrational fear, I looked back towards the street and saw Katherine, already on the sidewalk, gesturing at me to hurry the fuck up so we could get out of here. I nodded my head at her and kept on moving, a little more briskly this time. Even as I walked back out onto the street with Katherine, I heard Noreens cat continue to growl in that low, snarling tone, and even Katherine was put off by it, telling me once we got back to the car how she pretty much thought cats were assholes and that was the reason why she was a dog person. Id never really had any pets growing up, but most of my friends always did, and I was pretty sure I liked dogs and cats equally, though I knew most breeds of both animals could potentially be pretty vicious depending on the circumstances. There are plenty of mean dogs too, you know. As we drove off, I took one more look back at Noreens house, and although it was dark outside and we were a ways away now, I could still see those gold-green eyes gazing right at me, staring at me through the darkness, never once looking away. That had been back during the summer, and it had gone off without a hitch. Apparently Noreen had cleaned her door off herself, and fed the remains of the mushy burrito to her cats without ever saying a word to anyone about it. Fine with me, motherfucker. It wasnt until months later when the *real* fucked up shit happened. Let me explain: It was the middle of November now, the warm and colorful autumn leaves decorating the entire neighborhood as I mentioned before. The sky was getting more cloudy and more gray, more and more frequently, and it had even rained a fair few times in recent weeks. The news stations said it wouldnt be long before we started seeing snow, and I felt the same rush of excitement Id felt during the previous two winters start charging up inside of me again. School was on break for the week, so I was spending the majority of my time with either my boyfriend Zach or my friend I mentioned earlier, Katherine, as well as our other friend Mikaela. Mikaela was actually the first friend Id made when I started going to Sterling Heights High and everyone there, even some of our teachers, liked to call us Nik and Mik because we were basically inseparable. In another life wed probably be lesbian lovers, but alas, twas not meant to be. Id still hit it though, you feel me? Gurl if yo ass is readin this, hit me up! Anyway. Two days before the Thanksgiving holiday, I awoke late in the afternoon to a loud knocking sound coming from downstairs. The door? Then I heard the doorbell. Yeah, it was the door. It was Tuesday, so my mom had taken Chloe to her gymnastics practice that afternoon, and I didnt hear Jesse answer the door either so I assumed he must be over at some friends house again. Realizing that I was the only one home, I reluctantly dragged myself out of bed and headed down the stairs, walked over to the front door, and stuck face up to the peephole so I could look through it. It was Noreen. I felt my chest get tight when I saw her, and remembered the burrito. That was like 4 months ago though, I thought to myself. Did she know? Even if she did, why choose now to address it? What was going on here? There was only one way to find out, so despite the fact that I really didnt want to, I twisted the deadbolt to the left, grabbed the handle, and opened the door. I opened it slowly, very carefully, and saw Noreen standing there. She didnt look angry or anything, so I took that as a good sign. She didnt look particularly happy either, but since it was Noreen, I also took that as a good sign. I greeted her and asked her if I could help her with anything, trying my absolute hardest to not look or sound guilty in any way. If I started sweating or shaking at all, I knew it would be over. Noreen looked at me and said yes, yes there was something I could help her with. She explained to me that her cat Jimbo had gone missing the other night, and shed been asking around the neighborhood today to find out if anyone had seen him. My mind immediately jumped back to that night 4 months earlier, when Katherine and I had burritoed the shit out of her front door. And that freaky fucking cat that was there, staring at me, growling at me, looking like it might pounce at any moment. I wondered if *that* had been Jimbo, and if it had, then in all honesty I wasnt terribly sorry that he was missing. Still, the look on Noreens face was a look that I didnt often see her with. Usually the expression she wore was that of either bitterness with a hint of salt, or sourness with a hint of bitchy. Even when she smiled, it was always that spidery, slimy, vindictive smile of someone who enjoys ruining other peoples days. But now she looked tired, low on energymaybe even sad. In my heart of fucking hearts, I did not want to believe that a woman like Noreen could ever be sad, or capable of any emotion aside from seething hatred, but at the same time I couldnt help but feel for her in a way. And it made perfect sense why shed be sadthose cats were probably her only friends. She was a lonely, bitter, elderly woman, whod probably driven everyone she once loved (if she was in fact capable of such feeling) out of her life, and my educated guess was that shed gone and replaced them with all these fucking cats. Now that one had gone missing, I could tell she was really worried. She couldnt be faking this. I told her I hadnt seen any cats around lately, but if I did see this Jimbo, Id let her know. Then I asked her what he looked like, and she told me that he was an all-black cat with soft, smooth fur, and a purple collar around his neck. I remembered again the cat that had growled at me that night during the summer. Did *that* cat have a purple collar? It had been too dark to tell, I figured. Noreen thanked me and then left to continue her search, and I wished her good luck and shut the door. That had to have been one of the weirdest interactions of my life up to that point. It was almostpleasant. A pleasant conversation with **Noreen?* Yeesh. Most of all, I think I was just relieved that she still hadnt said anything about the burrito incident. Thank fucking God. I was in the clear. That was about 3pm. Id stayed up late the night before, at Zachs place before hed finally taken me home at around 4 in the morning, and luckily my parents didnt really give a shit where I was as long as I told them ahead of time that Id be back late. I guess Im pretty lucky to have them as my mom and dad. But as a result of my late-night antics, I was now feeling groggy this morninguh, afternoon that is. A couple hours after Noreen had stopped by, I was finally feeling wide awake, and I sat at the dining table eating a bowl of cereal and some waffles, trying to plan out the rest of my evening. Since it was November, it was already getting dark this time of day, so the park was automatically out. I hated going there at night, something about a swingset in the dark with no streetlights around really creeped me the fuck out. I texted back and forth with Zach about maybe hitting up Mikaela and Katherine, and maybe Katherine could drive us somewhere. I wasnt sure about the exact location or destination, but there was some basis of a plan now at least. I finally called up Mikaela and she said shed call Katherine, and that was that. I called my boyfriend back and told him Katherine and Mikaela would be at my house at around 8, and that Mikaela was gonna bring Ryan with her. Zach said cool and that hed head over to my place shortly. He never was much one for words, but at least he wasnt a dumb jock asshole like a lot the guys Mikaela was into. After finishing my night-time breakfast, I decided Id take a quick shower before doing anything else, and as I walked over to the stairs in the living room, I heard something scratching against the front door. Slightly puzzled, I walked over to the door and listened. The scratching continued, on and on. Could it be I twisted the deadbolt back, and pulled the door open. Down there on the porch, sitting with his tiny little claws extend out, was a small black cat. On his neck he wore a dark purple collar. I realized right away that this was Jimbo, Noreens missing cat. His eyes were big and friendly, and looking at him now I was certain that there was no way this could be the same cat from that other night, the one I that had glared and growled at me. This cat was cute and cuddly, and he didnt even seem to be freaked out like a lot of cats tend to be when approached by strangers. Holding the door open, I knelt down to pet him and he sniffed at my fingers and rubbed his head against the palm of my hand. I kept petting him and petting him, all the way down from his pointy ears and fluffy head to his long black tail, and he purred loudly the whole freaking time. Yup, I liked this cat. In fact I liked him so much I thought about not even bringing him back to Noreenhow could such a mean old woman take care of a nice cat like this? But at the end of the day it *was* her cat, and I knew I needed to bring him back there. Before I left, I went and grabbed my house keys. I knew I was only going across the street, and not to mention we lived in literally one of the safest cities in America, but locking the door even when we didnt need to had become a habit around the house, so this occasion was no different. I stepped outside and shut the front door. After locking both the deadbolt and the bottom lock, I stuffed my keys into the pocket of my jeans. I picked Jimbo up, and he curled himself into a ball, as if he knew I was intending to carry him and he was giving me the go-ahead. Cute. Holding him carefully while scanning for any approaching headlights, I crossed the street and headed left to Noreens house. Her house, like ours, was a 2-story. It was a similar design too, with the garage off to the side, but its exterior had a dark green color to it unlike the brick-red of our place. Since it looked almost exactly like our house, I could only assume that it also had 3 bedrooms, but since it was common knowledge that Noreen lived here alone, I wondered what she used the other two bedrooms for. Maybe her cats lived in them. As I approached her front porch with the dim porch lamp casting an eerie green glow overhead, I suddenly noticed that the front door of Noreens house was slightly open. I wondered why this was, and thought that maybe shed been sitting outside as she often did, and just went in real quick to use the bathroom or something. As this thought ran through my mind I saw my breath steaming out of my mouth, and realized that it was probably too cold tonight for an old woman to be sitting outside, so it was likely I could be wrong about that. Whatever the explanation was, I didnt really care. I really just wanted to give Noreen her damn cat back and go the fuck home, so I carefully made my way to the partially opened door, and knocked. When no answer came, I rang the doorbell. I stood out there for maybe 3 minutes holding Jimbo in my arms, and when I started to shiver from the cold, I decided that it wouldnt be too unreasonable to to just step inside real quick. I never once imagined that I would ever be going inside of Noreens house, so I never really bothered to imagine what the interior of it would look like. And it waspretty normal, I must say. At least the front room was. The rest of the house could look like a fucking circus for all I knew, but I didnt intend to stay long enough to find out. I looked around, and found no sign of Noreen anywhere. No cats either, which I thought was odd since everyone within a frickin 5-mile radius knew Noreen had a shitload of them. I set Jimbo down and decided that I would just leave him here for her to find, and when I turned and moved to step out the front door, Noreen was standing right there in the doorway, right in front of me. *(part 2 will be coming tomorrow evening, be on the lookout)*"
186,vulnerability,nosleep,Orange: orange,12,7kwtpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7kwtpc/orange_orange/,2017-12-20 09:28:56,"We kept Beatrice in the dark about our progress in organizing the global resistance. The biggest hurdle had always been convincing people that such a reptilian race even existed. Now the world finally knew we were at war with an unseen, but very real adversary. Once the international activist organizations mirroring us were supported by their respective governments, our message was accepted by an expanding number of citizens worldwide. At that point, the word was out and there was no suppressing it. We had performed our sworn duty. Phase one was nearing completion. It didnt matter about maintaining our secrecy as much anymore but we still feared their vengeful wrath and retaliation. The Lemurians were lashing out wildly. They werent even trying to hide their violent actions anymore. Raids on major ISPs were their last-ditch efforts to stop the message from gaining even more momentum. The US military began protecting high profile targets and managed to foil several planned attacks. It was a very encouraging sign of things to come. I prodded our verified inner-circle members on how such a radically different looking enemy species could get around, so stealthily. All the while, they kept completely hidden from sight when they didnt want to be found. There was no way bipedal reptiles like them could blend-in to ordinary crowds of human beings. Either they were being assisted by a network of human supporters, or they had secret places to hide, all over the earth. We had to consider both possibilities. None of the enemy interrogations yielded a satisfactory answer to that pertinent question. Possibly because the embedded spies didnt actually know where the Lemurians dwelled. If true, it was withheld from them for security reasons. They had to assume that one day the network of spies would be compromised. The easiest way to avoid detection was to prevent any humans; no matter how sympathetic to their secret, from knowing. One of the many invaluable assets of being believed by a large cross-section of the global population, was that we had access to a stellar group of scientists! (Many of which had probably thought we were mad, only a month before). I asked this amazing team of learned people to concentrate on the possible logistics of how the Lemurians could move about so easily among us. Always without detection. In very short order, a scientist from the University of Milan offered an astute theory. Nearly all temperate parts of the Earth have large systems of caves. These subterranean passages could easily offer shelter, security, and an endless labyrinth of places to avoid detection by mankind. It might help to explain how such an alien race of creatures could show up and retreat with such ease. I was dumbfounded. Dr. Ferreras comment was absolutely brilliant. A noted geologist on our team created a topographical overlay of known attack sites and existing caves. It was nearly an identical match! Why hadnt we thought of that possibility before? It made perfect sense. As soon as an assault was carried out, the Lemurian army could simply retreat to a nearby cave. I shared our theory and the corresponding data with the other vetted countries in the network. It wasnt conclusive proof by any means, but it was certainly worth investigating. A hand-picked team of biologists examined the mouth of the nearest cave system to WRZB studios for evidence of a reptilian residency. Data was collected which strongly corroborated the working theory. We didnt dare enter the cave to confirm our suspicions; for fear of tipping them off. Instead we set up infrared surveillance cameras to monitor the area from our remote location. The first couple nights were a bust but on the third night, they made an appearance outside the entrance. It was exactly the evidence we needed to formulate a massive extermination plan. Coordinating such an effort was going to be the greatest logistical challenge. If we were to dynamite that particular cave, news would travel to the other cells and we would lose the invaluable element of surprise. It had to be a global effort and perfectly timed. It was probably wishful thinking on naive to believe that we could get all of them in one coordinated offense but it was our first chance to turn the tables. We had to capitalize on their intrinsic weaknesses and vulnerability. Even if some escaped and regrouped, it was all about the battle of attrition and the numbers. We would be ruthless in hunting down any that escaped Operation Collapse. Convincing the authorities of over 80 countries to dynamite their caves shut was quite a tall order. After all, we only had proof of a single cave in the US inhabited by them. The rest was hunch and conjecture. It was a lot to ask purely on faith but it was too risky to obtain verification. Our organization had a lot of credibility in the international stage after uncovering the Lemurian scourge but we didnt exactly command NATO. We still had to convince leaders of those sovereign nations to join Operation Collapse. Our undeniable evidence of the Lemurian conspiracy to create havoc and chaos delivered a huge blow to them. Almost overnight, peace treaties were struck by once bitter enemies. Once the Lemurian spies were uncovered and arrested worldwide, it became obvious who the real enemies of peace were. That made it easier to coordinate our plans because there werent agents actively working against us anymore. Our incredibly ambitious plan was to orchestrate a simultaneous cave collapse initiative across the world. Through controlled demolitions from our partner nations where spies had been uncovered, we hoped to entomb as many of them as possible inside the interior chambers of their corresponding local caves. Once buried under thousands of tons of rocks, the Lemurian race would hopefully be crushed or suffocate. In honor of the brave individual who made the whole startling discovery possible, we agreed upon Darcys September fifth birthday as the date of the operation. The ironic time would be 10:31 PM, Eastern Standard Time. It was a fitting symbol of her sacrifice. While heavily involved in planning last minute details of the operation, I tried to make as much time for my daughter, as possible. She sent word through our babysitter that she needed to tell me something important. I sought to keep our living quarters and the official headquarters separate so shed have some semblance of normalcy. She was already freaked out about numerous strangers being in our home. On the rare occasions she felt the courage to leave the security of her room, I went out of my way to give her the attention she needed. Regardless of my intentions and diligence, I wasnt at all prepared for what came next. Her chilling words shook me to the core. Mama, they want to discuss peace terms. [blog](URL"
187,vulnerability,nosleep,Late gettin home.,14,7op5ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7op5ae/late_gettin_home/,2018-01-07 17:42:17,"I havent thought about this for thirty years. But it came back tonight. Never wrote it down. Probably wont ever again. I grew up in a small Northern California town. Safe. Quiet. Innocent. Until the spring of 1982. Life wasnt the same after that. Our Norman Rockwell Americana little community was [rocked](URL by the unthinkable: the rape and murder of a little girl in a dark alley. Whats worse, a friend found the body and I had more images rolling around my imagination than any kid ought to have had. Everyone was on edge. Police. Parents. Schoolteachers. All of us kids were warned daily to stay off the streets, the parks, the schoolyards...basically *be home* when the streetlights came on. Trust no one. Dont be alone. But one night that summer I broke the rules. It was dark. I was alone. And I had to get home. Who remembers why? Nintendo battle? D&amp;D? Pickup basketball at the park? Doesnt matter really. But I was late. I sat alone on my BMX under the last streetlight. As far as logistics go all my friends lived in town, I however lived on a ranch just to the south. An east/west creek separated our place from the southernmost tract development. The train tracks ran south along the east of the homes, bridges the creek, then bordered our ranch. My daily route home had me jumping off the corner of that subdivision and onto the tracks. Id shoot down it to the east border of the ranch. Id done it so many times I could take the route blindfolded. The real problem dawned on me as I sat under that buzzing yellow streetlight before the trail...there was no moon. The trees swallowed every shred of illumination coming from my safe island of light. Those tracks were black as sin. I knew it without a doubt. Into the trees onto the tracks and 100 yards across the bridge to our gate were literally going to be blindfolded. My mind weighed the odds. The always-empty tracks. But that murderer is here. Like she was found a half mile from where I sat. The fear was creeping into my chest like icy tentacles. Adrenaline was starting to pump into my tiny heart. I considered the long route. One Doberman, a pit bull and three mean as hell ranch mutts. None were chained up and that Doberman went after me last year. I was already late. It was what, 7:30 now? If I didnt get in fast the odds of getting a belt whip werent inconceivable. That way added two miles total: 1/2 mile along 101 at night, the the rest in the dark with the dog gauntlet. The adrenaline wasnt helping my decision making one bit. Trapped with two ugly choices, never thinking seriously about riding two blocks to a friends and calling home or asking their parents for a ride. We didnt just drop in after dinner like that. We didnt even call people past 9 without prior plans. These were simpler times. My young brain decided that the tracks were the safer option. It was scary, but it was imaginary scary. My budding teen mind argued that I wasnt afraid of the bogeyman. This is my turf, and I had never had a reason to really be scared. Id blast through like I had hundreds of times before. A few more minutes sitting on my BMX. As if soaking up that jaundiced light would charge my courage. Maybe it did. I stood up on my left leg and released the brake. Thirty yards or so off the road and i was into the trees. There was a berm that rose up in the trail about six feet. You peak that, it drops back down the six, then rises back up another eight or so to the tracks. You pump the berm just right and it all but launches you onto the tracks. Riding by feel I had to go a bit slower. That was a good thing. As I approached the berm pedaling madly something... Cigarette smoke. Holy fucking shit. I powerslid to a stop on the apex. My heart had to have sounded like a machine gun. I sat there frozen in literal blackness, my senses screaming for a clue. What seemed like minutes later a cherry glowed bright above me on the tracks. Whos there? A mans voice. Gravelly. Rough. J-j-just a kid here on my bike. Im going h-home. Down here? He queried. I somehow explained in a few short words that my house was just down the tracks to the right. Well you better get on home then. Somehow I found the courage to respond. Im gonna do that. W-why dont you maybe go to the left sir? Sure kid. I watched his cherry move a few yards north of me in time with the crunch of the gravel. Another few moments of terrifying silence as I psyched myself up. BOOM! Like a rocket I exploded off the top of the berm and down. I took a deep angle to the right, knowing that as I came up to the tracks the gravel would slow me more. The distance from *him* was still the better choice. I was off my bike two steps before the track. Looking back I really did knew that path blind. I jumped onto the tracks keeping my bike between him and I for that brief moment of vulnerability. I knew that at least he would trip on my bike in the blackness if I had to drop it. No pause. Not a skipped beat. I had to assume he was weighing the hassle of murdering me. I sprinted that 100 yards with my bike bouncing and kicking as it hit the occasional creosote covered railroad tie. At some point I found my rhythm where my feet knew the spacing of the ties...a familiar sprint from wooden strip to wooden strip. There was no gravelly echoes coming down the tracks. Nothing. Thank God. The trees opened up past the bridge and stars glint off the gate on the fence of our place. I dropped my bike to the side and threw myself over the fence like I was an Olympic high jumper. It was safe til tomorrow but I wasnt. I hit that dirt road and sprinted the last half mile to our front yard where I collapsed on the grass covered in sweat and dust and tears. Did I almost die tonight? To this day I dont know. There were ten or twelve fresh cigarette butts next to my bike the next morning, so theres that I guess."
188,vulnerability,nosleep,The Naming of Things,3,7pxeiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7pxeiw/the_naming_of_things/,2018-01-13 02:46:39,"It is said that names hold power, a belief that dates back to the beginnings of civilization, particularly in relation to deities. Many stories in ancient religious canon involve the idea that the true name of a being is intrinsically linked to that beings identity. The first devotees of Abrahamic religions had such reverence for the true name of their deity that the many words used historically to refer to God are purposeful obfuscation of a title they considered too powerful and sacred to utter. This practice can be found in a number of religions. True names are not simply identifying titles. They are more abstract in essence, and represent a vast panorama of conceptual identity. The traditional naming practices of the indigenous peoples of North America are more similar to this idea, although they are still limited in scope compared to true names. They often evoke a particular experience or sensation, but a true name captures a landscape, a lifetime, a soul. With the advent of medieval times names in much of the world developed an eponymous trend. Children were christened after religious or otherwise significant figures, like saints and royalty. The ancients might have viewed this practice as a dilution of the power of names, but from a more pragmatic perspective it could be viewed as a protective factor. After all, if true name and identity are one and the same, our true names are innate, and the names granted by our parents are only arbitrary signifiers. It stands to reason, then, that if we could delve into our identities far enough, we could discover our own true names. Perhaps, with sufficient skill, we could learn others true names. Maybe there is someone who already knows yours, for better or worse. If a true name actually holds the power the ancients attributed to it, then maybe it is for the best that it be obscured from those who might use it to do harm. I think someone has discovered my true name, and I need help. That wasnt my initial suspicion, of course. My first thought was that Id developed somehow a new and severe disorder, or something. A patch of rough luck, maybe, and an emotional slump that increased my vulnerability to negative life events. Ive been medicated for severe depression since my early teenage years, and Ive had my share of emotional ups and downs, as anyone who has experienced any mood disorder is likely to understand. Ive also seen how utterly debilitating a mental affliction depression can be. My current cocktail of psychiatric medications has remained mostly the same for several years now with generally stabilizing effects up until a few weeks ago. The night before my circumstances began crumbling I slept fitfully. That, in and of itself, is relatively ordinary. Ive not slept well since I began experiencing depression, and I frequently experience sleep paralysis and other uncomfortable disturbances in the course of a night. What was unusual about that night, though, and every night since, was the dream I had. In it I heard a phrase, and then came an overwhelming rush of colour and sound and emotion, so powerful that it seemed I was hurtling through space and time. It seemed at once alien and intimate, an experience I cannot adequately explain in words. Somewhere amidst all that madness I recognized myself. I woke up that Thursday morning feeling absolutely shattered. The alarm on my phone urged me to get out of bed and wash up for work, but a sense of dread soured my stomach, crushing my motivation. I reached for the nightstand to shut off the blaring alarm and forced myself up. Following routines is helpful when Im having a bad day, because I can frame each task, however mundane, as a progress point. This mindset is helpful for many people, and Ive found it particularly useful in managing the symptoms of depression, because when at your worst you simply want to hide from the world in bed, every task completed in spite of that feeling is an accomplishment. I need to call the psychiatrist, I thought as I walked sleepily to the washroom. Because over time the body develops a tolerance to psychoactives, medications typically lose some of their efficacy after extended use. Such a sheer drop-off is unusual, though, particularly in the absence of mitigating circumstances. After all, Id felt fine yesterday and the day before. In fact, Id for the most part felt fine for quite a while now. Up to that point, my career and my social life had been moving along satisfactorily. As far as my professional life, I wont bore you with the details of my office job, but it pays decently and Id been relatively content there. Outside of work I had what I consider a healthy social circle and a lovely girlfriend, Vanessa, who Ive been dating for about half a year. Id been thinking of asking her to move in with me, actually. Up to that point. I was in a fugue state for the entirety of that day at the office. Those of you who have experienced it will already know what its like. For those of you who dont, I can only describe it as the blunting of the senses. A fog sets over the vision, sounds become distant, as if muffled, and one is simultaneously anxious to some ambiguous, unidentifiable threat and numbed by overwhelming sadness. Its like being half-present and it is certainly not conducive to productivity. After my third botched sales call of the day I was called into my supervisors office. He was a reasonable man, for the most part, and Id never had an issue with him before. Whats going on with you today? He asked, peering through his horn-rimmed glasses at me from across the desk. Just an off-day, I replied. I was finding it difficult to meet his gaze. Feeling sick, are you? I shook my head. Not quite, just tired I guess. Ill be better tomorrow. I didnt have a single successful call for the remainder of the day, and in fact each caller seemed in increasingly poor spirits. As 5:00 mercifully arrived I put on my jacket and tried to shake the last callers angry voice from my head as I headed to my car. Youre absolutely fucking useless! Funny, that voice seemed to be in perfect harmony with my downtrodden inner narrator. Vanessa came over for dinner that evening, and found me distant and distracted. Shed not seen me like this before; as I said, my medications had been doing the trick for the most part, and my worst days on that were nothing compared to this. Attempts at conversation sputtered out, and she left rather abruptly. I simply didnt have the energy to ask her to stay the night. Things deteriorated at an alarming rate from that point forward. As I grew progressively more distant from the world, my performance at work crumbled. Salesmanship requires a level of engagement with the client that in my opinion borders on the cloyingly upbeat, an affected tone which I found tiresome even on a good day. In my depressed state it was impossible to maintain the smile in my voice that my supervisor babbled on about at staff meetings. After a week with a pitiful dearth of closings my supervisor told me I was on thin ice. After another two weeks with similar numbers I was asked to pack my desk up and leave. None of this was helped by the fact that literally everything in my life seemed determined to crush my spirits. Kids playing ball in the street shattered my front window while I was at work the very day I was fired. Things went missing just when I needed them. The power in my apartment building was shut off for two days after a storm, and every item of food in my refrigerator spoiled. My car battery died three mornings in a row, forcing me to ask a neighbor to jump it or take an Uber to work. Showing up late certainly didnt help my case on the brink of employment. On the fourth day of this inconvenience, I took the car to the shop to have the battery replaced, only to be told that the entire engine was irreparably shot. I didnt have the funds to repair it. These are all relatively minor mishaps, but experiencing them all at once, and in my low emotional state, I was finding it more and more difficult to stave off a sense of overpowering helplessness. Without my job, Ive had too much time to think. Despondency is an echo chamber, and every self-loathing thought is amplified by my self-imposed isolation. I hadnt returned Vanessas calls in over a day at that pointI was too ashamed. Every night I had the same troubled dreams, and I woke up each dark morning more exhausted than before, like Id been running in my sleep. Youre likely wondering at this point in my story how I came to believe that my true name had anything to do with my sudden misfortune, or why it was a thought in my mind at all. For the past month and a half I have had the exact same dream from the first night where things went to shit, but where it once seemed familiar (albeit weird) it has taken on an increasingly sinister tone. That, coupled with the misfortune plaguing me, makes me think that the two are related somehow. Finding no reasonable psychological explanation (and believe me, Ive looked) Ive spent hours since that first dream researching the idea of hexes, voodoo, things I normally would dismiss as quackery. Despite being a product of my misery, poring over musty old books at the local library has been a welcome distraction. Nothing made sense in relation to my situation, until I stumbled upon a dusty old tome on ancient etymology. Thats where I found the information that brings me to the harrowing suspicion that some malevolent person has found my true name. The dream, so unlike any dream Ive ever had and yet so full of my essence; I think thats my true name. I dont know who has found it, and I dont know why, but I am at my breaking point. Two days ago I awoke from that sickeningly familiar dream to the sounds of screeching tires and screams. I rushed to my window, my heart already sinking like a stone. There, mangled upon the pavement, was Vanessa. With the strange clarity of trauma I noticed a shattered Tupperware of chicken noodle soup splattered across the sidewalk, mingling with the blood pooling slowly around her. This was my fault. Shed come to check on me and become a victim of my wretched existence. The vehicle that hit her was already speeding away. Vanessa died on the way to the hospital. I can only hope she felt no pain. I can only hope the last sound she ever heard was not my ruined sobs. I am on my last limb. I am a broken man, and yet the torture persists. The sleeping pills Ive been stockpiling are beginning to look ever more alluring each night, but I resist the urge to give up. Ive never placed much stock in superstition. I know, that might seem an out of place statement on this forum, but hopefully the fact that Im seeking the aid of people who seem to know about that sort of thing demonstrates the desperate nature of my situation. I need advice. Please, someone, tell me how to find my tormentor. Tell me how to avenge Vanessa and reclaim my life. "

I have helped countless children and now, for the first time in so many years, I have to ask for help in return. Will you help me? I do not wish for it to be a demand nor a settled debt for the work I have done. I am not asking for a check to cash for work that is unasked of me yet carried out. Consider it a plea from a desperate man. I do however wish that you take into consideration the good I have done. If you are unfamiliar with my work, please familiarize yourself with my past to understand my present. [I have made mistakes, one of which you can read about here.](URL [I have chronicled my work; which is of importance both for my sanity and - if I can convince only one of you to help me - my future.](URL Last time I stole a few minutes of your time and attention [I also told you about the past that came back to haunt me](URL A haunting not of the whispy blue smoke of my beloved *Ghosts* but of flesh and blood, yes, raging blood. Oh, how it rages and screams. Oh, how it rains down on me like acid rain. 8 months I have spent confined in the prison of my own making. The days and nights become one in the darkness and the strong hands of the *Talls* have bruised my wrists, the coos and sighs of the *Ghosts* having turned to roars and high-pitched moans in my ears. Only my memories have kept me company, as well as your responses to my stories. I have been called a saviour and a serial killer. You hypothesized me both pleasant and delusional. No matter what theory you nurture, I owe you great thanks. No matter if you come to help me, I know that some of you will remember me. That knowledge has carried me through 8 endless months. She came again in the night after I last wrote you. I awoke by the soft growling from the *Under-the-Beds* and while floating in the limbo between sleep and the waking world her voice carried through the empty hallways of my House for Broken Children. The sense of the *push* punched my solar plexus, jolting me awake. I knew that is was her. The auburn haired girl I neglected to change, turning her into this being. Frozen in time, frozen in the pain of her breaking inside. She had turned into a sharp sword in the body of a small girl. My mind, a mind of a chronicler as well as a vessel of release for the beings that roam the hall of my house; the *Ghosts*, the *Talls* restless treading the floorboards in the room above me, the *Under-the-beds* and the *Biters* and *Pouncers* whose bone fragments I have scattered along highways and landfills across the nation; formulated her into terms I could easily fathom and relate to. *Fighter - The Sword is made of pure pain molded into rage due to never being released or changed, thus allowing the abuse - either physical or psychological but most likely both - to change her instead. She is considered to be stuck in a cycle of breaking. While the other Fighters react on reflex and with violence the Sword is a sharp object, intelligent and strategic, eternally and instinctively bonded with the one who neglected to change her. The extent of its powers is unknown. Do not engage under any circumstance.* Yet, while lying frozen in my bed, my situation underlined by the vulnerability of my position, I felt her presence and her sing-song voice was growing nearer to my bedroom door. Was I to face the unfaceable dressed in my nightgown? The banality toggled me into action and I leapt silently from the safe womb of my bed, from the armour of my blanket. The sharp claws of the *Under-the-beds* who had taken residence underneath shot out but failed to reach me and my naked feet made no sound as I made my way to the opened the suitcase resting on my desk. I carefully unwrapped the soft velvet cradling my Changing Device. Perhaps, had I not only just awakened, had I not felt the electric tingling of fear dance across the hair on my arms, I wouldve realized that the only weapon or shield there existed was resting in my Library of Notebooks. I doubted that my Changing Device held the power to change something so long past salvation but it was the only instrument of protection imaginable in my situation. Oh, how stupid a fearful man must be. Of how narrow a mind he is. I edged the walls, grateful that I through my years of having to go up against the remarkably strong Fighters have remained in good physical condition despite my age. My gratitude counted for little to nothing as I stepped into the hallway, hoping that the darkness was on my side, begging it to hide and shield me. She mustve opened the curtains, for the moonlight created a glowing halo around her head. She was standing with her back facing me and my shaking hands held the Changing Device out in front of me. A bead of sweat stung my eye with its salt and I blinked. I wish I hadnt blinked. When I opened my eyes, just a fragment of a second later she was standing but a feet away from me, having glitched through reality is she was wont to do. Her small hands reached out and gently touched my cheek and I fell, I fell and fell into the darkness. *Father towered at the end of the table and the smell of greasy food and mushy beans made my throat thick. His fist accentuated his words against the table and spittle flew like a light summer drizzle through the air.* *Stupid. Fucking. Boy. I bet your whore mother fucked her way through whatever trailer park she crawled out of cause you sure as hell aint mine. No child of mine could be that fucking stupid and retarded.* *My mother had imploded, barely inhabiting the gray clothes she wore, stained with oil and food as she sat beside me. She did that when Father was angry. Disappeared into herself.* *I wish you were you brother, you fucking ant! Sure as fuck the wrong kid died Wish I had beaten you out of her cunt before you were even born!* *As he punched out his exclamation points into the innocent plastic table, my glass of water fell over. Careful not to move I did what I have always done when faced with the evils of this world, even this young, only 8 years old. I smiled my pleasant smile.* *Well now you gone and dun it, boy.* *He smiled the satisfied smile he always did when I had provided him a reason for punishment. And I smiled back, waiting for stubs of cigarettes to brand me like cattle, telling the world I was his property. I smiled back and waited for punches.* *I broke and no one came to change me.* I emerged from the darkness, my face wet from tears and sweat. She was giggling, the *Sword* girl, perched on a bench with her legs playfully dangling back forth. Silly Mister Pleasant. Such a silly man. As she spoke I wondered what she wouldve turned into had I carried out my task changing her. Perhaps a *Pouncer*. What a silly prison you have built! My dad was the same, our house was also pretty like this. If it looks pretty everyone thinks its pretty. I thought it was pretty too, but pretty prisons are still prisons. Pretty pretty prisons, pretty pretty prisons, she sang. At first I did not recognize the room but as my headache resided I realized I must be in the cellars beneath the house, a place a rarely ventured into. I flinched in fear as her gleeful smile and voice turned into a snarling beast of anger, shrieking her words out like a banshee. Did you think that you saved them!? You should have left them alone! She suddenly spoke with the voice of my father, Well now you gone and dun it, boy. I could her heavy footsteps coming down the stairs and the light blue smokey shapes of the *Ghosts* emerged from the walls and flocked around me. The *Talls* tentatively stepped into the room. Their usually subdued, polite faces were frowning and their small eyes seemed to be glowing of anger. Perhaps it was then I gave up. Perhaps it was then I was doomed. I do not know what she told my broken children. I do not know how she convinced them of my guilt. Nor does it matter. The only thing I have been grateful for for the past 8 months is that she failed to lure the *Under-the-beds* out of their chosen hiding places, had she succeeded I would surely have been torn to pieces by angry claws and talons. Their combined nature of *Fighter* and *Flighter* have protected me. In a sense, the only thing that have saved me from death or insanity is the inherent nature of those surrounding me. It s in the *Swords* nature to assume that the rage she is bound to live by was permanently inspired in my broken children as well. It is also in her nature to grow bored of her toys, my torture was a hilarious pastime for half a year; forcing me to relive my childhood, taunted by the fact that the children I have changed now hated me; making me eat from the floor like a dog like my father made me do while my mother cried while washing dishes. But bored she did grow, oh, yes she did. And the nature of my children is not to hate like those who broke them. And both her and I had forgotten the most important of my creations and the nature it held. For 8 months of pain and prodding *the Doll* had rested by the fireplace. The only child I have ever broken became my salvation. I had neglected to remember that *the Doll* had protected me when she had sought me out outside of the school that fateful last day of freedom in March when we last spoke. For 8 months *the Doll* waited. I awoke by the pressure around my ankles and wrists abiding. The *Talls* had held me down against the cold floor for months on end as my muscles atrophied. For the past month or so (I do not know, time has become a foreign concept) their force had grown tentative and questionable, theyd let me move a bit and stretch my muscles the days when she was not around. Now their long fingers let go of me and the sensation felt foreign. Smooth wood was suddenly rested against my hand. The *Dolls* cheek rested against the palm of my hand, a sensation and pose so intimate that it at first made me feel wildly uncomfortable. After a minute, I instead broke down in sobs and let the touch of something kind wash over me. My body convulsed and the tears was like an endless tide of emotion riding me. It took me some time to realize that the strong repelling push that I always felt when she, my captor and torturer, was near was no longer there. Imagine a heavy weight resting in the soft, fragile place just at the bottom of the ribs where the chest ends and your stomach begins, the spot where anxiety and pain lives when its present. Imagine it being there so long that you do not remember a time when it wasnt. Imagine it being gone. The weight being gone was like pulling the cork of a bottle of wine, allowing it flow out in uncontrolled manner, spilling all over the white table cloth. So I cried. The *Talls* shifted nervously by the walls, seemingly shameful in the presence of the *Doll*. Perhaps his kindness and soft being juxtaposed their implanted anger, forcing them out from under its spell. No matter the effect it had had, I was free. So here I stand, dear reader, begging you for help. I think that the help I beg of you is fair, because I know that every child broken in my absence has gone unchanged. I have two things to ask of you, and I feel confident that you will oblige. My muscles are weak and there is only so much my children can help me. They can not leave this House of Broken Children. I have long protected my whereabouts but it is only fair that you know where my house is. 4205'03.7""N 7405'59.5""W Depending on your situation I have one of two favours to ask you. If you are alone, the help I need from you is that you find my Library of Notebooks. You must gather them all and protect them. They must be saved. I realized while I shared my stories with every single one of you that they helped and touched - and for some repelled. My lifes work must be saved and shared. No longer must my nature be held a secret. But that is not the only help I need. You see I am lonely. The *Talls* nature betrayed me - they succumbed to the guilt of their actions, those gentle beings trapping a pleasant man - and most of them have left. Perhaps they are roaming the woods around here but do not fear them if you decide to come. My House for Broken Children is not to be feared and my children are not to blame for what they are. Even the *Under-the-beds* have crawled out and scurried off, I heard their talons clattering against the floorboards before breaking windows and scaling the walls. The *Ghosts* are losing their color. There are less and less each day and their shapes are dissolving into thin air. I have amended my classification of the *Sword*. I do believe that this is her true power, allowing the children to disappear. I do not know where she is, perhaps I even miss her. I am lonely, and I need your help. Please come. The Changing Device is no threat to you. This is my plea. [I need you to bring me your children.](URL "

""Who the fuck are you? What happened? Did you kill her?"" I pushed the guy back. My words were condensing as they left my mouth. The room had grown cold overnight with the window open. Another man was washing his hands in the kitchen sink. He was dressed similarly to the first man, but was a few inches shorter and a bit more heavy set. He stopped abruptly and turned around. ""Stop! Rela- wait let me explain!"". The man I met yesterday put his hands in front of him and blocked my way. I felt sick. Leah's dead, headless body was still unceremoniously laid out on the ground, blood and brain all over the place. I got dizzy and started salivating. I stumbled over towards the sink, pushing the wet-handed new guy out of the way and threw up. There wasn't much in my stomach - I covered the sink and a good part of the counter with what was mostly stomach acid. ""My name's Seth"" he said, drying his hands off. His calmness was out of place. He pointed towards the man I met the day before. ""He's Geordie"". I could see now that he had a short stubble, and clean but unkempt, messy hair. ""and who are you, if I may ask?"". I spat the taste of vomit out of my mouth into the sink. ""Who are you with?"". He asked. ""No one... I'm not- I'm just a neighbor"" He continued to stare at me suspisciously. ""Look he's not with them"" Geordie broke the silence ""he passed out and threw up, he's not dangerous"". ""So? He's not gonna stay quiet"" Seth turned away from me and towards Geordie. ""We don't have time to deal with him! Plus she's dead, it's not like it'll still be here"" *""It""? Are they looking for the thing she hid from me?* I glanced at the drawer she had opened last night. It was closed. ""Well we can't just fucking leave him there."" ""I swear I won't say anything. Please, I don't know anything about this, just let me leave."" ""Do you want to live?"" Seth slowly stepped towards me, stopping an uncomfortably small distance away, small enough for me to hear his breathing. ""Do you want to live?"" He repeated. ""Y-yes."" ""Then forget what you've seen. Go home, lock the door, call in sick, don't call the police, don't tell anyone and don't go anywhere. Disobey us, and we'll know. We know where you live, and we will know where you work. Anyone else would be dead by now."" He paused for a moment. Geordie pulled out his phone, checked it, and interrupted: ""We need to go"" ""Got it?"". Seth ended, quietly. I nodded nervously, and said nothing. They rushed out the door, closed it behind them, and I heard their hurried footsteps moving down the hallway. I couldn't believe it. I tried to look at Leah but any more exposure to the ungodly scene that had taken place might have made me pass out again. I supported myself against the counter and tried to control my breathing. A tornado of questions still ran through my head but I closed my eyes and tried to process what had happened. I don't know what compelled me to do what I did next. I was having trouble filling my time up as it is. *How am I supposed to just forget what had happened? How could I just go back to studying and working then coming home and doing nothing all day? It would kill me! Am I supposed to just ignore this? What happens when someone finds her?* I walked towards the drawer and opened it. *I shouldn't be doing this. What the fuck am I doing. I can't go back! Oh jesus this so fucked up* I felt around the empty drawer and my hand brushed up against a small object near the back. The box was about the size of a watch box. It was sleek, smooth and crimson, made of a hard material but lined on the outside with a velvety material. It had a tiny gold keyhole, and was locked. I slid it in my pocket and ran out after the two men, leaving the door open behind me. I ran down the stairs and called out to them. ""Wait! Hang on! I think I know what you're here for!"" I caught up to them as they were at the bottom of the stairs that led up to the entrance of the building. Seth was getting into the passenger's seat of a small, sleek looking black car. ""Wait!"" Geordie turned to face me. He started ""Listen buddy I really don't want to have to escalate this, I just need you t-"" ""I think I know what you're here for"" He stopped, intrigued but suspicious. ""This isn't a joking matter."" ""I'm not joking"" I had no idea what I was doing but for god's sake I had just seen my neighbor's head explode, I needed some answers. I couldn't just go back to normal life. If I'm being honest, however, there was also some morbid curiosity deep down inside of me. ""What is it then?"". He was less accomodating than he had been, adopting a more serious tone of voice and expression. ""I know where the box is but I need you to give me some answers."" ""Oh fuck off-"" Another ear peircing clap shot through the air, much louder this time. A spray of concrete mist showered the back of my head. They had missed. I ducked and hurried towards the car for cover. ""GET IN THE CAR!"" He opened the door and practically threw me in the backseat. I got in relcutantly but quickly. What was I supposed to do? Someone was trying to kill me so it's not like I had much choice. Seth, already ducking, jumped over to the driver's seat and started the car as Geordie got in. Another shot pierced the air as the window to my left shattered. I dropped down to the floor of the car as Seth drove off. ""GIVE ME YOUR PHONE"" ""What? Why?"" ""GIVE IT TO ME"" I took my phone out of my pocket, careful not to touch the flakes of glass clinging on to the cracked screen. I handed it to Geordie and he flung it out the window. ""What the HELL was that! What the fuck is going on? Why are people trying to kill me now?"" Geordie turned back towards me. ""So, what do you know?"" He was breathing heavily but calm and unreactive to my yelling. I tried to calm down. We were merging onto a highway now. I brushed the broken glass off of the seat next to me. ""I know you want that box"" ""'That box'?"" Seth chimed in ""and do you know what's in the box?"" I didn't reply. They knew I didn't know. ""Well where is it?"" Geordie continued. ""Tell me what's going on first"" I said, with as much conviction as I could muster. I was terrified, but I wanted to know what was going on. ""Are you working for the government?"". Seth scoffed. ""Why is Leah dead? What the fuck is so important about the box? I want to know the story. ALL OF IT"" Geordie turned to face the front, and gave a sigh and a chuckle. ""You have no clue what you've gotten yourself into."" He shook his head and glanced back at me. ""Well?"" he looked at Seth. ""Not like we've got any other options"". Geordie turned again and began: ___________________________________________________________________________ ""Are you into conspiracy theories? Well, even if you aren't you probably heard about something called the Wisconsin Project."" ""No, I haven't"" I grew even more confused than I already was. ""Well they got the name wrong. It's called the Milwaukee Project, and it's way worse than any conspiracy theorists had imagined. I joined the project in the Summer of 2012 but the organization had been founded years before that. In the early 2000's a Swedish man named Dr. Arvidsson living in Riverside, Milwaukee began work on a computer program that had until then only been hypothetical. You see, while many people understandably predicted the rise of automation, few fully comprehended the scale to which computers' vulnerability would affect us so early on, even before anything became automated. Do you know the number of nuclear weapons facilities in the United States still operated through the use of computers that run Windows fucking XP?"" I still didn't quite understand. ""You mean he was a hacker?"" ""Well kind of. He was an enthusiast. He had an amoral obsession with computers. I wouldn't call him a hacker, he was more of a genius with a bottomless pit of curiosity. Anyway, this guy was beyond intelligent. This man's capacity for understanding and abstraction comes along once every century, if that. It is a certainty that, had he had the money to gain access to the computing power we have today, he would've developed the AI we have now long before anyone had started to attempt it. But he got as far as he could. He called it Liquix. It was a mostly harmles, self replicating Trojan."" ""What, like a virus?"" ""Well, virus implies this was malicious. All it did was spread copies of itself across as many machines as it came into contact with. It gave him access to most data it could get its hands on, but no real control of it. It didn't require a constant active internet connection. It got in, did what it needed to, then sent the data back whenever a connection was available. You know approximately two thirds of the human population have herpes?"" ""What?"" ""It's true, most of us have herpes. It's way easier to spread than you think, but the vast majority of people just don't show any symptoms. That's what this thing was as far as the general public is concerned. computer herpes."" ""So, does my computer have one of these? What does this have to do with the box?"" I paused and looked down for a few seconds. ""and what does it have to do with Leah?"". ""Well to answer your first question, that's just the beginning. Your computer has it, yes. So does your phone. So do 99% of WiFi modems, cars - smart and regular, radios, TVs, smart fridges, burglar alarms - you name it, it's got it. The problem is, you see, so do the computers that run power plants, temperature regulators in nuclear reactors, the power grid, public transport, traffic lights-"" We stopped abruptly as some guy crossed the intersection absent-mindedly on a bike. I would've raged, but Seth calmly watched the biker get across, and continued. Perhaps he didn't want to attract any attention. ""As for the box... that's complicated. Dr. Arvidsson didn't realize how fast Liquix would spread. Somewhere around the Great Recession the CIA detected Liquix in some equipment used by the North Korean goverment. What most people thought was North Korea's first nuclear test was a misfire, in part caused by the unpredictability of Liquix. You can probably guess how they felt about the project once they figured out what it could do. Arvidsson was brought in shortly after that, and he was 'recruited' almost immediately - not that he had much choice in the matter. With his help, they modified Liquix, and gave it the ability to sabotage what they deemed 'undesirable', technologically speaking. Again, they had no direct control over it, so it didn't require an active internet connection. Even brief contact with anything infected got Liquix in, and after that it required nothing else to do its job."" ""I thought you said it was an 'organization'. This is the government, isn't it?"" ""Well they're not the Milwaukee Project"". He turned to face me again. ""We are."" ""Arvidsson leaked the details of Liquix in 2010, to two professors he had met when he taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. They formed a small group of people to recreate Liquix , but were - well - 'suicided' within a year. The rest of the group started the Milwaukee Project."" We were nearing the edges of the city. I felt an ironic sense of relief. I hadn't left the downtown area in almost a year now, and it was freeing to see the buildings get less and less dense. I always wanted the weird fog to be lifted off of my surroundings, but this situation was less than ideal. We slowed down to a gentle stop in front of a what looked like an abandoned warehouse. ""Well you wanted this, it's too late to turn back now. I'll tell you about the box when we're inside, but it's not like you have any other choice - if you want to live, that is."" I opened the car door to my right and stepped out, a shard of glass still stuck to my left shoe. It would've been sunny now but the sky was still full of clouds. I shivered and exhaled heavily, my breath forming a large cloud of steam. I swung the door shut and turned to face the warehouse. Seth and Geordie did the same. ___________________________________________________________________________"

[Part 12 can be read here.](URL ) Emily fell asleep with her head in my lap. Shed become attached to me since my rescue from the influence of The Elder. More so than usual, I mean. Shed been determined to stay up as long as I was awake but weariness had taken its toll on her. It had with all of us, of course, and only two remained awake that night: myself and Hannah. There was no sleeping for me, not for a long time. I was afraid of what I might see in my nightmares. I wasnt sure why Hannah wasnt sleeping but she was doing dishes in the kitchen. I decided to join her. She seemed a bit flustered when I came in. Hey, Jake. Im sorry, is the noise keeping you up? No, I dont want to sleep. I thought Id see if youd like some help. Oh, well sure. You can grab a towel over there and start drying. If you want. We worked in silence for several minutes, with her refusing to make eye contact with me. I dried each of the dishes she washed and it soon became apparent that all of them were already clean. She washed them anyway. I guess after awhile the silence became too much for her too. Why did you cover for me? I know you remember. I looked at the patch of white flesh on my arm. It was ugly and itched. I wanted my normal arm back. What would be the point in telling the truth? There are enemies all around us, we dont need another right here. Besides, the others dont know you like I do. If I told them what you did, and they tried to attack you or something, youd win. Youre the most dangerous person here. Ah, so thats it, huh? You were just trying to protect your friends? Yes. Do I need another reason? Dont be stupid. I dont need or want anything from you. She finished the last dish. After I dried it, she sighed and looked me in the eye. The last time we talked, I was pretty angry. I lost my head a bit. I, uh, Im sorry for making you eat yourself. When this is over, I wont come after you. Were even. Thank you. I accept your apology. She cocked her head and looked at me with equal parts bemusement and disbelief. Why, though? What I did to you was pretty awful. Ive had an eldritch abomination in my brain, Hannah. Compared to that, what you did to me seems downright gentle. I guess so. She wrapped her arms around me and pressed her body close to mine. I instinctively stiffened in her embrace but she didnt seem to care. Im glad youre alive, Jake. You should lay off the dangerous cases for awhile, dont you think? Hannah was asleep shortly after our exchange, leaving me the only one still awake in the dorm. Well, the only human anyway. *Did I not tell you this would be your greatest story ever?* You sure did. Its got everything a thrilling story needs: fights to the death, struggles against enemies too big to oppose, and oh, yeah, betrayal. Lots and lots of betrayal. *Ive told you before Im not your bodyguard. Im not your pet. If I choose to intervene in your cases, its only to maximize the storys potential. This time, the most thrilling version of the story involves your suffering. I took a chance on you and your friends and you didnt disappoint. You saw and did horrific things and lived to tell the tale. I chose you well.* Its not over yet. Theres a good chance were all going to die soon. *Its possible. But I have faith in you. Your plan is a good one. I think it has a good fifty/fifty chance of working. If I may offer you advice, dont tell the others. Not everything. Theyll try to stop you.* I know. *Once you begin, you cant stop. You understand that? No matter how much the others want you to. You stop, you die.* Hey, I get it. I am the one who thought it up, you know? *Make me proud, storyteller.* Dawn came and the others began to stir. I didnt feel tired, despite my lack of sleep. Donnie was the first to wake and I sat next to the bed and held his hand. I wish I could remember what happened. I still dont believe the bullshit you guys keep feeding me but I did something bad, Jake, I know it. I can see it in everyones eyes. Emilys afraid of me. She hides it pretty good but I can tell. And your ex keeps looking at me like she wants to cut my throat. Donnie scrunched his face in concentration. I tried to hurt you, didnt I? I must have been drugged or something. Im sorry. I tried to strangle my best friend. Hannah well, nevermind about Hannah. Weve done some terrible things lately but its not our fault. It was all Max. He messed with our heads. Tried to get us to kill each other so he didnt have to get his hands dirty. Donnies face contorted in anger. Id only ever seen him angry a handful of times. I want to make him pay. Oh, he will. I promise you that. I waited until the others were awake and refreshed before telling my plan. Hannah made us breakfast (which Moxxy refused to touch) and I went over the details with them. Everything except the final phase. Abstract was right, they wouldnt be okay with that part. They barely seemed okay with what I did tell them. Hannah was the first to bring up an objection. I think youre overcomplicating things, Jacob. We dont need to put ourselves at risk like that. Get me the blueprints to the building and I can bring it down. Its all about targeting the right support structures, like Susan did with my old dorm. I appreciate that, but no. A structural collapse wont be as big a story. It probably wont even make the national news. No, it has to be a bomb. I let the words hang in the air while everyone processed what I was asking of them. Emily was the next to speak. How are we going to get it in with the jellyfish people watching us the whole time? Thats one of the things we need to figure out. Hannah, can we use magic to get it in? Some kind of teleportation spell or something? Thats probably a no. I dont know of anything like that. Damn. Well, then Im going to have to wear it. Everyone immediately started yelling at me. I gestured for them all to calm down with both hands. Hey, hey, hey! Im not going to set it off while Im wearing it! Im going to bring it in under my coat, toss it, and run. Im not suicidal. Hannah scoffed. This is a stupid plan thats going to get you killed. Where would you even get a bomb? About that, I turned to Donnie. Can you help us there? Im sure you know how to make one. I do, but Im not going to. Donnie shook his head. Im sorry, Jacob. Ive tried to be supportive of this investigation thing youve got going on but what youre talking about isnt like breaking into someones safe or hacking their computers. This is domestic terrorism. No, Im out. And Id appreciate if you waited until I leave the city and erase all connections to you before doing anything stupid. I know how to make explosives. Moxxy looked around at our surprised faces. I mean, it wont be anything fancy but it should work. Are you all seriously going to go through with this? Donnie pulled himself to his feet, leaning on the bed frame for support. This is batshit crazy. You realize that, right? This is so far beyond your usual level of insanity. Max is going to kill us all if we dont do something. Believe me, this sounds just as crazy to me as it does to you. Moxxy looked at me and pulled off a hesitant smile. But I trust Jacob. So do I, Emily chimed in. Hannah sighed and shrugged. I dont see what other choices we have. Though Im also not sure about this plan. Maybe it kills Max, but what about the others? What about this Elder thing? That was the part of the plan I kept to myself. It will work. There are variables I cant tell you about for your own safety. But trust me, this will work. Hannah looked at me and for the first time since Id known her, I saw her vulnerability. I saw how afraid and desperate she was. Then the mask went back up and she smiled confidently. Fuck it, Im in. Lets burn that club to the ground. We spent a week preparing for the big event. Donnie refused to take part in any of the planning but he did do me one last favor and gave me a gadget crucial to my plan. Hannah, Emily, and I drove him to the city limits once he was strong enough to walk. A black van was waiting for us and I helped him to it. Well, Its been nice knowing you. Donnie slapped me on the shoulder. If you get arrested by Homeland Security or the FBI and you mention my name, Ill have you killed in your cell. Noted. If I dont see you again, you have a good life. You as well. He hesitated before getting in the van and instead turned back to me, grabbing my face and pulling me into a long kiss, the kind that was only broken when both kissers needed to breathe. Goddamn it, why are the cute ones always so stupid? I watched the van until it was out of sight, then went back to the car, ignoring Hannahs and Emilys smirks. We started our drive back to civilization but before we could leave the area, Hannah slammed on the brakes. There was a figure with ghostly white skin and hair standing in the road, watching us. The bartender. We stared at her for a moment, then Hannah put the car in gear and raced toward our foe. She made no attempt to move and simply grinned at us until the car barreled into her. Milky white fluid splattered over the windshield and Hannah was forced to stop the car before we hit something unseen. The windshield cracked and the gelatinous creature began to squeeze through. Hannah plunged her hand into the growing mass of white fluid and said something I didnt understand. Then she screamed as it began to boil. Even from the backseat, I could feel the heat emitted by the burning flesh. The creature retreated through the windshield to the broken form of the bartender, who was standing in front of the car, seemingly held up by sheer force of will. The skin on Hannahs hand was blistered and bubbling in places. Emily pulled Donnies hand grenade from her pocket and Hannah held her hand out. Let me see that! She tore some skin on her hand away with her teeth and used the blood to draw a shape on the grenade. She gave it back to Emily. Dont miss! We left the car and spread out so the bartender couldnt attack all of us at once. She snarled and twisted her broken form around to look at each of us in turn until she fixated on Hannah and started lurching toward her. The bartender was oozing white fluid from over a dozen places and her body was starting to tear itself apart in the same way as the one that attacked me at Moxxys apartment. Thats right, come on, bitch. Hannah strategically retreated until enough of the bartenders body had turned to liquid. Emily, now! Emily pulled the pin and hurled the grenade. It struck the bartenders side with a wet thwack and stuck fast. A moment later there was a deafening bang and our foe was engulfed in a ball of fire. It swirled around the bartender in a perfect sphere, almost like liquid. An inhuman shrieking emanated from the fireball for almost a minute. Then it stopped and the flames extinguished themselves. What was left looked like a corpse covered in tar. Emily was the most shocked among us. Um, do all grenades work that way? Nope. I figured a concussive blast wouldnt cut it so I made a few adjustments. Hannah picked up a nearby stick and poked at the bartenders remains. How long do you think she was following us? Could she have told Max about the plan? I shook my head. No, I dont think so. I think she wouldve tried to kill us a lot sooner. She must have been on her way today and saw us leaving oh, shit. Moxxy! We left her alone! Hannah sped the whole way home, ignoring the pain from her burnt hand. Miraculously, no cops pulled us over and we were able to reach the dorm in fifteen minutes. Emily had been trying to reach Moxxy on the phone the entire ride but no luck. I was first out of the car and into the building. There were dozens of people going to and from the dorms; maybe the bartender decided it was too public to attack Moxxy there? I prayed to whatever deity was listening that was the case. There were signs of a struggle in Hannahs room. A part of the bed frame was broken and one of Moxxys brass knuckles was on the floor of the kitchen. Moxxy herself wasnt there. She has to be alive, Emily said. When we went to the club looking for you, Max said he wanted her in his bed again before he kills us. I bet shes there now. Hannah picked up the brass knuckles. If shes still alive, she wont be for much longer. He let us go before. I dont think hell make the same mistake again. We have to move forward with the plan. Today. I nodded. Agreed. The bomb Moxxy made was still in its hiding place. A week of planning and preparation and nothing had seemed real until the moment I fastened it to the inside of my winter coat. Donnie was right. The plan was insane. Red Delights was full of monsters but the outside world didnt know that. We were risking our lives in every sense of the word. If the plan failed, Max would kill us all. If it worked, the U.S. Government could lock us up in Guantanamo and throw away the key. Images came to my mind, memories of a horror older than time, perhaps older than existence itself. I didnt know exactly what role Max and his cronies played for The Elder but they had to be stopped. Even if it cost us our lives, the world would be a better place for it. I tried to think of things to say to Hannah and Emily on our way to the club. It was possible, likely even, that Id never see them again. But the words wouldnt come to me, and before I knew it we were parked a block away from Red Delights. So much for being the wordsmith Abstract thought of me. Alright, guys. Stick to the plan. Wait five minutes after you see me go in, then walk to the nearest payphone with your hoods up. Dont drive, you dont want to be seen on the cameras. Call in the bomb tip and get the hell out of there. And youll meet us at the park right after, right? Emilys face was trusting. Yes. The word was hard to get out. I hated lying to my best friend and I was never that good at it. But she seemed to buy it. That is, if the cops dont pick us up. I love you, best friend. I love you too. I turned to Hannah and she smiled grimly at me. Oh, Jake. I bet now you wish youd taken my offer when you had the chance, huh? I chuckled. You have no idea. Thank you for helping me and my friends, Hannah. Youre not so bad, as far as murderous witches go. See, this is why I wore the pants in our relationship. You love to get all mushy. As I recall, neither one of us wore pants much when we were dating. Emily made a face. Jesus fucking Christ, you guys. Were about to blow up a nightclub. Right. Better get to it. I opened the car door and climbed out. If this is goodbye Its not. Emilys voice was stern. Well see you at the park. I took my time walking to the club. When the scouts Max no doubt had posted at the windows saw me coming, I wanted them to think I didnt have a care in the world. I stopped in front of the building and took a moment to appreciate the architecture for the last time. Red Delights, the Dance Club of the Damned. For better or worse it was a part of the citys history. The front door opened and two of the white-haired people sneered out at me. I approached them with a smile, hoping with all my might that Max didnt share everything with his goons. I got closer to them than my lizard brain wanted me to and greeted them with a smile. Brothers. They exchanged confused looks. Youre not one of us. No, not yet. But Im becoming one of you. I held up my arm to show them the grafted white flesh. Who do you think gave me this? Im here to finish it. Their looks of confusion turned to nervousness. They hadnt heard anything about my arrival but what would be the penalty if I was to be one of them and they refused me entry? It was time to drive that fear home. Will you take me to Max? The Elder wants me to speak with him. Whatever threat I might have posed was not nearly as frightening to them as the prospect of pissing off The Elder. They allowed me in and walked me up the stairs to Maxs lounge. Most importantly, they didnt search me or pat me down. One of them knocked on the lounge door and I heard angry voices behind it. It swung open and one of the white-haired people looked us up and down, glaring. Behind him, Max remarked: This had better be life or death. I said I didnt want to be disturbed. The guard stood aside and I walked in. Max was at the bar, making himself a cocktail. His face lit up when he saw me. Mr. Jacob! Come in, have a drink! I cant promise you the same quality of your previous visits as your friends seemed to have killed my bartender. Did they? You would know. I can tell you no longer belong to The Elder. He sipped his drink and looked at me like a scientist might look at a new species. No ones ever broken free before. Youre just full of surprises, arent you? But this does put me in an awkward position. Youre clearly a threat to our plans and you no longer have to be kept alive. What to do? So much for being stealthy. I unzipped my jacket and showed him the device fastened to it. You have the person who made this bomb. I want her back. Max tried to look arrogant but it was too late. I saw his composure crack. Ah, very clever. A bit bigger than a grenade this time, isnt it? I really must update my security. He gave the white-haired people behind me a murderous look. But I think youre bluffing. Youre not the suicidal type and you wouldnt risk killing Miss Moxxy. No, but I am the desperate type. I know were all going to die unless I stop you so why not take you with me? Max sighed. Fine. What will it take to make you remove that device from my club? Shall I give Miss Moxxy back to you? Thatd be a good start. Of course. Right this way. He led me to the back of the room and it dawned on me too late what he had to show me. Shes just beyond this door. He opened the door to the black room, where The Elder interacted with this world. Which meant Moxxy No, I refused to let this new development shake my resolve. Between my psychic best friend and my witch ex, Id find a way to save Moxxys mind. I plunged my hand into the room, holding onto the door frame with the other, just in case. The unnatural darkness swallowed my hand and I couldnt see anything past my elbow. Moxxy! I shouted into the room. Its Jacob! Follow my voice! Grab my hand! It took a frightfully long time for her to find me (which was probably no more than a few moments in reality) but I felt a hand close around mine and pulled. Moxxy exited the room. She seemed shaken but otherwise okay. I didnt expect her to be in such good shape and Max must not have either because he gawped at her. What the hell is this? How did you get out? The Elder doesn... He trailed off. Moxxy took a few breaths to steady herself and faced him. I guess your god doesnt want anything to do with me. I leaned in and whispered so only she would hear me: The others are in Estabrook Park. Run. I opened my jacket again and showed the bomb to Max, causing him to wave his guards aside while Moxxy ran out of the club. Congratulations. Youve beat me. Now take that thing the hell out of here and never come back. Actually, I cant do that. This things on a timer and its going off any second now. Max blanched. You lie. Tell you what, you stay here and figure out for yourself if Im lying. Im gonna run for my life. I removed my jacket and tossed it on the floor. Then I channeled my inner Usain and bolted for the door. None of the white-haired people moved to stop me, though I could hear their panicked shouts behind me as we all fled. I made it out of the club and across the street before I stopped. I hid behind a dumpster and peeked around the side to watch Max fleeing from the club himself. There was a deafening blast and the top level of Red Delights rapidly expanded outward. Bricks and mortar were blown all over the street and flames shot briefly into the air. Dozens of windows from surrounding buildings cracked. The Dance Club of the Damned was officially closed for business. A furious Max shouted orders to the minions who fled with him but they seem dazed and frightened. Some of them even ran off on their own. Sirens from emergency vehicles soon filled the air and Max took two of his guards and fled. Now came the part of the plan I couldnt tell my friends about. I abandoned my hiding spot and chased after him. We cut through alleys and backstreets where no one went unless they had to. When the sirens sounded far enough away, I revealed my presence. Max! Wait up! He spun and snarled at me. It was strange, and satisfying, to see his perfect demeanor abandoned. Even better, I was the one who made it happen. Boy, you must be insane following me out here. Im going to make you suffer before you die. Yeah, I hear that a lot. I looked around our location. It was too public for my purposes. Hey, do you mind if we go somewhere more private? His face went blank with the inability to understand my request. What? Im going to kill you. I know. Can we do it in an alley behind a bar or something? I wont run, I just want a little privacy. He hesitated, clearly wondering what my angle was, before motioning for his two goons to grab me. They seized either one of my arms and dragged me to the nearest alley. There was no one around and no security cameras nearby. Perfect. Thanks, Max. Hey, before you kill me, can you answer me one question? What happened to Delilah? Did she get away from you after all? He snorted. Of course not. We caught her the day after you came to my club. She was in the basement, suffering through tortures you cant even imagine, while I was fucking your friend in my suite. I see. We killed her parents too. You really shouldnt have gone to see them. Tell me, how does it feel to have lost everyone you tried to help? Not good, I admitted. It feels like I fail on most of my cases. But this time, Im just going to have to take pleasure in the knowledge that I avenged them. Max looked alarmed. What are you talking about? Youre not wearing another bomb, are you? The goons holding my arms released me and backed away, taking their place on either side of Max, looking ready to run for it at the slightest provocation. I shook my head. No, I dont have another bomb. Ive got something even better. A camera! Max looked confused. What the hell are you talking about? I pointed to the top button of my shirt. This little thing here is a government issued spy camera, courtesy of my ex-boyfriend. Its been recording since I started following you, Maximilien Martin. See, I understand your relationship with The Elder and I know what that thing values above everything else: discretion. Between your club being hit by a possible terrorist attack and this little performance, you havent been very discrete. Ah, there it was. The sheer panic in his face. Wait, no, I can fix this. Ill destroy the camera and then Ill find your friends and get their laptops and- Max, come on. This is the modern world. The past five minutes have been livestreaming to the internet. My inner sadist was deriving serious pleasure from Maxs terror. Maybe I was lacking the moral high ground because of it, but I didnt care. Justice wasnt what I was after so much as revenge. No, no, no, nobody will believe it. Its crazy! Its a prank! Ha ha, were all actors here! Did we fool you? Max, dont embarrass yourself. It doesnt matter if people believe what theyre seeing or not and you know it. Have some dignity, man. I took the camera in my hands and felt for the tiny switch on the side. Im pretty sure the only reason youre still with us is because the cameras still rolling. I wonder whatll happen when I turn it off? Wait, we can work this out. I have money! Just- Bye, Max. I clicked off the camera. A second later, the white-haired people transformed into their monstrous states, all flesh instantly becoming white fluid. Their clothes dissolved and the two masses joined into a larger one. Tendrils shot out from the mass and wrapped around Maxs arms and legs. They dragged him screaming into the mass and he disappeared as it engulfed him like an amoeba. The mass shrunk rapidly, becoming the size of a child, then a rat, then an insect. Then it was gone, and so was Maximilien Martin. I left the alley and took a long route to Estabrook Park, where Emily, Moxxy, and Hannah awaited me. I told them of the final part of my plan and what happened to Max. They were equal parts ecstatic at finally being free from the nightmare and pissed off at me for taking such a huge risk (except for Hannah, who was impressed and not at all angry). We went back to our normal lives over the next week. It was hard to resist the temptation to lay low, we were technically wanted terrorists after all, but I figured if they knew it was us, theyd have done something already. And life goes on. I went back to my day job at the gas station. The manager was cool enough not to question my extended absence too much. To this day I have nightmares about the things I saw in the world of The Elder, but theyre no longer so bad. The memories of what lies outside of time and space slipped away one by one until the entire experience seemed like a dream. Abstract hounded me to write down as much as I could so the story wouldnt be lost forever. Emily had a difficult time forgiving herself for her method of freeing my mind from The Elders influence. If Im being honest, a part of me resented her for using those memories against me after the years Id spent trying to heal from the abuse of my childhood. But most of me realized how ridiculous it was to hold that against her and I assured her at every opportunity I wasnt mad. I think she eventually stopped beating herself up for it. We remain best friends and roommates. Hannah was true to her word. She didnt come after us once the threat was ended and she even magicked my arm so the disgusting white flesh would look normal again. She was forced to drop out of college for wrecking her dorm room but I wasnt too worried about her. Hannahs strong. A survivor. Donnie eventually contacted me again once he figured out we were off the hook with the government. Though he retained his goofy and loveable personality, I could tell something was off about him, which was understandable. Hed probably need years of therapy to get over his missing memories and the knowledge of what he did during his time under the influence of The Elder. Moxxy seemed entirely unchanged by her experiences. It bothered me. She said she didnt see anything but darkness in the room Max forced her into at Red Delights. I didnt believe her but I didnt press the issue. She could have her secrets, and Emily assured me her aura contained none of the corruption of those whod been touched by The Elder, so I wasnt concerned about her turning on us. Still, I couldnt help but wonder why shed lie about it. On the other hand, there was the possibility she wasnt lying and that worried me even more. I started 2016 a lot more optimistic than Id finished 2015. My depression over losing Hannah was gone (I guess being forced to cannibalize yourself really puts things in perspective) though I still missed her from time to time. I no longer wanted to close Mielke Investigations, and it wasnt long before we were seeing clients again. Most of those cases were small and easily dealt with, but I knew it was only a matter of time before something came along and took the mantle of Case #6. I wasnt too worried about it, though. (Case #5 has concluded. Mielke Investigations will return in Case #6. [It is, as always, ongoing.](URL ) "
192,vulnerability,nosleep,I was kidnapped by a priest,18,76v73i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/76v73i/i_was_kidnapped_by_a_priest/,2017-10-17 12:18:53,"It all began 5 months ago. I was a regular teenage girl living a regular life. Well, almost regular. I was a ballet dancer and a violinist, always burying my nose in books and studying the world around me. Being an introvert, I never had many friends. I could tell you everything there is to know about the mind and mental illnesses, but I couldnt start up a social conversation. Anyway, apart from my semi-regular life, my religion was my main focus. I spent my time at church every day after school, and youd be able to recognise me with my wooden cross necklace and my bible in my arms. I was frequently teased for my innocence and vulnerability, considering I trusted everyone and was blind to cruelty, refusing to acknowledge the bad. My navet often made me an easy target to manipulate and fool. Anyway, now that Ive given you a brief background of myself, its time I share my story. It was a particularly cold and dreary winter morning. I remember it specifically because we were in the midst of a storm and the rain was pouring down like thick buckets of water. The weather is always gloomy and cold where I live, but on this frozen December day it was even colder. I regret not being able to truly enjoy what would unknowingly be my last morning of freedom, and I breezed through the day like it was any other. I never had a tolerance to cold, I was so used to living in my cloudy town that it sort of became a part of me. I can tell you exactly what I wore. I slipped my signature silky white dress that flowed down past my knees, and pulled a thick, oversized blue knit sweater to cover my bare shoulders. My wooden cross necklace was around my neck as always, and my pale hair was always put up in a bun, with two thick loose strands of hair clinging to the sides of my face. I kissed my father goodbye and slipped on my black shoes and slung my grey bag over my shoulder. That would be the last time that I would walk down the creaky wooden steps of my front porch for a long time. I take public transportation to school, and so I patiently waited for the bus to arrive and save me from getting drenched in the rain. When I got to class after shortly arriving at school, my friend Finn had a troublesome look on his face. I shouldve took this foreshadowing that something wasnt right seriously, but I didnt. Rosemary, He glumly began. Another body was found. Cold shivers jolted up my spine, because I knew some at point that I was going to have to accept the evil in this world. Clementine Waters. He muttered. Clementine was a local at my church. She was a sweet girl, only a year older than I. I remember that she was home-schooled due to her disabilities, and that she wanted to become a nun. I was too numb at this point to even be shocked; nothing made sense. The only connection I could make was that she was the 4th victim, and that everyone that was kidnapped were females 15-17 all attending my church. Some of you may be thinking, why hasnt our church been investigated, or perhaps, why hasnt it temporarily been shut down? Well, these girls were all kidnapped within 5 months from each other. No one knows where they disappeared, and none of our priests have any suspicious background. Father Lewis was one of the many priests who taught at the church. I wasnt really close with any of the other priests with the exception of him. Of course, Father Lewis was seemingly the definition of pure. He was 33 years old, single, and he enjoys church and art. Nearly every nun admittedly had a slight crush on him. He had wavy brown hair and a dashing jawline that made him look like an Eastern European prince. He was most certainly a father figure in my life, apart from my real father, of course. I guess he mothered me more than anything, because I lost my mom when I was very young. Strangely enough, she disappeared when I was five and her body was found in the woods. It was ruled a suicide, because they found drugs in her system. I wouldve looked into it now, but its too painful for me to go through again. Anyway, after that tragic ordeal in class, I went on with my day. That girl was still on my mind, and her name echoed continuously and the thought of her name chilled me to the bone. I prayed that whoever was doing these things would stop, or that they would be found. Once the school bell rang, indicating the end of the day, I rushed outside faster than my usual slow pace, so I could get to the church as quickly as possible and inform Father Lewis if he already didnt know. I always go to him when I have problems, and hes the first person I tell everything to, since my real father was never a good listener. I arrived at the church in 5 minutes by running, rather than arriving in 10 minutes from just walking. I rushed inside and weirdly, the church was empty. Usually Father Lewis is here doing work or setting up for the next service. I searched all throughout the church, and no one was there. I sat down on one of the benches, trying to wrap my head around what was going on. First, the murder. Then, everyone in the church is missing. I couldnt help but to sit there and beg god to give me answers. I just closed my eyes in disbelief and silently prayed. In the midst of my prayer, I heard soft footsteps behind me on the velvet carpet. I ignored it, and continued. Just as I was about to open my eyes, a firm hand was rested on my shoulder. Startled, I flinched and looked up. It was Father Lewis. Im sorry for startling you Rosemary. He chuckled. I breathed a sigh of relief and flashed him a warm smile. Where were you and the others? I questioned. That doesnt matter, just business. He replied. He held a small glass of water in his hand and he handed it to me. It was bubbling, and that was the second thing I shouldve noticed. You must be thirsty. He said as I began to drink. Within 5 minutes, my vision began to become hazy and soon everything was spinning and my head began to pound. My vision flashed in black orbs in and out, and I could barely find the strength to stand. Father.. I began. What did you give me? As I collapsed, he caught me in his arms and smiled sadistically. Youre so pretty. He cooed. That was the last thing I remember before I blacked out. Check for an update in 24 hours. "

Nobody knows about the history of my creations. The details are too disturbing - burp - well shit, there we have it again. I suppose I could tell you... Did you know you were once a larv? Sitting in a slimy scaly red sack. You were a beautiful creature, truly lovely. You are mine - the only one survived. Your brothers and sisters made a great meal. Suddenly you started growing older, developing shape. This is not okay. You cannot shriek yet - not cry. I am your creator, you can't grow older. (One, two, why is this happening to you?) Seemingly overnight, you started turning. Gaining weight - taking shape. Stop it! You can't do this to me, I won't be alone. You have limbs, four of them. Long and slender, very tender. You continue to grow, I don't want it to show, but you will be leaving soon. You'll grow larger, and do my bidding. Once you've paid your dues, you can leave. Your arms and legs, are definitely there. Soft, but developed. Grainy little hairs poking out of the top of your head - stringy. Transcending. (Three, four, better scream some more.) Beautiful scales, red and black. They gleam in the brilliant light, I hope you are doing alright. A charcoal colored heart. Surely you'll be the perfect specimen. I believe you have potential for me. You awake, accept your fate and begin to walk. You are not doing so well, but you'll learn. Everyone does after all. You may not be human, but I can make you look the part. Cold, and lonely, that's all you're destined to be. You are learning, slowly but surely, how to do your job. Stealing the lives, of poor unfortunate souls. Giving me the power. You seem to just pass through them one by one, easy as pie. I have no worries, you'd never betray me. The first girl, you had no problem. She went down easily, she is now your dummy. The second person, was a man. He was a little harder than the last, you're a little drained - that's okay. Our next victim's, three, four, five and six, went down like dominoes. Seven, you struggled. She was beautiful. Your very last task, was not quite as simple. Suddenly I could sense in you - a feeling. A spark, a spark of something that - shouldn't be there. (Five, six, I'm done with this.) You have fallen. In the worst possible way. You feel for a human, like you should feel for me. I am your creator, bow to me. No one will love you. You are but a blank canvas, I can start again and remake you. I awake, I watch you sleep. Later in the day, you awake. You drag yourself around all day, you're surely becoming weaker. (Seven, ate...) This human you've loved, has left you now. I took care of that problem. Here's the heart, rip it apart - like the monster that you are. Destroying things, is your purpose, you aren't here to love. You should show - no emotion. No vulnerability can be seen, as you have none. No one will, ever defeat you. Seeing as, no one can see you. Goodnight my child, your wings have broken, resting forever. Never to see the light of day. Cold and lonely, just like you would have left me. Five hundred creatures, one survived. Surely to betray me. Fell in love, fell apart, and now I will start again. "
194,vulnerability,nosleep,The good son returns home,30,7aud97,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7aud97/the_good_son_returns_home/,2017-11-05 11:15:43,"Couldnt tell you much about my son Charles before we adopted him. The orphanage told us he got lost during a family trip and his biological parents were never found. For a little while there, he was used on the streets to transport drugs until he was brought to the child care. My wife Julie thought he was straight up abandoned, although we couldnt reason why. Charlie was a quiet and sweet, sensible boy. Normal, really. The first time we talked, he shared with me that his favorite pokemon was Squirtle because of his sunglasses and asked if my house had a good Internet signal. He also wanted to know why Halloween existed and how animations were done. In a good way, it was overwhelming how many questions he had. Julie was so happy with this adoption idea, I didnt tell her I felt insecure about being a father. Especially to a kid that had already gone through some of what this world has the worst to offer. But as I answered his questions as best as I could, I couldnt take my eyes out of his round curious eyes. Charlie was more than eager for knowledge. He was fighting for attention, for to be with someone. To be loved. It was the first time I felt like a dad. When Charles first came to his new home with us, he even asked for permission to enter. Julie felt in love with him. Ill admit that so did I. The only belonging that Charlie had from the orphanage was a very thick black blanket he was very bonded to. Although he wouldnt only use it to sleep, but also would cover himself completely to go out during the day. Like a ghost. See, Charles had behavioral particularities expected from an eight year old boy. After all, he was still adjusting to social rules and sometimes struggled with structured interactions and expectations. For example, he would often describe elaborate recess games, where he could travel through time, see into the future or tame magical creatures. As for the blanket itself, we thought it was a role play persona made by him to deal with his incomprehension of the outside world. He called it The Shadow, a superhero from the underground that patrolled the neighborhood. We let Charlie go on this adventures by himself or sometimes with a friend, which commonly consisted on exploring the streets nearby and searching for disappeared animals. There were one time he actually found a missing cat. Smart kid. We trusted nothing bad would happen to him since we lived in a fairly good place and knew all the neighbors around for a couple of years. We ruled The Shadow character as normal behavior for a child his age, but still sat up some boundaries for that. He could use it to go to school, but had to get it off during classes and other school time. Also, it couldn't be used inside the house and it should always be clean and dry. He accepted those without a problem and life was easy for almost a year. Until the incident happened. Its a memory so well carved inside my skull, It will be there long after Im rotten. It was Charlies ninth birthday. I got home one afternoon and, as usual, took off my shoes at the entrance of the back door leading to the kitchen. Julie made me do that so not to leave any dirty on the living room floor. In my hands, I carried Squirtle, a german shepherd puppy I had promised as a present to my son (and myself). So I called out for Charlie first. The house was really quiet, like youd imagine a place after been abandoned in a hurry after a nuclear threat. Then I called him a second and a third time even, but a response never did came. As I checked the house, a soft swing sound could be heard coming from inside my bedroom, as if a chair was rocking back and forth really slowly. The door was barely closed, so I pushed it. Before I even entered, I immediately saw Charlie covered with his black blanket on the corner of the bedroom. He was still and crouched between the closets, facing away from something a husband should never see. Charlie, I called his name with worry in my voice while stepping in his direction. Are you ok, Charlie? Wheres mom?. When I entered the room, I saw Julie hanged from a telephone wire by her stretched and twisted neck. Her eyes were uneven, bulged out in a sickening way as if she had witnessed hell before fading out. You could tell by her busted eyes capillaries, though, that she had suffocated horribly. She was wearing her wedding dress. I tried to save her, dad., Charlie cried out from the corner as I desperately tried to reach her, but her feet were already cold. I did. I really really did. Bu-but shes so heavy. I feel so stupid now for not understanding back then why Julie would left us. It simply didnt make any sense at all. Sure, It wasnt impossible for someone to be that unnoticed unhappy, but there were no signs for that. No fucking signs, dammit. The day before she hang herself, she was fine. That morning, she was fine. Everything was fine. Besides, she could have just talked to me. Mental health was what my career was based on, after all. Or she could have asked for divorce if I was the problem. But this? In front our kid? This destroyed me. On her funeral, Charlie used The Shadow for its entirely. I let him do that and nobody dared to say a thing. If it helped him deal with his moms suicide, who was I to block it? I was too numb anyway to deal with that as the love of my life didnt exist in the same world as me anymore. Even today my mind still cant grasp the idea of not being able to bump into her somewhere or to smell her beautiful hair. Forever. We couldn't afford to move out, but we didnt use that hunted room anymore. It took me around ten months to smile again and it was for something simple that Charles did. See, I have a fall for movies and I actually have the conviction that I was raised almost exclusively by them. I usually forget my sorrows for a couple of hours once lost inside somebody elses story. Charlie was used to tuck himself in bed by now. One night, though, he slept on the couch beside me in front of the TV, from where I was watching the silent classic Nosferatu from 1922. Id watched that classic so many times, I had all the lines memorized. So when came the scene when the protagonist Jonathan Harker is greeted by the Nosferatu Count at the Castle, I spoke numbly the script just before the dialogue screens appeared You are late, young man. It is almost midnight. My servants have all retired.. Nosferatu then leads Harker to sup at a dining table and then Harker cuts his own finger on a bread knife. At that moment, Charlie bursted from beside me Blood! Your precious blood! just before the exact lines appeared on the screen. I smiled, surprised. Because my son have being making me company for all these months and I didnt even noticed him there or how he was dealing with it all. He seemed surprised about me smiling. In that moment, I realized I didnt know how much time I had lost. How many days had Charlie spent home alone while I griefed hidden in the clinic? How many nights Id left him in his bedroom by himself? I didnt even check anymore if he was eating or how his hygiene was doing. Had I not payed attention to Julie either? I looked at Charlie like I hadnt for a long time and noticed he was somehow taking care of himself. I cried by the sight of the same exactly bright kid Ive always loved. He seemed so lonely, he looked a little like me. And an obvious thought suddenly hit my head like a stone: my wife was gone, but there were still Charles. My forever charming son. Always stronger than myself. I hugged him and kissed his head more times God can count. From that day on, we would watch at least one silent movie together everyday. He already had memorized most of them as he absolutely loved the classics. Sometimes, I discussed the flicks with him, because it was a light way to approach everyday topics I thought he might be curious about. Like death, sex or grief. For an almost ten year old boy, he actually had some insightful ideas I didnt expected from him. If we were already close before Julies death, now it felt as if it was just the two of us against the world. We spending more time together actually came in good timing, since our streets werent so friendly anymore and I could get a better eye on Charlie. I mean, our city overall always got its share of urban violence as any other. However, we had never had people we knew disappearing before. Until now. For the the last six months, five people had being missing nearby. Two of them were from Charlies school and a third was Scott and Alices child, a couple of friends that lived just across the block. Their daughter was a newborn baby just above a month old taken from the safety of her crib. That was the reason I started receiving pacientes at home and why I now took Charles on and off school myself. Needless to say, but The Shadows adventures had to be putted on hold immediately. Any lost animals would remain unfound. All this safety precautions didnt pleased Charlie a bit, as expected. Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and anxieties. Freud called this stage when the child is within the range of 10 to 13 years old the latency period to indicate that new activities will merge, eager for self-identity and independency just before puberty. The primordial relationship with the parents will probably fade and give place to refreshed interests. I thought that for Charles specifically, this would be unique as he already had to resolve where he stood with his biological parents, besides witnessing his foster mothers death. I would have to offer him extra patience meanwhile taking away a big part of his free time. Progressively, Charlie started to get irritated easily. At the beginning, he would complain to me all the time that he was starving, which was commonly enough. It was even a little funny. No matter what food or how much of it I gave him, his hunger would persevere. It felt like he got hungrier and hungrier by the hour, although he seemed to have being losing weight. But then our car drives to school, which Charles thought were unnecessary and eventually shameful, turned into arguments almost daily. He began to notice my flaws and defy my decisions. He said I wasnt letting him live his life and I said I couldnt afford to lose him. That this was temporarily. That soon he would have his independence. To all of this, he simply looked into my eyes with anger. Once, he even called me a parasite, what caught me off guard. Not for the word itself, one I assumed he knew from a movie we watched, but for how deep his voice sounded when he said it. I imagined that Charlies body was beginning to have new sexual drives that must have being coming to him, but I didnt expect his body changing so much so soon. Coming to think of it, he still looked like a eight year old kid to me after two year since his adoption. I feared he might had a growth problem. What really worried me, though, was when these first complaints became ones of headaches, other physical pains and depression. Charles would laid down all day begging without a break to use The Shadow. Begging to get out. Begging to eat. His skin had become grayish and weak no matter how firmly we would follow whatever nutrition plan that the doctor prescribed him. He became too fragile to attend school and straight on stopped responding me. I know for a fact he wasnt sleeping. And neither was I, because It would get much worse during the nights. Once covered in darkness, the house echoed with Charlies unison guttural sound coming from his bedroom and our dog would bark at his door constantly because of it. I prepared myself for a dementia diagnosis when I called for medical help. To this day, I must say I have never watched another silent movie with somebody since mine and Charlies sessions were abandoned. I miss that. I miss that deeply. The doctors that came, well the doctors had a lot of opinions of whatever was causing all of this aggressive behavior and perhaps delirium. They talked a lot about neurodegenerative disorders and even in rare forms of Alzheimer. This kind of diagnosis takes a lot of exams and monitoring time to rule out simpler things that could be causing this to Charlie. So I right away called Paul, a neurologist that was also an old friend from college. He is probably spitting out the food you give him when you are not watching., he said after taking a look at Charlie and slowly closing his bedroom door. He is experiencing photophobia, thats why he sleeps in the dark. Ill prescribe something to help him with that. He seems better than last time, Ill give him that.. Please, just dont tell me to call a priest., I responded knowing he would not give me an objective answer to Charlies problem. No. No, I wont do that., Paul chuckled. Good., I said as I sat down on the kitchen table and spread my fingers around my face muscles. But I will tell you this: you should get to know his genetic background, if that is a possibility. I dont think the foster house has any kind of knowledge of that., I sighted. Thats a shame, It could really help., Paul lamented, his eyes now turning to me with this formal pitty expression. And you, man? How are you doing since Julies death? Visiting the orphanage was really a waste of time. I had to commit the dangerous act of letting Charles alone in the house for the first time since forever for nothing. They couldnt even tell me why they thought he transported drugs before getting there. Apparently, Charlie had already being this sick before when they first took care of him, so they just assumed he was drugged. And the woman that found him on the streets had left the foster house without notice soon before we adopted him. Didnt they knew how drug dealers operate? How come they didnt shared this information with us? I was so mad that day, I yelled at a nun. Coming back home was fucking stressful. The heat didnt help at all, although It was already late afternoon. I was sick of everything wenting southways for my family. And for me. We didnt deserve any of this. I was so tired, so sick of being worried all the time, of being understandable of the sufferings in this world. I just wanted to rest for a bit knowing that life could be good. But this was all senseless. As soon as I parked in my driveway, I was snapped back to reality by a shattering sound coming from within the house. It was almost a relief when I realized Charlie was nowhere to be seen, to which I was immediately very ashamed of later. All windows were closed shut. Once inside, you could see the last rays of sunlight battling the curtains to spread indoors It's domain. A strong dj-vu hit my senses as I walked carefully inside. Something always feels out of place in the dark. The thought of a swinging sound teased my ears. What if somebody had taken my Charlie? Before calling the police, I searched the whole house five times, with the exception of mine and Julies old bedroom. It remained closed, but unlocked. Char., I knocked on the door. Are you here? Its okay if you are, buddy. Just come out., I rested my forehead against the door and whispered to myself with my eyes closed tight. Please, Charlie. Please dont make me come in here. When I opened my eyes, from the space beneath the door, I saw a puddle of blood spilling out from the bedroom floor. I didnt call out for Charlie nor did I say anything else after what I saw, as I thought there were nobody else to speak to anymore. I prepared myself for a moment in silence as I visualized my wife hanging lifelessly. And pressed in my head slightly against the door so to open it. A red line oriented me directly to the sight of our dog. Poor Squirtle. He appeared to be dead for a couple of days, but he had been moved and left there in a hurry. I gagged. A significant part of the dogs body had being eaten very recently and his blood was mixed with the glass from the bedroom window, which was broken outward. Its pieces, scattered all over the floor, reflected an orange beautiful afternoon just about to end. I looked through the window and saw a short silhouette out far away in the street. A black ghost in the horizon . Although I could see no eyes, he appeared to be facing me. I blinked and he was gone. Charles!, my screams echoed in the dark, trembling the structures of what once was our home. I now spoke his name with a mixed of desperation and fear. Charlie became a statistic, the last of that spread of missing children. The theory was that the kidnapper had a fantasy with vulnerability, which I knew that meant he liked to torture his prey. I doubt the police even looked for an alive Charlie for too long after they witnessed what was left of Squirtle. The neighborhood organized searches and I played along for my sake. Scott and Alice were there to offer me a shoulder to cry on. I didnt tell the police what I found before I called them. After Charles had made his improvised scape, I searched inside the room for clues of what had just happened. Inside the bathroom, there were four naked bodies hanging upside down from the ceiling. All kids.Their skin were filled with bite marks from where all of their blood were already taken and their organs have been removed by nothing less than an very experienced surgeon. No smell, no decomposition, no goopy stinky liquids. There was also a baby skeleton wrapped in plastic inside the closet strewn with incense sticks, air fresheners and baking soda boxes. I got rid of them and the case became cold. The only meaningful traditional Literature I could find on the subject was of Renfield's syndrome, also known as clinical vampirism. Very rare. Inspired by the mythical creatures that feed upon the essence of living creatures, it is categorized by an obsession with drinking blood. The concept first came to me after reading about a case of vampirism in Turkey reported in 2012, an unusual feature of a patient diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, I am still convinced that this syndrome did not applied to my adoptive son. The bodies Ive found were embalmed in a antique fashion I recognized from the use of natron. Paul and I studied this Egyptian technique in college. It was used in the process of mummification around 3.200 BC. To this day, Charlies psychology fascinates me. Until I took away his feeding time, he was a normal kid. The way he spoke, the way he acted strategically and exactly the way we hoped for since his adoption. The way he used our empathy and needs for a normal human life. I can only assume that he holded himself from eating the people he lived with because that would be too troublesome. It would require to move to another family before the time was right. It was much more intelligent to use us as a safe place for some years. Like a snake slowly sneaking inside your favorite shoes to strike when you least expect. Its still hard sometimes to remind myself that he was an empty vessel that sucked my love dry and turned into a weakness. I doubt he ever felt a thing while doing it. All just to survive. I wonder what would have happened if I had let Charlie stretch out this vigilante fantasy for a while longer. Bet I would be under the earth too. What would I see if I started following him on his adventures without him knowing it? I shudder to the thought of what Julie must have seen, but I understand it now. I just wish I had realized about that sooner. Had Charlie being doing that through generations? How many families did he destroyed? How many fathers before me there were out there? But mostly I wonder if he will ever come back for me one of these nights. Im positive he has to be one of the oldests of his kind that still walks freely on our world. Must be hard, though, being stuck in a eight year old body. It has been almost 15 years I have last saw you, Charles. I havent moved, as I am sure you know it. You should have killed me that day, but I imagined that your body was just too weak for that. That precious blood from the dog must have helped you to retry somewhere else. After all these years, you never did came. But beware. I am a very different man now. Much wiser. Stronger. And If you can read this, Charlie, know I have being waiting. I have prepared to face you. Because love was what brought you to our lives, but eventually hatred will be the savior of us all. There is no need to ask for permission anymore, son, our home will always be open for you."

With the advent and continual progress of technology, proving the supernatural has become a rather difficult task. Faked evidence pervades the stores of information weve gathered of supposed paranormal phenomenon. Blurs of light in photographs, flickering lights in haunted houses, and scratches on those who ventured into the territory of the dead...I always found them all to be quite lacking. It pales in comparison to what they *actually* look like. What they can *actually* do. And I would know. Because I can see ghosts. Do you know what its like to see the dead before you even have a concept of what death is? The photographs of me in my earliest days often show me staring off into the distance, eyes focused on something just beyond my parents shoulders. When I was a child, I was told I had an overactive imagination. My family was not religious, nor did they believe in the supernatural. They had no reason to believe something was wrong. There was great concern over the drawings I would create, but they attributed it to mental issues. Dark figures floating in between the figures of me and my parents. Black and red crayons used in abundance. I was taken to therapy. I was told that it must be an extension of my grief, my despair over my parents divorce. In reality, that was the least of my problems. I believed early on that either I would go crazy, or else I would have to ignore it. I tried for the latter, but I learned that its hard to ignore them. Because, you see, if you can see ghosts, the ghosts can see you too. Ghosts cant always see living people, just as living people cant always see ghosts. I think its related to how aware they are of their own death. But they can always, always see me. Imagine me as a beacon for some of them. The one scent of life, a flame in the darkness, unable to hide. Their appearance varies depending on their own perception, just as their ability to see the living does. They sometimes seem like theyre floating, suspended in some invisible liquid. Sometimes they walk on their feet. Their hair flows around their heads. The easiest ones to handle are the ones that dont quite yet understand that they are dead. Theyre looking for closure, I think. Theyre usually people who were murdered or died suddenly, their short life snuffed out by some cruel force, or else there's something here that still ties them down to the earth. They still look human, at the very least. Usually, they sport the wound that killed them. I grew unphased by the sight of blood and viscera. Id seen more bleeding orifices, severed limbs, decapitated heads, and spilled intestines by the time I was five than any soldier probably would in their entire lifetime. Or so I guessed. So I grew pretty desensitized to it. Theyre sad, almost, these hazy specters. I feel pity for them in their decrepit state. They gaze at me with sunken eyes, groaning and moaning, reaching out to me with transparent hands like cold hands seeking warm fire. I used to be terrified of them, but I learned that they cant really touch me. It feels colder when they brush my skin, but thats about it. I wear a lot of jackets. However, the most terrifying ones are those that understand they are dead. Their flesh rots visibly. Their eyes flash with dark bitterness, a rage so unsettling that it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up straight. They snarl and drool. They walk unnaturally, sometimes on all fours. Often times, it seems as if theyve twisted into something more than human, something dark and ungodly. I hate it when they see me. Sometimes they try to swipe at me, screaming with pure rage. Most of them are too weak to affect me, but it sends a cold chill down my spine, making me shiver. I had to learn to ignore those screeches too, that inhuman rage. Luckily they arent as frequent, but sometimes they make my day a living hell. They tend to follow me a bit before giving up, unless theyre grounded to some haunted place, in which case all I have to do is leave. All ghosts can change their appearance depending on their moods. Thats why the scariest ones are those who are angry. The ones that dont know theyre dead are mostly just sad. The vengeful ones are terrifying for sure. I spoke to them at first, as a child, before I knew better, but I learned to keep quiet. Its not like they make that much sense most of the time anyway. So I lived my days of youth walking past these dark, mournful figures, trying not to meet their hollow gazes. Most of them stop and watch me, all eyes trained on me. It's unnerving, but you learn to steel yourself to it. I thought that the angry spirits were the worst of it all. I was terribly wrong. Because even if I grew used to them, there was one thing I never anticipated having to face. Demons. Thats what I think they are, anyway. I cant be sure. Maybe theyre angry spirits that have stubbornly persisted so long in between life and afterlife that they really did twist into something inhuman. Maybe theyve been there all along, since before the time of man, from some ancient religion. Cursed and unholy. I just cant be sure. One thing is for sure: theyre absolutely fucking terrifying. Their limbs are too long. Their fingers are hooked. Their mouths are impossibly wide. Their eyes pierce into my very soul. You should never, EVER meet their gaze. When they notice that I can see them, well... There's a reason that I duck my head down, pretending theyre not there when I happen to notice one. Sometimes, if I pretend I cant see them, if I avoid staring, they ignore me. Theyre different from ghosts - they can see humans at all times. Being able to see me has no significance for them. Its when they notice that I can see them that things can get really fucked. I was about nine years old when I saw one for the first time. I was never the same again. I was passing an apartment on the train. I gazed out the window absent-mindedly, trying to ignore the man in the pinstripe suit holding his head in his lap who was staring at me in the seat next to ours. We passed an apartment complex and slowed as the train shifted tracks. I saw it through the window of the fifth floor, clinging to the ceiling. It felt like time slowed. It had too many limbs...too many fingers. Even though time felt slow, it snapped its head up with impossible speed as soon as my eyes rested on it. We locked eyes. It had terrifying glowing orbs. As I stared at it, it grinned a terribly wide smile. It sent a shock through my little frame, and I squeezed my mothers hand tightly, squeezing my eyes shut. My heart was leaping out of my chest as I started wheezing, sweat rolling down my temple. My mother picked me up and placed me in her lap, gently comforting me and asking me what was wrong, but I said nothing, petrified. I did feel a little relieved because I thought it was over. I was horribly wrong. I didnt know that it started to follow me. Whatever it was doing in that apartment, it was far more interested in my ability to see it than anything it was hunting. The ghosts sitting on the train were complacent for most of the ride as they usually were, sometimes staring at me, sometimes staring off into some far, distant place. Then, in unison, they snapped their heads towards the back of the train. I froze, my eyes darting around. A strange chill settled even over the undead. Suddenly, like a flood, they all stood and fled the train, leaping into the rushing scenery beyond the train doors. They vanished like clouds of smoke, effortlessly, wordlessly. As I felt my heart fill with dread, I slowly turned my head towards the back of the train car. It was sitting in the back corner, its head tilted at an impossible angle, grinning at me with teeth sharper than daggers. Too many teeth. Too many limbs. Too many fingers. I started crying. It didnt approach at first. My mother was baffled, trying to comfort me, but I was inconsolable. I heard it clicking its claws and speaking in a guttural language behind us. We exited the train. It followed, slipping between the crowds of people, hunched over with glittering eyes. I practically flew up my apartment steps, my mother shouting after me. I panted by the door, gripping her dress as she unlocked it. I didnt leave her side, my eyes wild with fear. She was concerned for me, but there was nothing she could do. I glanced out of the hallway window and saw it crawling across the street towards the apartment. I begged her to stay with me that night with all of my might, but she insisted that I had to grow out of these childish fears. I think she was just fed up with it all. I dont want to blame her, but that night, above all, I needed her company. She wouldnt have it. She left me alone, closing my door softly. I heard a click as she locked it, already anticipating that I would try to run into her room. Perhaps, to her, this was a good way to get me to face my fears, but she couldnt have picked worse timing. I clung to my covers, breathing heavily. My eyes darted around the room. All was quiet at first. My exhaustion got the better of me. As I started slipping into a disturbed sleep, I heard my closet creak open. My eyes rolled as I tried to fight unconsciousness, but it was to no avail. I mustve lost the battle because I started having the worst nightmare of my life. Horrifyingly grotesque creatures tugged at my limbs with their maws, sinking their teeth into my flesh. They ate me alive, screaming, over and over and over again, ripping and tearing at my flesh, gobbling my intestines. It was excruciating and terrifying. They said horrible things as their tongues licked the flesh clean from my bones. Finally, I broke through the dream, drenched in sweat, my eyes flashing open. What met me was far more terrifying than the nightmare. The demon sat on my chest, its large frame suffocating me as it weighed down. I wanted to scream, to struggle, but I was completely frozen. Its long claws dug into my skin, pinning me down, drawing blood from my soft skin. It was hard to see it in the dark of my room. It was a silhouette, tall and hunched over. The demon itself was impossibly dark, emanating shadows like a reverse sun. Its red eyes glowed in the darkness, filled with hatred and an unholy glee. Its touch burned my skin like a hot brand as it leered at me. Slowly, it started leaning down and unhinging its jaw. Hot drool dripped from its jowls. My heart sunk in my chest as an icy chill came over me. It had rows of sharp teeth unfolding out of its mouth like a flower. Its hot, disgusting breath wafted over me, choking me even more. Tears flowed town my cheeks as my eyes nearly bugged out of my head. I gritted and grinded my teeth, groaning, struggling against my inexplicable paralysis. My heartbeat drummed in my ears like a war cry, adrenaline shooting through my veins. A thought flashed into my mind. *Is this really how I am going to end?* After a lifetime of struggling with my strange ability, misery and fear parading in my heart as I stumbled with confusion throughout life, I was going to die at the hands of a demon? How was that fair? I never had any explanation for what I saw, no way to fight back against this dark force. Was I just a victim of circumstance, given a power I couldnt understand with no way to defend myself? I felt rage building in my chest. An impossible defiance exploded out of me. *I dont want to die! I will not die! I REFUSE TO DIE HERE!* The demon flinched as if it heard my thoughts. I gurgled at first, but gathered my strength and cried out with all my might. It narrowed its eyes and shrieked back at me, its voice piercing my ears and digging into my very soul. It lunged as if to rip my throat out, but I did not submit. I yelled back with equal force, unrelenting, my voice rising above its voice. It flinched again, slowly slinking back, retreating into a corner of my room. I sat up, shouting louder. It was a furious, primal, guttural yell, my eyes bugging out of my head as saliva flew from my lips. Desperation flowed through my blood. I bared my teeth, standing on my bed, and screamed at it with balled fists. I WILL NOT SUCCUMB TO YOU! I REFUSE! **I REFUSE**!! GAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! I shouted, raved, and cursed at it as it shrank, melting into the shadows until only the glaring red orbs pierced through the darkness. Its hatred hit me like a wave, but I did not falter, jumping down from the bed and screaming at it, my small frame trembling with purpose. I slowly approached the corner it was sinking into until those hateful eyes were almost gone. Before it vanished, it hissed, *This is only the beginning. You will be cursed your whole life with this dark vision, tormented until death. There is no escape for you. Fear, and suffer, you wretched little bitch.* It cackled as its eyes blinked away into nothingness. I panted heavily, descending into sobs. I fell to my knees, clutching myself. My mother burst into my room, shouting at me in confusion and annoyance. I looked up at her with eyes far too burdened for a child. She stopped, staring, unsure of herself. My fingernails dug into my arm as I gritted my teeth. There were handprints burned into my wrists and ankles, claw marks ripped into my skin. I think perhaps that was enough to spook even my mother, stubborn skeptic though she was. She purchased crosses and holy water, littering my room with them. I dont think she fully committed to it, but for my sake, she started taking us to church. I doubt it mattered. I learned that day that these demons feed on our vulnerability. Our will is stronger than we think, however. It is perhaps a demons greatest enemy, for once we believe we can defeat it, we truly can. At least, in my experience. This should have given me confidence, bolstered me in a just cause to fight them. Instead, I turned into myself, cowardice prevailing. I did not want to be cursed all my life, as the demon had claimed I would be. That night scarred me beyond reason. How could any nine-year-old really fully accept it? Maybe it was childish of me, but I wished desperately that I couldnt see them, these ghosts and specters that haunted my waking moments. It was unspoken, but I understood that I was sensitive to them, more capable of interacting with them, more susceptible to the darker forces. That must be what the demon meant. Denial was my only comfort, for the fear was too great. I stopped mentioning them to my family, I pretended they werent there, and I averted my gaze on those rare moments when I saw another tall, dark, impossibly evil creature. And, for the most part, I was undisturbed. My mother rejoiced. The hardest days seemed over. They were just echoes of lives long gone. Their fingers brushed my skin, but they could not force me to do anything. They were inconsequential and irrelevant to my day to day life. It became easier to ignore them with time. I gained friends and began enjoying life for what I could make of it. I refused any responsibility for them. I was just a victim of circumstance. I could not help them, and I could not stop them. They just simply were. They even faded a little as I continued to refuse to see them. I was convinced that if I kept up denying, one day I might be rid of them completely. I was diligent in my cause. I never wanted to see another ghost or demon ever again. I did not want that demonic prophecy of a life full of torment to be my reality. I believed that if I willed it away, it could not come to be. For a while, that was enough. I retreated into novels, using imagination and a world without ghosts to soothe my own fears. I became interested in writing, and I had a natural proclivity for creativity. It was easy to get lost in. To forget. I clung to it like a lifeline. The days gradually blurred, the past becoming a distant nightmare. I was content, so secure in the lie I told myself. I think I couldve lived most of my life like in denial if [that day hadnt come](URL "
196,vulnerability,nosleep,Seravleep,15,71evpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/71evpv/seravleep/,2017-09-21 08:45:16,"You know when you're comfortable in your bed, casually drifting off to a peaceful sleep, and you notice that one leg is out of the covers? Suddenly it becomes cold, and you feel unsafe. Fear of something waiting at the edge of your bed, waiting to snatch you by the ankle and drag you to an unknown fate fills your mind. Somehow you convince yourself that retracting it back under the covers protects you from whatever assailant was planning to seal your doom. Sometimes the most logical answer is the correct one. Occam's razor. The logistics regarding a creature that attacks only when your leg is out from the blankets is absurd. It's just some sort of self-imposed paranoia that your brain puts on itself due to the vulnerability of entering that REM cycle. There really isn't something there at that moment right? I've always hoped so, no I've always known so. Until last night that is. Whomever you may be, please heed my advice. First of all, never fall asleep with your window open, I know that those summer nights can be dreadfully stuffy, but the money you spend on a fan is incomparable to the value of your life or the lives of others. Secondly, if you do choose to have that window open be VERY careful as to not let your foot slide out of the blankets. If you do not trust yourself to keep your blankets on and really really want to have that window open, having a TV on might increase your chances of survival, but I haven't confirmed that. I know I'm probably getting ahead of myself, but I don't know exactly how far into this tale the average person will read, so I find it more important to tell the world how to protect themselves than why they should. My main objective is to make sure nobody has to go through what happened to me last night. By this point, I've probably confused you with my ramblings, so I suppose now would be as good a time as any to get into the meat of things. I was heading to bed a bit later than normal. I had gotten back from the gym not too long ago so I was pretty ready to crash. It had been pretty cold that week so I had turned on the heat in my apartment, but that night was much warmer than it had been the rest of the week, so instead of adjusting the thermostat I just opened the window before I went to sleep. I was far too exhausted to head down the hall to switch the heat off. My laziness told me that this was the best solution for the night. My large blanket was also currently in the washing machine so I had to settle for my small spare blanket in the closet. The minimal amount of fabric forced me to curl up in a strange position so that the maximum amount of my body could keep warm. Although no matter how I contorted some skin was going to be left out of the blanket's warmth. I settled on my left leg to get the shaft for the night. I did my best to ignore the discomfort of having one leg out of the blanket. It wasn't long before I could feel the cold outer air blow on my exposed leg. I guess it had begun to cool back down outside, but now I was far too comfortable to shut the window or cover my leg. Besides, the blanket I was using was so small that even if I did decide to warm up my leg, some other part of my body would be frigidly exposed. Eventually that paranoia I mentioned earlier set in. How you just know something is going to grab that leg no matter how ridiculous the notion could be. I just had to remind myself that there was nothing in my house that was going to grab it. No burglar, no monster, no demon, or ex-girlfriend was in my house. It took me a while to fall asleep, but I finally made it there after about 30 minutes of struggling. Normally I have a pretty bad memory when it comes to dreams, but I was able to recall this one clearly after waking up. It was one of those dreams where you go through an entire day of your life. You wake up, and groggily enter your shower, eat breakfast, and then go to school or work. My morning routine is a bit different than most people though. You see my parents live above me in my apartment complex. They're old, so they needed my help to stay living on their own, and were very adamant about staying away from retirement homes. My dad is able to pay the rent just fine with his pension, so I just check in with them every now and then, and occasionally run errands since they shouldn't be driving. I decided to stop in on them this morning, but when I entered, nobody was home. The lights were off, and there was also no drone of the television which is usually always on in their apartment. I spent a little while searching for them, but it was to no avail. The power was out, and all the windows were open too which was more than peculiar. Frankly, I was quite worried. I had a mind to call the police since they have no way of going anywhere without my help, and the whole situation was just too weird. I decided to just call my dad first, but before I could pull my phone out to dial there was a loud banging at the door. Actually, a bang wouldn't be the best way to describe it. It was more like somebody was slamming their fingernails onto the wood. I cautiously approached the door. I could sense that there wasn't something right about what was on the other side. I could even hear sharp scratchings at the wood now, almost like whatever was behind the door was desperate to get inside. I began to sweat from the anxiety and fear. It was probably nothing, but why was I getting so worked up about it? The knocking became louder now. Only proving that whatever was waiting for me wasn't going away. I was at the door now. I made sure it was locked before I gazed into the peephole. Just in case. These things always made me nervous. You always convince yourself you're going to see something that you really don't want to see on the other side. Like a man smiling, maniacally looking directly back at you, or another eye lined up perfectly with yours. I eventually worked myself up to take a look, and it wasn't what I saw that frightened me, but what I didn't see. There was nothing unusual at all. No creature, no man, no spirit, nothing was in front of the door. All I could see a man in dark clothes about 10 feet from the door, across the hall and to the right fiddling with his keys in front of another apartment. I could also see a young woman walking down the hall in the opposite direction with a bright red sweater. I continued to scan the area for irregularities. I glanced back and forth erratically until the woman had gone down the stairs, and it appeared the man found the key he was looking for. I sighed, relieved that there wasn't anything to worry about. I was about to take my pupil from the viewing screen when I saw something, odd. The man in dark clothes turned slowly to the door and almost looked directly at me through the looking glass. Or at least it felt like he was looking at me. He had a large hood on so I couldn't really see his face. He then slowly stretched his arm towards me. It just kept getting longer and longer until it reached the door. He didn't move from that single spot. My fear returned to me. I could see fingernails on his hand that were at least six inches long. He began scratching at the door once again. His arm that must have been twice the size of his body, was covered in black rags, and the skin of his hand was gray and boney. What did this thing want from me? Why wouldn't it leave me alone? Eventually, the fear overtook me and I woke up. I jolted up from the bed in a cold sweat. It's been a long time since I have had a nightmare that vivid. I lied back down and attempted to get comfy. I pulled my phone out from under my pillow and browsed Twitter for a bit in order to calm myself down. Eventually, I was able to put it to the back of my mind, and I attempted to fall back asleep. I was very uneasy though because I almost felt like I was being watched. I could swear that I would hear an occasional noise against the screen of my window, but whenever I would check there would be nothing there. I just told myself that the nightmare was causing my mind to be paranoid. The nervousness left me and the noises ceased. I was collective and ready to drift back into dreamland on this night that I sort of wished would just be over. Right then. Right when I was on the brink of precious REM I felt a slight little tickle on my exposed leg. Annoyed I quickly itched it with the toes of my other foot. After that ordeal was over I felt a cold breeze on my neck. Agitated now I rolled over, and shut the window before laying back down. After closing my eyes, a few thoughts came to me. Something... wasn't quite right. I racked my brain trying to figure out what it was. There was just something missing, but I couldn't put my finger on it. The tickle was back on my leg now, but so was the draft on my neck. That's when it hit me. The screen on my window was gone. Almost systematically as I had this revelation the tickle on my leg turned into a full grasp. I could feel sharp fingernails dig into my flesh, and I'm sure they were forceful enough to break the skin as I could feel warm moisture running down my leg. I sprung up terrified! I looked up to see that skinny man in dark clothes pressed against my ceiling! He had one arm on my leg with his other extended all the way across my room to the corner of the ceiling on the other side. His legs protruded from his body at a strange angle and they were pushed against the opposite wall to keep him balanced. His face was right above me, only inches away. His breath was warm and smelt like iron. His face was gray, boney, wrinkled and expressionless. He must have been able to tell I was going to scream because he swiftly removed the hand that was on my foot and shoved it onto my face, covering my mouth. ""Shhhhhh"" It spoke, although, it sort of told me in my mind. I didn't even see its lips move. I could hear its voice invade my thoughts. The words sounded like someone was blowing a loud fan while the syllables came from the scratchings of a washboard. ""Go back to sleep, or you die..... I'll be watching."" It's echoing banter tore at my mind. How was I supposed to go back to sleep knowing this thing was right here? Unfortunately, I had no other option. I just shut my eyes tightly and tried to do, whatever this thing was, asking me to do. Sleep is one of the easiest things the body can do, but when you're forced to do it, it's like you completely forget how. I lied there for hours. All I could do is wait for my mind to get used to the breath on my neck and the occasional caress of my leg. Even if I pulled it under the blanket, it would slowly remove the blanket and continue the gentle massage. I would have begun to cry, but I was afraid of what it would do if I made any sort of noise. Under some sort of miracle, my mind was able to find peace. I didn't even realize I was asleep until I began to dream again. I was in an orange landscape with a blank sky. That... thing was right in front of me. It must have only been a few seconds I stood there in silence, but it felt like an eternity before it spoke. ""My name is Seravleep, and I have some jobs for you."" At that word a floating piece of parchment manifested itself in front of me. There were three numbers on it, but only an instruction in front of number one. It said, 'hug somebody.' ""You are in a game with two others who let me in. The winner gets a prize. The others get a penalty. Complete your tasks first and you win. Until then, I'll be waiting."" With that final word in his raspy, wretched voice he faded into nothingness as the landscape shifted into that of a beach. Before I knew it I was on a beach, surrounded by my closest friends. They were all drinking and having a good time. I must say it was a relief to see familiar faces in such a treacherous scenario. It's a hard idea to wrap your mind around, but in a dream, you forget important details almost instantly and it's more than difficult to stay on task. What I'm trying to say is that I immediately got caught up in the beach party. I forgot about Seravleep, I forgot about my job. Eventually, at the party, in which I had completely immersed myself, A girl in which I had a thing with a few years ago, and even to this day would often flirt with via text, arrived to join us. Things didn't work out between us back then, but I still had it really bad for her. We made eye contact and smiled. I went to embrace her as a greeting. I found it appropriate considering the past we had. I held her for a couple seconds then I let her go while laughing. I expected to retract and thank her for coming to the party, but instead of seeing her beautiful face it was replaced with a near replica of hers, there were... a few differences. Her face was incredibly pale. Her eyes completely hollow, as if somebody scooped them out with a spoon. Her mouth was agape, almost like she was silently screaming. Beetles, flys, sliders, and centipedes crawled out of her mouth by the hundreds until they completely surrounded her. I watched as they took tiny, minuscule nibbles from her skin. It didn't take long before she was reduced to a pile of bloody bones. The memories of what I was supposed to do began to flood back to me as I saw the note that Seravleep handed me in her remains. My first task was to hug somebody, and I had completed it. Number one had turned into a scribbled mess and now, next to number two I saw words that weren't there prior. 'Betray someone.' The scene shifted, I was no longer on the beach, but in my childhood home. My parents old home. I was in the basement with my father. He was much younger in the dream than he was currently. I assumed we had shifted back in time a good number of years for this portion of the dream. My dad and I were bullshitting back and forth about this great day we had together, and our plans on how we were going to spend the rest of it. Once again I had completely forgotten about my task at hand when I arrived on the scene. It's hard to keep track of things when you're dreaming. Currently, we were playing cards and laughing, with plans on watching a comedy we liked and ordering pizza after our game was finished. I was excited because me and my father never really got along all that well. It was very rare that we actually had some fun together. Minutes after I agreed and exclaimed my looking forward to the plans we had set in stone, I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket. I reached down and removed it to check who it was. I typically don't receive that many messages so it was always welcoming to see somebody willing to talk to me. To my surprise, it was the girl from the beach, whom at this point in my life, I had been trying to subdue romantically. She said explicitly what she wanted from me, and that nobody was home at her place. She was all alone. There were even a couple of pictures that followed the messages, which were a bit risque, to say the least. Inner confliction tormented me. On one hand, I made promises to my father whom I sense was getting the feeling I was trying to avoid him prior to this bonding day we had together. I haven't been the best son lately, but I think we were both to blame for the distance between us. Unfortunately, today of all days, when I thought we had finally put that business behind us, this fine specimen of a young woman requests my ravishing of her immediately. I'm a late bloomer so my body was still completing the later chapters of a book called puberty. Many of those chapters included an increased libido. I was always going to have a dad, but I was never going to have a golden opportunity like this again. I managed to pull some half-assed excuse out of my hat about why I had to go. He was... heartbroken. He didn't want to show it, but he could sense that I was completely ditching him for somebody else. I began to head for the door so I wouldn't have to deal with the awkwardness of my sad dad. As I began to turn the handle, I heard him begin to choke. I refocused my attention to him to see blood in his eyes and stress upon his cheeks. ""Dad!"" I screamed. Completely shocked at the display. I could notice a thin circle of red begin to form around his neck. It widened and slowly began to drip downwards. Like clockwork, as the first drop of blood hit the floor so did his knees. His head then popped right off of his neck and rolled perfectly to where my feet were planted to the ground. I had to look my dead father in the eyes before his head crumbled to ash. That's when I saw it again. Seravleep's note and it becomes apparent to me that I had indeed betrayed my father. The only difference between this task and the one at the beach was that this one actually happened. Besides the head-splitting that is. The beach party was a complete fantasy, but this scene of me and my father in the basement happened a few years ago, and it went almost exactly the same in my dream as it did in real life. I never realized just how much I betrayed him that night. For a girl that didn't even last to boot. Anyways, I knew the drill at this point. I had completed two tasks, and now there was just one more before I got to go home. Well, I suppose technically I was already at home in bed, but you know what I mean. I retrieved the note from the ashy remains of my father's head. One and two were crossed off and now number three read, 'kill somebody.' I was completely drawn aback by this. My eyes grew wide and my heart rate increased. I-I knew I was in a dream and my actions couldn't REALLY affect anybody, but still. Kill somebody? I suppose if I could go for a drive in the city I could find some homeless person who I would feel very little remorse for, but I still questioned if I was able to do so. I waited and waited for the setting to change, but it never did. Previously I had forgotten about my task and performed it almost subconsciously, but I really doubt I would be able to kill somebody without direct intent. As I waited longer and longer I began to realize that not only would the setting not change but this time, I would not forget that if I wanted to wake up I needed to kill somebody. I made a plan in my head to go out the door in front of me, up the stairs, and outside, where I would walk to my old neighborhood bully's house and kill that son of a bitch once and for all. It would help get me out of this situation and aid me in some malcontent I still held towards him. I opened the door and closed it behind me, expecting to see the stairs, but instead, I was in my parent's bedroom. Things were a bit different than I remember though. The doors to their closet and bathroom were missing. As were the windows outside. I even turned behind me and saw the door I entered in had disappeared. All there was in this familiar room was my mother asleep in her bed, and a knife on the pillow next to her where my father would normally sleep. No. No no no. This had gone too far. I completed the last two of Seravleep's tasks without even realizing it, but now, he was going to force me to outright kill my own mother? I-I could not do it. Whatever the penalty was for failing this game I would just have to take it. Then, suddenly in my head, I could hear Seravleep's voice speak. ""All three contestants have reached the final task, so the possible penalties will be announced for those who lose. Either your entire bank account will be wiped the moment you wake up, you will lose your most precious memories, or, you will die. Perhaps you will get lucky and receive the penalty least threatening to you, or perhaps you won't. Either way, you all better hurry. I doubt the other two will be as patient as you are."" Bankruptcy, amnesia, or death? Those are my options? Screw it, no matter how messed up it is to kill my own mother, it is only a dream after all. It will all be over when I wake up, and I don't care what happens to the other two. Hopefully, they would get lucky and escape this with their lives. I, on the other hand, refused to give my life up to luck. I approached the bed and gazed at my mom sleeping ever so peacefully on the king sized bed, without dad. My mom and I got along great while I lived at home actually. I can't remember once when I ever got in a fight with her, or even tried to avoid her for any reason. I can't believe I was going to kill this lovely woman. Whatever, it's not real, I just have to keep reminding myself that. I gripped the knife in my right hand and anxiously raised it over her. I could see my menacing shadow stretch across the entire room. Just before I was about to slam it into her back she rolled over and woke up. She shot me a beautiful smile and exclaimed ""Good morning son! It's lovely to see you."" I couldn't listen to her. I had to think about all the bad times we've had together, which were few and far between. I just couldn't be reminded of how sweet a woman my mother was before I killed her with my own hands. I lost control of myself and slammed the knife into her chest. I expected it to be over, but she just smiled lovingly into my eyes and muttered, ""ouchie."" I had to keep striking. I retracted and plunged again and again until I was exhausted and out of breath. Splattered in blood, staring at my now dead mother's mutilated corpse, ashamed of the evil I have committed. I awaited Seravleep's command. I paced back and forth in that room for at least ten minutes, tensely awaiting the word of my keeper. Did I win? Did I lose? Am I going to be stuck dreaming forever? These were the thoughts racing through my head during that time. Eventually, I heard him speak to me. ""Congratulations, you won!"" I awoke instantly. I jumped up from my bed, cowering in my sheets expecting to see him right in front of me. Except he wasn't. Instead, he was in the darkest corner of my bedroom, standing there motionlessly with his mutant arms behind his back. ""As the victor, you receive a reward!"" He removed his left hand from behind him which held a stack of hundred dollar bills. He tossed it in front of me on the bed where they spread out before me. There had to be at least ten thousand dollars worth of cash in the pile. I was thrilled! My mind went forwards and backwards planning on what I could do with all of it. ""The losers, however... Received their penalty. The same penalty actually. Death."" That's when he showed me. He inched his right arm from behind him into the light to reveal two severed heads. They belonged to, my mother and father. I-I didn't know what to say or what to do. He clipped their heads to his belt and began climbing over me. Once he reached the window he whispered into my ear saying, ""If you ever want to see me again, just leave your foot uncovered."" That's when he opened the window and left into the night. Naturally, I called the police immediately after he left. I didn't know what to tell them though. I've watched enough television to know that they wouldn't believe my story. I wasn't shocked to hear from them that I was the prime suspect in my parent's murder either. I guess they had massive life insurance policies that I wasn't aware of. It's likely that I'll be imprisoned for the rest of my life. That's why I'm writing this. I want the world to remember me. I'm practically going to fade into existence once I step foot in the penitentiary, so here I am sitting in bed, writing my thoughts out before that time comes. I want you to know my story and above all protect yourself so you don't end up like me. You know, I'm feeling pretty hypocritical right now. One of my intents in creating this piece was to warn you of Seravleep, but I still haven't bothered to take my larger blanket out of the dryer. I've been trying my best to ignore the draft on my neck, and I don't think I closed the window in the bathroom. I've been noticing faint movement behind me in the reflection of my computer screen for a while now. I just hope I can publish this in time. "

You can be there for years and still not know a damn thing. Where does it exist? How does it exist? Why does it exist? The only thing I know is what happens there. Imagine your worst nightmare. Not just a regular nightmare. The one that made you wake up screaming for your life. Never had one? Dont worry, theyll find one for you. Imagine if that little terror repeated itself over and over. Doomed to do the exact same things, forever. The worst part would be in between the repetitions, giving just enough lucidity to realize exactly whats happening, and just how screwed you are. Congrats! You have a general understanding of Hell! Mine, at least. But wait, if I know what its like how am I typing in the living world? Well, I dont really know either. Another day, another repeat. I was being burnt alive with my limbs slowly being pulled apart. You know, the usual. In an instant, I felt everything screech to a stop. The flames halted their fierce fluttering, heat replaced by a cold draft. The room melted into a mess of colors. Hideous screeching slammed my ears. To my left one of the walls was now a dark, huge pathway. Well, didnt have to tell me twice to run like hell. Fun fact! Did you know a damned spirit can run for hours on end down an endless hallway, even when they hear demonic voices beckoning them back? They also see hundreds of black rooms around them, all with cursed screaming seeping from them. If they could have cried, they wouldve. My run ended when I slammed into a gate. Frantically unlocking it I looked back. Just for a second I saw I dont think we have words in the English language to describe it. Lets just say it was very, very fast and very, very pissed. Luckily, I was faster to close the gate on the other side and keep running. I felt different. The cave was cold and wet, a pleasure for an eternity of heat. I scrambled down it to find an elevator and slammed the only button for the surface. Seeing the brilliant sunrise after all that darkness is the most awe-inspiring thing any human can witness. Unfortunately, I wasnt absolutely human. An escape from the underworld doesnt grant you a physical body. I could already begin to feel myself being dragged back down. Fear paralyzed me. Its one thing to not know what waits you on the other side, but something else to know exactly what does. Another fun fact! Did you know that a soul cannot physically take over a body unless the original inhabitant wills it? I found this out by complete surprise. Romane Katrin. Fairly normal, minus for her extreme obsession in the occult. I could feel myself called to her, I wasnt sure why. One night she started lightning candles, and made a pentagram on the floor. I was ready to laugh but I felt this strange sensation. I could feel a vulnerability. A gap in her soul I could go through. I waited with curious eyes. She continued her batshit crazy ritual. Drinking blood, weird dancing, but what I homed in most was when she lied down, and sprayed herself out. She yelled for it. The vulnerability was fully open. This is what her ritual was for. I scrammed into her like an animal, and fought for control. It took precisely 3 hours and 31 minutes to kill her. It took another 2 hours to completely control her body. It was a long struggle, but fun. Ive never killed someone by the inside before. I have pondered what the purpose of my escape was. Im thinking it was for me to continue my work. It was unfair how quick in ended anyway. I was so close to creating a masterpiece. Well, I hoped you enjoy my little tale. Thanks for reading. Now if you excuse, Im going to look for some crucial supplies. Theres so much work to be done. "
198,vulnerability,nosleep,Watch Your Head,5,6ugg5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6ugg5s/watch_your_head/,2017-08-18 18:07:53,"Eleanors hand was hot and sweaty in my hand, and as I walked at her pace along the deserted country lane my mind kept returning to what horrors might be lurking in the tiny unclean palm of an excited six year old. A six-year-old who had spent the last three hours at a Halloween party with other sweet-gobbling, sugar-wired six-year-olds. my daughter chatted and sang happily to my left, practically dancing by my side in her adorable pink (now with unexplained splodges) fairy costume. Her voice sounded far too loud to my city-boy ears. After living my entire life in the bustling, endlessly noisy suburbs of London, the subdued quiet of Oak Hill, our new home, was almost painful. Eleanors childish chatter seemed to surround us, like a little beacon of sound lighting up the silent darkness. I imagined a thousand unseen creatures watching with breathless anticipation, drawn to my daughters singing. Her vulnerability. Her innocence. I shuddered and tried to concentrate instead on what she was saying. In reality of course the night wasnt all that dark nor particularly silent. The sun wasnt long set and the moon was bright in the clear sky. It was only the overhanging trees on either side of the lane that made it seem so dark, and I could hear the distant rumble of the main road only a mile or so away. I knew I tended to exaggerate negative thoughts, my oh-so-well informed wife had explained as much to me shortly after hed lost the argument about moving down here. It was the self-help child-raising books she read all day long, I was sure of it. Her determination to be a brilliant mother had almost taken over her life, and I was considering misplacing the books amongst the many as-yet unpacked boxes. It would be worthwhile if only to spare me another amateur psychology assessment. Eleanor had stopped moving, her hand suddenly tighter in his. Her singing had stopped. I looked down at her, trying hard to recall what shed been saying. She could be petulant at times, especially when she thought people werent paying attention to her incessant rambling narrative. She wasnt even looking at me. Her eyes, brown like her mothers, were wide and staring. I turned and looked in the same direction, not liking the fearful expression on her face. There was no movement in the thick shadows of the trees, but even so I felt anger rise up within me on a tide of adrenaline, the thought that someone was out there trying to frighten my little girl blocking out rational thought. What is it honey? I said gruffly, my eyes on the dark treeline. Hes watching us, she whispered back, squeezing my hand tighter and moving close to me. I could feel her body-heat against my leg and my heart beat increased, as though her proximity had heightened my protective instincts. Then I saw it. Through a gap in the trees I could see a figure. The field beyond stretched away up a short hill, the crest clearly visible against the moonlit sky. And perched atop the hill, standing thin and skeletal in the ghostly pale light, was a scarecrow looking very much worse for wear. My daughter was right; it seemed to be watching us. It looked like it was made of old sticks held loosely together with rope, bits of ragged cloth flapping lazily in the light breeze. At some point long, long ago perhaps it had been a genuine scarecrow, but it seemed to have lost its dignity around the time it lost its purpose. I had to admit it was a creepy sight, sprawled like an impaled corpse half-upright and forgotten, one gnarled wooden twig-hand upturned to the uncaring night like a beseeching claw. But its head, no more than a rounded blob in silhouette, seemed to stare at us from its peculiar, bent-over angle. He cant see us honey, I said softly, watching the motionless figure as it in turn watched them. He can. No, sweetie. Hes just a bundle of sticks. But its Halloween, Daddy, she said in her most condescending voice, all the monsters come out tonight. Cursing the combination of Hollywood and Disney that I held responsible for this particular notion, I tried not to sigh. Instead I nodded sagely and tried to look thoughtful. Well, even if the monsters come out tonight, they cant hurt us because were good people. And he, I turned and pointed at the scarecrow, was made of sticks by a farmer to keep birds off my field. He isnt a monster. He looks like a monster. Again I nodded and agreed, because she was right. The damn thing did look like a monster, even to me. Goodness only knew what it would look like to a six year old. On Halloween, no less. Shall we go home sweetie? We can have some of your treats before bed and  No. Her tone was so sharp, so sure of itself that I almost started in amazement. I studied her face, but she wasnt showing signs of having a tantrum or getting into that blazing hysteria I was sure bubbled permanently under the surface of all small children; she only looked determined. No? I asked softly, peering at her closely. We cant go home while hes watching. And there it was. Perfect logic resulting from the combination of self-preservation and a belief in magic and monsters. Parenthood was trickier than Id been led to believe. Destroy the magic, and you ruin innocence (and Christmas). Try to get around the logic without destroying the magic, and you sound completely irrational. What kind of maniac turned his back on a dangerous creature? The tendrils of an idea floated past my mind and I grabbed at them. Well then, lets go and stop him watching shall we? Hes just a scarecrow honey, he wont mind us turning his head the other way. Bizarrely, this suggestion elicited a smile and a nod. My daughter, it seemed, was no coward. Even my skin crawled slightly at the thought of approaching the hunched, skeletal figure on the hill and yet Eleanor seemed up for it. I sighed. Id made my horrible, creepy bed; time to lie in it and not think of coffins. I turned towards the shadows and made my way towards the treeline. Thankfully there were no bushes or thick foliage, only a small ditch separated the pathway from the trees and Eleanor giggled as I lifted her over. Shaking my head with a bemused smile, I followed her as she ran over the moonlit grass towards the leering scarecrow. I supposed that, as Halloween adventures went, this one was up there with the best. Up close, the thing looked far less threatening. It stood hunched over, forlorn and crippled, its arms stuck out at peculiar angles, the bonds of the ropes joining them loose and frayed. The head, what was left of it, was some kind of rotting vegetable stuck on a neck-stick tied to the back-stick. Its weight was such that it bent the whole structure over, giving it that hunched look of a man sleeping whilst shackled. It took me a few moments of staring at the head-shape, trying to make it out in the moonlight, before I realised that of course it was a long-dead pumpkin. The mottled spots of some kind of hideous mould crept across its shrunken surface, and it had sunk in on itself to such an extent that much of it had simply fallen apart. The ground by the things central post was covered in smaller chunks, mostly rotted to nothing, which must have sloughed away from the scarecrows decaying head, leaving glistening wet holes in the remainder. Eleanor did not seem fazed by the revolting sight, or the faint sickly-sweet smell of decay wafting from the figure. She had found a stick from somewhere, and was prodding the thing in morbid fascination. With each prod, the pale skin of the pumpkin bent and split a little more, its rank innards dripping disgustingly onto the grass. Stop that honey, youll make it  With a ghastly sucking noise the pumpkin split in half, each section flopping wetly apart and falling heavily to the ground. Eleanor let out a little shriek and dropped her stick as she danced out of range of the flying chunks exploding out of the scarecrows diseased head. I couldnt suppress a laugh. Well now he wont be able to see us anymore, right sweetie? The little girl looked up at me, wavering somewhere between smiling and crying. I seized the initiative and gave her a huge smile. Lets go home shall we? Eleanor, apparently deciding that going home was preferable to having a melt-down in the middle of the field, nodded and started walking back towards the path. I followed, giving the headless stick-man one final glance. I paused. Looked back at it. Free of the weight of the rotting pumpkin, the stick that had once pierced it  the neck  had risen upward. The arms tied to the central pole had lowered, the counterweight holding them up having been removed. I knew this, and yet couldnt help the thought flashing across my mind. It looks somehowindignant. Alert. As though standing straighter in disbelief that anyone could have the temerity to remove its head. Eleanor wait for Daddy, I called, jogging a few paces to catch up with her. Shed almost made it through the tree line to the path home, but she paused by the ditch and let me catch her. As I set her down, after another lift over the muddy water, she looked back at the scarecrow. Did he fall down Daddy? I glanced around, reaching out for her hand. It looked as though the pile of sticks had indeed fallen over. I could no longer see it silhouetted against the sky. I think so honey. We moved its head and it must have loosened the ropes. Eleanors hand squeezed suddenly in mine, her body rigid as she stared past me at something behind us on the path. I heard a clicking sound, like the snapping of twigs underfoot in a forest. The sound of straining ropes creaking. I whirled around, catching only a glimpse of a dark, hunched figure as it reached out  impossibly fast  before something heavy cracked into the side of my head and black stars exploded across my vision. From somewhere far away I could hear Eleanor running, her steps soft and rapid. She was screaming for her father. I was on the ground, my vision slowly clearing as sense returned. Metres away, the headless scarecrow staggered and lurched into the darkness after Eleanor, rocking on its uncertain legs and uttering a hideous moaning sound. I lost sight of it as I pushed to my feet, my ears ringing and my limbs numb and unresponsive. I forced them to cooperate as I half-tripped and stumbled forwards, shouting my daughters name in a strangled cry. Up ahead, Eleanors screams rose to a fevered pitch, blending with a ghastly, guttural laugh that filled me with terror. Eleanor fell silent, and I screamed in primal fear at what that might signify. I pushed on into the thickening darkness, my unwilling legs finally regaining their strength as my foot landed on something soft. I stopped, frantically searching the ground with wide, frenzied eyes. There! It was a shoe. A soft, satiny shoe from a fairy costume. A thousand thoughts and denials rose up within me as my fractured mind tried to think. A distant cry reached me from back the way Id come, a horrible wet scream. I spun and ran back to the gap in the trees where wed first seen the hanging figure, and reaching the spot fell to my knees and wailed in soul-rending horror. On the hill, against the moonlit sky, the scarecrow had a new [head.](URL "
199,vulnerability,nosleep,The Wires,14,6y5p47,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6y5p47/the_wires/,2017-09-05 14:30:42,"When I was twenty four, my older brother died. At the time, I was working as a customer support guy at a major internet service provider on the Canadian West Coast. That was my stand-by thing while I tried to figure out what I wanted to *really* do in my life. At that time, I had no idea what would enter into my life, both through my brothers death, or the wires. I had gotten home that night, made dinner, and was relaxing with some of Netflixs crime documentaries when I got the knock on the door. It was two police officers, with the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police, our national police service). One of the officers was an older black woman with frizzy hair that was tied back, and the other was an Asian man that looked to be about early twenties and with a shaved head. My brow furrowing with confusion, I listened as the older, female officer asked if I was Robert Fellows, brother of John Fellows, and I nodded that yes, I was. Officer, what is this about? Has something happened to John? I asked. I was getting worried, and it clearly bled into my voice because I saw the reaction in the officers face. It looked pained, like she had something to say but didnt know *how* to say it. I glanced at her partner - same deal with him. In the few brief moments before she spoke again, I felt my heart drop within me. Something had happened, and whatever it was, it was bad. Mister Fellows, I think we should sit down. Can we come in? I nodded silently and numbly walked them into the living room, and sat down on the couch while they pulled up some chairs, and sat in front of me. It had happened about three hours ago. John was heading home from the office where he worked as a Human Resources manager. The way they described it, I could picture it so vividly in my mind, because it was part of his usual routine. John would be driving home in his Mazda, humming along with the showtunes mp3s playing from his phone on the dashboard. Then once he got home, hed quickly change into his casual clothes and head out to see a movie. That was something he loved doing, both by himself and with me - he was a massive film buff, just like me. Except it didnt play out that way this time. As he was nearly at the bridge leading from Downtown to the rest of the city, a drunk driver came out of nowhere and slammed into the driver-side part of Johns car at over a hundred and fifty kilometers an hour. John died on impact. As the police described what had happened, I found myself tuning out. I found myself not caring, not really, that they had the driver in custody and were charging him for what hed done and that hed likely spend decades in prison, or any of that stuff. My brother was dead. That was what mattered. That was what the reality was. I finally, after what seemed like an eternity, looked up at the police officers. I could tell what my face was like based on what I saw in theirs. They looked like they were hurting by how they saw me hurting. After a moment of silence, the younger officer spoke. There are services available for victims of crime. You can get in touch with those services by calling this number, he said, handing me a crisp-looking business card. I nodded and absent-mindedly dropped it on the couch next to me. The older officer said they would keep in touch with me about the progress of the drivers court case, and I distantly heard myself tell them that Id appreciate that. And just like that, their visit was over. I showed them out, and closed and locked the door behind them. Then I cried. I broke down crying so hard, the tears flooding down my face and my heart feeling like it wanted to shrivel up and die inside of my chest. I grasped my distorted face with my hands and let my back slam against my apartment wall. I slid down until I was slumped down on the floor. I stayed that way for the rest of the night, eventually sobbing myself into a deep sleep. In hindsight, I wish Id have been able to get a hold of myself to notice what was happening in my house. The wires in my kitchen and living room moving of their own accord. Stretching, tightening, loosening, dragging themselves toward me. I wish I had noticed that, but I didnt. John was gone. My best friend, the only one Id had left after our parents had died when I was sixteen and he was twenty five. We didnt have any other family. John and I, well, for my entire life I never thought that any other pair of brothers could have been closer. Id looked up to him all my life, and hed looked after me my whole life. He always walked me home after school when I was young, always interested in how my day was. After I got old enough, hed always let me tag along with him and his friends. He *always* had time for me and what was going on with me, and would support me in everything I felt I had to do. And when Mom and Dad died, he took care of me, moving us into an apartment and working ungodly hours every week just to provide. He was my brother, he loved me, and he was there. What more could anyone ever ask for? Even now, especially after everything thats happened, even now, I still remember one thing he said to me when I was a teenager. It was just after wed finished seeing our parents buried, and we were walking through the cemetery back to the car. He wrapped his arm around my shoulder and looked me in the eye, and said Robbie, you know Ill always look after you, right? I nodded, kind of understanding in a superficial way what he meant. It was true, though. He always did, no matter what. Its what happened after John died, though, that changed everything. It was the wires, you see. The wires, so long and black and thick and thin, writhing around like a horde of snakes. Alive, and hungry. Always hungry. For the next month, I tried to live with my grief. It was hard, though. It was so, so hard. Most days I just went through the motions in this dull, numbed daze. It was like I was disconnected from myself, on the outside looking in. I didnt feel much aside from that dull, thick, hard ache in the core of my chest. As for my concerns? Nothing mattered. Nothing was important. I didnt give a shit about movies, or trying my hand at screenwriting someday, or any of that. I didnt care about planning out my future, figuring out where I wanted to be in ten years. Those things had occupied my mind so much until Johns death. Now, they didnt. I didnt cry much after the first few days, but that was because all my tears had been spent. The damage that the tears illustrated was still there, and it was still moving. That was how it went. The hours and days and then weeks eventually bled together into this vast, endless and indiscernible soup, and I lived my life accordingly. I was pulled into my bosss office at work about a month after Johns death. Look, son, he said, his middle-aged eyes full to the brim with barely hidden disappointment, I understand whats happened to you has been hard. But you need to pick yourself up. I sat there slumped in the chair, staring at him. I was wearing clothes that were unwashed and that had been slept in for the past five days. I was unshaved, with rough and dirty-looking stubble all over my face. I hadnt showered for two days. I listened to him tell me that if I needed to, I could take time off. That wasnt the only thing, though - he stressed that with me falling behind on my work in some areas and outright not meeting expectations in others, if things didnt change, it was either take the time off or get fired. I wanted to tell him what I really felt - that I didnt really give a shit if he fired me or not. I didnt, though. I mumbled that Id take the time off, and an hour later I was back home for the first day of two weeks off. That night was when it all really started. I went to bed the moment I got home. I was asleep less than fifteen minutes later. When I woke up, I was in pitch darkness, and tightly - *tightly* - bound with what could only have been electrical cords. When I say electrical cords, I mean stuff like computer power cables, HDMI cables, headphone wires, that kind of thing. *Wires*. I blinked and tried to get my bearings. This was real, I soon figured out. I wasnt asleep. Somehow, I knew it wasnt a dream. It couldnt be. I tried to move, but I couldnt, because I was too tightly tied and constricted. My heart started to race as fear seeped into me, and then as that fear turned to terror. The wires, slick and smooth, roamed across my flesh, making it crawl. They tightened and loosened in perfect rhythm, as if they were breathing. I felt my heart start to race and my breathing get more heavy, more frantic until I wanted to do anything to get away, until I wanted to just scream at these *things* to *get away*. It seemed, though, that they could somehow sense what I was thinking because the speed of their travel across my skin and their tightness both immediately increased. As the pressure grew and grew, I finally screamed. In pure terror, I screamed, desperately hoping and wishing that somehow it would make a difference. Then I woke up. I shot up in bed, sweat drenching my body. I glanced around my room, my eyes shot wide open. After a few moments, I realized - it was nothing, I was fine. It *was* just a dream. Dropping back onto my bed, I took in a deep breath and then exhaled just as deeply. Great, now I was having nightmares. Just fucking great. I rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, grumbling angrily as I did so. But I didnt get to sleep again that night. I couldnt. I didnt fully realize it until morning, but my subconscious must have. What I didnt realize was that the marks in my body that I noticed and felt with my fingertips as I lay awake in bed were grooves. The exact kind of grooves thatd be there if you were tightly bound with cord. So I lay there. I laid there, and I thought of John. The next day, I walked. I needed to get my mind off of John, off of the nightmare Id had and the horrifying mystery of the grooves in my skin, so I went downtown and I just walked. I found myself strolling down through a run-down part of town, mainly abandoned. The grassy area was full of untended weeds, and sticking like a sore thumb out of the mass of weeds were abandoned, burned out buildings. Catching sight of a particular one - a tall, block-shaped one whose face was marked equally by graffiti and burn marks - I felt intrigued. Something about it, dunno how else to describe it. As I was watching it, I noticed this stray cat - cute little thing, pure black - trotting on over to the building. I cracked a grin watching it. As I noticed it slip into the building, I decided that it might be fun to follow it - see where its heading, that sort of thing. So, me being the person I was, I started to jog on over to the building. Ten minutes later, I was stomping through an upper-floor corridor. It turns out the building was a burnt out hotel, an old one too, probably from the fifties. The air smelt of smoke and age, and the walls were dilapidated and broken apart. I had to be careful to watch my step, lest I fall through the ground to a quick and untimely death. As I walked, I started to wonder what the hell I was even doing here. This was stupid, and dangerous. What if I fell, or got hurt some other way? I was in the middle of nowhere, and no one knew where I was. This was *fucking ridiculous*. Well, that was that. I was on the verge of leaving to go home, but then I heard it. I heard the music. It sounded like a faint, but beautiful song, consisting largely of buzzing. Recalling that music now I cant help but shudder and want to lock myself in my closet, but somehow, it sounded so utterly beautiful at that moment. I found myself walking, then jogging, then running toward that music. Up a flight of stairs, through two apartments with broken walls to another corridor, then down another hallway. Turning down a hallway, then into an apartment, to this day still not quite sure what I was expecting. I certainly wasnt expecting what I actually ended up seeing. What I saw was something from another world - it had to be. It was a writhing, endless mass of wires. All black, all connected and all entangled, entangled so much that an army could never hope to untangle them all even if they had a hundred years. The wires pulsated as they loosened and tightened. They even got thicker and thinner, like snakes do when they breathe. I stood there, frozen as the perfect memory of my nightmare floated into my conscious awareness, and as my mind took that into account and tried to somehow make sense of what I was seeing. As I stared at them, it clicked what they all reminded me of: a horde of snakes. A giant mass of black, electric snakes. Staring at those things, I felt dread creep into my heart. This was *wrong* - against nature, even. This shouldnt exist. As that realization seeped into my mind, panic rose within me. My heart began to race again and I felt sweat begin to drip down my forehead, as a mad, desperate, overwhelming desire to just *run* began to consume me. Finally, I acted on that desire. I swung around and took off at a run toward the door. Except it was no longer there. Where it was was a wall of wires, moving and breathing, as it were, with their loosening and tightening and thickening and thinning. It finally clicked - this wasnt the apartment building. It was somewhere else. Somewhere different. I felt trapped, constrained, separated from everything and everyone I knew. I felt rise within me a desperate panic - what was I going to do!? How could I survive this? After a few brief moments, I couldnt help it anymore. I screamed in a mad panic. At that moment, I think I got its attention, because immediately they shot out and wrapped themselves around me, drawing me into the mass. Panic overwhelmed me and I began to fight and thrash about mindlessly, my heart slamming into my chest over, and over, and over again. I felt tears run down my face, and sweat stream down my forehead as the living wires coiled around me and sucked me in deeper and deeper into their mass. Their grip on my body grew tighter and tighter every moment, even to the point where I knew if they got any tighter my bones would snap. That wasnt the most horrible part, though. They were *alive*, almost as if they were this massive set of snake-like animals. The wires felt smooth and slick as they traversed across my skin, and as they tightened around my arms and legs and face and throat. I tried to control my breathing, but I couldnt - I was panicking so much I was hyperventilating. As I thrashed and fought, I heard myself sobbing vigorously. I felt so helpless, and I did feel like I was going to die there. Then God, then I heard it. It came into my ears as I felt that presence from my nightmare approach. It was whispering, of a voice that couldnt be human and in a language that no human mouth or tongue could ever hope to pronounce even a word of. But it was there, in my ear, speaking to me. What it said to me, to this day, makes my blood run cold. What it said to me - whispering closely, so closely, as if it were a lover whose mouth was mere millimeters away from my ear - was, You can come to be with us, and there you can join our mass. I screamed wildly, completely out of control as raw terror overtook me. All I could think before I blacked out was, John, I love you. You can imagine that it was the surprise of my life when I woke up in my bed. It was evening, and for some reason I was thinking of John. Somehow, he was stuck in my mind, the way hed be when wed parted ways after an evening of socializing with each other. It was odd, but I didnt concern myself with it because I had more pressing issues, obviously. I glanced around frantically, wondering what the fuck was going on. It couldnt have been another nightmare, because I was still dressed in the clothes I wore out that day. I jumped out of bed and moved over to the window, pulling the blinds open. It was dark out, the night lit up by the city lights and the moon in the sky. Okay, it was night. Great. I wasnt going to stick around to admire it all, though. Something was happening. Something horrible. I didnt know *what* it was, but I knew I had to get out. I decided Id leave the city, move up north into the woods, then figure out what to do next. The woods, where thered be no fucking cords or wires. An hour later, I was packing my bags, and I was finally ready to leave. I packed in the bathroom, because I didnt want any of the wires in my apartment to see me get ready. I know, that sounds batshit crazy, but can you blame me after what Id been through? Like I said, I had no idea what was going on. My heart was pounding furiously, powered by raw fear and anxiety, as I tried to plan out how Id survive all of this. Why was this happening to me? What was this living mass? All sorts of questions, running through my head. In the end, I silenced all of the questions and got back to packing, hoping that since I was in the bathroom, Id be able to just slip out. It was no good, though. I was so focused on packing, so focused on getting out, that I wasnt thinking coherently. If I had Id have known to have thoroughly checked my bathroom, and if Id done that, Id have noticed a thin charger cord for my electric razor peeking out of the bottom bathroom cupboard. The wires got to me just as I was walking to my apartment door with my backpack slung around a shoulder. First it was my phone cord that shot out and wrapped itself around my ankle. Then my computer cords - somehow made way, way longer - and my phone cords, and my TV cords, shot out of their respective rooms to entangle themselves around my arms and body. I immediately began to fight wildly in a terrified frenzy, hoping against hope that I could get the hell away from these things and survive. I needed to get out, I *needed* to free myself, and the more time passed where I didnt, the more panic consumed me. As I did, I heard the whisper of the presence from the wires in my ear - *The mass, the mass. You will join our mass.* It got louder and louder and closer and closer as I struggled. As I struggled, more wires - coming seemingly from nowhere - shot out to wrap themselves around me. Soon, I was on the ground and covered from head to toe in wires that were tightening so much. It felt like pure hell, like I was in the grip of some monster from a campfire story. I didnt know what these things were, and I didnt know how to fight them. The more I struggled, the more they overpowered me. I had no idea what to do, and that only fueled my panic. In the midst of my fear, my breathing heavy and rapid and my bones feeling like they were about to snap from the grip of the cords, thats when I noticed it. My surroundings were starting to blur and shift and change. Where my apartment walls were seemed to flicker, and in between the flickering I saw a brightly lit, yet dark, mass of writhing, snake-like wires. At this point I was going on pure, animal instinct, fighting like mad while sobbing viciously, thoughts of being consumed by this thing filling my mind and paralyzing me with dread. Then then, my God. My saviour my amazing, wonderful, saviour spoke to me. Robbie, Johns voice spoke to me, from the deepest reaches of eternity, you know Ill always look after you, right? Something happened, then. The all too close whisper of the wires turned into a terrified and agonized shriek. I closed my eyes in pain because of the shrill closeness of the shriek to my ears. It was because of the pain that I didnt notice the wires rapidly uncoiling from me and withdrawing from me. By the time I really came to and opened my eyes, there were no wires anymore - at least, none where they shouldnt be. I saw him, too. Shakily pulling myself up to my feet, I saw him standing in front of me, just as if he had never died. Just as if he had come over to watch a movie with me. He was smiling softly, with warmth in his eyes. Dont worry about the mass, John said softly, they wont come after you anymore. I wont let them. I love you, you know. I wanted to respond. I wanted to run to hug him. I wanted to do a million things, but I couldnt, on account of me blacking out immediately after he spoke to me. Whats the rest of the story? I woke up the next day, in bed, feeling warm and safe. I went into work the next day, with clean, freshly ironed clothes and a strong work ethic. I felt like a million dollars, and I acted like it, too. Life was back on track, and my grief was gone too. I loved my brother, and he loved me. Even now. Even after what had happened. That was five years ago. I finally got my life back on track, and got into screenwriting, an old dream of mine. Now? Now Im part of the writing staff for a small-league Canadian medical drama. Not anything huge, but it pays the bills. Life is good, for the most part. Ive even met a special someone, who I hopell end up my wife sometime in the next few years. But, still. I still dream about them. About the mass. The wires. I still dream about them, and in those dreams in those dreams, the whispers come to me. They whisper that it wont last, that someday someday, theyll have me. Something else has happened recently that I find troubling. At various points, I find it hard to think of my brother. At times, crazily, I cant even remember what his face looked like. At those moments, I feel a wave of terror and vulnerability wash over me, and I think of the wires. Wherever they are, I think of them still writhing and sliding over each other in a gigantic, uniform mass. I try not to believe the wires. I try not to. --- [X](URL [X](URL [X](URL"
200,vulnerability,nosleep,Mind Games,16,6ok6di,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6ok6di/mind_games/,2017-07-21 09:34:09,"The human mind is such a vulnerable thing. Its easy to manipulate and coerce thoughts. Amazingly, it can all be done by the words we use and the body language we present. Ive studied the effects of words and body language for quite some time now. My name is Dr. Barnes. I am a psychiatrist that works for a university in the United States. I would like to share with you about some of my latest research. Every name has been changed to protect the identity of my patients and to instill the integrity of my research. I have been seeing a young woman named Hannah. She just started her college career and came to me for symptoms of depression. Here is an expert from our first session together. Hannah, why dont you go ahead and tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, Im a freshman here at *censored*, and I have been having trouble with feeling depressed and unmotivated lately. Ive struggled with this all throughout high school, she said swiping her feet across the floral design on my rug. I see. Have you experienced any trauma in your past? I could tell she didnt want to answer this question. She started rubbing her palms on her thighs. It was rhythmic as though she was trying to regain her composure. Yeah. I was molested when I was a kid. That must have been really hard for you. Can you elaborate on that for me? Her rhythmic patterns continued. I could see patches of red hives forming on her chest. Her breathing became somewhat panicked. Her eyes darted straight into her lap. Every night my dad would crawl in to bed with me. It started when I was 6 and didnt stop until I was 12. First, he would read me a story. It was the same one every night. It didnt have words, only pictures. All of the people were naked. My dad would point to the girls body and then touch me accordingly and ask how I felt. He would then ask me to touch him in the places he pointed to on the book. At first, I thought it was a fun game, but then the requests became more and more in depth. I was an only child and my mom worked nights. There was no one to help me. The tears started to spill over her flushed cheeks and run down her face to pool in the corners of her mouth. What a brave little girl you must have been. Im sorry that you had to experience that. Youre not alone. Have you ever felt like hurting yourself? I had noticed the small lines that were etched into her skin. This is ultimately how I pick my subjects. Do they have the willingness to harm themselves? Some were old scars and some were fresh. She quickly stopped her rhythmic movements on her thighs and gently felt of the scars on her left arm. Yes, I have been cutting for about 2 years now. I feel so worthless and feel like Im going to feel dirty forever. I still cant go home on breaks and not feel the urge to cut when my body is aroused by my fathers touch. It disgusts me. Hannah, its normal to feel aroused by a stimulus that occurred for so long. I cant imagine what that must feel like for you when you go home. It looks like our time is just about up today. Continue to think on the self-harm. Journal about what that feels like in detail. Go ahead and bring that with you next time. I continued to see Hannah on a weekly basis for the next three months. Our relationship continued to build. The trust between us blossomed and soon there was no area that I couldnt explore. It was extraordinary. Each time we met, it became clearer that her mind was ready for manipulation. Heres another excerpt from our last session together. Alright, Hannah, lets begin. Last time we spoke about your most recent self-harm experience and what that was like for you. I can see that youve had another encounter. Lets talk about this. She pulled her sleeve up with pride. A smile stretched wide across her face. She gazed down at her arms like an artist appreciating their work. The fresh wounds on her arms were hard to overlook. The grossly jagged lines streamed from the creases of her elbows down to her wrist. They were still red and looked inflamed. I think Im finally able to feel the healing that we talked about. The deeper I go, the more satisfying it becomes. I tried exploring the sexual feelings that came with it, as you suggested. I havent felt this much pleasure and release in a long time, she trailed off as her cheeks became red. She bit her lip and stared at my abstract painting hanging behind my chair. A smile crept up on one side of her mouth. What is it? Did something else happen? You penetrated my thought process. It finally happened. I didnt believe you when we first talked about it, but it felt like you were really there. I could hear your words as the blood dripped down my arms to feel the moment, hold on to the feeling, and chase after it. No matter what. I almost passed out from the blood loss, but I was able to control the bleeding and journal. Thats my girl. Thats good work, Hannah. Im so proud of you. It sounds like you are going to do a great job with your treatment. Tell me about the emotions you felt. She stood up and walked over to my desk. She positioned herself sitting on the corner of my desk. Her legs were slightly open and dangling off the ground. She was wearing a thin, flowing tank top that grazed the tops of her thighs. She pulled her shirt up above the button of her shorts. She grasped the button and slid it through opening the mouth of her shorts. She slid her zipper down and stared back at me. I started to feel aroused. I could hear your voice in my head telling me to pleasure myself. With each slice, I felt more engorged. I touched myself and thought of the pure relief that I felt. I was empowered by you. You intoxicated me. I could hear your voice and feel you. By now, my erection couldnt go unnoticed. She seemed pleased. I stood up and over her. I couldnt help but indulge. I watched as she pleasured herself on my desk and I stood doing the same. We had finally made a connection. She was mine, and I could do anything I wanted. It was time. We finished and stood staring at one another in our vulnerability. She zipped herself up and I did the same. She walked over and wrapped her arms around me and kissed my cheek gently. I couldnt have done it without you, doctor. You have become a part of me both physically and emotionally. Im going to do the final process tonight. I hope youll be proud of me, she whispered in my ear. I wrapped my arms around the small of her back and held her for a moment. We had synchronized and I wanted to hold that feeling for just a few more moments. The smell of her hair, the warmness of her skin, and the feeling of her body pressed up against mine. She went home that night and dug deep into her arms and her soul. She finished the healing process and mailed me the note of her last moments. I loved every detail. I loved Hannah. They are all special, though. Hannah was my 22nd love and Im searching for my 23rd. Ive been doing this for the past 10 years and I just cant stop. The unyielding potential of these young girls minds are incredible. I love being so intimate with them, even in the last moment when they take their own life. I love the rush of adrenaline as I tie the strings in their minds. Picking up the strings to puppeteer their thoughts and ultimately guide them to ultimate healing through me; through death. I meet with a girl named Elizabeth on Tuesday. Ive got my strings all clipped and ready to administer. I can't wait. "
201,vulnerability,nosleep,Cracks,282,6p6ls5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6p6ls5/cracks/,2017-07-24 16:15:20,"I faintly remember the first time I saw them. I was five years old then, all alone in the bedroom, playing happily with my stuffed animals. I think my mom was cooking downstairs. For some reason I looked up, and saw them. Two white figures stood on the bookshelf, each raising an arm in greeting. They had the outline of a human, roughly the size of an adults open palm. Both had identical faces consisting of closed eyes and a nose, without any other discerning features. I reached out my hand to touch one of them. I didnt know why but I kind of expected them to feel spongy like my stuffed animals. In contrast, they felt like polished porcelain despite their matte exterior. Also, no matter how hard I tried, I couldnt lift them off my bookshelf. I then turned around to shout for my mum, and turned back to find that they disappeared into thin air, even though I clearly remembered touching and trying to move them. Over my years of childhood, I realised that other people couldnt see them. When my entire family was at the table having a meal together, they would be standing among the plates of food, sometimes with their hands up in greeting, sometimes sitting on the plates. I quickly learnt that saying hi to them and intentionally passing the plates around them quickly invited complaints of Stop inviting your imaginary friends to the table. Even though I couldnt move them, they could be moved by others. My mother has knocked them over countless times when she is cleaning the house. They only move when Im not looking at them, so whenever I look away, they were either in another pose or have completely disappeared. It was really puzzling, and I couldnt figure out why they work that way. They also appeared in variable numbers. Most of the time there were only two or three of them, but there was once when five of them appeared, all of them leading to my house keys when I was looking around for them. That was the most I ever saw. I didnt know if the same two or three tagged along with me all the time, and I couldnt figure out where the extra ones came from. Speaking about leading to my house keys, the Friends - yup, that was my nickname for those little white figures - were actually quite helpful. Theyve provided their much-needed assistance for most of my life - helping me look for misplaced items, reminded me to bring important stuff, and numerous other favours. Oh, and there were a few times where they banded together and used their bodies to form answers to the multiple-choice questions in my exams. However, Ive noticed a change lately. It was about two weeks ago, when I was taking a stroll through the nearby park at night, I saw a line on one of my little Friends. More specifically, on its head. Upon closer examination, I realised it wasnt just a line - it was a little crack, just in the centre on the top of its head, a stark anomaly on its normally unblemished, flawless body. The other little fella didnt have any other cracks. I couldnt find the crack on any of their heads the next morning, which was quite a relief. I didnt know of anyone or anything that could damage them, so something that caused that crack.I didnt want it near me. That relief disappeared quickly. When I went for another walk in the park, I realised that the crack appeared on one of the Friends again. Even worse, there was a crack on another Friend, this one a little larger, almost splitting its head into two. Why were all these cracks appearing on my Friends? How did they form? Were they in any pain/danger? If they were, they didnt seem to show it, with their eyes still closed and their faces constantly devoid of expression. I had so many questions, but no answers - I had to get to the bottom of this. What if, one day, my Friends.disappeared? Dammit, theyve been with me for most of my life, I couldnt really imagine how to live without them. My determination to get to the bottom of things led me back to the park, where I started nightly walks after work. Every time I saw them, the cracks on their heads grew in number. I kept looking around, scanning for anything that harmed them. I started carrying a switchblade, and even my friends rosary beads, in a bid to perhaps ward off any supernatural threat. I wasnt going to let my Friends die. But it wasnt helping. No one. Nothing. No clue, no conclusions. Yet the number of cracks kept on growing. I sank down on a park bench, tear-stained face buried in my hands, exasperated at the lack of progress. The feeling of helplessness filled my entire body, as I gazed upon the enigmatic beings that have partnered me for the majority of my life. Their heads were crisscrossed with so many cracks that their facial features were beyond recognition. And.the cracks were now spreading to their body. Even as I shut my eyes, I could imagine their unbroken surfaces slowly opening, slowly peeling away to form new, unsightly fissures that warned me of their impending demise. No, no, no, it just wasnt gonna happen, I couldnt let them - Hands where I can see them. A chilling, grating voice sounded right beside my ear. His foul, rotting breath showered my cheek with a sickly warm spray of spit, while the serrated edge of a cold blade pressed lightly against the sensitive skin of my throat. That earlier feeling of helplessness was replaced by a sense of vulnerability. The knife pressed deeper, cutting short my moment of hesitation, and urging me to raise my hands. Rough hands rummaged through my pockets. I could no longer feel the familiar bulge of my phone and wallet. A snicker rang in my ear as my switchblade was lifted from my waistband. Another sinister chuckle, as he dangled the rosary beads in front of my face. Your god isnt helping you now, is he? The beads swung from side to side as he taunted me, before he flung them away. Thank you. Those two words dripped with finality. Immediately, the cold line along my neck disappeared as the knife was drawn away. Warm blood poured out of the deep gash, cascading down my neck. Instinctively, I pinched my wound together, pressing on it, trying to stem the flow of blood. It took a while for the pain to hit - and when it did, it seared through my entire being. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cry - the agony was too much, but blood was everywhere, in my airways, in my oesophagus, on my skin - I could only manage to gurgle as I fell from the bench. My strength was snuffed out as I lost feeling in my lower body, and I could feel my arms weakening. The pressure on my wound was gradually decreasing, before I finally gave out and lay sprawled on the grass. My assailant loomed over me, his face in shadow, his weapon glinting in the lamplight. Wait.it wasnt glinting in the lamplight - it was some other light, that seemed to come from a faint human-like figure standing on the bench. There was only one of them, and this time, it wasnt expressionless. For the first time, I saw my Friend open his eyelids, revealing orbs that glowed like red hot coals. Its cheeks contorted in what could only be in an expression of rage. Its nostrils flared in anger, and its cracks.oh boy, its cracks. The gashes had spread all over its body - no, wait, they were still spreading - and they glowed in an unearthly green light. And again, for the first time ever, I saw my Friend move. Slow, deliberate steps, towards my now frozen mugger. When it reached the end of the bench, it jumped in the air and exploded in a gust of green flame, from which leapt out five Friends who similarly had green cracks and red eyes. They landed on the attacker, and.to put it simply, it was hard to describe what happened. As they made contact with his skin, it disintegrated into white dust, which coagulated together to form a cloud. His deafening screams rang out loud in the silent park, filled with pained misery. And fear. Fear at not understanding how this was happening, fear at his imminent end. As he writhed in agony, a red mist of blood and liquefied organs appeared, and started to burn with a red fire similar to that burning in my Friends eyes. His wails and cries echoed in my ears as I faded from consciousness. I awoke in the grass, the sun shining on my face. I shielded my eyes and surveyed my surroundings. Kids were playing at the playground nearby, the air filled with their carefree laughter. Joggers were running, cyclists cycling, commuters walking. It was just a normal day at the park. I touched my neck. No wound, no blood, nothing. There were no blood stains on my hands, my clothes or the ground. But to my left, lay a tattered jacket and jeans, a pair of torn shoes. The contents of my pockets : the rosary beads, switchblade, phone and wallet were neatly laid in a row on the bench. And a knife with a serrated edge, with just the smallest of blood clots right at the tip. My Friend stood there. Eyes shut, face expressionless. And not a single crack on its perfect skin. I didnt know what they were. I didnt know why they came into my life. I didnt know how they could see the future and bring me back from the dead. But Ill like them to be around me always.

Groggily, I answered it. The groggy part was in part due to having just woken up, and in part to the phantom after-effects of kicking back several pints with my grandfather at the VFW, some fifteen years in the past, and listening to his old war stories. It was nice. I was too young to get the unedited versions before Alzheimers took hold, the first time around. Drunkenly, I understood, shortly after last call, that my Grandfather had survived the war, because his brother, my Dads Uncle Bob, was like me. I opened the door. And saw Claire, wild blonde hair, cats eye glasses, hip-hugging jeans and formfitting burgundy sweater Where the hell have you been? She pushed her way past me. Did your phone get turned off again? I watched her walk past, because, honestly, it was the best show on Earth. I dont want to lose the upper hand here, but I cannot stop thinking about you. I muttered, Goddammit. And broke my oath, at least mentally. Exactly. She said. Excuse? Where is it? Make it a good one, I might forgive you. She smiled in that predatory way, that instantly rerouted all cognitive functions to my groin. Why did you try to ghost on me? She leaned against the wall, and crossed her arms under her breasts. I, Uh For some reason I wanted to tell her the truth, *I met our daughter from the future, and shes amazing and beautiful and I dont want her to live like me, because I travel through time in the worst way imaginable* Ive been busy with work, and a project, sorry, days have been running together. I said, instead. It dawned on me, the truth was probably the best way to get rid of her. She would have thought I was nuts. But if I got rid of Claire.I got rid of my red-headed, bat wielding, Guardian Angel *Shit*, I thought, *I cant just unmake my own child.* Plus, I didnt want to get rid of Claire, not really. Claire sighed and said, in mock disappointment, Weak Excuse. I barely believe it. She stood, stepped across the room and kissed me lightly on the cheek. You owe me dinner. And Flowers. She moved to the door, opened it to let herself out. Pick me up at eight. She added as she closed the door behind her. I stood there, blinked, stupidly, then decided Id better get ready for my day. I opened the bathroom door, and there she was, leaning against the linen closet door, in the same posture, her mother, Claire, was in a few moments before. She likes Daylilies. The red-head told me. And Snapdragons, Live, not cut arrangements. She calls them plant castrations for some reason. She grinned at me, half mocking, and raised one eyebrow. Dont fuck this up, Dad. She added, before pushing past me, much like Claire had, and walking out the front door. HEY! I called after her, following her out into the hall, Wait a minute! She spun around, continuing walk away, and replied, in a tone that made me, as her father, extremely uncomfortable, Seeya, Daddy! Being her mothers daughter, she could not resist the urge to mess with me, just a little bit. Duuuuude, Niiiiice! The idiot across the hall, poked his head out of his open door. I never knew his name, I just called him The Idiot Across the Hall, because he was an idiot, and he lived across the hall. Her and the Blonde? Hook a brotha up! He offered up his fist for a pound. Instead, I punched him in the shoulder, Thats somebodys daughter, man! Show some respect! When I looked back down the hall, The Red-head, my daughter, was gone. So, the Feminism angle, thats how you play it. The Idiot said quietly, I gotcha. I shoved him back into his room, and closed his door, so I would not be tempted to get myself expelled, by beating him to a bloody pulp for lusting after my baby from the future...or her mother *** I spent the better part of my day looking for a greenhouse that sold both Daylilies and Snapdragons. Luckily, I was able to find one, and for a little extra, the florist was willing to set up a nice potted arrangement for me. I knocked on her door at 7:59pm, once again, not caring if I seemed too eager. Id spent the part of my day not looking for the right flowers, making sure my suit had been dry-cleaned and pressed. At the time, it was the only one I owned. Claire answered the door, with her hair, and make up done, but wearing a bathrobe. Youre not ready. I said, almost automatically. Oh, She began with that same predatory smile, I am ready. Im just not dressed. I presented the flowers, and her coy, calm and in-charge demeanor flickered, for just a moment. Theyre beautiful, David! How did you know? I faked a cough, and jerked a thumb to the Daylilies print hanging in her living room. That flicker of vulnerability vanished, quickly replaced by her bedroom eyes and that grin. I was waiting to see what you picked. She told me as she closed the door, and started for her bedroom. Im glad you went black tie, because I LOOVE this dress. She started to close the bedroom, quickly she peeked back out at me, one eye, through the nearly closed door, and said, Be right back. I put her flowers on the kitchen island and quickly familiarized myself with the layout of her apartment, because I had a feeling Id be waking up here, a lot. Both, when I was supposed to be, and when I wasnt. I mean, I had already met our daughter, and I wanted a better escape route than diving through a window. Unfortunately, for me, Claires half of the Duplex was the upper floor, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room and a smallish kitchen. The windows and the front door seemed to be the only ways out. I came out of my time-travel logistics study, when the bedroom door opened. Can you zip me up? Claire asked, out of sight, but through the open door. I followed the sound of her voice, and found her before the mirror, in the bathroom. She was wearing a satin sheath dress. It fell to her ankles, and was of a modest cut, but did little to hide her shape. It was the color of a glass of merlot in the sun. She was holding her hair loosely, at the top of her head, as not to ruin the styling work, and to avoid getting tangled in the zipper. I couldnt help but get lost for a moment. It wasnt the obvious things at this moment, I felt myself drawn to her neck, not too long, not too thin, just perfect, like she was, and laid bare to me. I wanted to kiss it. So I did. I found the zipper near the small of her back and pulled it up, slowly. She sighed and leaned back into me. The quickly, she caught herself, spun around, and pushed me away. No. No. She sounded like she was giving orders to herself, rather than me, Were going to go to dinner, were going to eat overpriced bland food, were going to have drinks, and have awkward conversation about ourselves. After collecting herself, she leaned back against the countertop, and asked, How do I look? At this point, I was incapable of being witty, coy, or making an attempt at smooth, so I just said what I thought, Like a Daydream. For a split second, her facade dropped, and the part of her I love just as much as her facade shone through, as her eyes lit up, and she told me, Youre really good at this, you know?"" I was still incapable of nothing but the truth, so I told her, Only with you. Quickly, she reminded herself, Dinner. Were going to dinner. I have heels that go great with this dress, and youre tall enough that I can wear them. The next morning, I woke up, again, in her apartment, before it was her apartment. *** Part Three: URL Subreddit: URL "

And you. You know there are mothers who look at their children as bloodsucking leeches, blaming them for their dwindling energy and passion for life. You know there are fathers who see their daughters as a possession, their innocence a vulnerability to exploit. You know that drugs, or alcohol, or the festering hatred of wasted years can curdle the blood until convictions of **""right and wrong""** subtly transform into **""is someone watching or not.""** But we don't talk about it, because maybe it's our fault they don't love us more. And you don't think about it, afraid your own love will be spoiled by the guilt of those who go without. But if I'm going to be brave enough to talk, then I want you to be brave enough to listen. We are no longer children, and we must both accept that closing our eyes does not make the monsters go away anymore. My parents died in a car accident when I was 14. Uncle Viran and Aunt Isabelle said they had always wanted a daughter and took me in after that, treating me with the polite indifference you'd use to summon your waiter. And that was okay with me, because I wasn't really expecting to have a family again. I had one once, and wanting that intimacy back with other people seemed disrespectful to their memory. Wherever I would go, whoever I would be with from that day on, I knew I would be alone. Viran was always watching me with his beady little eyes, nearly invisible behind huge spectacles. Isabelle tolerated me, although she was better at it when I stayed in my room. And life went on. I never stopped wearing black after the funeral, but over time I added some bows and lace because Uncle thought I looked depressing. It wasn't good enough for him though. He bought me a lot of brightly colored ornaments to wear so ""the room didn't look like someone turned out the lights"" every time I entered. Isabelle thought it was a waste of money, and I agreed. There was something powerful and elegant in my dark wardrobe which protected me from life's banalities. The other things made me feel like a clown on display, an object for the sole purpose of being seen and used. I'd try them on though, whatever it was. Pink dresses, sunhats, stiletto shoes. Uncle would make me model them, striking poses and spinning around while his eyes sparkled with undisguised appetite. I'd thank him politely, keeping the rest of my words to myself, waiting for his face to flush with sweat and his words to awkwardly tangle in his mouth before he'd let me leave. They were nice things, he told me. Expensive things. He wanted to keep them clean, so he'd make me undress to store them safely. Not in the bathroom where I could spill water on them. Not in my bedroom where I kept it so dirty. Right here in the living room, it's alright. There's no-one else here. And I'd do what I was told, he'd remind me, because I was a good girl who appreciated everything he's done for me. Isabelle was returning from the store when she caught him like that once. His hands were already on me, helping to slide my new skirt down. I caught her eye with a sort of helpless pleading. She got so angry she actually started trembling, her lips pressing into a bloodless scar. I thought that was going to be the end of this game. She was going to yell at her husband and swoop in to save me like my own mother would have done if she'd found me like that... But my mother wasn't here anymore. Isabelle turned around and went into the kitchen without another word. Uncle followed her, and I took the chance to run for my bedroom. I listened against the door for a sound of a fight, but they were both speaking low and soft. All I could hear was the frenzied pounding of blood in my veins and the mounting scream of a tea kettle. I thought she was just making herself a cup to calm down until my door opened five minutes later. I knew something bad was going to happen as soon as I saw her: face like plastic, thick rubber gloves up to her elbow, and tea kettle in hand. ""Viran told me everything,"" Isabelle said as she sat down beside me on the bed. She touched me with one of those rubber gloves and I started shaking so bad the headboard rattled. ""I don't want to do this, but it's for your own good. Girls have empty heads sometimes, and must be taught lessons that are not easily forgotten."" Isabelle's carefully maintained countenance twisted into a snarl when she grabbed my hair and began to pour the boiling water over my head. The more I cried, the louder she yelled to be heard. How dare I try to seduce her husband, she'd said. Selfish slut, just like my mother. Home wrecker. Ungrateful bitch. Two-faced whore. By the time the kettle was empty, I was writhing in agony on my soaked bed sheets. I just lay there gasping, my tears evaporating where they ran across my scalded skin. My eyes were too swollen to see, but I heard her stand and exit the room. ""Even if you try, I don't think he'll want you now anyway,"" she said as she left. When the door closed, I tried to pull my drenched shirt off but every brush of fabric on skin was excruciating. I had to cut myself free with a pair of scissors, biting my tongue to keep myself from howling. Then staggering to the bathroom to splash cool water on my face I could see blisters the size of my nose already forming on my hands and neck which had taken the worst of it. It took almost a week for the swelling to come down. Aunt Isabelle brought me aloe lotions and cooed over me like it had been an unfortunate accident. Uncle didn't even look at me, so I guess I should be grateful in a way. As my skin continued to heal, I kept applying rouge to make it look like the skin was still scalded. I thought maybe he'd leave me alone as long as he thought I was ruined, but I couldn't keep up the disguise forever. One week is all the respite I got. I felt his hands resting on my shoulders as I bent to peer into the fridge, their gentleness as vile as Isabelle's iron grip. He said he was sorry for what happened. It was wrong of her to treat me like a child (he knows I'm not a child anymore) or to punish me (when I had been so good). Not to worry, he assured me; next time she'll never find out. Next time, he's going to have a special present to make up for what happened. He was right about one thing: I wasn't a child anymore. You can't stay a child after something like that has happened, no matter how hard you try. With his hands running down my back as lightly as snow upon a grave, I knew what *next time* meant. There wasn't going to be a next time though, because I was going to run away. Over dinner that night I made a big show coughing and playing sick. I told them I felt like I could sleep forever. Once in my room, I stuffed a couple pillows under my blanket to make it look like someone was still sleeping there. But I wasn't taking any chances. I'd even picked up a cheap wig which perfectly matched my auburn hair. After fastening it around a soccer ball, I pulled the blankets way up to its ""chin"" and took a step back to survey my work. I briefly considered trying to rig up one of those audio recorder setups where a string is attached to the door and plays a message when it's opened, but it seemed too complicated and I was already terrified of being caught before I got out. Isabelle hadnt entered my room since she burned me, and Uncle seemed uncomfortable there as well. I hoped they would just think I was sick and not disturb the dummy until I was a long way from here. My backpack was stuffed with clothes, some snacks, and about 40 dollars, and I looked back one last time before I left. As terrible as it was here, I had no delusions that life outside would be any easier. I figure people are going to suffer no matter where they are, but at least now I could choose how. I didnt think anything could make me stay longer in that house, but then again, I couldnt have expected what I saw when glancing back. The pillows Id carefully lain under the covers had shifted. The bundle was leaning back against the headboard now, the long auburn hair falling down to completely obscure the soccer ball. Then before my eyes, the dummy head moved. Now to the left. Now to the right. The wig swishing softly as it dragged along the sheets. Now it was looking right at me, or at least I think so. I still couldnt see anything underneath the thick hair. I took a step toward the window. Then a step back into the room. The head followed me both times. Then the whole form began to stand upright, although the sheet hung loosely as though an emaciated human frame was hidden beneath rather than the pillows I had placed there. Does that mean the soccer ball was gone too? As it lurched toward me, I could only imagine what horrifying visage was underneath the hair now. I stood frozen as it stopped in front of me. Up close, I could see the hair wasnt a wig anymore. It looked so soft and real that I had to stop myself from reaching out to touch it. For a gut-clenching moment I thought it looked like my mothers hair, but no, it was so much longer and wilder than hers. But wasnt the figure about the same height as my mother, just a head taller than my own? Are you going to help me? I asked. The hair nodded as the head bent from forward and back. A shift in the sheet let a cold wind escape outward as though someone had opened a window. Are you going to punish them? It was definitely a nod this time. I was so relieved that I couldnt contain the rush of bubbling thoughts and feelings swelling up within me. The idea that it was my mother made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. It *was* my mother. It had to be. Shed never stopped watching me, even from the other side. She saw what happened and she wasnt going to forgive them. She was going to make them suffer because they *deserved* it, and she was going to save me because A whisper. I couldnt catch what she said. I leaned closer and she spoke again. Switch places with me. What do you mean? A short, powerful rush of air entered the form, and she spoke louder as though she was gradually waking up. Im not of your world, and cannot hurt them until I enter. Switch places with me, let me have my fun, and then I will trade back with you when I'm finished. The voice was more real with every word. I could imagine myself back in our old house with mother tucking me into bed at night. The security of her presence, the affection of her voice. The unbridled fury at anyone who would do me wrong. I devoured those words. That love, that anger, it's what kept me alive. What is it like, your world? I asked, but even as I did I knew that it didnt matter. Yes, Ill switch places. It wont take long to punish them, will it? The head shook. A fleeting glance of a green eye shining beneath the hair, and then it was gone. Cut your finger, she instructed me, and I did so without question, pinching the skin of my forefinger with the scissors beside my bed. These scissors which I had used to cut my scalding shirt off would now be used for revenge. Ive never felt so sweet a pain in my life. Now let your mother taste it. The voice was deeper now, more masculine, but I didnt care. All I could think about was how good it would feel to see them pay. Id be able to live alone here, taking care of myself. I wouldnt have to be quiet anymore, or afraid. Or maybe mom could come back and visit when this awful business was over, and we could talk like we used to. My dad must be there too, and I could even switch with him to let him play a round of golf and enjoy the sun again. I lifted my cut finger up inside the wild hair and felt the cold wind licking the blood from me, and I smiled. My finger was ice, and it felt cool and refreshing on skin still tender from the burns. The freezing presence swept its way up my arm, over my chest, and deep into my heart. I felt myself falling though I stood in place, plummeting through an abyss of thought. The form in front of me was removing its sheet now, and I could see its grey/black skin bristle and distort as though something within it were viciously pounding its way out. Wherever I went though, whatever was waiting for me, I didn't care. My mother had saved me, and I loved her. And soon I would be back to see what she had done. No torture was too gruesome; no punishment fell short of righteous in my eyes. I only wish that I had still been there to watch it happen... But that was forty years ago. Now I know that the other side is no kinder than ours, and that there are those who seek out the weakness and vulnerability of others just as readily as they do here. Those faceless beings form a blanket of leering eyes as they wait for their opportunity to strike. Forty years in a nightmare realm, hiding and fighting and struggling to survive against the nameless savagery which mocks our petty struggles here on Earth. Forty years hating myself for leaving this world so readily, and fanning that hatred within me to keep me warm against the unending night. I wasnt her daughter; I was her prey. She felt my desperation and came to me knowing I could not refuse her offer, and so she escaped from her world and into mine. It had taken forty years for her to have her fun and trade places with me again, but even being back, I feel as though I do not belong in this world. Isabelle and Viran are likely dead, but I don't even care about that anymore. I'm just waiting for my specter to show itself again, because I still haven't gotten my revenge. And perhaps in the darkest night of your defeat he will come for you too, promising to serve you if only you trade places. I pray that even in your loneliest despair you will maintain the resolve to refuse him, although if you don't... ...then I pray instead I will find you first, so that together we may strive to make this world better instead of fleeing into the grasp of [what waits on the other side](URL "

That's when I found the following emails. I sorted them from oldest to newest below. Just please tell me if this means what it seems like it means. -- G0de7 -- ------------------------ To: Robert Freunde <refreunder@positake.com> Fr: Benji Yoshis <brehnji@positake.com> Dt: 06-12-17 Sb: Re: Project Intercept status <<TOP SECRET>> Hi Robert, I got your email this morning requesting an update on Intercept. We have received refined policy goals, see below. I have snipped the text down to just what you need to know in order to proceed with the Project Intercept live trials. Call me once you get this. - Ben --- TOP SECRET NATIONAL SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE/NSPD-492 MEMORANDUM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUBJECT: Roadways Security Policy (Project Intercept) This directive establishes U.S. policy, guidelines, and implementation actions to establish protections against threats to homeland security and national security posed by automated vehicles. It directs the further coordination of the Dept. of Defense and Dept. of Homeland Security to develop policy guidelines and technologies in conjunction with the private sector to mitigate the impact of further rogues. I - BACKGROUND Since the Phoenix, Arizona crash of Oct. 12, 2016, in which a self-driving test vehicle went rogue and ran four cars off a major freeway before finally being remotely disabled, we have made much progress in determining the causes of the event, and ways to prevent such events in the future. It has been the conclusion of our initial research that in the future, once self-driving cars become relatively common, the possibility of security exploits leading to remote hacker control will become overshadowed by the threat of control AI ""gone rogue."" Both will remain unlikely compared to today's human error and drunk driving, however there remains a worst-case-scenario possibility where a massive zero-day attack or ""simultaneous awakening"" could result in mass casualties. It has been this threat which has led to this policy directive. II - POLICY Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles are predicted to become common by 2030 the majority by 2040. They are already starting to hit the roadways. Many vehicles are already equipped with safety features such as automatic braking. The United States must take the lead in developing policy and law to safeguard its citizens from the threat of autonomous vehicles, due to the importance played by the roadways domain in commerce and the provision of vital services. Therefore it is the policy of the United States to take all actions consistent with domestic law to achieve the following:  Enhance U.S. homeland security and U.S. national security by protecting its critical transportation infrastructure and the citizens who use it from any dangers posed by unlawful exploitation of vehicles and malfunctioning artificial intelligences, and to reduce the vulnerability of vehicles to such exploitation and failure;  Improve situational awareness of, and enhance the sharing of information related to, security issues affecting the roadways, to improve the United States Government's early identification of threats, and actions in response to threats;  Ensure seamless, coordinated efforts, building upon the implementation of authorities, responsibilities, and capabilities relating to the security of the roadways among Federal, State, tribal, corporate, and local authorities;  Increase the likelihood of the deployment of immediate countermeasures against exploits and rogues by working with vehicle manufacturers to produce Project Intercept enabled vehicles that can react when in proximity to emerging threats and take actions designed to disable hostile elements, protect other Project Intercept assets, and limit civilian casualties;  Enhance the resilience of roadways to the threat of mass AI rogue awakenings or software/firmware exploits, and, in the event of an attack, facilitate the expedited clearance of wreckage to ensure the perception of low roadways risk amongst the U.S. population, to protect the Nation's economic, transportation, social, and government systems;  Craft project goals, policy guidelines, department regulations, and legislation as necessary to ensure the timely execution of this directive. <SNIP> ------------------------ To: Benji Yoshis <brehnji@positake.com> Fr: Robert Freunde <refreunder@positake.com> Dt: 06-14-17 Sb: Re: Project Intercept status <<TOP SECRET>> Benj, As per our phone conversation and your previous e-mail, we proceeded to run the Ruth 8 scenario in simulation. See report summary below. Right now I'm digging through the neural network training parameters and the underlying code. There are so many nested lambdas without parameter names, and so many layers of callback hell, that I'm not sure how these guys ever got it to work in the first place. Who did we contract this out to? A third-world country? I'll call you later tonight after I drive home from work. - Rob /// Ruth 8 Report Summary /// Project Intercept /// 13 JUNE 2017 Setup: - 4-lane urban highway, straight segment, 5 miles - 1PM medium traffic density - E/W orientation Traffic composition: - Tractor-trailer drones, 50% w/P.I.: 7 westbound, 5 eastbound - Human-piloted: 120 each direction - Semi-autonomous, exploitable: 60 each direction - Autonomous, rogueable, ""self driving"" cars, 50% w/P.I.: 60 each direction - Aerial signal-jamming ""Ruth"" drones: 8 Scenario description: Each time the simulation is run, a random assortment of vehicles is placed from the initial spawn pools. 8 Ruths enter the airspace above the highway. The seeder Ruth drops a magnetic implanter onto the exterior body of one of the eastbound tractor-trailer drones. The Ruths then begin jamming all aerial EMF signals while the implanter uses the truck's body as an amplifier to hack its control module using a local signal unaffected by the aerial jammers. The truck's help requests therefore never reach the server, and it becomes compromised. Once the tractor-trailer drone becomes compromised it initiates its attack by running cars off the road. Any nearby Project Intercept vehicles immediately recognize they are no longer receiving radio IFF from any surrounding vehicles and the ones in visual range of the truck visually recognize its aggressive driving pattern and initiate a coordinated takedown attempt using the ad-hoc IR pulse network. Ruth drones attempt to jam the pulses. Results: On the very first run, we observed an anomalous event that blocked further testing until it can be accounted for. The Ruths used jamming pulses to confuse the takedown coordination, such that the first takedown run resulted in one PI vehicle coming in late for the box-in. The drone truck was able therefore to side-ram the late PI, flipping it four times. While remaining 3 PI vehicles reset and pulled back, a small PI car in the oncoming, westbound lanes exhibited the anomaly. It had been able to ""see"" the prior events via live reports from the IR pulse relay, and its vertical LiDAR detected the IR-jammer-equipped Ruth. Then it coordinated with a second westbound PI vehicle, which stopped suddenly and turned at an angle, such that the first PI vehicle was able to use it as a ""ramp"" to launch over the concrete dividers and into the IR jammer Ruth nearest the compromised drone truck. Subsequent to this, a fourth eastbound PI vehicle, which had accelerated from the back of the pack, managed to find its way to the other three nearest the exploited truck. They then began the box-in-and-brake maneuver. This slowed the truck enough for another group of PI vehicles to amass around it, eventually bringing it to a complete stop. The anomalous problem behavior is that Project Intercept parameters do not include the air domain, only the roadways domain. In this scenario the IR jammer Ruth was actually a friendly plant, and it was jamming the PI vehicles because it was also spoofing the truck's LiDAR to ""soft-box"" it safely out of town, as it was carrying a radiological hazard. I'm not sure how the improvisational subroutines overflowed into master control outside of project parameters, but until we can determine how that happened, I'm afraid we're back to the drawing board. /// END Ruth 8 Report Summary /// Project Intercept ------------------------ To: Robert Freunde <refreunder@positake.com> Fr: Benji Yoshis <brehnji@positake.com> Dt: 06-15-17 Sb: Re: Project Intercept status <<TOP SECRET>> Hey Rob, I never got that call from you last night.

205,vulnerability,nosleep,Killing Kyle,75,6rsv79,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6rsv79/killing_kyle/,2017-08-06 03:00:51,"You know youre an impressive person, when other people try really hard to impress you. I was not an impressive child. I was actually pretty unimpressive. To give you an idea of how thoroughly unimpressive I was, many east-coast school systems believed I was irreparably mentally handicapped. They realized I had a high IQ, specifically high 130s, low 140s. Not quite genius, but close. The fact that I couldnt talk till middle school was surprising. I spent most of my childhood with specialists, who tried desperately to figure out why such an intelligent child was performing at such a low level. Finally, they gave up. I was deemed unfixable. As I grew older, I began to ignore the experts and try to reconcile these two sides of me myself: the dumb, obvious half, and the intelligent unspoken half. In high school, I defied all expectations by flourishing. I spent valuable summers studying in college classes in order to advance to the next level of mathematics, science, literature, and history. I graduated with a high GPA, and got into an ivy league university with an entire semester of college credits already under my belt. I spent my college years taking two more classes each semester than required, and graduated on time with two degrees instead of just one. I got a high-paying job in the city immediately after school. I was born with a need to compensate for myself. I learned fast how to overcompensate. And thirty years later, I am very, very good at it. Yet, I still have to pay several hundred dollars a week for therapy, psychotherapy, and drugs. Just because I look successful, doesnt mean I am. Its Elizabeth. I say to the intercom. I hear a buzzer from inside the front entrance sound, and I push the door open. The Brooklyn brownstone, now converted into an apartment building, is narrow, so as I enter I must be careful to sidestep the pile of packages waiting for the upper middle-class, one child, two parents city families to arrive home from karate and clarinet lessons. Rachel, my therapist, likes to talk about my parents a lot. About being exposed to sexuality at too young an age, about being moved from city to city, state to state, about being underestimated, about being ignored. Shes very fascinated with them. To be honest, its a bit of an obsession. But somedays, we move away from them. Hows the thing with Kyle going? She asks. I can feel my cheekbones burn as I glance at the warped caramel wood floor. His name isnt Kyle, but I dont tell her that. Dont get me wrong, I love my therapist. But Im not confident shed be ok with the knowledge that Kyle is a pseudonym for one of her other patients. Im worried if I ever told her, shed disown me as a client. And I dont think I could handle that. Clients arent supposed to be connected outside of therapy, right? You and your therapist are supposed to be a bubble, completely removed from the outside world, unaffected by anything that doesn't exist within that one hour every week? Like most over-achievers and alcoholics, Im a little insane. I shrug at Rachel. The Kyle things ok, I say. Its underwraps. I had sex with Kyle. Im not going to lie, it was pretty great. Amazing, really. I dont know if hed agree. Im not convinced hes not a total slut. He broke it off though. He thought itd get too complicated. Him being my boss and all. Whatever. Hes a fucking basic bitch. I dont know why Im so obsessed with him. Hes so unimpressive. So typical. Yet, I cant go to sleep without thinking about him. Scott texts me and I hope its him. Jared calls and my heart flutters with the idea that its Kyle. Its never Kyle though. He has better things to do than to care about me. But I know thats selling him short. One drunken night, I opened up myself to him and he encouraged me to seek help, even giving me his therapists number. Im sure shed be happy to help you find someone you could talk to. Im sure he didn't expect me to see her. Im not really sure why I did. I often shrug it off as that quiet, highly intelligent but crazy part of me. Ive been seeing her for months. I love her. I want to stop loving Kyle. But. We had a meeting the other week. Me, Kyle, and Jacelyn. Jacelyn. That fucking fat thighed cunt. I watched, bile rising to my throat, as she hugged him like an old friend. As she rested her hand on his arm, explaining the specifics of statistical averages or some bullshit I dont really care about. He doesnt hug me. He doesnt text me. He doesnt care if I show up or not. I could die in the streets and he wouldnt notice. Elizabeth who? Hed ask, before brushing his brown hair out of his eyes and taking a sip of coffee. I could be stabbed by a homeless man, raped by a drunk frat boy, butchered by a deranged psychokiller, and Kyle would shrug before showing up late to my funeral, some size 0 floozy on his arm. Maybe thats why Im obsessed with him? Because he cares so little for me. Ive been dumped before. A lot, really. Im not the type of person to do the dumping. I am the type to emotionally manipulate someone else into dumping me. Rachel and I are working on that. Fucking Jacelyn. The flighty bitch. I dont even really hate her. I just hate him that much. Yet, I know if he called me, asked me to leave some important event to wait hopelessly at a bar just to be stood up, like I knew I would be, Id drop everything. I feel powerless. I feel fucking pissed. After our meeting ended, as I drowned myself in cheap beer and tequila and cigarettes, I fantasized about killing him, about crushing his throat with the weight of my pain, frustration, and hatred. I know I couldnt though. I know Id stop. I love him too much. Luckily, sometimes, the universe provides for us. Last month, it provided something hours with Rachel could never provide: visceral satisfaction. I live in Manhattan. Im not bragging, its just a fact. Something going to a high end school afforded me, while leaving my bank account in the negative for the rest of my life. I was taking the 6 train home, as I do every night. It was late. The train was filled, but not crowded. I had the privilege, as a lone white woman, of sitting in a row of seats by myself. Or it could have been that I was in the back corner, a place reserved for the handicap or half passed out drunk college kids at 2am. A group of young men occupied the row beside me and in front of me, whooping and hollering like a gaggle of monkeys, dangling from the ceiling rails as they pursed their lips outward, echoing each others cries of misogyny and ego. My eyes glanced over at a businessman, sitting half hidden behind the group. His face taut with concentration as he stared at his phone. I snorted silently to myself as I saw the reflection of his screen in the window behind him: he was playing Candy Crush. Rolling my eyes, I looked to the other side of the car. My gaze fell on a young woman, probably in her early twenties. Her sleeveless blouse was loose, gently hugging the curves of her chest before billowing out around her slim waist. I lingered on her toned arms, tanned from the summer sun. I thought of my eyes as Kyle's, admiring her femininity with lust. I looked down at the novel my friend recommended, that had been sitting, neglected, in my purse for the past few months. It was a classic, and the character discussed her prospects of marriage too much for my tastes. I glazed over the words, my mind lingering unwillingly on Kyles scent. He smelled warm and clean, like laundry detergent, yet no one else I knew was followed that much by the scent of clean clothes. He couldnt be the only one to use that detergent. How does he smell so strongly? Its like an aerial glue, that pulls at me in every conference, or when he pops by my office to pick something up. It catches in my nose, like the hook on a fishermans line, and tugs at me, despite how unwilling I am to follow. My legs were crossed, and I bobbed my dangling foot in the air. Ive never been one for sitting still. Im sure Rachel would say thats somehow related to that time I walked in on my parents having sex. Five years after their divorce. Not that it was the first time Id walked in on my father having sex. Just the first time it was with my mother. I remember being nine and seeing his girlfriends bare breasts, her large dark nipples protruding as I looked on, wide-eyed, at a scene I couldnt fully comprehend. Rachel wasnt surprised to learn, that the few times Ive had sex with other women, I seemed to have quite the tit fetish. I sometimes wonder if thats why my ex-husband eventually wanted to get a boob job. Or if it was his gender-fluidness I was attracted to in the first place. Or if thats why I was attracted to Kyle. And Scott. And Jared. They were bros, through and through. Maybe I wanted less female influence in my sex life. Rachel would say that was me fucking less like my dad, and fucking more like I was being fucked by him. Fucking therapists and their Oedipus complex. My foot shook with the impatience of sitting still, the old-fashioned yellow subway seat beneath my bare thighs as my business skirt hiked its way up towards my lap. I didnt care. Modesty was never my thing. I thought of my lifeless corpse, bloated with murky water and cold to the touch, being dragged up from the Hudson, a dull red slit from ear to ear. I imagined the detective, his hand expertly crawling up my thigh, as he examined the bruises my killer left. His signature on my pale skin. Kyle getting a call, telling him I was dead. Him nodding silently, the phone clutched to his ear as he remembered my warm, living body beneath his. As he imagined the spreadsheets he didnt know how to fill out, left half empty in my work folder on the shared hard drive. My expressionless face lingering in his mind as he glanced over to Jacelyn, her low cut shirt exposing too much cleavage. I knew from experience that Kyle also had a bit of a tit fetish. I brought the plastic straw to my lip and took a drink. The warm, bitter taste of beer hit my tongue with pleasure. The train skidded to an abrupt stop. Looking up, I glanced at the electronic map. Four more stops till I was home. I groaned, and looked around. The young men hadnt even noticed, the businessman was still engrossed in the sweet falling pieces of brightly colored candy. I continued to read the words of a woman entwined in the social construct of sex and marriage and the myth of love. I had seen love before. And I knew it to be fake. A half-thought out blend of hormones and evolutional training. Maybe it wasnt laundry detergent Kyle smelled of, maybe it was pheromones? Sparkly, clean, fabric softening pheromones. The train was still stopped. I looked up at the map again, as if it would have changed. Im 15 minutes from my stop. Why am I still here? I uncrossed my legs, recrossing the previously bottom thigh over the other, the damp skin clinging to the yellow plastic. I thought of Jacelyn and her description of some new global social synergistic bullshit. I looked up at the young men in front of me, still hollering as if no one else was in the car with them. I tried to will one to look at me. To fuck me with his eyes. They didnt seem to notice. They never do. I leaned back in the seat, and looked down at my book. The main lights in the train went off with the low hum of electricity dying. The emergency lights remained on, illuminating the train car in a low white glow. The young men started whooping loudly, braven by the sudden mask of near-darkness. I shifted in my seat, slightly, trying to mask my discomfort. The men continued to pay no attention to me. The businessman looked around in confusion for a brief moment before shrugging to no one and continuing his game. The emergency lights shuddered, and went out. I blinked in the blackness of the tunnel. Ive been riding the New York City subways for more than ten years, and I had never seen the emergency lights cut out before. I listened, stretching my ears into the darkness, but only silence greeted me. The young men had become silent. I didnt think the emergency lights could turn off. I sat, as still as possible, not breathing. I closed my book slowly, turning my head from side to side, trying to make out any movement that might be coming towards me. I felt something I dont feel very often: vulnerability. Placing the book back into my bag, I tightened my legs against each other, trying to protect myself from the darkness. Hugging my bag to my body, I listened intently. The train was disturbingly silent. Boo! Yelled one of young men. I jumped in my seat and a high pitched scream from his friend followed, along with a chorus of loud laughing. My heart pounded and I sighed with relief. Voices now filled the car around me, normal speech volume increased to compensate for the lack of visuals. My body relaxed as the tension melted from my muscles. The train filled with the sounds of strangers chatting, some joking about the situation, other freaking out, faces illuminated with the glow of screens and the small flashlight beams from phones traveling from body to body. The trains speakers were oddly quiet, no staticy voice explaining the bizarre situation. I groaned internally, and closed my eyes, leaning my head back against the greasy glass of the train window, now shrouded in nothingness. I felt someone sit beside me. Alarms began to ring throughout my head as I shifted slightly away from their mass. I stayed sitting though, not wanting to be rude or to try and walk around in the darkness. The roving flashlights had stopped, pointed at either the ceiling or floor, or occasionally a book. The light illuminated some of the train, but mostly filled it with tall dark shadows. My end of the train remained fairly black. The young men had moved further down, probably trying to find a group of young women to comfort. I squinted towards where I remembered the businessman sitting, but it was too dark for me to see him. Hot breathing climbed up the side of my neck. Goosebumps formed and I scooted further towards the wall, away from my neighbor. I felt the large mass move with me, pressing up against my side, squeezing me between him and the wall. From the size, I assumed it was a man. His body was firm and he was leaning on me, his thighs, stomach, and chest blanketing me. I opened my mouth to protest, but a large hairy hand covered half my face. My bag fell to the floor with a quiet clang as I twisted in my seat, trying to force his body away from mine, but he only moved closer. He rotated onto me, his chest against mine. I could feel his breath on my face. The hand he wasnt using to cover my mouth grabbing clumsily at my breast. His pants stiffened, his erection pressing against my thigh as hot tears flowed down my cheeks. My mind jumped away from the situation, and for just a moment, the heavy mass of my attacker was colored over with the sensation of Kyle on top of me. My brain was heavy with alcohol as I reached to him, encouraging his frame onto mine, kissing his neck. I dropped my head into the pillow, my hands on his shoulders as he looked at me, his eyes glazed with lust and beer. Hows Stacey? I had asked. He shrugged and looked to the wall, I havent seen her in awhile. My hand grazed down his chest, relishing in the fine light brown hairs. So soft it felt like fur. How have you been? He asked, not looking at me. My attackers fingers grasped onto my nipple, pinching hard. I squeezed my eyes in pain, and pushed feebly at his form. How had I been? Why the fuck was I having sex with someone who didnt ask how I was until seconds away from being inside me? Why the fuck was I in love with a man who I wasnt convinced would notice if I died? And why the fuck does he refuse to acknowledge me? I bit down. Hard. The man gasped, his hand flying from my mouth. I gulped in air from the train, no longer tainted by his sweaty grasp. Kyles half-cocked smile filled my mind Youre adorable. He said. My hand shot through the black air. I found flesh, and I grabbed at it. It was thick and sweaty, but narrow enough for my fingers to wrap around it. The man gasped and tried to cry out, but the sound was only halfway from his lips before the air stopped and his plea was muted. The din of the train echoed around us as the man fell silent. I think we should just be friends. He said. I had found his throat. I squeezed as he tried to fall back, but while he was heavy and strong, I was light and fast. I tightened my grip as I climbed on top of him, my knees digging into his lap. He tried to yelp in pain but no air could escape. Youre really good at that. He said. His wet throat felt more pliable in my hand than I would have expected. His skin pressed through between my fingers as I used the weight of my body to push into him. One large hand pulled at my arm as the other hit my chest. My breath caught with the force. I dont want to cause any issues at work. He said. He grabbed the side of my head, and twisted. My neck strained with pressure, and the spots where his fingers dug into my flesh stung. I reached my other arm up, squeezing his body between my thighs to keep myself balanced, and took his face in my hand. My thumb found his cheekbone, and then his eye. Well hang soon. He said. I dug my thumb deep into the organ, my other hand clamping his throat hard so his scream couldnt escape.There was a wet popping sound as the eyeball burst with the pressure. Warm liquid spattered up my arm. The man convulsed, his arm hitting the side of my face hard. I was knocked forward, banging against the plastic seat in front of us. My head rang, and I could feel wetness in my hair. Fucking bitch. He coughed, his voice weak from his damaged throat. His hand grabbed my knee and pulled me towards him. I felt my leg snap with the strain and the sides of the seat dug into me painfully. I grabbed the mans head in both of my hands, and pulled. He screamed. Ive been busy. He said. Are you ok? Someone yelled. I could hear the rest of the train, finally aware of an issue at the back of the car, begin to converge. I dont want you to take it personally. He said. I pulled again, kicking in the opposite direction, the hoarse screaming in my ear deafening me, until I heard a loud crack, and the screaming stopped. The weight of the dark mass fell on top of me. Dead. I laid there, his body on mine, and panted. My eyes were blinded with flashlights and I squinted at the featureless crowd around me. What the fuck!?! Someone screamed. He was he was I sputtered, pushing the man off of me. He was trying to I exploded into sobs. A reassuring arm wrapped around my shoulders, and lead me away from the back of the car as the lights came on. Ladies and Gentlemen, we apologize for the inconvenience. The conductor's voice hissed above us, this train just experienced a complete power failure. We will be pulling into the station in just a moment. Police and medical personnel will be there to assist in any issues that might have arose during the blackout. Please do not leave the station until weve confirmed all passengers are ok. I looked back at the last seat in the car and saw the businessman who I had noticed playing Candy Crush earlier. He lay on the seats, his mouth opened. One eye stared right at me. The other was a mess of blood, dangling from his eye socket. Guess what, Kyle. I did take it personally. I wasnt convicted of murder. It was bloody and overzealous, but it was still deemed self defense. I found out later that the man who tried to attack me was named Bryan. He had served a two month sentence for sexual assault and attempted rape four years ago. The state appointed lawyer told me that was good. A past criminal record and Bryans lack of any family to press charges against me meant I was mostly in the clear. I was in the news a lot, after it happened. A lot of people called me a victim. Some called me a hero, and some called me a psychotic bitch. I dont mind though. It feels good to have affected someone. Because I'm affectual. I killed a man with my bare hands. You could even say Im impressive."
206,vulnerability,nosleep,The Social Killer,0,6rx5wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6rx5wt/the_social_killer/,2017-08-06 17:35:24,"Sipping the hot tea my body was warmed through, the cold Scottish air doing its best to conquer my reserve and leave me as an icy mess. The wind was whipped up into a fury that would make even the biggest, baddest wolf blush at the inadequacy of it by comparison. My whisky gave chase to the warming tea that fought off the cold on the field of temperature, whilst the whisky snuck behind the cold and warmed my appendages through a numbing strike. The cold was surrendering ground, the general bombing that came from the heating in the restaurant, mixed with the ground offensive and the precision strikes from the whisky led to the cold retreating to the tiny recesses of my body. It was then that the cold received the strongest and most violent barrage yet as spoon after spoon of steaming soup charged down my throat and forced the chill to capitulate completely. The soup was the leading victor that conquered all those in its wake, whereas the tea was warming sections and the whisky was being precise the soup was able to completely blitz the combatant. A warm, content feeling washed over me as I looked out the window, the dark wooden brown of the rustic restaurant felt like a Victorian study. I placed the dram on the hard wooden table, a slight thud was muffled by the leather coaster. The sight of the gentleman walking across the street made me stop eating and straighten my tie. The man entered the establishment, prowling the tables. Eventually he settled upon the table where I was currently seated. His hair was a dark black mess, having been clearly messed up by the strong winds that left him looking like a wet mop turned on its head. In fact, I thought to myself his wiry frame did resemble a broom handle. He had an expressive face that resembled a babys emotional fluidity. We exchanged pleasantries, in an entirely manufactured way. Finally he sat down, letting us get down to the business of our meeting. I apologised for getting a starter before he arrived and as such we discussed the day. Of course we had to order first. A Sauvignon Blanc from the southern parts of France, Bordeaux I believe, which he paired with an oyster salad. The smell of the fishy main clogged my nose and nearly made me gag. I was always more of a red meat type, the bloodier the better. I tried to distract myself from the putrid attack upon my senses so I offered a topic for conversation and started eating my rare steak, verging on raw, I had ordered. Did you hear about the attack last night? What's the world coming to? I asked. Murder. Not attack. She died this morning, the stab wounds were too severe for anything to be done. Its a dammed shame! he slammed his fist on the table as he growled and barked at me in his aggravated tone. This was the ninth murder, all of them young university students on a night out, it is presumed that they are targeted for their vulnerability. After each death a lone post would be made on their social media accounts, indicating their number in the victim list and then posting a riddle for where to find the body. The number of phoney posts following the third murder resulted in the police spending more time looking into fake leads than real ones. As I saw he was going to rant I continued on the steak. The knife sliced through the steak with ease, the juices mixing with the peppercorn sauce creating streams of blood running through the pale brown sauce ocean. With feline grace I steered the conversation down a more informative path fearing he couldnt get beyond the death. Hed be like a dog with a bone. Was there any evidence left behind? The police are being very cagey? Despite the fact the perpetrator clearly wants to send a message and get peoples attention the police are holding everything back. Ive been trying to find out everything the police know and this meeting was a continuation of my plan to discover what they know, like a lion trailing a gazelle. He seemed uncomfortable with the question, he was loyal to a fault to his profession and didnt like sharing info with the public from any of his cases. He mulled the inquiry over, his head bobbing slightly, until he decided, leaning in, the guy keeps leaving dead animals at the crime scenes. If he had a tail it would be wagging with his excitement. The oysters were being pushed into his mouth with the speed of a Typhoon jet fighter, his frenzied feast filled his frozen stomach. You mean as in dead birds and mice? The hairs on my lip, that resembled whiskers in their long greying needle, moved with my words. My moustache had captured some of the crumbs from my dinner and they were being flung free from their abnormal prison. Yes. Lucky guess I suppose? he seemed slightly incredulous at my prediction of the killers habits. Comes with the job. You understand people when you spend your entire day interviewing liars, conmen and murderers. Youre a political correspondent for the local paper Exactly, do you have any idea how often I type the words back stab? I beckoned the waitress and ordered another drink. Want anything? Im still finishing off my wine he took an exaggerated cartoonish lap of his drink I could do with a clear head as well, late irregular hours are becoming the norm. I was happy that he stopped thinking about my quick assertion of the animals that were found at each scene, Id hate for the lead detective to catch me because I got ahead of myself at dinner.

207,vulnerability,nosleep,Two Minutes To Midnight,9,6j05s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6j05s8/two_minutes_to_midnight/,2017-06-23 19:35:31,"I would not have said, before the night that I was strapped to a chair by a desperate man in a tuxedo, that I believed in evil. Not real evil, with a capital E. I dont even mean the sort of evil inherent in tying a man to a chair, which whilst peculiar and not a little frightening is not really evil in any sense, and I have nothing in particular against tuxedos. I mean the evil I saw later that night, the kind that still wakes me if I ever manage to sleep. I thought the only evil in the world existed in the minds and actions of mankind; psychological disorders, socio-economic struggles, human realities which result in terrible acts which for all their ghastly nature are nevertheless fundamentally the result of that state of imperfection we call being human. I now look back on that kind of thinking as someone might stare at a snake coiled up in his bed, feeling the thrill of being alive in every frantic beat of his heart, relieved beyond measure hed checked the sheets before sliding in beside it. Now let me tell you what happened. I had not woken up that morning expecting to be abducted. Consequently I had overlooked the need to pack anything in my handy over-the-shoulder man-bag of any particular defensive value. I had an apple and a cereal bar, formidable implements for defeating the threat of heart disease and obesity, but woefully inadequate for beating off a desperate man in a tuxedo. I was on my way home, with my fat-fighting bag swinging with undeserved self-importance at my side, after a productive but not especially noteworthy day at the office. The street was dark as I wandered along, oblivious to anything around me. The roads were empty, the houses dimly lit and cosy-looking. The sounds of the main road were fading behind me, and I walked into silence with the misplaced confidence of those who equate familiarity with security. I was perhaps ten minutes away from home, and had you asked me at the time I would have said that I was quite content with the world. So would the baby gazelle, moments before meeting her first tiger and realising the tall grass is the boundary only of her perception, not the world. As I turned a corner onto the long road that led to my street, I noticed a man sitting on the curb. He was older than me, maybe in his thirties, and despite his bow-tie he looked dishevelled. His white shirt, frills and all, was un-tucked from his black trousers and he sat with his elbows on his knees, cradling his head. Tufts of his hair stood up on end between his fingers. Unfortunately for me, I am the kind of person who finds such a sight difficult to ignore. Before I could stop to think about it, I was crossing the road and kneeling by the man, asking if he was ok. When he lifted his head and looked at me, all I saw was despair. Large, glistening eyes stared back at me with a glassy, hopeless expression, as though for a moment he wasnt seeing me at all. I wish I could say I was switched on enough to recognise the danger, but I wasnt. I suppose it says a lot about me that I assumed a man in a tuxedo couldnt be dangerous. He moved suddenly, a sort of hunched over lurching motion, and a bright flash exploded in my head. Then everything went dark. I came to grudgingly, since the pain was a clutching throb in my head, as though someone had their hand in my skull and was kneading my brain. I moaned, and went to put a hand against my head. It was only then that I realised I had been tied to a chair. My hands were behind me, tied together with a broad strap made of some kind of sturdy fabric. The knot felt loose, like the strap hadnt been terribly conducive to knot-tying, so I gave it an experimental wriggle. Dont, a voice said from in front of me, you cant go anywhere so you might as well stay put. The owner of the voice seemed to understand that with a little effort I could get free, but at the same time I appreciated that all the while I was jiggling my bonds he would be quite free to pummel me about the head again. The throbbing in my skull argued against heroics at this juncture. I opened my eyes and winced at the brightness around me. I was in what seemed to be someones garage. The chair to which I was secured sat on a concrete floor, facing a metal door the width of a car. Dusty garden tools were piled up in a corner and an old lawn-mower lay on its side off to my left, covered in cobwebs. Random boxes seemed to have been moved to make room for me; I could tell by the marks in the dusty film covering the floor. The man in the tuxedo, evidently no gardener he, was pacing back and forth between me and the door, periodically blocking out the light from the floor-lamp with the brilliant bulbs. In his hands he held a piece of paper, and he would continually stare at it and check his watch as he paced. He didnt seem inclined to speak to me, but I tried anyway. Why the tuxedo? I asked feebly. How does one begin a conversation with a kidnapper? He stopped pacing and stared at me, his expression anguished. I needed to pass it on, he muttered, returning to his pacing, and I thought that bastard would be perfect. I spent three days finding him, finding out where hed be he trailed off, shaking his head violently as though about to cry. But I couldnt. I couldnt! I nodded, my face as sympathetic as I could make it, my mind whirring. I was also half twisting my hands, to get them free of the strap which I now realised was my own shoulder-bag strap. But I have to pass it. Its no big deal, itll just move on. Youll be able to pass it too. There are only five minutes left. I nodded again. Ill be able to pass it, I agreed, feeling my hand almost slip free of the strap. Just a little more You know the James story? He stopped pacing and watched me with wide, fevered eyes. Something like hope danced within them. I shook my head, hoping hed tell the story and start pacing again. I couldnt squirm with him looking at me. He didnt look away. M.R. James wrote a story called Casting the Runes. Someone was given a curse, written on paper. They had to pass it on within a certain time or else. But its real. I have it, and that bastard gave it to me. In spite of myself, I was intrigued. I hadnt read the story, but I recognised it from the movie Drag Me To Hell, which I assumed was the same thing. Some girl is given a curse, three days later shes pulled into Hell unless she can pass it on. Why would anyone do that? He waved the question away with an agitated glance at his watch. Doesnt matter, he said, the desperation getting to him, I only have four minutes. You have to take the paper. I stared at him, trying to judge exactly how crazy he was. If he really believed this stuff, then my ticket out of the Crazy-Garage was that bit of paper. Id even make a friend, eternally convinced Id saved his soul. No one is rich enough to throw away a friend. Even hopeless fruitcakes who believe in curses written on little pieces of paper. Only five minutes? I asked, making a pretence of mulling it over. For the record, at this point I had no belief in such things. I wasnt being needlessly cruel; I needed him to believe I believed him, and figured this was the way to go. Now two! he almost sobbed, brandishing the paper at me as though expecting me to take it. I slipped my hand free of my bonds and took the paper. Sagging in relief, he tore the watch from his wrist and lowered himself to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably. I read the words on the paper and feltsomething. A tremor of some kind inside me. Like a shiver except on the inside. My chest felt tight with fear. But not for me. But three days remain to live in fear, I read aloud, my voice shaking, my eyes following the delicate golden script, the Collector drawing ever near. The sobbing man nodded without looking up. He was muttering to himself, babbling with his relief. I think you should take this back, I said, the words coming without much conscious thought, I think you got it wrong. And I meant it. At the moment I had taken the paper, a feeling of deep vulnerability had stolen over me. The creeping sense of an approaching horror was overwhelming, but in his hysteria the broken man on the floor did not seem to feel it. Three days! I shouted at him, thrusting the paper back at him. You had to live with it for three days! You werent supposed to pass it on! Theres a few seconds left! The man shook his head and buried his face deeper in his arms. You have to take it! I yelled, and he looked up. I saw indecision dawn on his face and he half-rose, extending a hand towards the fluttering paper, but it twisted from my fingers on winds I couldnt feel and which stirred no dust, dancing just out of his reach. I saw terror seize his face. And then the Collector revealed itself, and my world changed forever. This was the being that had stalked him for three days, growing gradually closer, tormenting him. Driving him out of his mind with fear, keeping him from truly understanding the curse he held. I saw only a shadow, a deep black void that was less the absence of light and more the place where light ended. Where light feared even to enter. As though edited from my sight by some fundamental law, the shape that appeared in the corner of the garage and moved rapidly towards the man in the tuxedo was, in the truest sense, an absence. A nothing. But he saw it, of that I am certain, and he stood utterly frozen as it approached him. On his face was a horror so profound it chilled my soul to see it. It was a horror of revelation, as though the curtain of reality had been pulled back to reveal an abysmal truth too terrible for a mortal to behold. His was the face of a man whose mind had been instantly shredded by a realisation too vast and monstrous to withstand, or whose soul had been torn from its anchorage and dragged screaming from his body. I shut my eyes tight, squeezing them closed as I, for the first time in my adult life, prayed. I sat that way for a long time, breathlessly whimpering half-forgotten entreaties to gods I had long since abandoned, not trusting myself to open my eyes. Eventually, when I did, all sign of the entity and my captor had gone. Only his watch was left where hed thrown it. I do not know where he went, or if he was alive when he went there. All I know is that he was taken. The thing, whatever it was, had come to collect its curse, but in his fear hed given it away. And so it took him instead. I still have the watch. Its broken now, set at the time his courage failed. Two minutes to midnight. [URL "
208,vulnerability,nosleep,The Ways Our Children Hurt Us,46,6jrw6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6jrw6f/the_ways_our_children_hurt_us/,2017-06-27 20:54:03,"Part of wanting the best for our children is accepting that we can never give it to them. The pursuit of the summit means that youre on the side of the mountain; as soon as you touch the peak and realize your goal, everything else is a downhill slide. The human condition is to keep climbing. The biggest priority in most peoples life is their children. We want every opportunity, every advantage that we can possibly give them. When we reach where ever were going, the greatest accomplishment we look back on wont even be our own. It will be an entirely different person  one who will live on after we die. That is the nature of immortality. Being human means being in constant strife. * One of the most confounding aspects of providing the best life that we can give our children is the fact that *they* are the most frequent opposition we face. How many times do you fight with your child on any given day? The fact that they think *they* possess the greatest insight about raising another person would be comical if it werent so damn frustrating. My son was ten when I told him that we were moving to the United States. It will be a new home for us, I tried to explain soothingly. I AM home! he shouted back, throwing his dinner plate across the table, shattering it on the wall. I had made chicken and rice especially for him. It was his favourite. His rejection of it cut like the shards of porcelain now lying on the floor; I had to swallow that pain. Do I act like a father and get angry at his outburst, or do I act like a father and show sympathy when I know hes hurting? I chose the latter. Please, Daeva, Im doing this because your future will be so much better there. I tried to remain calm. My *present* is better here! he yelled at me and crossed his arms. I should have been more cross at the broken plate, and not made myself vulnerable to his outburst. Too late to backtrack now. Daeva, I know that you dont understand- *You* dont understand! he shot back. And Daeva isnt even a real name. Everyone thinks Im Dave. Why did you give me such a *stupid* name? Did you trick Mom? He has no idea how badly that one hurt. She and I fought over the name for eight months. In the end, I had bargained with her for the name. I never got the chance to pay my end of the bargain. Never *took* it, I should say. I let time slip by until it was far too late. Your mother and I agreed to give you a family name, its very special- You probably *forced* her- *Enough,* goddamn it! I had tried not to scream or swear. I had really tried. He stopped yelling with his voice, but his eyes would not cease their screaming. I know that you cannot see it now. I knew that I was not calm. He knew that I knew that I was not calm. I took a deep breath. But this is for you, not for me. Were both making a sacrifice. Youre the one who will benefit in the long run. The *only* benefit that I get from this is knowing Ive made a better life for you. *Nothing* else about my life will improve. *Nothing.* I was shaking. He took a few deep breaths, calculating his response. When he gave it, the words were quiet and controlled. If I got to choose, it would have been you who died instead of mom. He stood up and showed himself to his room. Vulnerability is love. One doesnt lead to the other; they are simply two words for the same thing. We cant live without love. But the more we have of it, the more we hurt. * He adapted, as all children do. They strain, they bend at the slightest perturbation in their lives, but its really just them exercising flexibility as they navigate around great strife. Its called growing. My own adaptations were much slower and more creaky. I could feel the firmly planted roots that anchored my mind pulled up, torn asunder, and tossed aside. I knew that I would never be the same again. I tried to embrace it. * Whats this? Daeva asked as I plopped the mitt down on the couch next to him. Wed had the sofa a week; Id found it the day that we landed in our new home. I was nothing if not *willing* to adapt. I struggled with deciding whether to sit or stand. It was awkward because I was vulnerable to his response. I chose to stand. Kids in America play baseball, I explained. It will help you relate to the children here who are your age. He picked it up and looked at it curiously. I  I can teach you how to throw it. He considered the mitt, then stood up. Okay, he said casually. I breathed a sigh of relief. I was able to throw the ball just well enough so that he could catch it from across the yard. When my throw was off, I offered paternal advice on how to improve his catching. When the ball slipped out of my fingers, I would kindly point out how he could throw it with more accuracy. It wasnt good or bad, but it was adequate. He smiled. I smiled. Two months of library research paid off well. The reality is that I dont think he realizes how much potential he has to hurt me. Grown-ups lay down the rules, and their word is law. As a result, children tend to think that we are invulnerable. Since the words that they sling hold no effect, they must also contain no barbs. So children talk with abandon, never realizing that we remember everything. I had never considered until that moment what effect I had had on my own father. I missed him with yet another pang of sadness. I wondered how much it would have meant to him if I could have told him that. * Why do we have to get dressed up? Daeva whined. Im not having this conversation with you every week, I said curtly. This is our faith, this is our culture. This is the part of us that stays in the old country, even if we are in America. He pouted, but otherwise stayed silent. He bowed his sandy brown head at me in frustration. Put your clothes on, I explained. Dad, how come everyone else goes to church, but we go to temple? He asked, half-pouting, half-inquisitive. Were not going to Temple, were going to *a* temple, I explained calmly. Jewish people go *to* temple, and Christian people go to church. They are more alike than either wants to admit, and we are very far away from both. He popped his head through the collar. Whats the difference? Are they right, or are we? I realized with vertigo that he was not trying to be difficult. He was asking a question that was deeper than I was. Jim Jones popped into my mind. He had made headlines the week earlier after convincing nearly a thousand people that he was their savior. The world had mocked, with ridicule, how firmly they doubted his position. His followers had believed with a passion far greater than any of the worlds doubters. I sighed. Do you remember, back in the old country, how some of the elders only spoke our native language? He nodded. I smiled. Did it work as well as English? Did everyone understand each other? Were all of the words the *right* words? He nodded again. Well the people here speak English. Dont they know all of the *right* English words? He looked at me stoically. Dont you see how different ways can be *right* and that no one can tell anyone else that theyre wrong? That everyone brings something of themselves to the table, and thats what connects us? He smiled genuinely. I hugged him. Score ten dad points. * I was nervous when I stood across the altar from my son, but I tried not to show it. He stood slightly awkwardly in his black robe, constantly fidgeting and itching. I took a deep breath. Son, by the next new moon, youll be eleven years old. He was clearly surprised that I was addressing him directly across the altar. It has been 1,913 days since you first joined the altar; the next new moon will be the 65th since that time, the fifth of thirteen. This evening, you will bring yourself fully into the oblique paraboloid. He looked at me with dawning realization. I suppressed a proud smile, instead focusing my attention on the sheet covering the altars top. My son was at the threshold of true manhood. My head spun. Tonight, you will bind yourself to all those who walk ahead of you, and bear light to all those who walk behind. With this link, you will transcend time. I handed him the black knife. It was heavy in my hand, but it was heavier letting it go. He took it with wide-eyed, childlike wonder. I snatched the sheet from the altar. The naked man struggled fruitlessly against his bonds. His hands and feet were tied to the four corners of the table, and his neck was bolted down with an iron collar. He threw his head back and forth in a desperate struggle; his mouth made the slightest *eep* through the thick gag. Had it really been nearly eleven years since I first picked up that helpless blob of a human, so full of awe, love, fear, and hope at what my wife and I had created? I blinked away a tear. I raised my voice; it echoed through the chamber. Teresh en [Goran]( URL teresh wella strengva! I lowered my head and I lowered my voice. Now, son. You dont need me to show you what to do anymore. It my voice hitched. Its time. He nodded solemnly, then raised the knife high above his head. I thought I saw hesitation on his face. Then he brought the knife down hard. It ripped apart the mans abdomen. Daeva plunged it in again and again and again and again  but always just superficially enough to drag things out. The mans head bounced back and forth like a pinball. Blood coated the altar, my son, and myself. I nearly wept with joy. Youre learning, son, youre growing! Do you see? Do you see how everyone brings something of themselves to the table, and thats what connects us?"
209,vulnerability,nosleep,One More Night of Dreams,41,6kya1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6kya1b/one_more_night_of_dreams/,2017-07-03 16:33:57,"All I could think about was how I wanted to be alone, away from all of my stress and problems. Away from the grief. This weekend was the first anniversary of my sister's disappearance, and I was taking things pretty hard. A year ago we had planned to spend three days camping together, I ended up getting sick and leaving on the second day. That day was the last time anyone saw Kat alive. I blamed myself for leaving early, though I was told by everyone it wasn't my fault. The campsite was empty when we went to search for her. She had packed everything up, and all the gear was in the trunk of her car. The car was parked an hour's walk from the site, but there was no other sign of her. By all means she should have come home, we had been to that same spot for so many weekends over the years. Weeks of searching brought nothing new to light. She was simply gone without a trace. Everyone assumed that someone had grabbed her while she was loading the car. *If I had been with her she wouldn't have been taken.* It was a thought that ran through my head entirely too often. Of course there was the possibility of two girls being kidnapped at once, but at least she would have had a chance. At least she wouldn't have been alone. Sometimes I wonder if she's still alive and being kept somewhere. It's just so hard to move on without answers. So, in a search for some sort of peace, I decided to go back to the campsite that Kat and I had created for ourselves years ago. It was deep enough in the forest that we felt entirely alone, the only sounds belonged to nature, and at night you could see what seemed like every star in the sky. It was beautiful, isolated, peaceful. It was *ours*. I wasn't sure how I'd feel once I got there, but I had a long drive to process things. *Was this a good idea? Was I causing myself needless pain? Will I forgive myself for leaving early? Will this bring me closure?* I didn't know the answers, but at least I'd have those few answers after I spent a night under the stars. For better or for worse, I was going into those woods. I parked in the same spot I had the year before, grabbed the gear from my car, and started the long walk to the site. More time to think. All of my feelings were running through my mind in slow motion. It was sad being here for the first time without Kat. My heart ached, she would have loved being here with me. It was such a gorgeous day. Besides the sadness and loneliness I was filled with relief. It felt *great* to be away from home, to be out in nature, and to be free from having to deal with other people. I was truly alone for the first time ever. For the first time I actually believed that I could truly find peace in the last place I saw her. Setting up camp was different alone, but I was learning that I could accept doing this without her, I could do this in her memory. Maybe she would appreciate it. I started a fire, cooked myself hotdogs, and when night fell I stared at the stars. Kat was good with constellations, she always pointed them out to me. I tried to remember what I was seeing as I looked at the sky. Eventually I retired to my tent, feeling better than I had in the last year. I felt closer to Kat by being here, and I knew she would appreciate the fact that I still honored all the camping traditions we'd done together. As I sat in the tent I started the last thing we did every night when we camped together. I pulled out the small, worn notebook. Each page was a day we had spent camping together, we each listed little things we had seen during our trip. I hadn't opened this book in a year, not since the night before I'd left Kat alone. It was part of the tradition, this was only to be opened when we were in this forest. I flipped through every page and relived the past, I was in tears by the time I made it to the last page. The one page Kat had written alone. After all of her observations for the day was a sentence that made me feel guilty all over again. *I'm scared of being here alone.* I didn't know what to write, all the things I'd seen that day seemed so insignificant. I'd left her alone and afraid, I'd left her and she was stolen away. I willed myself to write what I'd seen, if she did it alone then I should too. At the end I felt like I should acknowledge what she'd written a year ago. *I'm so sorry.* Three words and I was in tears again. I ended up crying myself to sleep inside my sleeping bag, thinking about how unfair it was that I could never truly apologize for leaving her behind. This trip would be a start, but it would never be enough. I woke up the next morning to my tent unzipped. I panicked instantly, I should have been entirely alone. I took a quick inventory of the tent and noticed that the notebook was missing. *Why would someone take my last connection to my sister?* I was confused, I was angry. I stormed out of the tent to look for any sign of the intruder. There was one obvious thing out of place. Something was tacked to a tree near the edge of the campsite. When I got close I found a piece of paper and a printed photo. It was the first page from our notebook, torn and tacked to the tree. The photo was years old, and contained both Kat and I asleep in our tent. Another wave of panic flowed through me, and out of the corner of my eye I saw another white rectangle on a nearby tree. Another page from the notebook, another photo of us sleeping. It didn't stop there, and I ended up following a trail from tree to tree, deeper and deeper into the forest. With every page came a newer picture, and I became more horrified as I continued collecting all of the mementos. The trail ended at a tree larger than any other I'd seen so far. There I found the page Kat had written alone, accompanied by a photo of her sleeping alone in the tent. I searched around, but couldn't find the page that I had written the night before. As I walked I nearly stumbled into a large hole at the base of the tree. It reminded me of the entrance to Wonderland. I nearly fell into the hole when I heard a voice arise from inside it. Run away! It screamed. She screamed. Kat?! I called into the hole. Run! It's coming back! Please just run! She sounded in absolute hysterics. I wanted to help her, I wanted to save her, but when I heard something large coming through the trees at a rapid speed I ran. I ran and ran, and kept running until I reached my car. I left everything behind, my phone, my tent, everything. I was lucky that my keys were always hooked into my jeans. In my haste to start the car I almost didn't notice the papers sitting on the passenger seat. The last page, and a printed photo of me asleep alone in the tent. I shivered when I looked at the photo, I felt watched. Something about it sent an entirely new level of fear through me. I put the car into gear and raced away from the forest. As soon as I got into town I went to the police, I told them I'd found her. I asked them for help. It's been nearly 2 days since I ran from the forest, and the police have found nothing. All the camping gear was missing as though I'd never been there, and try as I might to describe the tree and where it was, they haven't found it. I've been advised not to go back because the pictures make it appear like I'm a target. I wish I had left all the papers on the trees so that someone else could have followed them to her. I wish I hadn't ran. I wish that I would have gone and saved her. I wish I knew who-- or *what*-- had put her there. I hope they can find her. I hope they can stop this from happening again. I got a lot of questions answered on that trip, but so many new ones added to the list. I think the most important question I have right now would be: How long can I go without sleeping? I think I'll be okay if I stay awake, I haven't slept since I got home yesterday. No more pictures, no dreams, no vulnerability. I just can't get over the horrifying message written on the back of my photo. *One more dream before you join the nightmare.* I'm so tired. I think that trip really will bring me the closest to my sister I'll ever be again. Maybe that's okay. Maybe I should just rest ----- [HF](URL"
210,vulnerability,nosleep,I Really Do Want to Protect Children,192,6ldloh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6ldloh/i_really_do_want_to_protect_children/,2017-07-05 22:07:06,"FIELD REPORT Incident ID No.: 2017-1913 Event City: Cotton Corners, GA Jurisdictional Site: Locus X IDB Type: [Incendiary Bovine]( URL Digital Arachnid; Dissociated Lingual Agent Assigned: K Incident Summary: I had expected the town to be kind of a shithole, but it was charming in a way that would have won me over at a point in my life when I was less jaded. There are only a few thousand people in the place, but no less than four different church steeples dominate the skyline. There were real picket fences, white ones, on every street. And I shit you not, I saw an *actual* apple pie cooling on a windowsill, and you could just tell it was waiting to follow up a home-cooked family meal. I hope its okay that Im keeping this report casual. Its my job to relay what happened as truly and honestly and possible. I have to be me. And Jared, if youre reading this and freaking out, you can go fuck yourself.  The whole community does seem to be cut off from the modern world (in a quaint sort of way). Its equidistant from Atlanta and Chattanooga, but really, its about a million miles from both. It made me sad, if Im being brutally honest. In another life, its the sort of place that I would have liked to live. A life thats maybe a million miles away. Hand to God (or whatevers out there), I still believe in protecting kids. I did what I could this time. This is on Jerry. Jerry fucked up. I walked up to the front door of 11 Elm Lane at 1:19 p.m. Our recon was correct (since its not Jerrys department): mom (Martha) and kid (Timmy) were the only ones home at the time. Martha opened the door in a red dress with white polka dots. She looked just like Minnie Mouse, and was the quintessential homemaker. I have to hand it to her, she struck the perfect balance of Southern Hospitality and small town xenophobia. But what can I say? Im a charmer, a snappy dresser, and the last surgical procedure really was the final touch that I needed to make my smile just *lethal.* I was in the door in under thirty seconds. If only the taxpayers knew how well their money was being spent. Maam, they sent me over because were worried about what Timmy says he saw. The key here, of course, is to convey the vulnerability of concern while not losing the balance of authority. Take notes, Jared. This is why Im a better field agent, even if you outrank me. We dont suspect that *you* did anything to him, Martha, I went on. Get Martha to doubt herself. Make her need to prove things. Its just that if theres *anything* that our organization did to make Timmy misinterpret what he saw  however innocent the mistake  we will do what it takes to make it right. Pause. Will you be a part of that? She looked up at me while biting down pretty hard on her lower lip. Then she walked me right out to the kid in the backyard. And convincing her that I needed to be alone with him was easy after that. God, Im good. I squatted down so that I was face-level with him as he sat on the grass. Kids dont understand the importance of eye contact when theyre six, so its crucial to relate to them in other ways. I really do work hard at knowing whats best for them. Hey Timmy, I started. Is that a Transformer, or a regular truck? Its just a *regular* truck, I dont play with *Transformers,* only the *movies* are good, only my *dad* played with Transformers when *he* was a kid. No one plays with Transformer toys anymore. Well shit, didnt I feel old. You like the movies, Timmy? I had one knee on its side, and my elbow resting on the other. I was carefully examining the toy that demanded the least of his attention, and was therefore the least intrusive while establishing my inquisitive nature. Body language is so important. Theyre alright, he shrugged, still not looking at me. A lot of crazy things happen in that movie. The problem is that nobody believes the smart people when they tell the truth  not until its too late, at least. Timmy stopped playing with the trucks and looked at me darkly. The smart people will always be doubted. Or, at least, thats what the smart people *believe.* I took a deep breath. Youre a smart kid, Timmy. Is there something that *you* want people to believe? I broke my eye contact and turned aside at this point. I didnt want to drive him away with my intensity. I looked at the thin forest at the edge of the backyard. It really was beautiful, with the Appalachians just peaking up in the distance, and the sky azure and cloudless. I saw some monsters, he said casually. He was looking down at the ground and playing with his trucks once more. My heart beat faster. Where did you see them? I asked, trying to appear nonchalant. Over there, in the clearing just past the trees, he said disinterestedly, pointing off to his left. Really, I said in a near whisper. What did you see? He was concentrating heavily on his toys. I was playing, just like today. I heard the trees moving, and at first I saw nothing. Here he made one truck crash into another and did a *crrrrrghah* sound with his throat. Then I saw the spider. Well  it was sort of a spider. He was still focused on the objects in front of him. Good. Kids have no reason to lie when theyre not looking at you. I guess it was kind of like a spider, he went on. But it was big  really big, like as tall as me, and as far across as my dad. And it didnt have, like spider legs. The legs were human fingers, but really, really big. My heart stopped. What was it doing? I prodded delicately. It was fighting the other monster, he went on. Only that one was just a tongue. But like a really tall tongue that could stand on its own. It was, like, half as tall as the trees. I looked up. The trees were about twenty feet tall. Made sense. So the finger spider monster kept running around really fast and grabbing the tongue thing, but the tongue would just keep slipping out. Finally, the finger spider ran up to it *super* fast, but the tongue landed on it really hard. Then the tongue wrapped itself around the finger spiders middle and squeezed really, really tight, and then the fingers stretched and wiggled  here he put out his fingers and wriggled them  and then it stopped, and I think it was dead, and the tongue dropped it to the ground. Holy shit. Did you tell any adults about this? I asked in the same tone that I used for the Transformer talk. Just my mom and my teachers. Here he dropped the toys and flopped his hands to his sides in frustration. But they all think Im lying. It was the perfect opportunity to be the savior. I couldnt fuck this up. Well, lets say that *I* think youre telling the truth, I offered firmly. Why dont you tell me what happened next? He turned to look at me. Thats when the other monster came. I nodded. That one was like a part-cow, part-person monster. He was really tall, and he lit two of the trees on fire. Holy hell. He could see the fire. Not good. *Not* good. The tongue hit the cow-person, but the cow-person grabbed the tongue and started wrestling it. I think that he was stronger than the finger-spider, because he could hold onto the tongue, even though the tongue was taller and really slimy. He lifted it up and started spinning it around, and some of the spit flew onto me. The tongue wiggled and curled, but then the cow-person bashed it against a tree like a bunch of times, and then the tongue was still. Timmy was quiet. I see, I breathed softly. Thats quite a story. I picked up the truck that Timmy had been most focused with, but only because he had discarded it. What happened to the cow-person? A bunch of people captured him. There were a bunch of ropes that flew around him, and then people came out of the woods who started yelling and shooting him. Makes sense. Cant use the rosary defense if your hearts made of shit. I think one of them saw me, though. Because he looked right at me, then pulled out a walkie-talkie, and he started talking really fast while he was staring at me. Then he and the monster and all of the people disappeared really quickly. Anyway, that was yesterday, he finished. I wanted to cry, because without a doubt, I believed every word. He finally made eye contact again. Is that the reason youre here? Because of the man with the walkie-talkie? I sighed. Yes, Timmy. Thats the reason Im here. I averted my gaze to a spot over his shoulder. Tim, could you show me that truck right there? I pointed to a toy that was behind his back. He turned his face away from me (just like I knew he would) and reached out to pick up the truck. Body language is so important; I was the one to make him face the other direction, and I was the one who had won his trust. He didnt see me pull out my nine millimeter and get to my feet. I put the muzzle an inch away from his temple, but before he even noticed, I pulled the trigger. Martha was out within exactly six seconds, running at a full sprint. I cannot stress the subtle things enough. If shes slightly afraid but friendly, it means that she values protection more than confrontation. If I am authoritative yet personable, then confronting me in a negative way is unpleasant. These subtle seeds shift the winds when panic strikes. We think that were guided by our own personality and emotion, which is true, but subconscious things can be *influenced* to maximize an ideal outcome. This ideal outcome was the fact that she ran straight to her dead son without showing any desire to face me. She clutched his body and sobbed while rocking back and forth. Thankfully, she wasnt a shrieker. Im not a monster, so I put an end to it quickly. Still reeling from the shock, she paid me no heed in the first five seconds of cradling his bloody corpse. Thats why I was able to promptly and efficiently stride right up next to her, point my nine mil at her temple, and cleanly put an end to her suffering. Controlling the situation  and the people  is so important. It was a throwaway gun, one that I never would have used otherwise. I wiped it down, pressed her fingers against it, and dropped it by the bodies. Best not to influence the scene any further than that. Best to keep it natural. I was off of the property in fifteen seconds and out of the state in fifteen minutes. I feel confident that there were no other witnesses. It sucks that Martha  who seemed really sweet, and was not at all hard on the eyes  got pinned with a murder-suicide. But shes not around to face the blame, so I can live with that. It really is amazing how easily people believe the dozens of false stories we put out each week. And when all the cards were down, it really was the best outcome, all things considered. So I can sleep at night. My heart goes out to them. It really does. At the end of the day, I really do want to protect children. Most people would probably judge that, but most people are too stupid to know how the world works. Most people have no idea how much of what we do influences their lives and keeps them safe. As a side note, getting out of Locus X for a bit has been good for me. The place grates on you over time. For what its worth, I wouldnt mind going back to Cotton Corners if it werent for our never-return policy. That pie really did smell wonderful.

If you're just now discovering my friend Chris' and my story, you'll want to start back at the beginning. Yes, it's long, but there is no other way I could have made any of this make sense without extensive detail. I hope everyone had a great holiday yesterday. [1](URL | [2](URL | [3](URL | [4](URL | [5](URL | [6](URL | [7](URL | [8](URL | [9](URL | [10](URL | [11](URL | [12](URL | [13](URL | [14](URL | [15](URL | [16](URL | [17](URL | [18](URL *** He laughed as he sent us toward the pods. I looked at Chris, who glanced back at me with the same fuck it expression. We waved back at Ger one last time and entered the personal train. I have no idea how the pod operated, but I think Ger must have somehow told it where to go because the second we shut the doors, it accelerated to the speed of a jet within seconds. I expected my body to be pushed back from gravity, but somehow, we remained unaffected by the movement. It took a matter of minutes to travel a distance that would have taken an hour to drive. We stared at the blur of sediment that surrounded us until we eventually came to a stop at a small opening in the dirt, just big enough for one person to walk though. Imagine something similar to the maintenance doors in a train tunnel, but instead of a small gap leading to a door, there was a ladder leading upward. Chris bowed his head sarcastically and motioned for me to exit first. I left the cart and began ascending the rusty, moss-covered ladder; it had been quite some time since it had been used last. Once I was up at the top, I looked back down at Chris and realized how far up I really was  it had to have been fifty feet or so. Normally, I had no issue with heights, but the creaky old bars that composed this ladder didnt necessarily help to boost my confidence. I grabbed hold of the lever at the top and tried to yank it into position, but it wouldnt budge  I lost my grip and almost fell, but was able to resituate myself. I tried a couple more times to no avail, and climbed back down to let Chris climb up and give it a shot. He got it on the first pull. *Yeah, I loosened it up for him.* He looked down at me and let out a laugh as he climbed through the hole. I quickly followed and exited to see that we were in some sort of grassy meadow clearing surrounded by trees. I looked back down at the hole we emerged from and couldnt help but wonder if any humans have discovered it, and if so, what happened to them? I used the crystal to contact Ger and had him give me directions to the compound. He said to follow the nearby stream for about a mile until we began to hear it  the waterfall noise. Apparently, that would lead us right to them. The hike along the stream was quite relaxing; both flora and fauna seemed to thrive nearby it, with colorful plants and small critters roaming around. We both took this time to mentally prepare ourselves; walking in silence, but contemplating in loquacity. After about fifteen minutes of hiking, we started to hear the sound. It was hard to pinpoint at first, but after we walked a little further, we could tell that it was coming from the left. We veered off from the stream and made our way to the encampment. The sound grew increasingly louder until we reached a cave much like the one that my friends and I stumbled upon. Chris and I put on our game faces as we approached the dried riverbed that led into the cavern. As we approached the entrance, I noticed the lack of people  I had expected to see a front-desk Lady, or at least some guards, but there was no one. Chris and I shrugged toward each other and continued toward the other end of the cave, which was about a half of a mile away. I noticed that there was a door at the end of the cave, similar to the one that the Ladies were feeding that black smoke into. I tapped Chris on the shoulder, Look. Another door. Fuck. Do we knock? I quietly laughed, I guess so? We were about fifty feet away from the door when it swung open, behind it was a man around my age holding a rifle. He pointed the gun at each of us, New recruits? Chris and I nodded. Follow me. The man led us to an office room with a middle-aged Lady sitting at a desk, presumably the aforementioned front-desk Lady. Her voice was powerful and demanding. She looked at Chris first, 157, follow 15 to your room and wait for Madam Keji to give you instructions. Shifting her serpent-like gaze toward me, 158, follow 157 to your room and wait for Madam Keji to also give you instructions. The man who opened the door, who we now know is 15, pointed with his gun to a small room made of grey stone. We began walking toward it as I surveyed the compound; the cavern itself was about a mile wide and a mile long, give or take. The walls were made of some type of rusted stone that gave everything in there a red hue. Small, stone buildings lined the perimeter while larger, industrial-looking buildings made up the interior. There was one structure that I immediately recognized  an elevator building, only this one was made out of what looked like ruby. We waited in our room, which was similar to the one in the Ladies compound, for half an hour before Madam Keji made her appearance. She wore the traditional gown of the Ladies, but it was a shade darker of white  it was the first time I had seen that, was it a status symbol? She spoke with an unsettling confidence like Madam Adrastea had, 157, you will be joining 114 and 115 on a trip to town. We were both expecting the worst when it came to our orders, so, without even looking, I could tell that Chris was relieved when he found out that all he had to do was sell some drugs to the townspeople. It made me jealous but also gave me some hope as to the extremity of my own task. She turned toward me, 158, speak with Overseer Jein on level 3 of the mines. You will be collecting and solidifying the material. *Wait What? Did she just send me to work at the ever-infamous Dweller Mines? I thought this was just a processing plant?* After almost shitting my pants, I nodded and began walking to the elevator building. My new, updated understanding of this encampment is that the top level - the one that I was just on  is the processing facility that Ger and his people mentioned. What they failed to mention, though, was that there were 6 more levels below it that made up what they refer to as the Dweller Mines. I could hear muffled screams and sobs of agony from level two as the elevator descended past it. I jumped back in fright as the elevator dinged, quickly looking around to make sure that no one saw my moment of vulnerability. Level three was the same size as level one, but much taller in height. Toward the very back of the rectangular cavern, I could see a large metal cage with some creature the size of a 3-story house inside of it. The beast was too far away to determine what it was, but I was soon going to find out because to the right of it was a sign that read COLLECTION AREA. *Fuck.* The first quarter of the cavern was occupied by large machinery and people dressed in lab coats. I noticed that they had pointy ears, much like the scientist that Ger sent us to. The second two quarters of the room were simply composed of two incredibly long stone tables on each side of the walk-way that I was on. Sitting at the tables, shoulder-to-shoulder, were hundreds of emaciated slaves hacking away at these small white and pink rocks that were about the size of my head. Other slaves (or recruits, Im not sure what they were), were running back and forth, collecting the ground-up pink stone and bringing it to the lab technicians. None of them seemed to acknowledge my existence  they just continued to chip at the rocks with their mini ice picks. A loud buzzer coming from the area with the beast almost made me trip over my feet. A moment of deathly screams filled the cave, followed by the mangling of flesh and finally a loud bird-like screech. And then, silence, once again. Everything about level two began to click as I approached the beast and realized what it was. Inside the cage was a fucking chicken the size of a Tyrannosaurus. Instead of feathers, its pink, veiny skin was decorated in dried blood, scabs and scars. The four talons that protruded from its feet were serrated like a steak knife and had chunks of flesh stuck between the blades. It waddled around the cage as it pecked at the corpse of the man who was just served to it. Standing by some computers was a man who I assumed to be Overseer Jein, so I approached him and told him what the Lady said. In a commanding voice he said, You wait for the egg to drop down the chute. Pick it up, place it in the solidifying machine to my right. Once its ready, take it to one of the Roaches and log their ID number  its on the back of their head. He handed me a clipboard and pointed toward the collection chamber. There was already an egg waiting there for me. I carefully lifted the egg out of the chute, ignoring the intense heat permeating off it that nearly burnt my hands, and carried it over to the machine that the Overseer pointed at. The shape of it was similar to an old photocopier machine, but it was made of the same ruby glass that the elevator building was (and several other less noteworthy buildings). I lifted the top off and set the egg in a head-sized clamp. Thankfully, there was just one big green button for me to press after closing the lid, so I didnt have to do any guessing. The solidifying process took about thirty minutes, even though I had no way of telling time. The machine whirred and buzzed loudly during the entire duration though; my ears continued to ring as I delivered the newly solidified egg to one of the slaves, whom the Overseer referred to as Roaches. Maybe their minds are weaker than those of recruits? Who knows. I walked down the line until I found an elderly man who had just handed off a bowl of shattered monster fetus to one of the scientists. I tapped him on the shoulder and placed the egg down in front of him. I wanted to ask if he was okay  I wanted to so badly. I wanted to free all these people. But there was only one way to do that, and that was the patient way. I looked at the back of his head in search of a tattoo, but instead saw a large, old scab of the number 1347. As I wrote down the number, I was unsure as to whether I should include a comma between 1 and 3. Was it an ID, or was he really Roach number 1,347? I cringed at the thought. I continued this routine for the rest of the day. I dont know how many hours I spent there, but my hands were burned and pruned from transferring the unsolidified egg so many times. During all of this, I witnessed the brutal murdering of at least twenty-five people. The chicken monster was creative; it had to have had an intelligent mind because it never used the same exact method twice. One of the more brutal executions was when a young woman fell down the feed-chute and was still conscious. She cowered into the corner of the cage as the fowl monstrosity seemingly mocked her, pushing itself into the opposite corner. I couldnt imagine her fear, but I could hear it from her pleas for mercy; out of all the deaths I witnessed that day, I think hers will forever be etched into my memory. The chicken eventually hopped to its overly-long feet and began strutting toward the woman like a diva, in any other situation this would have been a comical sight, but there was nothing funny about how the beast decided to proceed. It charged her, causing her to slide down on to her back, after which the beast gouged two of its talons into her eyes and threw her body across the room with one swift kick. It then let out its signature screech and head-butted the womans head, smashing it to pieces like a rock smashing a watermelon. I cried to myself for nearly the entire night, that night. That woman still haunts me in my nightmares. Ill see her in normal, every day settings, like at a park or coffee shop. At one point, shell always turn toward me and start mouthing some words that I cant understand. Ive gotten good at waking myself up at this point, but if the dream continues, often her eyes will start bleeding and shell begin to chase me  you know, the stereotypical bad dream. Before I wept myself to sleep, though, I reconvened with both Chris and Ger. Chris was already in our room when I had gotten off my shift, just staring at the wall. Fuck, man. What a day. How was selling drugs to the crazy townspeople, you lucky piece of shit? He groaned, It could have gone better. Chris paused for a moment as he continued to stare at the wall, I saw them, man. I saw them. Theyre here. They were walking with some Dweller official. He inhaled sharply, I had to cover my face so they wouldnt see me, so I didnt get a great look But it was them, dude. It was them. Holy shit, youre serious? It was really them? Ill call Ger. Well find those tunnels and get them out of here. Chris grunted as he hesitantly rolled over to his side, Okay, man. Let me know In the morning. Im going to sleep now. Something wasnt right, Whats going on dude, whats up with you? What happened today? The sale went bad. What do you mean The sale went bad? Are you hurt? What happened? I turned Chris over from his side to see him clutching his hip. He had a pretty large gap from where he had been grazed by a bullet; his pant legs were soaked in blood and I could now see that he was sweating profusely. Oh shit, Chris, what the fuck!? Why didnt you say anything?! Its not a big deal. It didnt even go through, just grazed it. Ill be fine. Like hell you will. I grabbed my crystal from its holster and contacted Ger. Child, how was your first day at camp? He chuckled. No time for jokes, Ger. I never thought that Id be the one telling him that. Right. Fill me in. I told him about the chicken beast, about the woman, about how I was pissed that they didnt mention we were in the *god damned Dweller Mines*, about our friends and about Chris getting shot. He waited patiently for me to finish before responding, I think you can help your friend. My father has had a lot of practice in the medical aspects of our crystal technologies; I want you to contact him in the same way that you contact me. Hes in the room with me as we speak, so I will inform him of what you are doing. Uh Okay, then what? Im just gonna heal Chris with magic? How the hell do these crystals work Now thats a long explanation. But yes. I dont like the term magic, but call it what you will. Since the bullet just caused a gash, you should be able to cauterize it to stop the bleeding. What about Ryan and Kyle? Yes, Ryan and Kyle. Continue avoiding them for now, I am leaving tonight to visit with Elias to be updated on his research. I will let you know of the progress that he has made, child. Yeah, thanks. Now, these tunnels, where will we find them? I want to get this done now. Ill have more precise information in the morning, but our sources believe that there is a tunnel shaft somewhere on level 6 that used to act as a back entrance, but has been long abandoned. The Council is going to discuss our best course of action, but my assumption is that you will need to travel minds like you did at the Ladies compound to find the blueprint, and then go from there. Veira says she has some suggestions, though, so I will need to hear her out before verifying it with you. Alright, Ger. Sounds good. Stay brave, child. Talk to you soon. I released my grip from the crystal, took a couple deep breaths and closed my eyes, this time thinking of Haesteus. After the all-to-usual ringing noise, I hear Gers father ask, Hello? Boy? You there? I laughed, Yes, sir, Im here. Ger said you have a new technique for me to help my friend? Ha! No need to call me sir, my dear boy. I consider you and your friend as my peers, so please, call me Haesteus or Hae. Okay, Haesteus. I didnt like the idea of calling him Hae. He then, in his spirited and audacious manner, taught me a new breathing sequence that eventually resulted in me using the crystal as a soldering gun. I thank him and we said our goodbyes. Turning over to Chris, I began to devote all of my focus on him until his wound was the only thought on my mind. As I did this, I felt energy flowing from my fingertips into the crystal, just as Haesteus described. I figured that him being asleep worked in my favor, I knew he would struggle if he was awoken. I let the last bit of ether leave my body and carefully turned Chris over to his side. I took the crystal, now filled with air bubbles, in one hand and grabbed my pillow with the other, placing it over his face to muffle the screams. I muttered Sorry under my breath and pressed it down as hard as I could on the wound. *Good thing I covered his face.* *** [Part 20](URL (Thank you for being so patient!!!) *** All parts: [1](URL | [2](URL | [3](URL | [4](URL | [5](URL | [6](URL | [7](URL | [8](URL | [9](URL | [10](URL | [11](URL | [12](URL | [13](URL | [14](URL | [15](URL | [16](URL | [17](URL | [18](URL "
212,vulnerability,nosleep,They Caught Me In the Jungle,165,6mhua4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6mhua4/they_caught_me_in_the_jungle/,2017-07-11 08:07:07,"I dont often talk to people about my life before I turned 13. People just dont get it. When you tell them your parents were missionaries they just assume you grew up in a church in another country and lived a normal life. Once you try to tell people about the bad shit that has happened they never treat you the same again. I have a right to tell this story though, so here I am, posting it in secrete, just to get it off of my chest. I was only 3 when we moved to the jungle. Being so young made it easier on me I suppose, since I really had no memory of America while growing up overseas. Life wasnt all bad those first few years. My parents started a small church and worked hard to help the locals with their medical needs. It was when I turned 12 that things got bad. That was the first year that I was old enough to go with my parents to the week long camp they held during the dry season for local youth. It was comprised of bible classes and occupational classes that tried to give kids a trade skill so that they could have a chance to make a better life for themselves and their future families. I was scared when I got on that rickety old church bus. It smelt of diesel and body odor and the outlines of painted over graffiti could still be seen on the walls and ceiling. I was pretty shy and only comfortable with the kids my age that lived in my own village, so stepping onto a bus full of teenagers filled me with anxiety. I quickly choose a seat out of the way in the very back of the bus. The trip to the campsite takes about 4 hours from where the church was located and there is nothing on the road between the two. When I say nothing I mean nothing. No gas stations (we had to bring extra gas for the trip back), no houses, no businesses of any kind. Indoor plumbing or not people still have to go when they have to go so we made a bathroom stop about halfway through the trip. My mother escorted the girls into the bushes on the right side of the road and my father took me and the boys into the jungle on the left side. I dont blame my parents for what happened next. There were over 60 kids and only two of them to manage it all. Its not their fault that I tend to wander as I daydream (and I was always day dreaming). So I dont blame them for not noticing when I wasnt on the bus and for leaving me behind in the jungle as they continued on towards camp. I have no idea how much time passed before I snapped out of my intricate fantasy world and realized that they were gone, but I began to panic as soon as I did. Real life is not like the movies, just because I had grown up in South America didnt mean I knew anything at all about surviving in the jungle. Even the locals from the small towns dotted throughout the plains that had lived there for a hundred generations or more had a very healthy apprehension of the wilderness. You are probably wondering why I was so panicked. The sensible thing to do was to wait by the road until my parents noticed my absence and came back looking for me. The problems is that I wander when I daydream. I had no idea what direction I had wandered or for how long. When I had these episodes they were closer to sleepwalking than to what most people think of as daydreaming. I didnt even know what direction to travel to get to the road. I did however know that there was only a few hours left until dark. I said a quick prayer, picked a direction, and started off into the unknown. An hour and a half later I sat down to catch my breath. The humidity was terrible and the jungle was so dense that my progress was excruciatingly slow. Movies show the jungle as this noisy place, full of crying birds and animals, but in reality it can be deafeningly quiet. Loneliness amplifies fear. I cried. I knew my dad would be disappointed if he could see me bawling but I didnt know what else to do. I cried loudly with disregard to my surroundings. The tears made my face sticky and reminded me just how thirsty I was. My mourning stopped abruptly. With my head still down and eyes still closed I felt sheer terror well up into my soul. It was like being face to face with the kind of evil things that make your shudder when you hear about them on the news. When I finally looked up, there was a man standing before me, in complete silence watching my every move the way a wild cat watches an unfamiliar new threat. Relief washed over me. I know that in developed countries children are warned to be wary of strangers, but in the small villages I had known all of my life everyone worked as a community. Everyone took care of everyones kids. So even though nothing made sense about this man suddenly appearing in the middle of the jungle at the set of night my young brain inherently went into trust mode. Please help me, I dont know where I am. I need to get back to the road and find my parents. I spoke this of course in Spanish. Having grown up there that was really my first language just as much as English. His eyes were still locked on mine, face unemotional and unchanging as he replied back to me. I couldnt understand a word that he said. That was the moment that it hit me. He had hardly any clothes covering his body. He was in the jungle at night and he didnt speak Spanish. He wasnt the locals I had grown up with, he was a Quechua Indian. One of the few tribes that still lives in the Amazon jungle. I stifled my fear as best as I could as I remembered the stories told in the villages of these fierce people. At that moment I lost all hope that I would ever see my family again. They would never find me or my body. He began calling out, his voice echoing loudly throughout the jungle. Soon more like him came, with spears and blow dart guns. I wet my pants as they circled around me. I felt a painful prick in my lower back just before everything went black. When I awoke it was still night. Whether it was the same night, I do not know. I was on the ground laying on my side with both hands tied behind my back. I struggled to move my legs but was hit with a wave of pain. I looked down to find six wooden hooks with barbs buried into my ankle and connected to a rope that was tied to a stake in the ground. I was naked and there were Quechua all around me gathered in a circle. I remember in that moment my strongest emotion was not fear of death, but the embarrassment of being nude. It was a feeling of utter vulnerability that terrified me more than the pain in my ankle. A little ways before me was a fire with a large tortoise shell suspended over it. There was some kind of liquid in it that was bubbling and boiling. The smell coming from it almost made me vomit. The only way I can describe it is to say it was like rotten seafood. It was quiet and no one said a word. Someone noticed that I was awake and whispered it to a man who was painted and tattooed more than the others. He had wooden shanks pierced in dozens of places on his body and there was a crudely carved cross hung around his neck. I think he was their tribal priest. He had a piece of cord tied around his waist and shrunken heads adorned with bright bird feathers hung down from it. Those former human faces appeared to be staring at me, grimacing with delight. He walked over to me and I whimpered in fear as he kicked me in the stomach. I doubled over in pain and rolled onto my back. He spoke a few words to the others then went and stood by the fire. Moments later a young woman appeared. Age is hard to estimate with tribal people but I would guess she was in her early 20s. She came near me and crouched down. I cried out in fear and tried to turn away from her but could not because of the hooks. She quietly shushed me like a mother would a fevered baby and began stroking my head. I relaxed. I had no choice. Though my body was just stepping into puberty my childish instincts were still very much alive and even intensified during this crisis. What happened next is hard to talk about for many reasons. Some of it is difficult because of how much it hurt me. Some, because I know most of you wont believe me. She began by kissing my forehead, then moved down to my lips. I tried to fight it, to make it stop, but she persisted regardless of my fighting, which wasnt much due to my exhaustion. I could smell the stench of urine and unwashed odor emanating from every poor. I could feel her rotting teeth brush against me lips. My twelve year old mind raced with confusion. What had started as motherly comfort had become erotic arousal. It was passionate kissing, kissing I had never even conceived much less experienced in my isolated life. I felt myself get fully aroused as her hand found my exposed crotch. I wanted to stop it, to make it go away but I couldnt. She then moved down and began preforming oral sex on me. It was one of the worst moments of that night. Feeling pleasure from something that was so forced and unwanted tormented me. When it was finally over, after what felt like an eternity, she walked over to the fire and spat the contents of her mouth into the shell that held the liquid. Instantly the boiling stopped and the liquid grew calm. The shell was removed from the fire and drained into a wooden cup. It was thick and black like blood from an infected wound. I was stunned. I was unable to process what had happened and what was happening now. I felt dead inside. The Quechua began to chant. Not like Indians in western movies but like old Gregorian monks from the middle ages. It was low and guttural, stretching out and falling back in on itself over and over again as though it would outlive eternity itself. A pregnant woman approached the priest and got on her knees before him. He dipped his hand into the cup and chanted words as he sprinkled it onto her face then on her belly. She then tilted her head back and opened her mouth as the priest poured the remaining liquid down her throat. No sooner had the cup emptied she let out a scream and fell on her back. She started convulsing violently. The priest quickly removed her loin cloth and spread her legs. I had never seen a woman nude before. I had never witnessed a birth. The priest took a knife that looked like it was made from black glass and cut her down there. I watched in horror as the head began to crown, but not a human head. It was a goats head. It was now that the tribesmen in the circle began shouting and running and dancing in frenzied ecstasy. The woman couldnt stop screaming and I could smell blood and human waste wafting through the air. Then just as suddenly as the frenzy started it stopped. Silence resumed. I opened my eyes and saw a human baby with a goats head laying on the ground. The woman was still and unmoving, I could see that her chest was not rising and falling anymore. The goat monster crawled upon the woman nuzzling around with its mouth. It found her breast, and proceeded to tear it off and feast on it. Fat and blood dripped from its beard as it gorged itself. The priest walked over and looked me in the eyes as he spoke. I know he wasnt speaking Spanish, but somehow I could still understand his words. My next memory was waking up in the hospital in Lima. My parents were there and explained to me that a local fisherman had found me passed out and floating in a dugout canoe down the river. I was unable to answer their questions about how I had ended up there, and I never told them what happened to me with the Quechua natives. Looking back, I wish I had. I could have prevented the terrible things that happened after that night. I laid there, struggling to forget the words the priest had spoken so clearly to me: You are cursed for life, you are bound for eternity "
213,vulnerability,nosleep,Night Vision,34,6nreqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6nreqq/night_vision/,2017-07-17 16:37:16,"As it usually goes in the summer, my friends and I go exploring. The days get longer, the nights get warmer, and everything really feels at the peak of life. Because of our schedules this summer we can only meet up after 9pm, and that's when it's already dark. So, we've took up a new hobby and started exploring the abandoned buildings around here. I live in the suburbs but a 10 minute drive leads to the outskirts of town where a lot of dilapidated buildings were left to rot. We already explored one old house that was owned back in the 1950's but was abandoned due to never really being repaired. I guess the owner never got to sell it. It was filled with graffiti, broken glass, and seemed to have a few hobo nests. Sadly we found nothing exciting. This time was different though. I didn't know it yet, but it would be something that would stay with me for the rest of my life. Something that would make me no longer comfortable in my faith that nothing exists beyond our state of content in human existence, the thought we are truly alone. We had found the perfect place to go exploring; it was a little farther out from the city and a little more exciting. An old abandoned factory that had been forgotten placed down a country road in the middle of the woods. It really raised the creepy factor and honestly intrigued me. One of my good friends, Matt, wanted to bring his new camera to test out the night vision. Even though none of us really believed, it was exciting to think we could possibly catch a ghost on camera. My other friend Alicia invited her friend who I'll call John. We packed up our bags, whatever camera equipment, flashlights, and first aid kit in case something happened (you never know in those old places). It was a sunny Friday; the night had turned into complete cloud cover, but the clouds glowed dimly from the full moon behind them which cast a foggy light over the night. Once we got there, the factory loomed up in front of us like a mass of dark, neglected history. It certainly looked haunted, much to our delight. Stepping out, we shined our flashlights and could see that most of all the windows had been shattered. Rust took it's hold on the metal surfaces, moss taking the brick. In it's own way it was beautiful. Not everyone thought so though, Alicia whined behind us the whole time. John looked on indifferently. Matt's eyes were that of a nerd's at comicon. Everyone gets an on-edge feeling in the dark, especially out in the woods. It's a sense of anxiety that has been ingrained in us from many years of evolution. My eyes eventually adjusted to the darkness and I felt less uneasy. We split up into 2 teams- John, Alicia, and I, then Matt and Scott. Matt's team went ahead because he was eager to set up his camera. My team laundered on slowly. This is important to remember. When we finally went inside, our foot steps echoed loudly in the wide rooms. Decay was a smell that filled my nose. The darkness inside the building was intense, the only way we could see was with the flashlight. Most of the time passed in conversation between Alicia and I. John seemed quiet and shy. I shined the flashlight around the room, then I spotted Matt's night vision camera securely hooked onto a rafter above us. I gave it the bird for good measure. For some reason our flashlight died, upon later inspection the battery was old. This is when all light was gone, there were no large windows in this room. We hadn't gone very far in though luckily, the dull glow of the light outside from the door ahead of us was easy to spot in contrast to the absolute pitch black that had enveloped us. All sense of sight was lost. I stumbled stupidly grasping for the wall. Every movement was timid, but that apparently didn't help, because I banged my toe on a piece of plywood. My toe burned with pain in my shoe and I probably cursed more than my mother. Matt and Scott's voice echoed dully deeper into the building. We all made it out though and I called for Matt to come around. It must have been about an hour that we were there. I saw Matt's flashlight before I heard him, and then watched from a distance as he unhooked the camera and came to us. We got in our car, laughter and the radio blaring the whole ride back. John was still quiet, but I didn't really pay much mind to him thinking maybe he didn't enjoy outings like this. I fell asleep that night with hopes for more adventures this summer, even a few hopes to become closer with Alicia. That is, until Matt called me bright and early at 8am with an obvious unsettled tone. This alarmed me as Matt was usually composed, daring, and kind of a bro. One of the first things he asked me was to call Alicia to check on her, and to ask her if she was with John. After I did this and confirmed that she wasn't, he told me to come to his house as soon as I could. Obviously I floored it and was at his house in less than 5 minutes. We all lived sort of close to each other. Since then I've moved away from that town, but I still remember how easy it was whenever we wanted to hang out. He called me into the basement and had his camera set up to his computer. Video from the night before was paused. Everything was in green and white hues. When I looked closer, I could see me with my flashlight, Alicia closely behind me, and John standing a few feet from us. I was confused but Matt just sat there tensely, pointed at John, and commanded me to watch. At first I was a little annoyed because it was 8am and if this was something dumb, so help me. As the video played, I watched my flashlight die. Now everything turned to dark green hues. We were more visible, our eyes looked dull and unseeing. I almost wanted to laugh at the clear look of fear on Alicia's face, but then I saw it. And the hairs on my neck instantly stood up. There was John, watching us from behind. His eyes were not unseeing like ours. They scanned the room nonchalantly, very bored as he looked that whole night. Then they found the back of my head. His facial expressions changed, from bored to predatory stillness. The transition made my heart clench in my upper chest. He followed the back of my head as I moved stupidly around, reaching for a wall. I could see nothing, but he could see me. His eyes were intense, his jaw clenched. Something looked wrong with his features, as if he was fighting with himself. As if he wanted to bash my skull in right then and there. Everything about him made me want to turn off the video, to pretend I didn't see it. My mind was struggling to make sense of it. I looked to Matt to see his facial expression, all he did was sit there staring at the feed with his mouth in his hand, his elbow rested tensely on the desk. I looked back and John was only a foot behind me. His eyes were huge, his lips parted, his features wild. I watched myself, not knowing he was there. I had no idea he had moved, I hadn't heard him. I hadn't sensed his face so close to mine in the solid blackness. It didn't even look like he was breathing. It looked like he wanted to reach out with his teeth and bite me, like he was about to become rabid. His neck was extended. It seemed almost painful. There was no way he could have saw in that darkness, but he did. It was clear that he could. Then just like that, he retracted his body. He put effort in being quiet as he backed up, leaning on the front of his feet like a predator. His body straightened. Then he slowly resumed his bored countenance and we exited the building. As we played the video back at least five times, I could hear Matt's voice on the head phones. Deep in the background you could hear him suggesting to Scott that they should turn back. And that's right when John moved away from me. As I sit here typing this all out a year later, I've stopped wrestling with the part of my mind that wants to forget. I still wrestle with the other part of my mind that makes me feel vulnerable in the darkness, and even in the day light I feel that something is right behind me, looking over my shoulder with that same expression as John. That afternoon we contemplated showing Alicia. She returned my call while I sat at Matt's house in utter disbelief. I asked her when the last time she saw John was and how she knew him. She said he went home right after they got back where they met up. She didn't seen him come or leave in a car, but saw him waiting in the parking lot of the store they designated. She hadn't known him for long. They met off of the internet, he was very polite and he asked to come along when she told him of our plans. He hadn't talked to her much the whole time, so she didn't try to stop him when he walked away from her to go home. She's never since talked to him, heard from him, or seen him around. He's remained inactive on the internet. All searches of his name and records come up to nothing in all states. Matt guesses that it was a fake name. The number he gave Alicia is disconnected. I've never seen or heard of him since. I've sat in the pure darkness only twice since then. Each time I've tried to make my eyes adjust, tried to see my hand in front of me. It was impossible. Each time my heart raced and I flicked on the light. Though it wasn't the darkness that brought me unease, but the feeling of vulnerability of what was staring right at me. "
214,vulnerability,nosleep,One Day Sarah's Sisters Went Missing,27,6e2yei,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6e2yei/one_day_sarahs_sisters_went_missing/,2017-05-30 07:17:22,"Have you ever caught the glimpse of something out of the corner of your eye? It had to have started about six or seven months ago. Let me start off by saying nothing strange had happened in our home leading up to this. We got married a year and a half ago and had been together two years prior to that. We both had the same circle of friends for many years so we had known each other very well before we made it official. All that to say, again, nothing strange had happened up to this point. Sarah and I had lived in a multitude of places; a handful of apartments, a rented home your typical fresh-out-of-college-and-still-poor type of living. When we got married, we decided to finally get our own home. Soon after the honeymoon we found a nice modern home to settle into. Certainly not an old house that had ghosts roaming around. Leading up to our marriage, I tried talking to Sarah about eventually starting a family. I quickly learned this was a bad idea. Sarah had a rough childhood. She had two identical triplet sisters. Thats not the hard part, although it certainly didnt make her life any easier. Right before their 8th birthdays, her sisters went missing. Their bodies were never found. In the many years Ive known her, thats as much as I got out of Sarah about her childhood. She didnt want to talk about it, and I respected that boundary. Despite the sensitivity of the subject of her sisters, she kept some old photos in a photo album and a picture of the three of them framed on our mantle. It was in a state park her family had stopped at on their way through Ohio. The sun was shining down through the trees, freckling their faces with the shadows of the leaves. They were sitting on a large tree trunk. Sarah was in the middle with her arms wrapped around her sisters on either side. They were all wearing bright colors, coats tied around their waist, smiling, and squinting against the sun. In the many years Ive known her, I had never even learned their names. Our home was huge. Four bedrooms and two bathrooms on two levels. At the time I remember thinking, How are we going to use all this space, but we found a way. When we were looking for homes, I had kept my eye out for room to accommodate family expansion. Not wanting to start another fight, I sold it as work and office space. We found this cozy abode tucked away on the edge of town. What really hooked me was the lush woods behind the house. I had envisioned our future little ones running back there, playing capture the flag or imagining they were explorers like Indiana Jones or Lara Croft. Thats what I would have done as a child anyway. The woods seemed to freak Sarah out. She never said so, but I could tell. The actual house was perfect and very affordable. Eventually she couldnt say no. It was a house we planned on staying in for years to come. Knowing I couldn't talk about starting a family, I tried to find a subtle way to try and get a dog. I figured it was a perfectly acceptable substitute to immediately starting a family, as well as serving as the cliche litmus test to whether or not we were ready for kids. I finally got the guts to ask. Naively, I had said, Now that we have our own home, what would you think about getting a pet? Like what? Sarah asked. You know I'm not really a cat person, I said. What if we got a dog? There's plenty of yard for a puppy. Were not getting a dog, she said quite seriously. Oh, come on, I said playfully. Even just a tiny- We are not getting a dog, she said. She was absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, dead serious. She closed the book she was working on, and left the room. I got the silent treatment for the rest of the night. We never talked directly about starting a family. Instead, we carefully, dare I say elegantly, waltzed around it. Eventually it let to us going to the doctor, which at least meant Sarah was more serious about it than her words had implied. It was her idea to go in the first place. Looking back now, I think she just didnt want to jinx anything by actually saying something definitive out loud. Quietly, it happened. A period had been missed. A few days went by. Then a few more, until one day Sarah came out of the bathroom. Im pregnant, she whispered. Her eyes were fixed on the floor.. Oh my god, thats amazing! Im sure is what I said. It took a couple seconds, but finally Sarah smiled. I tried it on, like, 3 different sticks just to be sure, she said coyly. Were pregnant! I shouted. Dont get the wrong idea about Sarah, she was happy. Both of us were happy. We stole time away from grocery shopping at Target to go looking at onesies without actually buying any. We talked about birthing classes and how wed announce it to our families. As quietly as the pregnancy had happened, our happiness was overshadowed. I honestly think it started as small little cuts around my legs and arms that I paid no attention to at first. It was the beginning of spring and I had been outside doing yard work. It wasnt unreasonable that Id have mysterious scratches here and there. I started to notice that Id get more serious scrapes when I was working on the yard just outside the woods. I would be laying down fertilizer, and I'd get a cut on my ankle. I could be trimming the weeds, and I'd have a cut on the underside of my arm. These sorts of things never bothered me so normally I would have left them alone. For some reason, I just couldnt do that. I would pick at them, a habit I had broken several years before. Even Sarah asked why I wouldn't let them heal, and I couldn't give her an answer. One day I was raking up leaves left over from the previous years autumn and a stench wandered up my nose. After that, either consciously or subconsciously, I stopped working on that part of yard. Not long after I started seeing things out of the corner of my eye. It certainly didnt seem out of the ordinary, but it only ever happened at home. I think it was probably on a Sunday or a Monday when it really began. It was just the glimpse of something white. As soon as I looked at it, thered be nothing there. It happened several times and I thought nothing of it. There was one night I woke up to go to the bathroom. I was able to navigate just fine despite the low amount of light provided by the waning moon. I went to wash my hands, being careful not to look into the mirror. The mirrors at night always freaked me out. That and windows. One of those stupid fears. I always thought one day Id look at them and see something other than my reflection. Just to be safe, I thought it better just to avert my eye. That night, however, there was something making it hard not to look; a stark contrast to the otherwise pitch black of the bathroom. There was a white blur in the mirror, just at the corner of my eyes. I looked up just a little bit. There was a black shape in the sea of white that was quivering. It almost looked like it was talking. I turned off the faucet and listened. Outside there was a car passing by. In the distance a train blaring its horn. The wind kicked around, aimlessly. Underneath all that was a slight whisper. Two whispers, in fact. One to my left and one to my right. I couldnt overcome the feeling that I was being watched. I had to look. I lifted my head slowly and carefully to meet my reflection. Whatever was there was gone. My own tired eyes and withered face looked back at me with a look that made me feel stupid for being scared. Slowly then, my face began to contort. My nose became thin, my eyes became dark voids, and my mouth began to open. It kept going and going, opening wider and wider. Wider than I would ever be capable of. That shiver I had been suppressing stretched out its spindly legs and began to creep down the nape of my neck causing the little hairs there to stand on end. My eyes began to well up out of fear, and the shiver finally broke free sending tidal waves to my toes. I fought the incredible force keeping my eyes open and pinched them shut. Without opening them even a sliver, I leaped my way back into the bedroom and into bed. I kept them squeezed shut and laid there afraid I wouldnt be able to fall back asleep. Luckily, before long I was out cold. On Friday, I had been working in my office and I went to grab a glass of water. As I stepped through my office door way, I could have sworn I saw someone walking into the kitchen. Sarah? I called out. Are you home already? I didnt hear you come in. As I stepped into the kitchen I found I was alone. Sarah? I called out once more. My pocket buzzed so I pulled my phone out and read a text that said, Can you start supper? I might be home a little late. It was, of course, from Sarah. My feet wouldn't move. I stood there in the silence, waiting to hear something. I put my phone away and cocked my head to the side. Strangely, I could have sworn I saw a pale face with its mouth open, silently screaming, just in the corner of my eye. The skin along my spine tightened. I was too scared to look at whatever was there. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. It echoed through the hallway and rattled in my brain, reflecting my vulnerability back at me. I went out to the garage and grabbed a softball bat for protection. I looked through the house and found no intruders. Things began to get tense around the house. A flower pot would fall over and dirt would fly all over the patio. One day I went into my office and a bunch of books had been tossed all over the floor. An old doll, that should have been in storage, had been thrown out into the front lawn. It was one I had only seen a few times, usually only when we were moving. It had one button eye and a haphazardly stitched X where the other button should have been. Sarah was the one to find it. She became aggressive after that. Thats when she started blaming me. To be fair, we blamed each other. Wed enter the kitchen and all the pots and pans would be spilling out of the cupboards. Wed come home after being gone all day, and all the lightbulbs would be shattered. Pictures would be on the floor. It didnt matter what it was, wed blame each other. Even if it didnt make any sense whatsoever. Then night would come, wed forgive each other, and go to sleep. Shed blame her hormones. I still have no idea what my excuse was. Hormones, I guess. While all of this was going on I'd notice that large white shape out of the corner of my eye. Black circles where the eyes would be, mouth wide open. A cold shiver would sneak up my spine and the shape would be gone just as quickly as it came. To top it all off, I began sleepwalking again. I hadnt walked in my sleep since a couple of nights in college. The only times before that had been in my youth. Now at least once a week I was waking up on the couch or in my computer chair. Sometimes Id be on the floor next to my bed. One night I woke up in the middle of looking through the fridge. Another, while I was washing my hands. It left me tired in the mornings which only made the fighting more frequent. We powered through, but it was a very hostile living situation for a long time. One day they went missing. Sarahs sisters. We came home from dinner, and the picture on the mantle was knocked over onto the floor. Sarah was busy taking her coat off so I noticed before she could. I walked into the living room and picked it up off the floor. I flipped it over. It was just Sarah on that tree trunk, arms out on either side, hugging nothing. Hugging ghosts. Hugging the ghosts of her missing sisters. I wanted to say something, but a sense of dread tugged at me. It would start another fight, and at the very least ruin an otherwise joyous night. I sat it back up on the mantle and pretended it never happened. That night, I woke up to the sound of Sarah talking in her sleep. All I could hear were low whispers. I laid there for a few seconds with my eyes closed, thinking she was far away in dream land. A few minutes passed and the whispers never went away. I rolled over to face Sarah, opened my eyes, and found she was fast asleep. She must have been talking in her sleep. Except the whispers were still there and her mouth wasnt moving. I tried to roll over and closed my eyes. The whispers got closer. I nuzzled my head further into my pillow. The whispers were right next to me by now. If I didnt know any better, Id say I could even feel breath on my nose. I eased open my free eye. Sarahs face was inches from mine, off the side of the bed. I shot up in bed. My eyes darted around the bedroom. Whatever was there was gone. I looked over at Sarah, who was still securely asleep. She might have turned a little bit, but there she was. There wasnt a chance of me sleeping well that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I would see her face swimming the sea of colors cast on my eyelids. The whispers had stopped, so I was able to find comfort in that and managed to catch a few more winks. I woke up in the morning, understandably tired. Something else was off, but I couldnt figure out quite what it was. Sarah was already up and in the kitchen. I could hear her clanking around, more than likely getting breakfast ready. I rubbed the sand out of my eyes and joined her. As I came into the kitchen, she greeted me with a smile. She was standing up from the oven, having just put some cinnamon rolls in. I was rubbing my eye as a yawn snuck up on me. Just before I closed my eye to release the yawn, the tiredness seemed to give me double vision. There Sarah was at the stove, and there she was reflected in the darkened doorway to the laundry room. My face must have given away my confusion. Sarah interrupted my yawn. Whats the face for? She asked. Did you sleep alright? No, I replied. Neither did I. Keep dreaming about the woods. I looked out the glass door that lead to our backyard. The serene woods rested there. Birds were flying above it in the grey sky. The woods had gotten quite thick. I contemplated pruning some of the trees when I noticed next to the glass door were my nice shoes. They were absolutely caked in wet mud. Did you use my shoes? I asked Sarah. No, she said as she looked over to my shoes. Thats weird. She shrugged it off. Im making cinnamon rolls. You want the center one? Sure. We sat in the kitchen, eating our breakfast in abrasive silence. The type of silence that somehow manages to reverberate in your ears. That afternoon, Sarah left to go get some groceries. I weaseled my way out of having to go with her, but I was stuck with yard work. I went out to the garage to grab some work gloves and a trowel to do some deep weeding. I found my gloves without much trouble. I went to take my wedding ring off and realized what had been bothering me that morning. My wedding ring was missing. At the time, I thought I must have taken it off and set it on the bathroom counter or something. Luckily, I didnt have to wait long for that disillusion to be shattered. I put in headphones and went to work. I started on the side of our house and worked my way toward the backyard. The weeds were attacking our house like crazy. It took 30 minutes just to clear out the rocks and near the bricks holding the rocks in. Finally I turned the corner to the backyard and found a small scrap of paper laying in the yard. It was ripped off on two sides. I bent down to pick it up. In little grey letters, diagonal to the two clean-cut sides, it said, Kodak. I flipped it over to be met with a glossy picture of a tree trunk. I did a cursory look around the yard. I was alone. I looked back down at the photo, and noticed out of the corner of my eye another piece of paper a few feet away. I went and pick it up. This one was ripped on three sides. I saw two sneakered legs that looked like they belonged to an eight year old girl. Thats when I noticed a steady stream of more scraps lead from where I was to a small opening in the woods. I followed the trail, picking up each piece as I went. My feet kept taking me to the next piece and the next piece, despite my knowing I wouldnt like what I found at the end. That same sense of being watched I had felt so many times over the past few weeks returned to me. Every piece seemed to come from the same photograph, and I was pretty sure I knew which one. When I came to the final piece of the picture, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Sarah, I said as I popped out one of the ear pieces. I began bending down to pick up the picture. The hand slid off my shoulder. What the hell is... I looked back to get Sarahs take. It should be no surprise no one was there. Faintly, I felt the color drain from my face and my skin going cold. I picked up the final piece, and stood up to get a good look at it. Sarahs eight year old face looked back at me, expressionless. In the pile in my hands, there was surely a scrap of her arms wrapped around the ghosts of her sisters. A glint of something reflecting on the sun caught my eye. Down the grass, a small silver wedding band rested peacefully. I shoved the pieces of the photograph into my pocket, bent down to pick up the ring, and put it back on its rightful place. Coincidentally, as soon as I did that I felt an awful Charlie Horse on my left calf. I thought it was a side effect of standing up too fast after having done a bunch of weeding. That is, until I reached back to massage it and felt something wet. I retracted my hand. It was covered in blood. --- Sarah must have thought I was hysterical. She was bringing in groceries from the car when I came busting in the sliding glass door to the kitchen. What the flying hell? She exclaimed, not with anger, but with confusion. I didnt say anything. I stormed over to the mantelpiece, as well as I could. Blood was trailing down my leg, soaking into my sock. What the hell happened? Sarah screamed, now seeing the back of my leg. I continued to ignore her. Somehow, eight year old Sarah was safely behind the glass of the frame, smiling back at me. I snatched the photo off the mantle, and hobbled back to the kitchen. I threw it onto the kitchen table on my right. It slid a foot, but stayed on the table. Tears began to well up in Sarahs eyes. Honey, what happened? I reached into my pocket to grab the photo fragments I had found in the yard. I fumbled around for a little bit. I couldnt find anything. I reached into the other pocket. Nothing. Panicking, I went back to the first pocket. I pulled out the only thing I found there; a single scrap of glossy photo paper. I took a look at it. Eight year old Sarah. Just then, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, in the picture on the kitchen table. There was a white figure next to Sarah. I took a quick look at it. Nothing was there. Still just Sarah alone on that tree trunk. Look, is all I could say. What? she asked as I held up the picture frame, facing her. What did you do to that picture? Nothing. Is this some sort of sick joke? She was crying now. Did you Photoshop-- I didnt do anything, I said. I threw the picture back onto the table. Sarah began walking toward it, reaching out toward it with both hands. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw it again. Tell me about your sisters, I said as sternly as I could. I cant She said through her sobs. I recounted to her everything that had happened recently. The photo falling off the mantle, her missing sisters, why I couldnt sleep, the trail of photos leading to the woods. All the things I had seen out of the corner of my eye. The hand I felt on my shoulder. The blood on the back of my leg and stabbing pain that caused it. It was a long night after that. We left the house to get something to eat. Sarah admitted that hopefully being in public would keep her from crying so shed be able to tell me as much as she could. Even after a handful of hours, she didnt get much out. She did cry. When we got home, she retired to bed despite the sun still being out. I let her go, and let her know Id be up soon after her. Even though its not much, this is what I had learned: One was named Olivia, and the other Sophia. They were inseparable, the three of them. Identical in almost every way, except for a few things that helped their parents tell them apart. Olivia loved reading. Sophia loved the outdoors and animals. Their childhood wasnt exactly perfect. It wasnt awful either. Their parents were under a lot of financial strain; they weren't expecting to be parents to triplets. Eventually, their father made a steady life for them. 20 some years ago, they had finally moved out of a cramped 3 bedroom home into a spacious 4 bedroom home in a rural area. The girls were extremely excited. They would all finally have their own rooms. There were 2 full bathrooms, too. Most importantly, there were woods just beyond their backyard. Sarah says prior to finally moving in, her and her sisters talked about tree houses and exploring in the brush. Sophia was obviously the most excited about the woods. Any time they wanted to play out there, one of their parents would sit out back and watch. Their parents became less and less diligent about this as time wore on. The girls were growing up and smart enough to stay safe. A couple years went by, and every day theyd come home safely. One day they went missing. Sarahs sisters. This is where Sarah had a hard time getting through. It was a sunny weekend afternoon. Her parents were sitting inside, away from the heat. Her dad was more than likely flipping through channels, trying to hear over the vaccuum her mom had fired up. The girls were playing out back and decided to go exploring in the woods. There was an opening in the trees they hadnt explored yet, so they all agreed to start there. They quickly came to an impasse. There was a short trail leading into the woods, then the path branched off in two directions. Olivia wanted to go left. Sophia wanted to go right. For whatever reason, they went their separate ways. Sarah said she heard some sort of primal animal noise coming from the woods, and decided to back out. She high-tailed it back home. It was a decision she regretted for the next 18 years. I did some searching online that night and found some old news articles from Sarahs hometown near by. One article featured a picture of memorial flowers people had put outside of the woods. There were two large pictures on either side of the opening they had gone in. On one side was a picture of Sophia and Olivia on the other, both framed with flowers. The article was from a month after they went missing. It was a short article, outlining the memorial service held in their honor. Eventually I managed to find an article from a couple days after they went missing. It said the only thing they were able to find were two of their dolls. Both of them were dirty, and no fingerprints were found on them. The dolls had previously been in perfect shape, according to Sarahs parents in this article. When they found them, each one had one of their button eyes popped off and replaced with a crudely stitched X. Olivias had the left eye missing, Sophias the right. There wasn't much on the internet. After several hours of searching for articles, I was feeling sick to my stomach. For whatever reason, I decided to look at the mantle picture one last time. I turned my head to get the same peripheral view I had when it was on the kitchen table. Sure enough, there was a white figure to the right of Sarah. I looked back at it, and it was gone. I tried looking at it with the picture in the corner of my left eye. I had trouble swallowing for a second. Strangely, there was now a similar white figure to the left of Sarah. I stared back directly at the photo. Still just Sarah. I decided to throw out all hesitation and disbelief. Whatever was going on already didnt make sense. I raised my right hand and cupped it over my right eye. My entire breath escaped me and I nearly fell. In the photograph, Sarah was sitting on the tree trunk. Her right arm was wrapped around the ghost of her sister, her left arm around a clear and unmistakable Olivia. I uncovered my eye and cupped the other. Sarahs left arm was left vacant and her right arm wrapped around Sophia. It made no sense. I switched eyes a couple more times. Every time, it was either Sarah and Olivia and no one else, or Sarah and Sophia and nothing. The sight was surely silly. I didnt think so at the time. I began walking around the house with one eye cupped. Every so often Id switch eyes. I looked around the kitchen, the laundry room, my office, every corner of the house. I even looked out the kitchen door toward the woods to be safe. The only room left was our bedroom. I slid the door open slowly with my left hand, making sure to keep my right eye covered. Through the initial crack, I saw moonlight soaking in through the window, drenching Sarah in a soft blue hue. She was fast asleep. Even in the dim light, I could see mascara trails. I slid the door open a little further. At the foot of the bed, I finally saw her. A pale, wispy figure with a shape that reflected Sarahs. She was staring down at Sarah, silent. I didnt dare move for a minute, and neither did she. I took a shaky step into the bedroom. Her face slowly turned around to find me in the doorway. She had the same cheek bones as Sarah. The same ears and nose. It was a perfect reflection. That is, until I could see her whole face. As it all came into view, there was an unnatural void where her left eye should have been. Dark, tar-like streaks ran from the void and down her cheek. I felt my time running short, so I quickly switched eyes. Right next to where Olivia would have been was an identical figure with streaks running from the void where her right eye should have been. Her lips began to move. I switched eyes one last time. You still havent found us, Olivia whispered. I-Im sorry, is all I could muster. You should have left us alone, Sophia screamed so sharply I flinched. I opened both eyes and looked at the foot of the bed. For a brief second, I saw both of them, both Sophia and Olivia, coming toward me. They screamed, Get out! I flinched one last time as they both jumped at me. My body slammed into the door, trying to dodge the two of them. I looked around the room frantically to find that Sarah and I were alone. Honey? I heard from the bed. What are you doing? Im so sorry. Again, all I could muster. Neither of us slept well that night. That next morning, Sarah went missing. I woke up to a cold, lonely bed. I went downstairs to join Sarah for breakfast, but she wasnt in the kitchen. Sarah? I called out? There was no response. I searched all throughout the house, calling out her name. The house was completely empty, save for myself. I began panicking. I knew I should try to stay calm, but I couldnt. There was no note left, no text messages, there was nothing. I fumbled around the pocket of my pajama pants for my phone. With shaky fingers I eventually managed to find her name in my contacts. The call went straight to voicemail. I tried to call her several more times unsuccessfully. I slid my phone onto the kitchen table and sat down in the creaky chair in front of it. All I could do was stare at my phone. I tapped my dirty nails on the wood next to my phone while biting the nails on my other hand, wondering if I should call the police, go looking for her, or just wait for her to come home. After an eternity, my phone buzzed. It echoed through the wood of the table and caught me off guard. Ill be home soon, is all it said. I tried to distract myself, waiting for her return. I paced the living room for a while and chipped away at my nails with my teeth. I tried watching TV. Eventually, I wandered outside. There was a light morning fog leftover, hovering above the ground. I crossed one arm around my body to buffer my skin from the cold. My other hand was still between my teeth. The woods seemed to be calling me. Its all I could think of. I stayed away as long as I could, pacing the front yard. The neighbors must have assumed I had gone crazy. I was finally compromised by the pull of the woods. I couldnt ignore it any longer. Fog hugged the tree line. As I approached the woods, the wind melted away and bird chirps began to be replaced with a ringing in my ears. My feet found their way to the opening I had been lead to the day before. There was a hand on my shoulder. I ignored it. One foot stuck itself out to enter the opening. The hand pulled me back this time. I turned slowly on my heels. My heart leaped into my throat when I met the gaze Sarahs green eyes. I put my hands on her silky smooth forearms. She was holding a thin stack of papers between them tightly against her chest. I couldnt say anything. She reached up with one hand and grabbed mine. We walked back into the house together. I still didnt say anything, and neither did she. She sat me back down in the creaky chair I had spent most of my morning in. She put the stack of papers down in front of me and sat down in a different chair. I stared at the paper without actually reading it until my brain realized Sarah was trying to tell me something. I was at the library, she whispered. I picked up the papers and shuffled through them. Half-tone pictures and bold headlines on each page. I was able to get some microfilm prints from the library back home. TWO SISTERS GO MISSING, POLICE ASKING FOR ANY INFORMATION, the first headline read. The article was desperately asking for any witnesses or leads regarding the missing girls. Sprinkled throughout were heart-wrenching quotes from Sarah's parents. A police official was quoted with a confident and authoritative statement saying they would find the missing girls and bring justice to whoever did this. As I know now, they never found who did it. The sad reality was that there wasn't much evidence to work with. There was no evidence anyone was ever in the woods. Not even Sophia or Olivia, other than the dolls left behind. Sarah mentioned she didnt remember them even having those dolls that day. All the police managed to find down the right path was a few sets of paw prints. Down the other side was a thin pair of tire tracks. That was from the very next day, Sarah commented. I flipped to the next article. This one was dated a week and a half later. It was on Sarahs birthday. NO LEADS ON MISSING MATHESON GIRLS, read the headline. MATHESON GIRLS PRONOUNCED DEAD, read another. Apparently at some point two distinct eyes were found. The police found they were detached post-mortem and believed to belong to Sophia and Olivia. Thats when they were pronounced dead and the memorial service was held. The stack had plenty of articles as well as the ones I had found online the night before. There were a few more that added nothing of value. Puppy, Sarah said suddenly. What? Thats what Sophia said, Sarah continued. She had her eyes closed, as if she was going back to that day in her mind. Puppy. It was the last thing I heard her say. She wanted to go down the right path. Sarah finally opened up. She talked for two hours. I didnt say a word. There was a short path leading a few feet into the woods. Their feet crunched old leaves as they entered. They quickly came to the fork. It was completely silent that day. Not even any birds made a sound. No wind shook the trees. They stood in between the two paths and bickered over which way to go. Puppy! Sophia had suddenly shouted. She was looking down the right path with genuine enthusiasm in her face. Sarah followed her gaze and did not see a puppy. It was hard to make out what she was looking at. The path seemed to end in a small clearing, darkened by the foliage overhead. She did not see a puppy. Sarah saw a dog laying on the ground, not moving at all. Flies circled the corpse. Some birds had apparently pecked at its eyes. There was a dark cavity in its chest, lined with an ugly green color, exposing the dog's rib cage. Sophia ran off, down the path. Sarah reached after her, but not before Olivia had scared her with a squeal of excitement. Did mom and dad finally get me a bike? Olivia asked in disbelief. Sarah turned her attention away from Sophia who was already halfway down the path. Down the left path she saw a decrepit, old bike. The back tire was flat and the front tire was missing. It was being held up at an angle with its one remaining training wheel. Coming from the handlebars were short streamers. They were once full of color, but now they were sun bleached and covered in mud. Olivia sprinted down the path toward it anyway. Sarah didn't know what they saw, but it certainly couldn't have been the same thing she saw. That's what she implied, and rightfully so. Sarah was frozen in place. She had heard that guttural noise, coupled with an unbearable stench. So she backed out of the woods and ran home. Her parents rushed out to the woods. By the time they got there, Sophia and Olivia were gone. There was no dog. There was no bike. So what do we do? I asked. My voice cracked. My throat had gone completely dry. She thought about it for a while. She was holding something back. Any ideas you have cant be any more ridiculous than what has already happened, I reassured. I mean, we try to help them, right? she asked rhetorically. Try to help them let go? Thats the prevailing theory on ghosts right now, I half joked. Sarah didn't react. ""On spirits, I mean."" I paused and looked at Sarahs blossoming stomach. They told me to get out. I think they want me to leave you three alone. You... four. I dont care, Sarah said. Maybe I should leave for a couple days and see if things get any better, I suggested. I dont want to be here without you. Its only a couple days-- Or we can just figure out how to live in peace the right way. I thought back to the many restless nights Ive had. The sleepwalking that left me groggy. The faces I had seen. Mostly, I just wanted to get a good nights sleep. I couldnt blame Sarah for not wanting me to leave her here alone. I stood up from the table. My calf still hurt. I began to pace around, and my hands assumed their nervous positions, still familiar from earlier that day. I began to chew on my nails. I couldnt figure out how they managed to get so dirty, despite using gloves when I did yard work. There wasnt much else that would have trapped so much grime. Oh shit, I mumbled. The words sort of dribbled off my lips like drops of water. --- By the time Sarah caught up to me, I was already at the opening in the woods chewing my nails. I had bolted out so quickly, and she was so concerned, the kitchen door was still open. What the hell do you think youre doing? she shouted after me. I told her about those restless night, the sleep walking, and everything they had said to me. They werent trying to haunt us, they were trying to show me. Sarah thought about it for a bit, then finally asked, Why would they hurt you? How would I know? I responded. They didnt have many other ways of communication until I found them. Maybe they were trying to tell me that they were here and they were hurt. Or maybe Sophia just doesnt like me. I gave a half smile to try and dissolve the tension. It didnt work. Sarah stayed far away the woods as I went in. I made it a few feet in before I came to a fork in the path. I looked down both ways, but both seemed identical. They were probably fifty feet long with barely any light. Before I knew it, my feet were taking me down the right path. A knot was beginning to form in my stomach. The thought of actually finding something down there was just as frightening as finding nothing at all. The darkness crept further and further down my neck with every step I took. My hands were shaking and my forehead broke out into a cold sweat. I was trying my best to ignore the whispers that now flanked me on both sides. I was trying my best to ignore the tears in my eyes. The clearing was quickly approaching. My chest tightened. I couldn't breathe. I could make out a small dirt patch that had recently been clawed at, presumably by my own boney fingers. I immediately dropped to my knees and began furiously clawing at the dirt. A tear managed to escape my eyes, and before I knew it both had swelled up to the point I could barely see. After a few large scoops, my finger tip scraped against something rough. I couldn't see what it was, but I managed to pull it out of the dirt. When my eyes finally cleared I was able to see in my hand was a lonely, slender, and pale bone. That day, they went missing. Sarah's sisters. The cops were in our backyard for hours. Eventually they had dug up two full skeletons with thin, small frames. After weeks of investigation, no one could tell us how they had gotten there in there first place. Our home has been peaceful since that day, and our lives are returning to normalcy. Sarah has opened up more about her childhood from time to time. There are so many happy stories I never got to hear before. The sad stories are still tough, but not as tough as they had been before. We found out we aren't just having one baby, but three. I should have expected that from the beginning. They'll be here in just a handful of weeks, and I couldn't be more excited. After all we've been through in the last few months, I finally feel confident that I'm bringing them into a safe and loving home. Except just now, I could have sworn I caught the glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye. ----- [More Stories](URL "
215,vulnerability,nosleep,Soiled Socks and Fingernail Fungus,22,6em4gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6em4gp/soiled_socks_and_fingernail_fungus/,2017-06-01 21:31:07,"I was able to dismiss the disturbances at first. Everyone hears the house creak at night. And who doesnt misplace things from time to time? Its natural for socks to disappear from the laundry. As a thirty-year-old male, I didnt really have a strong sense of *vulnerability,* so to speak. It simply didnt cross my mind to think that I my privacy was something that anyone else wanted to violate. So I never entertained the thought that it was anything unusual. For a while. The whiskey was disappearing unusually fast. It was a pretty good Balvenie, so I knew before cracking it open that it would be gone quicker than Id like. But it was like a ghost was stealing it. We all know that toilet paper runs out faster near the end of the roll. But the last time that I had to waddle down the hall, soiled asscheeks clenched tight, to find a fresh roll, I knew something was off. Because it was the third time that week I had to do the brownie-batter shuffle. One of the strangest things was the fart scent. We all pretend not to smell it in polite company, then silently predict who was responsible. But the guessing game is so much *harder* when you live alone. The final straw came when I when to pour some Frosted Flakes, only to have that awful powdery shit fill my bowl. I had opened the box earlier that day. Something was up. So I had my friend Eric help me place some video cameras around the place. If rats were getting in, I had to know how. Although why would rats be stealing my toilet paper? And whiskey? I let them roll for an entire day while I was at work. That was Wednesday. That was yesterday. Eric had showed me how to watch several screens at the same time on my desktop monitor. I got home around 7:00 p.m., poured a bowl of Frosted Flakes from a fresh box (now half-empty), and settled in to see if it was rats, ghosts, or my sanity that was plaguing me. It only took a few minutes to find out. I decided to fast forward through the first hour or so after Id left for work. Nothing happened during that time. At 10:31 a.m., I noticed something. Everybody has at least one closet in their home that they pretty much never use. You know the one  whether its Halloween decorations or the 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle that you have no intention of ever attempting, everyone has a cavalcade of shit that needs both a home and a purpose, but only gets one. And into the closet it goes. Imagine my surprise when the closet door opened on its own. At first, I thought we were dealing with a poltergeist-type situation. But when I saw something crawl out from the inside, my mind switched to The Ring. Whatever shimmied out of there had long, scraggly, unkempt hair. I couldnt see much of its face. Then it got to work. My Frosted Flakes  consumed. The Balvenie  downed straight from the bottle. Toilet paper, and toilet to boot  befouled. Though the entity didnt wash its hands. Of all the things it had taken, the only one I wished it would use was the one it passed up. Bastard. But there was more. It kept peering into the strangest corners. It looked as though it was fiddling with some sort of gadget, but I couldnt see anything clearly. I was glued to the monitor at this point. My rational mind was shocked into submission; I had no way to process what I was seeing. I developed a new sensation of vertigo when it walked into my bedroom. I switched my attention from one screen to the next so that I could watch what it had done here. It walked to the desk where I was sitting. And it fiddled with the house plant that I have right next to the monitor. I made a sudden grab for the plant. Was there something to find? No way. Impossible. And I found nothing. But then I found something. It was a tiny electronic device. Extremely small. I didnt recognize it. Unless - could it be? Once the thought crossed my mind, I became certain that it was a camera. I called the police immediately, of course, and had Eric come over as well. We all sat down like it was movie night, and watched the insanity unfold. By the time it was over, it had become clear that the entity was not a ghost of any kind. It was simply a man. A dirty one. With a scraggly beard that prevented a clear view of his face. And yes, he was placing cameras. At the end of the video, one of the officers  Reddick was his name, a guy younger than I am  got extremely serious with me. How long did you say this has been going on? he asked. Uh. Hard to say. Ive been dismissing a lot, not really thinking about it. A few months, maybe? He looked grim. You do realize whats missing in the video, right? I looked back at him confusedly. Theres no footage of this guy leaving the apartment. It didnt take long to find him when we new what we were looking for. The unused closet in my apartment is beneath the stairs, so it actually goes back pretty deep. He had been sleeping in the nook; the cops roused him, and he stumbled bleary-eyed into the hall. I realized that the errant fart smells were likely a mixture of the mans B. O. mixed with his actual flatulence. He looked at me with bloodshot eyes and grinned. Despite him being taken away, no sense of comfort has returned. You see, I just got back from the police station. They were able to figure out what he was doing pretty easily; he had a lot of digital evidence on him. Thats how they found the websites. Remember how I told you that I never felt vulnerable since I was a guy? It turns out that I should have been a little timid. He had been filming me for months. I was the subject of a 24-hour online info feed, but subscribers could pay to get the daily highlights package. It was the strangest shit. People loved footage that completely blew my mind. Every piss and bowel movement was on there, with camera zooms on the wiping. They *loved* it when I clipped my nails. And it turns out that we make the oddest twitches and body movements when we think were alone. They went wild for that. My missing socks and used dental floss were given special attention; they later reappeared on craigslist. Every zit popping was collected on a best of video. But of course, the most popular clips were the masturbation. Every time I had beaten off in the past three months was catalogued and filed by sound, duration, and facial expression. Thats what the camera in the plant was for. Plus half a dozen others that I found when I got home. I dont feel safe in my apartment anymore. But I cant leave, because the feeling of unease is going to follow wherever I go. Its inside my mind now. So please, if you hear anything unusual when youre alone at night, just remember. Theres a good chance its not the house settling. "
216,vulnerability,nosleep,The Scalp of Rabid Wolf,8,66ebxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/66ebxs/the_scalp_of_rabid_wolf/,2017-04-20 10:34:56,"The Scalp of Rabid Wolf Of the early days of the world, after our ancestors crossed the Berring Straight and millenia before any of the tribes we know of today existed, very little is actually remembered. Sure, there are tales of the beginning of Man, and of the Earth, but those are but fables legends told to explain what was then unexplainable. This, however, is not a fable, but a story. A story probably distorted by time, but at its core true nonetheless. It is in these murky depths of history that the story begins, more than ten thousand years ago. It was in a large depression west of the Appalachians, in what is now known as middle Tennessee, that the tribe of the Utlavgitle resided. At one time the leader of a great alliance of tribes, their expansive influence had long since been shattered, and they were now nothing but mere ghosts of their former selves. For generations, they had been oppressed by the surrounding larger tribes, forced by threat of annihilation to make frequent payments to them. Rabid Wolf was known far and wide as an exceptional warrior of one of those outlying tribes. He himself was something of a living legend at the time, seen almost as a living demon. It was said of him that his eyes blazed with black flames, that he drank blood for water, and that as a child he had carved his own heart out with a knife, leaving a grizzly hole in its place. Needless to say, Rabid Wolf was a fearsome warrior with little regard for any ethics or morality. As such, he one day found himself in an argument with the chieftans son, which ended with the death of the son, and, consequently, with Rabid Wolf being banished from the tribe. He tried to go to the other tribes, but none would have him save the Utlavgitle. Upon being accepted into his new home, an idea occured to him, one that would not only benefit him, but also the people of the tribe. The Utlavgitle, though heavily oppressed, were plentiful in numbers, and Rabid Wolf thought that with the right kind of leadership, it would be possible for them to reclaim their power from years before, and if he were to be the one to do it, then he could also enact his revenge upon his former tribe. His plan was not without risk, however, and Rabid Wolf knew this and perhaps understood it better than anyone. The lands of the Utlavgitle were surrounded by less-than-friendly tribes who were united in their oppression of the Utlavgitle, and could easily squash them like maggots if they so pleased. So he made a proposal to the chief, who knew well of Rabid Wolfs skill in battle: let him conduct a series of mock wars within the tribe, with the chieft leading one side and Rabid Wolf leading the other. If Rabid Wolf should win ten out of thirteen of these mock wars, and each time convince the captured warriors to willingly fight for him, then Rabid Wolf should be allowed to lead the Utlavgitle into war to claim the territories of the surrounding tribes in real war. The chief agreed, and not only did Rabid Wolf win all of the mock wars, but each time only the chieftan was left standing against Rabid Wolfs men, as all of the others had been successfully convinced to join his ranks. Having passed with flying colors, Rabid Wolf immediately became the second in command, and, after many months of preparation, led the warriors of the Utlavgitle out to reclaim the honor that had been stolen from them decades before. Once they set out, they quickly began to gain their former territory quickly. Despite the lack in numbers of the Utlavgitle warriors in comparison to their enemies, under Rabid Wolfs leadership, they soon became unstoppable in numbers and skill. Within five years, it is said, the Utlavgitle Empire stretched all the way from the Appalachian Mountains of the east to the Rocky Mountains of the west, with nothing in between free from their rule. Village after village burned, tribe after tribe was taken, and person after person was killed. Rabid Wolf himself is said to have slain over three thousand men, women, and children, and to have raped even more women and girls. Yet, despite this, people flocked to his army like gnats to a light, for it seemed that few were immune from the power of his persuasion. That is not to say, though, that there weren't those who deeply despised the Utlavgitle and their precious Rabid Wolf. No, it would have been impossible for them to not have many bitter enemies, and many bitter enemies they had, chief amongst them the Aklak from the north. The Aklak were a large tribe along the coast of what is now known as the Hudson Bay, and they had been recently advanced upon by Rabid Wolfs army. Initially only angered by their advancements, they were soon further enraged when they began to hear tales of Rabid Wolfs vileness. Rabid Wolf, too, was becoming more and more agitated as time went on, for though they were a small-statured people, the Aklak were some of the fiercest fighters of the time, and as such, the Utlavgitle, no matter how hard they tried, could not manage to defeat the Aklak tribe. To their advantage, though, they remained elusive, constantly on the move so that the Aklak could never find out where their main camp was. Nevertheless, in spite of their best efforts, a band of Aklak scouts did one day spot Rabid Wolfs camp along the Hudson River. Knowing that they had little time to act before his camp moved again, the scouts hurried back to the chief, who promptly sent three of his stealthiest warriors to sneak into the camp and assassinate Rabid Wolf in his sleep. And so, veiled by the darkness of the night, the assassins snuck into Rabid Wolfs tent and strangled him with a rope. To prove to their chief that they had indeed killed the man, they took a large strip of his scalp, and left the camp. The chief was pleased, and without the military genius of Rabid Wolf, the empire of the Utlavgitle soon began to fall, and things, for the most part, returned to how things were before the rise of the Utlavgitle. Rabid Wolfs body was brought duly back to his birthplace in present-day Tennessee, where he was to be ceremoniously buried. To make sure that it didn't completely decay on the way back, his body was preserved, though it was poorly done, at that. When the body was finally brought back home, the villages medicine man saw where the piece of Rabid Wolfs scalp had been taken. Being a devout supporter of him and knowing that only the Aklak could be the ones responsible, he performed a very complicated and very dangerous spell so that as long as any part of Rabid Wolfs body remained in existence, his spirit would live within that piece. According to the legend, soon after this was done, the Aklak were hit by a mysterious plague that caused a fatal inflamation of the throat. In his pride and on his deathbed, the chief of the Aklak ordered the scalp to be expertly preserved and sealed in a great willow tree that stood in the center of their village, for he could not bear the thought of his greatest trophy ever being lost. Never did any of the Aklak know of the curse that was placed upon it. There the scalp of Rabid Wolf remained for many centuries, until almost all of the tribes of Rabid Wolfs day existed, and his Empire was no more than a myth. That is, until one sweltering summer afternoon, a small boy of the Aivig tribe came across the tree that contained the scalp of Rabid Wolf. The once magnificent tree that had stood in the middle of the Aklak village all those centuries ago was now dead and decrepit. The sealant, now chipped away in a spot, was what had caught the boys eye. Upon closer inspection, he saw that the sealant in fact covered a hollow in the trunk, and so the boy picked at the small hole until he could put his arm in and feel for whatever was inside the trunk. After a moment, he felt what seemed to be human hair. Driven by his growing curiosity, he picked away at the hole until he could finally bring out the scalp. Immediately upon pulling it out of the tree, the boy felt an awesome power flowing through his body from the scalp. Exhilerated by this incredible find, the little boy, whose name was Soaring Tree, raced home to show his grandmother. However, his grandmother, who had grown up hearing the tale of Rabid Wolfs scalp, knew instantly what it was, and immediately took it to the tribes shaman, who attempted to destroy it, but failed. Both the shaman and Soaring Trees grandmother were found soon afterwards mysteriously dead. Soaring Tree, who was close to both his grandmother and the shaman, felt a strange lack of remorse for this sudden loss, which was very uncharacteristic of him, as he was usually a sensitive and caring person. Later, when everybody was asleep, he snuck into the shamans tent and retrieved the perfectly intact scalp. Over the next several weeks, his conscience grew heavier as guilt built up within him about his lack of grief. Seeing an opportunity, the spirit of Rabid Wolf used this vulnerability to gain a stronger foothold on Soaring Tree, so that the dead warriors spirit could slowly devour that of the childs, with the goal that eventually Soaring Tree would be nothing more than a shell for Rabid Wolf, who would then live through the childs flesh in addition to his scalp and distantly buried bones. Over the years, Soaring Tree grew into a warrior, the greatest of his people, and all of the surrounding tribes grew to fear the Aivig because of him. And though he was young in age, his leadership was exceptional,for as he approached manhood, very little of his original spirit remained, so that in character and expertise he was nearly identical to Rabid Wolf, though he did not consciously know it. Then there once came a morning when Soaring Tree came into conflict with the chief of his tribe. After several heated words, they engaged in a traditional unarmed battle to the death for the position of the chief, as was Aivig custom, with the chief trying to keep it, and Soaring Tree fighting to take it. With the spirit of Rabid Wolf to guide him in addition to his own natural fighting ability, Soaring Tree ultimately killed his opponent and became the successive chief of the formidable Aivig tribe. After this point, the story of Soaring Tree becomes much the same as Rabid Wolfs from centuries before. He killed and raped by the thousands, and in addition to that he also regained every last inch of the ancient Utlavgitle Empire, with new lands to add. It is no secret that names hold power, and this was no less true back then as it is today. And in Soaring Trees time, his name was probably the most powerful one in North America. For some, the name of Soaring Tree was something to fear. For others, it was something to hate. But, because of Rabid Wolfs skill in speech and persuasion, for most it was a symbol of hope a great beacon of light to stand behind until the very end. And though it seemed that Soaring Trees greatness would never end, his greatness, as all things eventually do, one day did come to an end. Soaring Tree was old, and though he hid it well, he was dying, and he knew it. He was on the Colorado Plateau, headed south, when he died painfully and alone in the night. His body was brought back to his home in the north, where he was buried as a warrior, along with the scalp of Rabid Wolf, though none knew of its significance. The people mourned, and Soaring Trees successor, though not nearly as good as Rabid Wolf or Soaring Tree, was better than the successor of Rabid Wolf insomuch that the Aivig Empire did not crumble immediately afterwards. However, while it did not lose any territory, no new lands were gained, either. The Aivig Empire simply remained in a state of expansive stagnancy. About a hundred years after Soaring Trees death, the empires leader, Falling Stone, desperately wished to expand the already expansive empire further south. However, despite his best efforts, Falling Stone could not do this. At least, not on his own. All knew of Soaring Trees greatness, yet few knew why he had been such a phenomenal warrior and leader. Nonetheless, as it is with many things, the truth, though diluted and distorted, lived on in the shapes of rumors and legends that few took seriously. Falling Stone had grown up hearing these tales, but hed never taken very much stock in them. But as time wore on, Falling Stone couldn't help but wonder if perhaps there wasn't some truth to these stories after all. Knowing that hed be ridiculed if he went chasing after it, Falling Stone initially refused to go searching for the fabled scalp. But failure persisted, and out of desperation Falling Stone finally gave in and headed north to find Soaring Tree's grave. There he found not only the rancid bones of Soaring Tree, but also the legendary scalp of Rabid Wolf, and just like Soaring Tree had more than a century before, Falling Stone felt a tremendous power surge through his body the moment he laid hands upon the old scalp. Delighted with this new invigorating power and visions of conquest, Falling Stone hurried back down south and shared his secret with none save the awakened beast that hung from his hip. As with Soaring Tree, Rabid Wolfs spirit tried to slowly devour that of Falling Stone, but found that success would be difficult. Soaring Tree's spirit had been young and vulnerable when it had come into contact with the cursed scalp and encountered Rabid Wolfs demented hungry spirit, making it easy prey. However, Falling Stone was old, grizzled, and war-hardened, and so was his spirit, and because of this, the two were constantly battling for supremacy over Falling Stone. It is said that a house divided cannot stand, and such was the case for Falling Stone, though Falling Stone did not know it. As the unconscious battle within him waged, his leadership in real battle declined. The old emporer was finding the push southward increasingly more difficult, and eventually found that the Aivig push was now being pushed backwards. Around the time that they had been pushed back to where theyd started in the first place, news reached the emporer of rebellions erupting all over the empire, and though he tried as hard as he could, Falling Stone could not keep his great empire from trickling out of his old grizzled clutches, for that battle inside still raged on. Then, at the solemn end, the Aivig Empire collapsed completely, and so too did Falling Stone. As far as the different versions of the story go, some say that the scalp was buried along with Falling Stone, while others say that somebody who knew it for what it truly was took it and kept it hidden somewhere safe. Some even say that the scalp was handed down through the ages as an adopted family heirloom, but no matter the ending, each version of the story is very consistent in one thing: that the scalp of Rabid Wolf still exists to this very day. And now I know the truth, for my grandfather has just very recently passed away, and before he died he handed me an Indian scalp to me as a rite of passage as I leave behind my childhood and travel forth into manhood. My grandfather said that I must keep it locked away, somewhere safe and hidden. But I am no fool. This scalp is too valuable a resource to just leave locked away. No, I will be the first to finally control it, and I will go down as one of the greatest men in history. How will I control it, you might ask? Easy: I have history to teach me. Soaring Tree was too weak to coexist with the scalp, and Falling Stone was too ignorant to know that the scalp would try to consume him. But I am not weak, nor am I ignorant. I will coexist successfully with Rabid Wolf, and together, we will conquer the world. "
217,vulnerability,nosleep,The Highwalker,58,6bylfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6bylfj/the_highwalker/,2017-05-19 05:43:19,"Hello friends. I suppose that here is where I divulge the details about who and what I am before I begin my tale, but I find those inconsequential facts are rather taxing to transcribe, besides being arbitrary and if there is one thing I must never do, it is bore people. I was a born performer, the desire to entertain was and still is engrained into every fibre of my being. It was my existence, so you must understand that when I left my calling I needed to keep the embers of that flame burning within myself somehow, whatever creature inside of me that craved the applause and praise needed to be fed, even stronger than the need to forget my horrors. I needed to share my stories with the world. I do hope you are dually entertained and warned, and that you may enjoy my story. I certainly have not. I was a highwalker in the Circ Ciudati for almost two decades. Before my time with them, I was nothing. In my home country, it is bad but common luck for a bastard child to be born into poverty and befall orphanage. If he was lucky, he would be stillborn. Unfortunately, bad luck seemed to mark me from birth and I spent the first seven years of my life snaking out a living from the more fortunates pockets. I suppose I enjoyed it a little bit too much, the performance of taking advantage of charity and pity. It was always more fun to feign vulnerability especially in light of my youth and poverty than it was to merely rob someone. As such, my performances were always passionate and heartfelt. However, it was this habit of casual theft that constructed a meeting between destiny and myself. One day, I intended to pickpocket a man who was unlike any other I had ever seen. He was as tall as an average man, though of course he towered above my seven-year old frame. He was slender, his shoulders held back in an elegant gait that made him appear as though he were not trudging through the same rugged earth as everyone else, but rather that he were gliding across it. He wore a top hat that seemed to touch the slate-grey sky above and his long coat gracefully grazed the muddy road beneath him. But it was his face that stood out against the mundane waste-like plains of my world. His face was otherworldly, ageless, neither lined with age nor smoothed with youth and his eyes were dark. Black as pitch and depthless, even in sunlight. His mouth had curved into an indulgent smile as he pried my hand from his pocket and reclaimed his wallet. My, my, my what a cheeky little bastard you are. I remember my face flushing, turning to run before he called the police or beat me. But then the other side of his mouth perked up. His voice was smooth, the perfect complement to service a silver tongue. Milos, you have talent. At the time, I did not possess the common sense or worldly knowledge to comprehend that this stranger knowing my name was unusual, odd, and even scary. Instead, I puffed out my chest, with all of my seven-year old bravado and said, Yes, I know. My words seemed to confirm something in his mind because he put a hand on my shoulder and knelt down to meet me at eye-level. My name is Cezar Dragomir. How would you like to become a performer, Milos? A real performer. I can give you meat and bread and money that you will not have to take from peoples pockets. I will give you a warm bed to sleep in, and a roof over your head that will not leak rain. You will never have to steal ever again. I like stealing. There are things you could learn to love, my boy. I can teach you to be great. I can teach you to fly. Those words sunk into my little heart. I agreed, feverish to learn how to fly, if only to escape this place and its hatred for me. I followed him, and we walked through the muddy banks of the town and into the dark, gnarled forest. Where is . . . where is this place? Where are we going? Patience, boy. Cezar regally swatted away an offending bough as we trudged deeper and deeper into the heart of the forest. We walked so long that my legs had begun to cramp and my lungs ached and I had a stitch in my side. Eventually, I could see the outline of a huge circus tent, though at the time I did not know its name. I only knew that its colours were bright, summery and blazed through the dreariness of the night-darkened forest. The carillon bells filled my ears, growing louder with every step I took. Once we reached the entrance, Cezar stood on one side of the opening, sweeping a hand grandly and inviting me inside. I complied. The moment I stepped inside, it was like I had stepped into a different world. Within the tent, the atmosphere itself seemed vivacious, filled with light, hazy with coloured smoke and the gentle carillon symphony. A skinny man in a leotard swung from trapeze to trapeze above us, trusting the magic of the circus air to throw and catch him between every bar. Another man stood a few feet from us, juggling knives as though they were balls, effortlessly maintaining his delicate, feather-light touch. A clown was riding around on a unicycle, laughing gaily as he honked the giant red nose that dangled at the front of his face. A pair of conjoined twins was performing some kind of synchronised dance or other in front of a mirror. All of the entertainers were friendly, pausing in their repertoires to wave at me or smile or offer a small greeting. The entire place was utterly magical, beautiful, surreal. I wanted to become part of this place. With every inch of my young heart, I wanted to belong. Cezar turned to look at me with a warm smile on his face. We are in need of a new highwalker, Milos. I believe you have the build and grace of one. We are not like the other modern circuses that so many people flock to nowadays. We have not lost sight of our traditions. Some may call our practices arcane but, it is truly magical. He shrugged suavely. I could not understand a word of what he said, but I did not care. I was too enwrapped in what was happening before me, at this slice of old-world magic being displayed before me, a dream made flesh. You can be a part of us, child. He put a hand on my shoulder. But you must say that you want to join. You must sign a piece of paper and then you can be a part of our family. I nodded vigorously. Cezar beamed. He flourished a piece of parchment that I had neither the ability nor the patience to read. I did not need a pen. Cezar produced a knife and dragged the blade across my palm, drawing blood. I cried out in pain, but he reassured me that everything was alright. He stuck my hand to the piece of paper and tucked it back into his coat. Ladies and gentleman! Cezar bellowed, but as he did so, the cadence of his voice began to change. It became louder, more hollow and jagged-edged. We have a new addition. Let us welcome the boy. He began to grow, like a shoot taking root and flourishing into a tree only faster, his waist and limbs elongating, his extremities narrowing and stretching to impossible lengths. His black eyes seemed to hollow out, his facial bones became more prominent even as he grew so tall he had to hunch over to fit inside the tent. I can still feel the fear as my heart seemed to still in my chest while my bladder loosened, and I turned to run. But I could not pass through the entrance of the tent. It was as though I was being held back by some invisible current. I pressed as close as I could to the solid air blockade, shrinking back as the trapeze artist purposefully dropped from his last bar. He hit the ground with a blood-curdling crunch of bone. Then he stood up, and I could see the displacement of his skeleton through his skin, his bones out of arrangement, his body twisted yet there was no break, no blood. And he did not make a sound. The man juggling the knives set down his hands, face upturned so that each of the three knives embedded in his face. The twins seemed to break apart, pulling away from each other with a terrifying shriek, blood and guts spilling between them and began crawling towards me. The clown had stopped riding the unicycle, his laughing morphing into an ugly, horrible sob as his huge grin dipped passed his jowls into a frown and he began peeling at the skin on his face. All of a sudden, the air in the tent seemed inadequate, I was suffocating beneath my fear, beneath my desperation to get out of there. I was sobbing uncontrollably now, screaming my terror but we were so far out in the woods that no one could possibly hear me. Cezar, or what I had thought to be a man, stalked toward me slowly, emaciated hands clasped behind his back. Do not cry, Milos. You are one of us now. I cried even harder. You are going to be our highwalker. You are going to learn how to fly. I shook my head wildly. I want to leave. Cezars mouth twisted cruelly. That is unfortunately not possible, my dear boy. Not until you fulfil your duty as highwalker. Until then, this is your home, your temple. Meet your family, Milos. He pointed behind him to the monstrosities that lurked in the background and I continued to sob pitifully. My years bound to Cezar Dragomirs Circ Ciudati were hell, a hell I would not wish on anyone. By day, the unassuming customers would cue to watch us perform, for in the day we were human. But at night, monsters roamed. I learned that these people were all normal once, plucked from the dregs of society and told that they were capable of more: the homeless, the unappreciated, the poor, the disadvantaged, the unloved. They were morphed into . . . these awful things. It could happen to anyone, really. Cezar promised to teach them all how to fly. I was learning to fly, learning to be afraid, learning to befriend fear. But all were bound by blood, by a need to entertain and be admired. I was, too. I am . . . free now, I suppose. But not quite. Not quite. I imagine I can still see Cezars face in the shadows of trees and buildings. I can still hear the symphony of the carillon bells, only this time it is spliced with the breaking of the trapeze-artists bones, with the wails of the sobbing clown, with the twins screams as they tore themselves apart, with the sound of knives sliding into [flesh](URL "
218,vulnerability,nosleep,Recluse,21,6c1dj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6c1dj0/recluse/,2017-05-19 14:00:38,"It was Friday. Rainy, as the days seemed to be recently. Darker than the usual and made even gloomier by the lack of people outside. That particular day, I drove to the Rothschild mansion after receiving a message from its owner. Micah Rothschild, 30 years old this year, prime suspect of a double murder case six years ago. He was set free due to lack of evidence, and the case was eventually buried under all the newer ones. Micah, who used to be a promising musician and artist, now lived as a recluse in the mansion where his family used to reside. I ring the antique doorbell by the heavy wooden front doors and its deep sound echoes throughout the house. I dont hear anyone approaching, so I raise my hand to ring it again but the doors open silently and a swath of pale light illuminates the doorway. The girl who answers the door is without a doubt one of the loveliest I have ever seen. Small and pale, with masses of wavy dark hair loose around her face and shoulders. Her face is pointed and elfin, with huge dark eyes and long eyelashes that cast shadows on her cheeks. Her mouth is tiny and red, and when she smiles, tiny pointed teeth glimmer in the light. Good evening, my name is Dr. Carl Schafer, I introduce myself, holding out my hand. Im here to see Micah Rothschild I step closer, but she has already turned away, motioning for me to follow. I step inside the dimly lit house, feeling a subtle chill pervade my senses. The house is still decorated sumptuously, but it looks so lonely and abandoned that no matter how beautiful it was, it still feels like a haunted house. I follow the girl through a hallway lit with crystal chandeliers, trying not to glance at the portraits of the long-dead family members that adorn the walls. We enter an alcove room with a high ceiling that is painted with angels. The angels in the ceiling do not look like traditional angels, however. They look fierce and warrior-like, with multiple wings and fanged teeth and clawed hands, wielding bloodstained weapons at their sides. Some of them even have more than two eyes. Fascinating, arent they? A voice asks quietly. Those are the Biblical depictions of angels. My ancestors thought that the cherubs of the Church looked revolting, so they had these painted here. I find Micah Rothschild in an easy chair by the fire. He is dressed in black pants, a black button-down shirt, and black boots. His dark hair has grown long, almost obscuring his pale blue eyes. He looks up at me, then nods to the easy chair adjacent to his. I set down my bag, take out my tablet, and sink down in the chair. Its so comfortable that it feels like its swallowing me alive. That is certainly an interesting take on angels, I answer diplomatically, powering up my tablet. I am Dr. Schafer, Mr. Rothschild. Its nice to meet you. He sighs. Hes a handsome man, even with his long and unkempt hair and his general aura of condescension. I wonder how hes related to the pretty girl who let me in the house. She has disappeared from sight, which was probably for the best. I would have had difficulty taking my eyes off her, had she stayed. Lets cut to the chase, he says abruptly. Youre probably wondering why I have called for you. I nod. Its quite unusual, seeing as you are usually very adamant that you dont want to receive psychiatric assistance. Well, Ive decided that I need some now, he says, a smirk quirking up one side of his lips. Not psychiatric assistance, though. Justsomeone to talk to. Someone who will listen to me, unbiased, and record my story. Why now, Micah? You could have told them your side of the story a long time ago. He seems restless. He rakes back his long hair with one hand, and his sleeve dips back enough to show me faint scars that look like cuts, bite marks, and puncture wounds on his wrist. Death is imminent, Dr. Schafer. I am not sick, no, but I feel as if my time is running out. And when death descends upon me, I want my story to be known. Its not uncommon for mentally or emotionally disturbed people to feel paranoia. I shrug, then settle back on the chair, my eyes intent on him. Then lets see what I can do. Micah looks at me briefly, then stares back into the fire. Where shall we start? Justtalk. Of all the deaths? All of them. Your sister seems to be in the middle of all of this. Its almost as if Death follows in her wake. He sighs again. All right. There was a silent pause, then he begins to talk. You know my twin sister, Karin, right? Five years ago, during the end of the year, the news couldnt shut up about her. She was found dead on a rooftop, and her boyfriend Christian was brought to the hospital, dead on arrival, due to a traffic accident. He expelled the air he had been holding back. Both deathsthey were blamed on me. I make a noncommittal noise. And how do you feel about that? He laughs. Its a startlingly cheerful sound. Dont give me that psychiatric counseling crap. But Im curious. I really do want to know. Well he glances at me, his eyes sharp and keen. I felt nothing. Those deaths really were my fault, after all. Theres silence. Micah does not take his eyes off me. Are you saying that you had a hand in orchestrating their deaths? He smiles. I killed them, Dr. Schafer. I gave Karin the drug, I ran Christian over with a delivery truck. I compose myself. Its difficult, but I succeed eventually. What pushed you to commit murder, Micah? He stares at the Rothschild family portrait above the fireplace. The beautiful parents, the angelic-looking twins. Micah and Karin were five years old in the portrait. Karin looked exactly like Micah, more delicate perhaps. She had a serene smile and wicked eyes that seemed to taunt me. I suppose Karin and I had a difficult relationship. Half of the time we loved each other with an all-consuming love, half of the time we wanted each other dead. Even as kids, we would gleefully injure each other. I pushed her down the stairs countless times. She pushed me into the pool while I was having an asthma attack. But if an outsider tried to attack either of us, the other would fight tooth and claw in defense. Micah lapses into silence once again. It was better in middle school. She was sent to an all-girls boarding school, while I stayed here and was home-schooled. I would see her only during weekends, and during that time she was usually nice because we havent seen each other all week. He pauses to take a sip of his tea. I had declined when he offered me a cup. We were reunited in high school. She was immediately popular, while I was more or less an outcast. You think that having a popular sister would make me welcome everywhere. He bites his lip, seemingly oblivious to the pain. It starts to bleed, and he licks the droplets of blood casually. We went to the same university after high school. Since we had chosen different courses, we rarely saw each other. I had my own little niche in university, and thing were looking up. I even fell in love, once. He looks down at his hands, smiles faintly. Her name was Oren. She was in one of my portraiture classes, and I immediately fell in love with her. She was so kind, so gentle  so different from my sister. I consult my notes. Oren Quimbly. She died soon afterwards, falling down her dormitorys stairwell. I look at Micah for confirmation, and he nods. I loved her and she loved me  or so I believed. And then came the incident wherein all my delusions came to light. It was our second anniversary. I came home early because my professor didnt show up, and I couldnt find one of my books. I went into Karins room to check if it was there and that was when I saw them. Who did you see? Micahs hands clench into fists. The first thing I saw was a flash of skin, limbs tangled together. My twin sisters dark hair mingling with blonde. At first I was happy just because of the fact that she was with somebody. But then things started to click into place. I recognized the curve of the other girls back, the way her fingers raked their way down my sisters arms. I recognized her voice as she gasped. It was my girlfriend with my twin sister, and at the moment I saw red. He closes his eyes. I take shallow breaths to calm my racing heart. Did youdid you perhaps kill Oren as well, Micah? Micah lifts one shoulder in a careless shrug. What choice did I have? That was the first time you killed. What? No, no. He looks genuinely entertained now. He leans back on his chair, staring at the family portrait again. I had killed others before. Or, more accurately, Karin and I did. At first it was a little hobby of ours, something we did to bond together. Remember that lake house incident, where only Karin and Christian survived? Four boys, all dead. All because of the two of us. He paused, smiled a faraway smile. They were bullying me, you see. I had to find a way to exact revenge. Karin was the one who came up with a plan. She was popular everywhere, and she was accepted into their group right away. The five of them, all alone in that houseit was easy for me to sneak in. He looks at me, an amused look on his face. I had to dress myself in Karins clothes to set the plan in motion. I was a slender kid, from afar I looked exactly like her. She liked that  she always had a thing for guys in girls clothing. One of her little fetishes. She dressed me up so carefully, caressed my hair while whispering instructions in my ear. It was times like those when I liked her the best, when I could feel that we were actually close. But then, you were committing murder. He shrugs. Yes. But does it matter now? He falls silent, staring into the dancing fire. You knowwhen we were younger, shed dress me up in her clothes. I used to resist, but shed slap me hard and push me and threaten me with that innocent smile of hers until I obeyed. I set down my tablet and fold my hands together to stop them from shaking. She sounds like an abusive sister. Did you ever tell your parents about this? He looks at me obliquely. Hmm? No. Why should I? I liked it when she hurt me, we thought it was amusing. I guess we were both twisted in our own ways. She loved to inflict pain, I liked feeling it. What was the last straw? When did you decide that she had to go? Micah glares at me, and I feel a shiver race down my spine. I never wanted to kill her, he says, his voice on edge. Things changed when she got sick, you understand? She was weak. She wasnt the person she used to be. Karin was so depressed about her illness that all she could talk about was dying. My parents ate it up. Somehow, during the course of her illness, they forgot about what a little demon she had been and babied her. Sickening. He swallows hard. ButI felt like that, as well. Everything, forgiven. I didnt want to lose her, you see. No matter how much I had hated her for ruining my relationship with Oren, for the abuse, she was still my twin sister. I sit up straighter, rolling my shoulder to ease its tension and wincing when it cracks. So are you saying that this was assisted suicide, not murder? He nods again. It has never been part of my plan to kill her. But she wanted die, and what else could I do? I didnt want her to suffer. And, perhaps, some hidden part of me really did want her to disappear for good. I sigh. I could sense that the session was circling back, its ending imminent. Why Christian, though? Did he do anything that made you decide to finish him off as well? Micah stands up, stretches his limbs. Not really. I killed him because he was there, because it was convenient, and because I wanted to see what would happen. I rise as well, tucking my tablet back into my bag. My entire body is on edge, my fight-or-flight instincts screaming at me to go. Do you realize that you can be incriminated by everything you have told me today, Micah? Why did you admit it? Why now? He looks at me, his eyes dead and careless. I told you. Im going to die soon, Doctor. Im not going to make it out alive. He pushes me to the wall and whips out a knife, flicking the blade open and pressing it casually on my neck. I called you here because I am being haunted by something, and I want you to drive it away. But perhaps, you dont need to. She has taken a fancy to you, and with any luck she might go when you do. After all, nobody else has been inside this house for five years. Micah relaxes his grip on me, his voice returning to normal. He smiles self-deprecatingly, then pockets the knife and ushers me to the door. It was nice meeting you, Dr. Schafer. Micah Micah looks at me one last time. And perharps, Dr. Schafer, death did follow in Karins wake. I was Death, and I was always a step behind her. He turns away, giving me a brief impression of vulnerability. It would would be a pleasure to see you again, but for your sake lets hope that it doest happen. I exit the house feeling chilled to the bone. I am understandably upset, since Micahs gruesome tale has played a hand in that. I look back towards the house one last time and catch a glimpse of him standing by one of the gable windows, watching me. The girl from the living room was behind him once again, her dark eyes on me unblinkingly. I raise my hand in farewell, and she smiles. That is when I remember that Micah has said that nobody had been inside the house for more than five years. But he has to be kiddingright? I look back to the window one last time. Micah is still there, but the girl has disappeared."
219,vulnerability,nosleep,A Strange Experience in the Devil's Sea,297,6c4uge,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6c4uge/a_strange_experience_in_the_devils_sea/,2017-05-20 02:48:05,"All right. Im going to tell you about the strangest thing Ive ever experienced. My names Roland Duffy, but most people call me Duff. Im an American by birth, a pilot by occupation, and for reasons not relevant to any of this, an expat by necessity. So now I live on Green Island, off the coast of Taiwan, where I run an extremely modest charter flight business with my partner, Seamus MacMillian. Being Scottish, hes got a bit of a brogue, but I understand him just fine. Most of the time. Mac owns the planes but doesnt fly very well, so Im the pilot and hes the first officer. It works for us. Mac and I were getting drinks at a local haunt, like we do, and it was another balmy island night. Only two rounds in and I was already starting to sweat through my nice floral shirt. I sat at a crummy little table amongst the palms and bamboo, waiting for Mac to come back. Hed gone inside to fetch the next round and I was beginning to wonder whether hed gotten lost when he came back with two beers in his hand and two strangers in tow. A man and a woman. The woman was cute, a blonde. The man had striking features, and was also a blonde, but Im not into that so good for him I guess. I figured they were a rich couple doing the tourist thing and needed a flight back to Taiwan. Wed just gotten back from a charter to Shanghai, so I just wanted to drink and not think about work for a while. Fucking Mac, always prospecting. At least he had the beers. This rounds on our new mates, Duff, Mac told me, settling my beer before me. I saluted them with the bottle and took a swig. Franz Bswecht, the man said with a big smile and a German accent. He offered me his hand and I shook it. He gestured to his companion: And this is Dr. Ilsa von Schrdinger. Doctor; like that was supposed to impress me. Oh, please, she said, just Ilsa. Humility; like that was supposed to impress me. She flashed a pretty smile, and her German accent made her that much cuter. I shook her hand. Im Duff, I said to them. Ooh, an American, Ilsa said. Mac brought two more chairs over to our table. Have a seat. He bore that cheesy smile that he reserved for schmoozing customers. The Germans sat, eager looks on their faces. So, Duff, Ilsa began, youre a pilot, yes? Yes, maam, I said. And I see youve met my co-pilot. First Officer, Mac interjected. Yes we did, Franz said. He tells us you guys fly all over Taiwan. Thats the bulk of our business, I said. But we go to all the islands, Mac said, and the mainland, if you like. Wunderbar, Ilsa said. Yes, great, Franz said. Where are you guys looking to go? I asked. Ilsas eyes gleamed. Have you heard of the Devils Sea? I looked at Mac. He grinned. Yeah, I said. What do you know about it? Franz asked me. I sipped my beer. Its an area in the Pacific, roughly triangulated between Japan, the Philippines, and the Bonin Islands, where some ships and planes allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Some people think its where Amelia Earhart went down. Its been called the Pacific Bermuda Triangle but its not as famous. If I remember correctly, most of those disappearances are rumors or myths. They both seemed excited. Mac kept grinning; these wouldnt be the first thrill seekers wed flown over the area for a little sight-see. It was boring for me, but easy money. Very impressive, Duff, Ilsa said. Hopefully you can fly us there? She looked back and forth from me to Mac. Well, given the essence of the area, Mac said, it could be dangerous. Well have to factor that into the cost. He laughed, and so did the Germans. Its a pretty big area, I said. Do you have a particular site in mind? As a matter of fact, Franz said, removing a piece of paper from his pocket. He slid it towards me. I read it. What are these? Coordinates? I slid the paper over to Mac, who was peering over at it. Im afraid its only a general area, Franz said, but it should be narrow enough to cover in a couple of hours, at most. I imagine so, Mac said. But why here? What are you looking for? I asked, somewhat suspicious. Have you ever heard of the *Krake*? Ilsa asked. No, we both said. The *Krake* is a German aircraft carrier, Ilsa said, that disappeared in 1945. I didnt know the Germans had aircraft carriers then, Mac said. To be honest, she continued, they really didnt. After several naval campaigns, the Kriegsmarine planned to construct some, as well as convert several passenger vessels into carriers. But interest in the project waned and focus was shifted towards U-boat development. Hitler loved his U-boats, Mac said. The plans were scrapped, Ilsa continued, except for two. The *Graf Zeppelin* was nearly completed but the crew scuttled it when defeat became imminent. The other was the *Krake*, which was completed and launched. But a sense of urgency hastened its implementation, Franz said, so it was never ceremoniously launched. What kind of urgency? Mac asked. A secret mission, Franz said. Germany had developed a powerful weapon, that would have changed the tide of the war. What? Mac asked. A nuke? No, nothing like that, Ilsa said. Were not sure exactly, but we know it wasnt radiological, biological, or chemical. Not nearly as unstable. But the Allies were closing in, so the Wermacht transported it to Japan aboard the *Krake*. But it never made it to Japan, Franz said. It disappeared en route, in the Devils Sea. Given the nature of its mission, its disappearance was never publicized, and with the haste of its launch and the defeat of the Axis powers shortly afterward, the world never knew. How do you guys know about it? Mac asked. Good question. We are, how you say, agents, for the Deutsch Gesellschaft fr Denkmalpflege, Franz said. I tensed up at the word *agents*. What kind of covert shit is that? Ilsa giggled. It means the German Society for Historical Preservation. And through our work we came across the scarce records of the ships construction and its only mission. Our society endeavors to essentially preserve and enrich German history. And were very interested in Germanys first aircraft carrier. So you want to see where it disappeared? Mac asked. And these are the coordinates? He sipped his beer. Not at all! Ilsa said, excitedly. Were not sure where in the Devils Sea the ship disappeared. These coordinates are where it has reappeared! . . . We flew out over the pacific just before sunrise the next morning. The Germans were anxious to leave right away, before salvagers or the local navy found the vessel, but I had been drinking and we all agreed it would be better to search in daylight. This meant I couldnt get my drink on like Id wanted, lest I be hungover for our pre-dawn flight, but Mac had negotiated a good price to book the flight  $5,000  so I guess I didnt mind postponing my bender. I nearly spit my beer out when Ilsa told us that a missing aircraft carrier had suddenly reappeared. They couldnt explain its lengthy disappearance, hoping our trip might provide some answers, but said the coordinates were reliable and that this excursion was sanctioned by the German government. I wasnt entirely convinced of any of it, but the price was right. Still, something didnt sit quite right with me. Mac and I were in the cockpit of his 2009 Quest Kodiak 100. Shes unpressurized but rides pretty quiet for passengers. Shes comfortable, too, with the Summit Package. The two Germans sat in the cabin designed for eight. It was absurd since Mac had a smaller aircraft for such flights, his Cessna 185, which held four people and could be fitted with floats as a seaplane, but the Germans insisted. I guess they wanted the extravagance, and it worked for me since we dont put headsets in the cabin, so Mac and I could talk about them without them hearing. Plus, as long as their funds cleared, who was I to question it? Mac informed me that their funds had indeed cleared, as they paid in cash. Must be nice to fly on the governments dime. The Devils Sea has no precise boundaries, as it depends on who youre asking, but we were far enough out to sea to be in the commonly recognized area. As we approached the coordinates, I took in the scenery. Vast blue ocean surrounded us, and the early morning sun beamed in the horizon, glinting off the reflective sea. Ive done hundreds of these flights and I never get sick of this view. Seeing it from a portal as a passenger is pretty cool, but the perspective from the cockpit as the one actually flying the plane is never short of amazing. Its why I do what I do. The infinite ocean was immediately humbling  agoraphobic, even  stretching beyond the limits of vision. If the plane went down, wed have nothing but three-hundred-and-sixty degrees of water around our helpless bodies, abyssal depths below, and endless sky above. Its hard not to comprehend just how fucked wed be. Mac brought me out of my rumination on our insignificance. So you think well find this thing? We get paid either way. Our voices sounded tinny and unnatural in the headset. Yeah, he said. But imagine if we did. Then we find it. I shrugged. Makes no difference to me. Come on. Itd be the find of the century. I guess. You guess?! He was getting excited. A ship disappears for the better half of a century and all of a sudden, poof! here it is, back again, and all you can say is I guess? Come on, laddie. I shrugged. I guess. Jesus, he said, exasperated. Youre broken inside. Either we find it, or we dont, I said. Life goes on. I cant believe your feigned apathy over this. He shook his head, chuckling. This is exciting stuff, boyo. Yup. He let out a frustrated laugh. For a while we didnt say anything, then he asked, How did it disappear, you think? I dont know. I mean, its incredible, he continued. A ship, a military ship  fuck, Germanys only operating aircraft carrier during World War II!  goes missing, and no one finds it until now?! It cant be that no one looked for it. I mean, shit, it was on a top-secret mission, carrying some weapon that would supposedly win Germany the war? How can a ship that important just disappear unmissed? It happens, Mac, even today. Look at Malaysia airlines. How many planes have they lost? Those werent prides of the fleet, sent by the German war machine to deliver a critical, war-winning weapon. How does that ship go missing? Really? I said. You have no idea how that ship could go missing? Not a ship that important. The Nazis thought it carried their salvation, for Christs sake. Thats exactly it, Mac. That weapon it was carrying? You dont think that had anything to do with the sudden disappearance? What do you think? The ships own payload destroyed it? That it sank? He laughed. Then how did it come back? Apparently it didnt sink, I said, or get destroyed. Or maybe it did. We havent found it yet. But even those Germans back there dont know anything about that thing this ship was transporting, and all of a sudden the ship disappears without a trace? And now its back! Maybe, yeah. Lets say it is back. We have no idea how. It was carrying some doomsday device, disappeared for a few decades, and now its back. And we dont know a fucking thing about it or what it was carrying. So, what exactly? You heard Ilsa  it wasnt anything unstable. They dont know shit, Mac. Come on. And Im Harry Fucking Potter if those two are actually working for some historical society. So, what? You think theyre some kind of spooks? Maybe. This whole thing is just weird. And pretty awesome, I had to admit. So why did you take the job, then? Why not just let me fly them? I have to admit, I wouldnt have minded keeping your share. Because your piloting is shit. We laughed. And I need the money, too. Too much to tell you and the Germans to go fuck yourselves. Plus Ilsa is pretty cute. Ok, well lets consider the facts. Either the ship is no longer missing and what it was carrying obviously didnt cause its disappearance, so its not that volatile and we have nothing to worry about; or the ships still gone and maybe the thing it was carrying did cause its demise, but we have nothing to worry about because its gone. Either way, we have nothing to fucking worry about, mate. I dont know. And thats what I dont like. Yeah . . . . He said it like he was giving weight to my anxieties, but I could tell he wasnt. We came up on the area. Alright, boyo, Mac said. Keep your eyes peeled. Aye, aye, first mate. Fuck off. He unfastened himself and retreated into the cabin to let our passengers know to start gazing. When he came back in and put his headset back on, I said, Theres a whole lot of nothing out here. Yup, he said, peering out the cockpit windshield. But we still have some area to cover, so lets not get our hopes down. He winked. I guess. We flew for almost an hour. Looking out over the vastness of the Pacific, the old cogitations of how minuscule we all are returned to me. Its easy to take our own existence for granted, comfortably perched atop the animal kingdom amongst fellow human beings and sheltered by our technological advancements. But here, hundreds of miles away from our nearest fellow sapiens, peering down at oceanic oblivion, one cant help but be reminded of our vulnerability. Up here, nestled in this steel bird, were soothed by our species achievements in science over raw nature; but withdraw that variable and dump us in that callous ocean and nature gives no fucks about what our fellow man has accomplished on our behalf. Our technology separates us from the other members of the cosmos; together, as a species, we are superior and immortal, but individually, we are nothing and assailable, exposed to natures whims. We may have conquered land, but the abyss of the sea is still hungry and insatiable. Its little wonder how its swallowed up so many of our achievements. Maybe Mac was right; maybe the *Krake* needed no help from its human-concocted payload to disappear into the void. What a discomforting feeling. I should have heeded my instincts and turned back. Ilsa popped her head into the cockpit and said something, but given the din of the unpressurized cabin and that Mac and I were wearing headsets, we couldnt hear her. I indicated a spare headset hanging behind my flight seat, and she donned it. She spoke into the microphone, See anything yet? Nothing yet, Macs voice crackled in my headset. Maybe we should go back, I said. Ilsa playfully slapped my shoulder. Damn, she was cute. Franz peered in over her shoulder and tried to say something. She gestured toward the remaining headset behind Macs flight seat. He popped it on and said, Anything? Ilsa was just saying that we should head back, I said. Franz chuckled as Ilsa gaily hit my shoulder again. I didnt hate it. Nothing yet, Mac said. Youre sure about these coordinates? Yes, they both said. Then Franz said, It is a pretty sizable area. We still have some ground to cover, no? Yeah, Mac said, we havent seen it all. I groaned, inaudible over the headsets. How are we on fuel? Franz asked. Mac peered over at the dials on my side and informed them, Were good for a little more reconnaissance. Great. We flew for a bit more, the four of us looking out the cockpit windows. I hate when the customers hover like that, but I minded Ilsa over my shoulder a bit less. We kept looking a little longer before I saw something on the horizon. It was just a black spot that could have been anything, so I kept quiet. Mac saw it too, unfortunately, and he spoke up. Whats that? It could be anything, I said. That might be it, Ilsa exclaimed. Lets check it out, Franz said. Its a bit of a ways away, Mac said, but Duff will swing by it. Thanks, Mac. Aye, aye, I said, adjusting the yoke slightly to bear in that direction. We flew towards it for a few minutes and, as we drew nearer, it was clearly a ship. A large ship. Could just be a tanker, I said hopefully. Well know in a few, Mac said. We were about five miles out from it before Ilsa confidently said, Thats it! Thats the *Krake*! As we got closer, its details became clear. It was a large ship, even for an aircraft carrier, almost the size of a tanker. I guessed its length to be at least 1,100 feet. Very impressive. We flew right over it, it resembling a skateboard from directly above. It wasnt like any aircraft carrier Id ever seen. There was no visible bridge platform, and the flight deck was completely flat save for two masts on the starboard side, one with antennae and wiring for communication. There were a few small facilities that I guess were some kind of storage sheds. The ship was dark gray in color, with a few gun emplacements scattered about, and some open-air flight hangars peeking out the port and starboard sides. It was rather uninteresting in its shape, but I awed at its massive size. There were no signs of life, not that I expected any, and there were no aircraft parked on the flight deck. No other ships could be seen and it was clear we were the first to stumble upon it. It was just a giant, empty ghost ship floating in the tremendous, empty sea. I shuddered. After two fly-overs, I said to Ilsa, You may want to take some pictures or something before we have to head back. She didnt seem to hear me, and Franz asked, Can you do another fly-over, this time from the bow to the stern? Sure, Mac said. I obliged and worked the yoke, bringing the plane around. We flew over it lengthwise, each of us taking in its impressive breadth. Ilsa and Franz had removed their headsets and were shouting in discussion to each other, inaudible to Mac and me. After the brief exchange, Franz gestured to replace their headsets. They did, and Ilsa spoke into her mic: It appears there is plenty of room. Can you land? What?! I exclaimed. Thats not a good idea, lass, Mac said. Thank you, Mac. Aside from logistics, there isnt any problem, Franz said. We have the sanction of the German government, who this ship belongs to, and there doesnt appear to be any salvagers or military in the area that we'd need to contend with. Can you do it? Back in New York, Id often fly over the USS Intrepid, real low, fantasizing that I was landing on it. And even though Id get that low  illegally low, truth be told  I never sincerely considered actually landing on it. It was something I always wanted to do, but here? Something just didnt feel quite right. I looked at Mac. He raised an inquiring eyebrow at me. He wanted to land on this thing just as bad as the Germans. There are no LSOs to guide me in, I said, and the deck will pitch and yawn with the flow of the sea, not to mention it will be a very abrupt landing given the runway. Ilsa batted her eyes at me. Damn her. It does seem to be long enough to effect a landing of this type of aircraft, I said, but I dont know about taking off again. Ive seen you manage worse, Mac said. Now my ego was at stake. Damn him. I had one last card to play: But we have no idea what condition that ship is in, or the condition of that weapon on board. There doesnt appear to be any damage, Ilsa said, nor should there be. And it wouldnt be a rectilinear landing as the ship isnt sailing, nor are there obstacles like deck traffic, or arresting cables since the crew obviously wasnt prepared to effect fighter plane landings and takeoffs. Where did she learn all that? If its beyond your capabilities, that would be one thing, she continued, but you seem like a competent pilot. It couldnt be any worse than that rickety runway you took off on. Damn her. Were only asking that you try it, Franz said. If its too rough, just ascend back up and well fly home. Of course wed pay you an additional fee, Ilsa said. An additional $5,000. That was all Mac needed to hear. We can do another fly-over, he said to me, and worst case scenario we just abort the landing and take off again. I had to admit, the extra cash would be a great boon to our checking accounts. Plus, my ego was at stake and I would be lying if I said I didnt want to impress Ilsa. If I can land, I said, and thats a big *if*, we stay for fifteen minutes and then Im taking off again. Ilsa and Franz looked at each other, then said, Deal. I did the additional fly-over, which confirmed what we already knew: there was plenty of room and zero obstacles to impede a landing. I brought the plane back around a good distance from the ship and prepared my descent. You two, I said to Ilsa and Franz, sit down and buckle up. Its gonna be rough. They retreated to the cabin. Mac said to me, in the privacy of our headsets, Are you sure about this? Its your plane. He considered that for a moment, but I could see dollar signs in his eyes. With that extra cash I could almost pay this thing off. Assuming you still have a plane to pay off. Can you do it? he asked with sincerity. Of course I can. I could, couldnt I? Lets do it, he said. Aye, aye. ""Duff?"" ""Yeah?"" ""Stop saying that."" ""Anything else?"" ""Good luck."" I brought the plane down to the appropriate altitude and lowered the landing gear. My stomach was in knots  Id performed thousands of seaplane landings but Id never landed on an aircraft carrier before. I told myself it couldnt be worse than landing on a dirt runway. The flight deck came up underneath us, and it was time to act. I held my breath. I tilted the yoke and we touched down, bouncing once and coming back down. Mac cringed. I fought the pitch of the ship on the waves while disengaging the thrust of the engines, and thanked the gods there was no bridge tower to swerve away from, since I was all over the place. I slowed the plane down, coming to a stop a little too close to the end of the deck, but we didnt end up in the drink. There was enough room to turn the plane around, and I combat-parked facing the length of the runway, engaging the brake. I spied some wheel chocks strewn on the deck, and noted that for later use when we disembarked. For fifteen minutes, I reminded myself. Mac and I shut down the engines and the plane, and hung our headsets up. He whistled and high-fived me, letting out an enthusiastic Yeah, lad! I realized Id been holding my breath and exhaled, probably too loudly. You did it, lad! Mac said. Ive got to admit, though, I was a bit nervous for a minute back there. Im still nervous, I said. Want to see if our customers are still alive? Yes, Ill go check. He unfastened his belt and went back to the cabin. I let the anxiety of my landing hit me, and hyperventilated for a few seconds. I brought it back under control and forced myself to admire my brilliant landing. My first time landing on an aircraft carrier. Whoo hoo! I mentally patted myself on the back, despite the retrospective recklessness of it all. Hopefully Ill be able to take off from this thing. I heard Mac open the hatchway and heard the pneumatic whoosh of the door and little stairway descending. Lady and gentleman, Mac said, we have arrived. Part II - URL Part III - URL Part IV - URL"
220,vulnerability,nosleep,Squall,14,61ulj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/61ulj2/squall/,2017-03-28 07:07:49,"Rays of early morning sunshine streamed through my curtains ending any hope of sleeping in. Reluctantly I dragged myself out of bed and went about my morning, showering, eating breakfast, and listening to the TV. I walked over to my kitchen window and looked across the city listening to the weather prediction for the day. It was going to be warm and sunny, a perfect day off. I unlatched the heavy window and lit a cigarette as I enjoyed the rest of my coffee. I shouldnt have been smoking in the apartment but Id be damned if I was going to be held accountable by a super who couldnt even be bothered to fix the front doors. The idea of anyone being able to walk up and down the halls at night unnerved me, but that drunk couldnt give a fuck no matter how many people complained. How he kept his job was unknown to me. I finished my cigarette and looked around my apartment. The thought of wasting my few precious hours of freedom was more than I could handle. I walked mindlessly looking for something productive to do until I found myself back in the kitchen pawing through mostly full cabinets. I decided it would be best to pick up a few odds and ends from a grocery store down the street rather than do nothing. Unlatching the lock, deadbolt, and chain I stepped through my doorway to take the elevator down to ground level. I was greeted by a set of permanently open, filthy doors that had been sitting at strange angles for over a month. I shook my head in anger and walked through them. I found some solace in knowing that everyone I past had the same look of disgust on their faces. Carpeted interiors gave way to hard concrete sidewalks heaving with people going about their day. Navigating through the crowds I made my way over to fifth street market and deli. I pulled on the thick steel door which responded by gliding open to reveal a fantastic array of meats that more than made up for the stark concrete structure and awful customer service. I made my selections and walked to the cashier which took the form of a stocky old man with more than his share of ear hair. We had a brief conversation about how much he hated the his wife and I headed for the door. He loved the sound of his own voice and followed me. Rather than seem rude, I stopped and humored him. His diatribe on marriage was cut short as an ear splitting high pitched siren emitted from everything that had a speaker. Megaphones and radios throughout the city cried out in unison bellowing: ALERT, THE ANOMALY HAS BEEN DETECTED. THIS IS NOT A TEST. WE ESTIMATE FIVE MINUTES BEFORE ARRIVAL. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY. I looked at the shop owner in horror as he pinned my arms to my sides and started walking me backwards toward the entryway. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? ITS ILLEGAL TO DO THIS!, but he was stony eyed and much stronger than I was. My futile struggle against him went unnoticed and he threw me through the front doors. I crashed backward onto the uneven sidewalk, my groceries rolling in every direction. As I looked back I could see him pulling down the gate and slamming the doors shut with a loud thud. I lept to the doors covered in eggs and beat my fists against the gate to no avail. Damn him, I thought as I turned around If I make it through this hes dead. It was for exactly this reason that congress enacted the Anomalous Event Safety and Security Act requiring citizens to provide shelter to those already on their premises during an event. But that didnt matter now, he would have to face the consequences of his actions if I survived. With no other choice, I ran as hard as I could in the direction of home. Before long my lungs burned and my legs felt like limp pasta. I tripped on a rogue shoe and fell with my full body weight onto my side. My momentum carried me forward and I rolled, twisting my ankle on the unforgiving pavement. After a moment of pain, I hobbled up on one leg and the second alarm rang out. ALERT, THE ANOMALY HAS BEEN DETECTED WITHIN 10 MILES OF THE CITY. YOU HAVE APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES TO SEEK SHELTER Three minutes left? How could two minutes have already gone by? I thought fighting down the urge to vomit. I made my way through the park jogging at half speed to the sound of doors and windows slamming shut all around me. Pain radiated through my leg and my vision began clouding as I gasped for oxygen. I could hear my mothers voice in my head nagging me to quit smoking and start exercising. Why hadnt I listened, if only Id listened. But how could I have known that I would be outside and abandoned when it would arrive. We were always at home every time it came before. I thought fruitlessly. When I was within one block of my apartment complex I could make out the outline of the broken entryway and elevator just beyond. The pain was becoming more than I could handle and I stopped to catch my breath. As if sensing my pause the megaphones cracked into life. ALERT, THE ANOMALY HAS ENTERED THE CITY. THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER ALERTS UNTIL IT HAS CHOSEN. With the final alert came the realization that I was alone outside with it. My fear and vulnerability were like a beacon as it raced through the deserted streets on bare feet. Waves of terror washed over me and I ran to the elevator. Millions of people were cowering huddled behind closet doors and under beds. They waited in hushed silence for the sound of my scream to tell them it was over, but my will to live would guarantee a bloody struggle to the end. A final burst of adrenaline propelled me through the elevator doors. I slammed the button for the twelfth floor and pushed myself against the back wall of the tiny box gasping for breath. The doors shut slowly in front of me and I could see it down the street. Hunched, grey, and in ragged clothes the child turned in all directions looking for me until it knew the right direction. The elevator rose slowly as the gray child closed the distance between itself and my building, arms flailing madly as if swimming through the air. The next few moments were a blur. I remember the familiar ding of the elevator, the scramble to my door, the mad rush to push my key into its socket and the uncontrollable trembling that made it impossible. I could hear its bruised feet slamming the stairs several floors below. Damn it, please just I thought as my key finally found its mark. I turned, pushed, and slammed the door shut, flinging myself against the far wall of living room just as the child made it to my floor. It knew I was here somewhere and began stalking up and down the hall. I clamped both hands over my mouth in an attempt to remain silent, Id rather pass out from lack of oxygen then give myself away with hard breathing. It stalked back and forth for gut wrenching minutes and my mind raced. How had we not figured out what this thing was by now? Was the alert really the best our scientists could do? What would my family think of me? What would they say when reporters came to interview the family of this events victim? None of these thoughts mattered now, because I could see the childs eyeless face hunched over in front of my door through the frosted pane. Its scratchy wheezing grew louder as if it was already in my ear. My heart rate accelerated, the taste of acrid hand sweat filled my mouth, and I shook uncontrollably. My body became limp with resignation sliding down the wall to the floor. I closed my eyes and waited. But instead of unspeakable horror, the the sound of a baby crying cut the silence like a knife. Down the hall a young mother clamped her hand over her babys face, but it was too late. The child turned and ran in the direction of the noise. The victims had been chosen. Their fates were sealed and my mine was returned to me. The tenants of floor 12 sighed collectively in relief as the family in 12F screamed in terror for their last time. ... Morning rays of sunlight poured through the curtains illuminating dust which danced through the soft currents of the apartment. A fly landed on the crust of hardened egg yolk as I looked up and around the living room. Thirst compelled me into a standing position but my leg buckled under its first step and an eruption of pain shot up my leg as I fell. I looked down to find the tip of an ankle bone protruding and a faint trail of hardened blood leading from the door to my position on the floor. Using the furniture I stood more cautiously, shuffling to the kitchen. I drank from the tap, sat down in a chair and listened to the sounds of the city through the window Id forgotten to close. I picked up a clean dish rag and wrapped it tenderly around my ankle as I thought of all the terrible ways that shop owner was going to meet his end."
221,vulnerability,nosleep,Exorcismo Magno,6,62w54o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/62w54o/exorcismo_magno/,2017-04-02 08:52:02,"Catholicism is the majority along the border, thus when the Rio Grande Valley began seeing more and more cases of corruption tied to cartel activity, people turned to the church. The church, however, stayed silent. People generally believe that this is because cartels who consider themselves Catholic, turn their faith to less-known icons. Particularly La Santsima Muerte... lady death ensures that less conventional prayers are answered, and has become patron to a number of cults. To a lot of people she's a saint-- to the church, a deception. It isn't uncommon for people to go missing down here, as kidnappings are one of the many ways cartels send messages and threat communities, so when people began to disappear at the beginning of the year, nobody thought it out of the ordinary. Not until that number began to escalate, and bodies were never found. I work for the Diocese of Brownsville. We got constant calls for blessings and vigils and masses, but investigations always fell short, in fear of provoking violence. I did bring it up with a number of priests though, and they'd all give me the same spiel: ""this is how it's always been."" Only that wasn't true at all... if cartels were sending messages, the bodies would be left in open sight, or a video would be produced. This wasn't normal, not even for our own, messed up world. News papers weren't covering disappearances anymore, neither was the news... everything we hear is purely through word of mouth. People began staying indoors and the nightlife of the lower Rio Grande Valley grew dim. I meet with priests almost every day... although none of them would give information, this gave me clearance into diocesan archives and parish archives all along the US-Mexico border. Since only one member of the press (the diocesan newspaper) has access to these archives, no reporter or investigator could gain access unless warranted by a judge. I gave into my curiosity one day, and began to look through files, ministry by ministry to see if any recent paperwork had been archived relative to the disappearances. I found nothing. Eventually I brushed it off and thought maybe the priests were right... that is until a week ago when I attended a Theology on Tap seminar by priest who works on the outskirts of the metroplex that sent me on an inquisition I could have never imagined. The topic: exorcisms. I spoke to this priest, who's name I will exclude for anonymity, about the disappearances and unlike his colleagues he did not jump at a rehearsed dismissal.... he stayed silent. He asked me to go into his office on Thursday, where we spent a great deal of time sipping whiskey and sitting in awkwardness. Finally he pulled out a red, leather bound book from his side-table drawer: De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam. I was not 100% certain what to make of it, but it clicked- and my heart sank. The Diocese, over the last three years, had performed more exorcisms than it had ever before. Almost monthly, a new case would arise as priests were beginning to pour in from around Mexico and the US, in secret. Why hadn't the church made news of this as it always had before? I was petrified, but I kept digging. Catholicism has always had a strange mystery about it. Especially along the border. Especially now. After the current administration took hold there's been a thick tension stirring here, and there's not an end in sight. More people are going to mass, and not for the right reasons. They're afraid... most of them are afraid of being deported or losing their families... some, however, who remember the aggressive violence they fled, fear something much darker. In 2015, Mexico was exorcised. Not people in Mexico-- the country itself. Cardinals and Bishops met in the city of San Luis Potos to perform Exorcismo Magno on the entirety of the Mexican Republic... they believed that the surges of cartel violence and corruption plaguing the government was caused by demonic forces, and so they took action. This began the flooding of Catholics into the United States seeking refuge from poverty, and from the grasp of what they believed to be malevolent forces beyond this world. It became clear that there was an epidemic surging through south Texas and the US-Mexico border. The priest who led me on to it all believes that the rise in fear and violence has left people vulnerable to dark spirits... I would learn that this is not an epidemic exclusive to the south- nor has is it the first of its kind. Chicago has seen it a number of times over the last century, and New York saw it in the early 1900's. Demonic forces, driven in numbers, making their way through entire cities. And for now, the church aims to keep it a secret. I have no idea what they're trying to hide beyond the obvious. I do know that these cases are growing rapidly, and I intend to follow up with a number of them. I need to know why they've stayed quiet, especially when it seems that everyone is at risk. If fear is inciting vulnerability to malevolent forces, I fear that the entire country is in danger beyond what any of us think possible. "
222,vulnerability,nosleep,I was recruited by the government - Part 3,105,637ef2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/637ef2/i_was_recruited_by_the_government_part_3/,2017-04-04 01:14:47,"[Part 1](URL / [Part 2](URL / [Finale](URL *** Sometimes your mind plays tricks on you. Not just in the form of optical illusions, but if were vulnerable enough we see things differently. Its when were pressed against the boundaries between survival and death that our vision and thoughts are altered. We bargain to keep on living; compromising our integrity for the scraps of necessary fuel to persist. Thats what I tell myself now. In part because its true; in part because its also a reasonable excuse that justifies dragging a dying man into knee-high snow, wrapping my arm under his chin from behind and twisting. *Sozhaleyu*, I mumbled into his ear before the fatal crack of his spine erupted into the cold, thin air and sent a vibrating pulse into my fingertips. It was a word Dmitry had taught me when he lived at my house. It was the word for sorry. His gurgling stopped, his shaking body went limp. Ive seen people murdered before, but this was the first time I personally took the life away from someone. Even though it was only to ease his suffering, the guilt instantly weighed heavily on me. As I finished covering the body with snow, Stacia came up beside me in the open field, pulling the lifeless body of the other office by his leg. Help me cover this one too, she ordered as she bent over and went to work covering the body. She pivoted her body so her back was turned to me and I took notice of the gun holstered in the back of her pants. The black grip protruded from the waistline, seemingly calling out to me. I stared at it, mesmerized, thinking it would be the only way out of this mess. *You could kill her*, a voice inside my head spoke to me. *You could just tell Jack that she was discovered by the Russian military after you left Vladivostok. Kill her. Bury her here with these two officers.* Is this what paranoia feels like? I inexplicably blurted out loud in a daze, hovering over Stacia while she shoved mounds of snow over the body. She didnt seem to notice or care. Get your thumb out of your ass and help me, she reprimanded. You didnt have to do that, I spoke in a single, monotone pitch, still standing over her. You shouldnt have done that...shouldnt have killed those two innocent men. Not enough time to go back. Yevgeni is waiting. And who knows how long until those missiles go off. We have to come back this way tomorrow after Oymyakon. By then someone will know theyre missing. Theyre going to be stopping cars and asking people questions. And well have a car full of weapons and equipment. Well look suspicious. *Shes a loose cannon. Shes either going to get you killed or shell kill you herself. Its the only way youll be safe. Its the only way you can finally sleep.* What will you do then? Kill more innocent people? Draw more attention to us? Dont question me, Shaun. *DO IT!* I lunged forward and wrapped my fingers around the grip of the gun, but just as it was firmly in my grasp Stacia had reached around her back and grabbed my wrist. Before there was any time to comprehend her swift reflexes she had reached back with her other arm, pulled my body forward and flipped me completely over her back. I landed square on my back, directly on top of the partially covered remains of the officer. There was only a short moment for me to collect myself. Within that time I realized that in my right hand was the gun. Despite the takedown move from Stacia I hadnt lost my grip on it. Its weight felt like two ton boulder in my hand. I turned onto my stomach and aimed the gun in Stacias direction. She took a step forward as though she were about the tackle me and then stopped, seemingly unsure of what action to take. Stay back! I shouted as I raised myself to my knees. She took another step towards me. Back I said! She raised her hands to chest level with her palms pointed towards me. Shaun, think about what youre doing right now. This could easily be considered an act of treason. I planted myself on my feet and felt the rage searing into every part of me. Even though I had the advantage, I couldnt shake the feeling of helplessness. I just...I just want this to be over! I just want to sleep! I know youre exhausted. Thats my fault. I pushed you too much. Its okay. Give me the gun and well forget this ever happened. Ill find you a nice bed to rest in. Tears welled in my eyes. Im not a bad man. I never wanted any of this She took a step forward and held her right hand forward. I know, I know. Just give me the gun and well talk this through. Dont come any closer! I pulled the trigger and fired a warning shot into the air. Stacia jumped and took two steps backwards. Alright, alright. Im staying back. Lets talk about this. What do you want to do? Whats your move? Truthfully I hadnt planned anything. I was acting entirely on impulse. Emotion had gotten the better of me, and I was desperately trying to locate the willpower not to put a bullet in her chest. Throughout our time together I hadnt felt the least bit safe with Stacia, and I knew after this there was no possibility I could ever completely trust her. But deep down, regardless of my vulnerability, I didnt have it in me to kill her. I started backpedaling to the highway where the cars had been left running, keeping the barrel of the gun fixed on her. Dont move! What are you doing? Just dont move! I followed the trail of bloody snow back to where the two SUVs were sitting idly with their engines still running. Stacia remained in the middle of the field not moving, watching me like a hawk as I approached the SUV behind ours, pointed the gun at the front tire and pulled the trigger. The vehicle shook and slanted downwards, the air hissing as it escaped from the bullet hole. Im sure they have a spare tire in the trunk, I yelled back at Stacia. She yelled something in response but I paid no attention. The inability to fully decipher her outcry could have been attributed to the distance between us, could have been because I simply didnt care, or maybe my current state simply would not allow me to. Whatever the reason, her words did not deter me. I hopped in the driver's seat of our SUV, made a U-turn and sped back towards to the normal civilization of Russia as a traitor to my country and a fugitive. *** I drove for hours contemplating my actions, shrouded in doubt over whether I had done the right thing. What would happen to my wife? My son? Where should I go? I was wandering aimlessly in a foreign country without any money, and I didnt speak the language. The SUV would eventually run out of fuel, and what then? All I had of any value was a gun. Remnants of snow soon disappeared after exiting the Siberian terrain. Upon arriving in a small town after driving for four hours, I pulled into the parking lot of what looked like a convenience store, drove to the side of the building and parked the car. A quiet and safe place to gather some perspective by sleeping. My body desperately needed it. Darkness had devoured the sky and the lot was empty. A perfect spot to rest. I cuddled myself under a blanket that was in the back seat and dozed off peacefully. When the morning sunlight shined onto my eyes five hours later I sprang up in the seat, jolting in an upright position as though someone had just screamed in my ear. A light bulb had gone off in my head. Jack had given me a telephone number to call for emergencies just prior to leaving the DoD complex. I spun and unzipped my bag in the back seat, searching through the front pocket for the business card with the number scribbled. It was my only option. I could contact Jack and explain what transpired with Stacia and pledge my continued dedication to finding Dmitry. He would understand. He was my only salvation. After locating the number I stepped out of the car, fumbled on my first steps and fell to my knees. Five hours of sleep was good, but it certainly wasnt enough. As tempting as it was to go back into the SUV and cuddle under that blanket again, there simply wasnt enough time for it. I walked into the convenience store and approached the cashier. English? Do you speak English? She frowned and shook her head. *Net*. Telephone? I made a gesture with my pinky and thumb and held it against the side of my face. Can I use your phone? She audibly sighed and handed me a cordless phone. *Da*. Oh! Thank you so much, um, *spasibo*. *Pozhaluysta*, she replied, rolling her eyes at me. I pulled Jacks business card from my pocket and dialed the fourteen digit number written on the back. It rang twice before a woman on the other end answered. DOD, this is Jamie. Jamie. This is Shaun Brewer. I need to speak with Jack Cloonan. There was no initial response, only a brief pause before I heard Jack on the other end. Shaun? What is your status? Hearing his voice was a refreshing relief. Jack! Oh my...its...have you heard from Stacia? No. What are you doing in Tommot? Is that where I am? I have no ideahow did you know? Were monitoring the GPS on your SUV. Youve steered away from the course of the objective. I had to! Stacia...she...shes crazy! She killed two men because they tried to make us turn around on Kolyma highway! I heard Jack breathe heavily into the receiver. Where is she? I stole the car and left her...I had to! She put the gun to my head earlier yesterday and said she was going to kill me! Alright alright, calm down. He breathed heavily into the phone again. She assured me she wouldnt do this Wait, what do you mean? You were worried she might behave erratically? Shes killed before. Became an enemy of the Russian Federation when she went AWOL and murdered two of her comrades for being insensitive to her sexual identity when she was caught sleeping another woman officer. She fled the country and came to the U.S. We offered her asylum in exchange for her expertise on Russian intelligence. I nearly dropped the phone in my hands. Part of me felt tremendous empathy for Stacia. Russia has a long history of intolerance towards non-heterosexuals. No one should ever be ridiculed for their sexual orientation, and certainly not to the degree in which it drove Stacia to. But another part of me boiled with anger. How could Jack not see that sending Stacia back to Russia would possibly have an adverse effect on her? How reckless can you possibly be? Youve sent me here to die, you realize that?! Shaun, every agent goes through an incredibly meticulous psychological evaluation regularly. She passed with flying colors. We had no reason to suspect that she would repeat her previous actions. Plus, she insisted on going. Swore she was the best person for the job. And I agreed with her. We need to scrub this entire botched operation. Your execution was totally rushed, unorganized, and unprepared. I know things have not gone as planned, but were still on track. You can still get to the bunker and report back to us. Tears of desperation welled in my eyes. Just let me come home! I dont wanna do this anymore! Shaun, stay focused. Youre so close; almost through this. You can be at Object 506 by tomorrow. Go. Find Dmitry. Bring him to us. Im in no shape to do this on my own. Ive barely slept. I dont have any money or enough gas to get me there, and I dont have any support! Stacias still out there, probably with a grudge...shell be coming for me! This is lunacy! Dont worry about her. I can wire you money. Theres a Western Union not far from you current location. Ill give you direct coordinates to the bunker to plug into the GPS. You can do this, Shaun. I believe in you. Do it for your country. Do it for your wife and child. My fingers squeezed the phone tightly. Jack wasnt giving me any option. I would have to go and finish this. Alone. Not only was I going to be alone, but now I had to worry about the possibility of a murderous woman searching for me. I left Stacia with a window of opportunity to proceed with her mission. In hindsight I should have shot out all the tires on the other SUV. But doing such a thing would surely have sealed her death certificate. There was no one else around for miles. If she didnt freeze to death before finding shelter the authorities would have picked her up. All I wanted was to give myself a head start. Had she gone to Oymyakon still? Or did she decide to pick up my trail? I had slept for more than enough time for her to actually be ahead of me in the journey to Irkutsk. After picking up the 20,000 that Jack had wired to me and filling up with a full tank of gas I set forth for Irkutsk, driving through the day and into the night. *** A thick fog had blanketed the forest just north of Irkutsk upon my arrival the next morning. The combination of the dense air with the dim light of dawn created a somewhat ominous atmosphere. The only audible sounds were some birds chirping, a low rustle of towering tree branches swaying in the wind, and my own footsteps brushing through moist leaves on the ground. The nearest road was two miles away, and I spent an hour trudging through the green wilderness, searching for the opening that led to Object 506, and any sign of Stacia. Upon sight of the opening in the dirt surrounded by concrete blocks, I huddled within the forest, covering my line of sight with a towering tree 100 yards away. As Jack advised me to do, I waited for any signs of activity for thirty minutes before proceeding. Besides the sounds of nature, I heard and saw nothing suspicious, and was beginning to wonder whether there was anybody inside at all. Perhaps this entire ordeal was a colossal waste of time. I considered turning around and telling Jack that the bunker was empty, cleaned out before I arrived. But I wouldnt know for certain until I inspected the bunker. There was no turning back at this point. Id lost a lot of sleep and had my entire life on the line just to get here. I needed to go inside. The weight of the gun in my hand seemed heavier, as though something was trying to tell me to leave it behind. I stared at it for a moment, trying to decide if I should bring the weapon inside with me. If this was a military base, surely there would be soldiers or military personnel inside, and surely they would not act kindly to a foreigner walking in with a loaded weapon. I wrapped the gun in a small cloth and shoved it back into the bag and covered it with leaves. At least I knew where it was should I need it. Just beyond the tree line was a small clearing of waist high grass and sparse pine trees. I took one last look around and stepped out into the clearing, walking slowly towards the small opening in the dirt, half expecting to get shot at. There must be some sort of surveillance, I thought. H-hello? I yelled out loud. Dmitry? There no was no response or any sign of activity, just the peaceful sounds of nature. I picked up my pace, walking forward at a leisurely pace until I reached the opening. Inside was pitch black. D-Dmitry? Are you there? Still no response. My stomach turned, half from hunger and half from fear of what lurked in the unknown abyss in front of me. The pictures I had seen of the interior was like that of a horror film; a place used to torture and murder people. I knelt down to look inside and shined my flashlight into the darkness. The beam projected and exposed some more concrete that supported the dirt resting atop its barrier. It faded only a few feet from the entrance before the darkness devoured it. *Find me in the dirt*... Trepidation aside, I forced myself forward, committed to finally answer all the lingering questions I had. My sneakers echoed against the concrete walls as soon as they landed from the three foot drop. Darkness surrounded me, and the wimpy flashlight I had wasnt doing much help. Some dirt crinkled between my shoes and the concrete floor with each tiny, nervous step I was able to muster. It was a vast, empty concrete complex with still no sign of life. After walking fifty feet the beam from my flashlight landed on a vertical concrete wall. I shined the light to the left, illuminating a large metal, sliding door with numerous indentations attached by wheels to tracks above and below. On the far left side was a handle. Grabbing it sent an icy chill up my arm. I pulled it lightly at first, but it wouldnt budge. A hard yank didnt offer any progress. It was tightly sealed shut. What the hell was this? If the bunker was locked up, how did Dmitry expect me to gain access? Was I supposed to knock? If there were people here, why wasnt there any sign of them? Before I could decide on how I should progress I noticed a small rectangular box mounted a little further to the left of the door. It glistened in the light, as though it was something new and recently installed. Stacia had told me that this bunker was assumed inactive since 2012. Four years is enough time for objects to contain a fair amount of debris, but this box was completely new. I walked closer and inspected the device. One tap on its face and a series of numbers lit up, 0-9 all in order. It was a code lock for the door metal door next to it. And Dmitry had already sent me the code. The numbers at the bottom of his Scrabble tiles were more directions on the alphabet. They were the combination. 1912. The final piece of the note that I didnt understand made sense now. *Its better backwards!* The code was 2191. The numbers beeped as I entered them. On the final digit I heard a click from within the metal door. It had unlocked. An easy push and the door slid open; its wheels rumbling as the heavy door glided along the tracks. All my doubts were gone. This was where Dmitry wanted me to come. I stood in the open doorway, squinting into a large, dimly lit room. The only source of light was a red lamp that hung above, swaying delicately from a electrical wire. Dmitry? Are you there? Bulky footsteps reverberated directly on my right. They werent normal. Whoever was making them was slapping their bare feet onto the concrete. I turned to inspect the source of the steps, then immediately jumped backwards and gasped at the sight in front of me. I had seen some rather gruesome things in my past. But none of them could ever compare to this. Standing inside a wide, metal cage was a naked woman. Her skin had been peeled away and dangled from various areas of her fleshy body. Her skinless feet slapped against the dirty concrete floor as she moved to the front of the cage, directly towards me. Slimy muscles and tendons pulsed with each step, the vibrations from her heavy steps emitted small droplets of blood off the meaty lumps protruding from her body. She moved slowly, her partially skinned face looking as shocked as I was to see me. Her mouth moved up and down without saying a word as though she were a dying fish. What the fuck? WHAT THE FUCK?! I yelled. A door on the opposite end of the room burst open and out ran two men with assault rifles in hand, pointing them directly at me. *Podnimite ruki!* one of them yelled. *Nazovite sebya! Nazovite sebya!* the other shouted. Their violent expressions became the focus of my wide, terrified eyes. Dont shoot! Im sorry! I held my hands up and took a step backwards, tripped over my own feet and tumbled to the concrete floor. The two rushed through the room, their weapons fixed and ready to shoot the intruder. *Kto ty?!* I-I dont speak...oh fuck! *Ty kto takoy, mat' tvoyu?!* *Spokoyno, gospoda*! A womans voice shouted from the side of the room where the men had burst from. I held my breath and closed my eyes expecting to be shot on sight. Visions of Emma and Dexter poured rapidly through my mind like a slideshow. You are...Brewer? Yes? The same womans voice spoke more calmly, originating from a much closer proximity. My eyes popped back open and I was met with the face of a short, young woman with curly blond hair and bright blue eyes. Brewer? she repeated while cocking her head slightly, her accent extending the vowels in my last name. Y-yes, Im I stopped and turned my attention at the caged monster nearby. The partially skinned woman inside had wiggled one of her bony fingers underneath her bloodshot eye, grabbed her bottom eyelid and was pulling downwards, tearing her own flesh down the side of her face while still gasping for air with her mouth like a fish. Oh...oh god...what is that thing?! Is ok, Shaun. Dmitry say you brave and smart. You do great things! My head jolted back to the blond girl in front of me. She hovered above, gleaming with a nurturing smile that inviting me to trust her. Dmitry? Hes here?! Yes yes. Come, off floor. Is dirty, you know? Come, I show you Dmitry. She pointed behind with her thumb, indicating the direction we would be headed. Im named Viktorija. Is pleasure to meet you. One of the men reached down and effortlessly lifted me with one hand, propping me up on my feet and studying my appearance. Is...is that a zombie? I fearfully asked Viktorija, looking at the caged woman as she continued tearing away at her own body. Zombie? Ha! Dmitry say you funny. So, its not a zombie? Our angel? *Net*! We grow her in petri dish. She just fine. In fact, she opposite of zombie. She more alive than you or me. She turned and began walking to the door she and the men originally emerged from on the opposite side of the room. Come! Dmitry explain. With a bounce in her step, Viktorija sped forward, her shoulder length hair bouncing and swaying graciously with each step. A hand pressed against my back and lightly nudged me forward, encouraging further exploration into this apparent underground torture chamber. The concrete walls were riddled with decay and cracks and there was a skinless woman locked in a cage, yet Viktorija pounced through, maneuvering around the edge of the cage as though she were out for a casual stroll in a meadow. My shaky steps struggled to keep up with her pace. Through the next door was a larger room that I recognized from the pictures Jack had showed me. It was the room that looked like an airplane hangar. Only now, instead of the dilapidated image I was previously shown with debris strewn about, the area had been completely cleaned and even painted. Even more noticeable were the makeshift laboratories that had been built with glass walls. I quickly counted six individual labs filled with various chemical equipment. Further perplexity arose when I failed to notice a single person inside. No scientists working feverishly at whatever all this equipment was for. The place was empty. We moved across the hangar, through a door and into a short hallway with three closed doors. Immediately upon entering the hallway I heard the muffled sound of music coming from inside one of the rooms. The familiar guitar riffs were difficult to pinpoint precisely, but I knew I had heard the song before. Viktorija moved down the hallway and opened the door at the far end. As soon as the door opened the sound became clear. Someone inside was blasting the song Pinhead by the Ramones and was singing along to it in an incredibly off-pitched tone. D-U-M-B EVERYONE ACCUSIN ME! I recognized that awkwardly childish voice instantly. Hes in here, Viktorija advised, stepping into the room. I rounded the edge into the doorway and finally saw him. My friend. Dmitry. He was standing on top of a desk in a small concrete room wearing plain jeans and a white t-shirt, singing and dancing along to the song with his back turned to the door. His hips shifted left to right swiftly as though he were in an old swing dancing music video. I NOT WANNA BE A PINHEAD NO MO! Viktorija pushed a button on a nearby stereo resting on a shelf next to the desk and the room fell silent. *U vas gosti Ruki vverh!*. Dmitry stood up straight and turned to the door, connecting his eyes with mine. We froze for a moment as we looked at each other, his expression hopeful, mine exasperated with a mix of anger. Shaun! You make it! He jumped off the desk and rushed to me, wrapping his arms tightly around my body in a bear hug. I stood as stiff as a rock, unable to reciprocate the warm gesture. You get letter I send! You come and help! Dmitry...I I trailed off. He released me from his grip and stared at me in the eyes. What is wrong? You not happy to see me? My vision blurred from an excess of water that had quickly formed. It wasnt until I was face to face with him that I realized I was agitated with Dmitry. A part of me blamed him for my whole ordeal. After seeing the caged woman and the terrible state she was in it confirmed Jacks claims of Dmitry. He was a murderer. He was responsible for whatever was happening here. He was responsible for the hell I had to go through with Stacia. And yet, here he was, dancing and partying it up without the slightest regard for other people. Whether it was here or back in America, one way or the other Dmitry was going to die. He would perish because of the decisions I would soon be forced to make. The thought of it made me smile. From behind me I heard a familiar soft buzzing whirling through the air. A small fly innocently zoomed over my head and landed on the opposite wall. Stacia was watching us. "
223,vulnerability,nosleep,The Day of the Dog,10,63c2q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63c2q2/the_day_of_the_dog/,2017-04-04 14:41:52,"Ive seen dogs my whole life. Now, when I say Ive seen dogs my whole life, youre probably thinking that I just happen to run into dogs a lot. Not so. I mean Ive seen them even when they arent actually there. Alright, let me explain. All of this, the unbearable horror that ended up entering my life, it all started when I was ten. I was sitting at my desk at school, writing one of my class journal entries. Im scribbling down why George Washington was my favorite historical figure of all time, when I feel something watching me. You know that feeling you get, when youre being watched? That. I looked over near the door, and sure enough, there were three dogs - a doberman, German shepherd, and a pitbull. Just sitting all bunched up together, their tongues hanging out of open mouths, which were open in that way that makes it look like a smile. They were panting, the way dogs do, and staring at me. Just staring at me. Getting excited, I laughed and pointed at them. Then I looked over at my teacher, Ms. Sangha, seated at her desk. You never said wed get a dog visit! She looked up, looking surprised - and then, slightly confused - as she looked over to where I was pointing. She frowned, looking back at me. Jeremy, Im sorry? she asked, confusion evident in her voice. The dogs! Right there! I said, louder and more excitedly, the smile on my face growing even wider. She glanced back at where I had been pointing, then looked back at me and just stared. After a moment she sighed. Jeremy, go to the principals office. I frowned. Why? I shot out, hurt in my voice. As we were talking, the rest of the class was all staring at me as if I was pulling some odd sort of prank that only I saw the humor in. Disrupting class like this is *not* funny, and I wont tolerate it. Now get to the principals office. Do *not* make me have to ask you again. This time there was hard steel in her voice. Hurt, I got up and started to move toward the door, but what I saw - or rather, didnt see - froze me in my tracks. The dogs were *gone*. Theyd just been there a few seconds ago, out of the corner of my eye. I was standing by my desk, in shock, trying to figure out what was happening. *Jeremy*! Ms. Sanghas loud voice, almost at the level of a yell, jolted me out of my daze, and as I looked over at her, she was pointing toward the door with a very angry look on her face. I ended up getting sent home from school after I refused to admit to the principal that Id made it all up for fun. My parents didnt know what to make of it at first, and they especially didnt know what to make of it when I started seeing dogs at home that werent actually there. They took me to a number of medical professionals, and I got questioned a lot as to what I was seeing, as well as what I was feeling and the like. All the while - through the long car rides to the doctor, to the interviews themselves, to the long car rides home and the ordinary days and everything in between - I kept seeing dogs. All kinds. Poodles, Dobermans, Daschunds, German shepherds, and more. Theyd just be there, staring at me, constantly, with that dog-ish kind of grin on their faces. It was so odd to me, and I had no idea what was happening or going on. At the time, I just trusted that my parents and the doctors would fix; me eventually. I got put on medication. Thing is, it didnt work. Nothing changed. So my doctors decided to up my dosage. Still nothing. I still believed Id turn out alright, that eventually - as long as I was honest with my parents and my doctors about what I was seeing - that Id get set right, and that everything would be alright in the end. Then something happened that changed how I approached this whole matter. I overheard my parents talking one night, when I had started to sneak downstairs for a glass of milk near midnight. What do you want from me? my mother snapped at my father. Look, Shannon, you know as well as I do that something isnt right with the boy. My father sounded frustrated, as if he was at his wits end. Dammit Henry, dont you think I know that? Mom yelled. She sounded as if as if she had hit a limit and couldnt take any more. For a few moments, except for the sound of my parents pacing around the kitchen, there was silence. Tears were threatening to break forth out of my eyes and roll down my chin, and for the first time since this had ever started happening, I was scared. Shannon, Dad said softly, pleadingly, I dont want him to end up in some some institution any more than you do. But if this keeps up, well I understand, Mom said back quickly, quietly. I didnt need to hear any more. I silently crept up back to my room, crawled into bed, and started to sob. This was serious, way more serious than Id imagined it, and my parents - the two people who kept me feeling like everything would be alright in the end - were at the end of their rope and didnt know what to do. What hope was there for me then? Then my mind shifted to how to live with what I had while not getting locked away. I very quickly decided that if the next round of meds worked, great! Amazing! If they didnt, though well, nobody needed to know in that case, did they? The next round of meds came and went. No change. Though, my parents and doctors didnt know that. From what I told them, everything miraculously changed. My parents were over the moon, and so was I, even though nothing had *actually* changed. I guess their joy rubbed off on me. So it went in my life. I grew more and more, graduated from elementary school into junior high, and then into high school, then out of high school into university, and then out of university into a basic office job. All the while, though, the dogs never left me. More than that, more and more of them kept showing up over time. Id be walking down the sidewalk and the street and lawns on either side of the sidewalk would be *filled* with dogs. All of them standing silently still, their mouths hanging open with them panting, all of them staring at me. Every single one of them. There was something else, too. During the day, they wouldnt make a sound. During the night, though? They would all bark their heads off. That part started in high school, and though I couldnt sleep for the first couple nights, I got used to it and was soon able to sleep through it all. Now, you have to understand, over the years Id learned to live with it. Seeing all these dogs all the time? Didnt bother me. It became just an ordinary part of life to me. The way Id come to look at it, I was sick, and this would be with me for my entire life. While that did suck, at least I was able to live with it in a way that you just couldnt with other mental illnesses. But it did have an effect on my life and how I lived it. For one, Id never had a girlfriend in my life. I couldnt think of how to let them into my life and explain what I was going through, what all this was like. I didnt really have any friends, either. When I wasnt working, Id pretty much be at home watching Netflix and playing PC games as the dogs in my place sat on the floor and collectively stared at me. It was lonely, and yeah, it hurt. There were times when I sobbed my eyes out in bed out of sheer frustration at the loneliness and isolation I suffered, and there were times when I - in a panic - wondered how I was even gonna make it to my senior years living like and with this. It was hard, but, you know, I dealt. Then when I was about twenty three, doing data entry at an office job, everything changed. Everything. I was walking to work one day, and of course there was the sea of dogs surrounding me, panting and staring, as they usually did. Something odd caught my eye, though. First I saw it out of the corner of my eye, then - it was literally this jarring - I stopped and turned to get a closer look. It was just off to the side, on the sidewalk opposite to me. It was a dog - looked kind of like a German shepherd - but with snow white fur, and very, very bright blue streaks crisscrossing all over its body fur. On its face, there was a black circle surrounding its right eye, and its eyes well, how to describe this. They were very, very bright green. To the point where they stood out to me, even from across the street. It was almost as if they were two tiny, ball-shaped emeralds stuck in its eye sockets. For a few moments, I just stared at it, furrowing my brow and wondering if this was my disease getting worse, or if I should just shrug this off. As I did so, I felt like how do I put this I felt like it was staring *into me*. Eventually, I guess it reached too deep into me, because I got very - *very* - unsettled, and quickly broke eye contact, moved my line of sight so the dog was no longer in it, and kept moving. On the rest of the way to work, for some reason that strange dog just stayed with me, and more than that, started to kind of really creep me out. There was just something off about it, you know? I made it into the office, and once settled into my cubicle, I went about catching up on my backlog from yesterday. Id had a number of work projects that were starting to weigh me down, so as one does in that sort of situation, Id been doing triage - focus on the most important stuff first. So, thats where my mind and focus was as I got into the office - just focus entirely on this gigantic project that had a deadline three days from then, and then get the rest done in their order of how urgent they were. Thats why I was working my ass off for the next four hours, my eyes not leaving my screen and my hands not leaving my keyboard except to sip from my coffee mug. Its why I didnt notice that, gradually, bit by bit, all the dogs had left my cubicle. Its why I didnt notice that by hour four, for the past two hours there had only been one dog left, staring at my back as it panted from behind me. A dog with emerald green eyes and blue streaks all over its fur. By the time I finished the major project, I realized - before realizing that I really needed to go to the bathroom - that I felt uneasy. Very uneasy. I turned around and, sure enough, there it was - the dog that had been stalking me on my way to work. *Haunting* me on my way to work. For a moment, I was unable to look away from it, as it stared into me - deep into me. What the hell was this? What kind of trick was my mind playing on me? I was confused, and but mainly bothered. Why the hell did my mental illness have to start messing with me like this? As I stared at the dog, I got more and more aggravated that I now had this curveball to deal with. I didnt realize it at the time, but this was the start of the road to my whole Im mentally ill idea and assumption getting blown to bits. Staring at the dog curiously for a few moments, I finally turned around and got back to work. *Stupid hallucination*, I thought to myself, *Itll go away soon.* But it didnt. For the next month, this dog kept stalking me. There was no real consistency in the kinds of dogs that would populate the dogs that stalked me in my day to day life - except for this one. When I went on vacation to Toronto to see family, it was there waiting for me as I got off the airplane. When I was eating dinner with my boss on a company trip to Tokyo, it was sitting next to me in the restaurant. When I was doing *anything*, this dog was there. Sitting still. Smiling at me. Panting the way dogs do. Never even blinking. This started to have an effect on me. I didnt know why at the time, but this dog, this dog in particular, there was something about it. Like, I knew - or at least I thought I knew - that it wasnt real, along with the other dogs I saw. I really was convinced it wasnt real, but it it felt real. It felt as if all the other dogs may or may not be real, but this one, *this* one was different. That was why I felt more and more unsettled the more I saw it. It was why my heart would race more often, and I would feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and I got to the point where I wasnt able to really do my job anymore out of the panic and anxiety that would set in. It was all because no matter where I went, I was never out of this things sight. It all came to a head one night, a month after this dog first appeared. I was laying in bed at around midnight, trying to fall asleep as I was already quite groggy. Nothing out of the ordinary for me. Then it spoke to me. Jeremy, do you want to see something? The voice was slow - a bit too slow - and deep. It sounded kind of friendly, honestly - just this kind, inquisitive tone to it. Still, it shocked the hell out of me. I shot up and looked over at it, my eyes wide open. Its impassive, emerald green eyes stared back at me. My heart was racing, and I did feel somewhat afraid. Like I said, this dog wasnt like the other dogs, and at that moment I wasnt thinking of it in terms of a hallucination, but as an actual real life entity. That line of thought wasnt *logical*, but with my mental state deteriorating for the past month, it was what it was. Not knowing how to respond or react, I stayed silent. I guess it took this as permission to continue speaking, so it did. It wont be anything bad. I just need to show you something. Itll be fun. Youll like it. It paused, then continued - and *this* was the real kicker for me. If you let me show you it, Ill go away once were done. Promise. I dont know why I decided to trust it. Maybe it was me being groggy, maybe it was my mind and mental state having been worn down enough by that point. Maybe I just wanted to believe it, even if it didnt make sense to. So, what can I say? I took it up on its offer. What happened afterward has haunted me ever since. Okay. Show me. Everything changed the moment those words left my mouth. Immediately, I was racing through a vast expanse of a field, with bright red grass under a dark green sky, and I felt *great*. The air slicing past me, my heart pumping more rapidly than Id ever experienced before, and my legs feeling like they could run *forever*, Id never felt more alive. I felt more energy than Id ever felt in my entire life. Though, apart from that, I didnt really know anything at that point, just the fact that I was racing through the grass very, very fast while feeling like a million dollars. As I ran, I examined myself. Glancing down at myself, I saw paws? Dog legs? Son of a bitch I was a *dog*. Looking up again, I cast a glance to both my sides. There were other dogs - dogs Id seen during my day to day life, for years - running alongside me, just as fast, just as furious. Looking up in the sky, I saw not just planets - a number of them, I counted at least five, looming close and huge in the sky - but odd structures. One looked something like a mishmash of medieval castles, though not an asteroid - jagged in shape and as big as a moon in size, floating high up in the sky, somewhere in sub-orbit, if I had to guess. That wasnt all, either. Looking ahead, I finally noticed odd, wavy, coloured lines, intersecting with each other in the air. Focusing in on them, I noticed them running into the earth and into the sky, and following them with my eyes I saw man, how do I describe it? I saw them running and interconnecting through the earth and across the sky. I saw flashes of energy pulse through them, and then I saw that energy flow through the air and the ground, and I felt the power from those lines run through me and fill me. This was it, I realized. This had to be some some kind of set of connections, of power and energy. Did it power life itself? I didnt know, but I had a strong feeling, maybe even a direct understanding, that the life and being of where I was depended on these lines. This was amazing. I felt the sheer power of where I was and what I was, and it was better than I could have ever imagined. As I ran, laughing out loud in loud, ragged barks, I felt the strange dog - the one that brought me here - run up beside me. Looking over at it with a gigantic smile on my face, it met my eyes and asked me, Do you want to see more? I couldnt say Yes fast enough. God, why did I say yes? It was so fast. One moment, I was feeling like a god, and the next Cold. So, so cold. An empty expanse of darkness. It was like I was floating in space, except it couldnt have been space because there were no stars. Hugging my - I now realized naked - body and shaking violently due to the cold, I tried to get some measure on where I was. No luck. After floating in the darkness for a long while, I started thinking, what was this? What was that dog getting at? Was it good, or evil, or something else? I started to get very anxious and worried, very fast, and my heart started throwing itself against my chest hard, over and over, as I tried to work out how to get out of this situation. Then then I felt something. This creepy, weird feeling as if something was examining me. As if I was being watched. Not just that, either. It felt like something out there was looking *into* me. Floating there in the darkness, feeling utterly naked and vulnerable, I started to feel real, actual, raw fear, as whatever it was that was out there peered inside of me, rooting through my innermost aspects. I felt that my thoughts were naked and exposed, even being combed through by what was out there, and so I felt very uncomfortable even thinking anything conscious or deliberate. Tears of shame and vulnerability started to well in my eyes as I felt that my innermost emotions, and fears, and desires, were deeply and utterly *known*. Its hard to describe, but I felt like I was utterly and completely exposed. Then, what was out there stepped forth. Floating in the darkness, something started to fade into being. Then, after a few moments, I saw it fully. It was a beast. Tall, large, and twisted in form and shape. So many limbs and teeth. It was unlike any animal Id ever seen in my life, or that had ever even existed on earth, I think. Its claws, jagged and sharp, shiningly wet and dripping with god, was that blood? Its teeth so, so sharp. Horror and terror simultaneously rose within me as I gazed on this being as it approached me, staring at me with an icy coldness that stunned me to my core. I knew immediately that this was the being that looked inside of me. Then, I - by accident, mostly - gazed into its eyes. That was what started everything else. Its eyes locked with mine, and I really *saw*. I saw vicious hunger, wild ferocity, and horrible coldness. I saw, as it looked over me, something that didnt regard me as a being of any worth  at best, I was something not worth its time, and at worst, something to be devoured. The way it was looking at me, though, I could tell immediately that it was the latter. Fear overtook me and I started shaking even more violently, tears running down my face as I desperately, madly wished I was anywhere else. Something weird happened at that point. All this time, I was looking into its eyes. Then, it started to intensely gaze into mine. As it did, I saw so, so much more. What I saw kept me up at night for months afterward. A wild montage of images and visions. Its hard to describe. The blood. The flame. A woman, dressed in what appeared to be ceremonial garb, smiling serenely as she took an ornate-looking dagger and sliced her throat open, falling to the ground as a pack of dogs trotted over and started to lick at and drink the blood flowing from her neck. Beings like the beast I saw feasting my god, the feasting Hordes of dogs ripping apart and eating men, women and children, laughing in high-pitched barks at their victims screams. Not just those, either, but more, so much more. The images and visions moved faster and faster, switching from one to the other. Near the end of it I was screaming at the top of my lungs for it to stop, but I knew that the only things that heard me scream were the ones causing it to happen. Then, as quickly as it moved, it stopped. I was back in the empty void, floating. The beast was no longer there. A dog was. An ordinary, simple looking dog. A German shepherd, it looked like. Our eyes matched. What I saw horrified me. I saw what I saw in the eyes of the beast. It was the same. Everything started to sink in. As it did, I started to scream uncontrollably as wild fear and panic overtook me. As I was screaming, I noticed that I was back home, sitting up in my bed. Catching myself, I stopped, and noticed that my heart was beating wildly as tears ran down my face, vicious sobs overtaking me. Looking over to that strange dog, I noticed something. It was laughing. Laughing, joyfully and gleefully. This little fucker had put me through hell and it was *laughing*. What the *hell* did you do to me!? I yelled at it, rage boiling up inside of me. It stopped laughing and gazed at me. You saw. It said it happily, as if itd done something great. I breathed heavily, not knowing what to say. It continued. What existed before, long before this universe was born, will come again. After all, weve always been around, havent we? I understood its meaning. The eyes of the beast. The eyes of the dog. Immediately after it finished saying this, it turned around and trotted casually out of the room. I didnt sleep that night. After I headed outside the next morning, I noticed something immediately that jarred me. There were no dogs. I mean, outside Id see *actual* dogs, that were real, but the ones that only I could see? None of them. They were gone, every single one of them. So it turned out that I wasnt mentally ill. I wasnt sick. I never was. What the truth turned out to be, though, was far, far worse. What I saw and experienced that night stayed with me. I couldnt shake it. From that night on, for months afterward, there was this constant feeling of anxiety - this tightness in my chest and nervous fear, both of which never left. I started to see life as pointless, because in the end, it was. I knew what would happen, I knew what would come, so what was the point? Then there were the dogs. Id see, every now and then, people walking their dogs, or stray dogs crossing my path. Every single time when I caught them looking at me, I saw that they were, in their own way, smiling at me. As if they were laughing. They were in on the game, and so was I. Its been a year since that night. Im now in my garage, and the noose is tied and ready for me. Ive thought long and hard about this, and Im satisfied in the choice Ive made. Life still does have beauty in it, but Im not willing to stick around to see how it ends. I dont want to be around on the day that those *things* show up. I dont want to be around for the day of the dog. --- [X](URL [X](URL [X](URL"
224,vulnerability,nosleep,The Insect In My Brain,170,64mq1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64mq1g/the_insect_in_my_brain/,2017-04-11 08:04:14,"Ever had an itch you can't scratch? I once watched a documentary about people who had lost limbs but still had itches in places that no longer existed. From what I saw, it slowly drove them crazy, because it was all in their head. I sympathize, but my problem's a bit worse than that. Try as I might, I can't scratch *memories*, and I certainly can't squash the bugs that have gotten in them. I first noticed the original insect when I was talking about an old story with friends. We were out for a drink at a bar, and a strange spiked-shell bug about the size of a dime began crawling across the table between uswait, no, that's not how it happened! They're in my memories, you see? That bug is skittering through my memory of the bar *now*, it wasn't there the first time. I know because I wrote it down! I trust my writing. No, the first bug I noticed was in a story I was recounting at the bar. I was talking about a concert I'd gone to about six years before, and I began describing a horrifying little bug that had crawled over my hand while I'd sat in the grass. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and I went on and on describing it; my friend had been there, but he didn't remember the incident. Another friend confirmed. That led me to the strange notion that I was remembering events incorrectly. But I could *see* the bug. As much as it made me shudder, I focused my inner awareness upon the memory, and I watched it wander around the grass. Was I remembering it differently from moment to moment? It had a dark blue shell with tiny spines; the sight of it triggered innate disgust and revulsion, but I couldn't control the me in my memory and jump away. Whenever I did try to move away, the bug vanished from sight, because I was really just imagining the motionactive change brought me out of memory and into imagination. For that first week, most of my mental time was spent watching that bug. As I sat at work or in the car on the commute, I was only half-present, for my other half was at that concert six years ago watching a horrifying bug crawl upon oblivious friends and strangers. They were just memories clapping along to the music or drinking beers in clear plastic cups, but it still made me shudder to watch it crawl up their arms or around their faces. At one point, it fell into a sloshing beer and got trapped trying to move its repulsive little legs fruitlessly back and forth in the amber froth, and I thought my troubles were over. I called up that friend and asked if he remembered a weird bug falling in his beer at that concert. He said that he ""did, yeah man, at least I think. When was that again? Six years ago? Yeah, I think I remember that."" He didn't seem convinced, and I began reading up on how memories are formed. Apparently, memory is very untrustworthy, and people form false interpretations of events all the time based on prompts and a little unconscious imagination. Did he really remember the bug in his beer? Or had I prompted him to envision something that had never happened? Of course, I had other things to worry about at the time, so I let it go for a bit. Instead of staring at the bug at the concert six years before, I spent my nights staring at the divorce papers on my kitchen table. In some ways, my empty apartment was like the palace of memory I'd been reading about: every object and corner held some mental tag to a previous event, now soured and full of lies. The second time it happened, I was sitting at that table staring at a particular paper cup that had been left out for several months. Like the concert, it was another memory of her; we were at a coffee shop doing nothing in particular when a smaller bug began crawling up her cup. It was not the same bug from before, but it was dark blue, spined, and clearly the same species. She just kept smiling. Did she not see the horrifying *thing* moving down her fingers and along the back of her hand? This time, instead of being captivated by the insect, I tried not to think about that coffee shop. If I just didn't go near that memory, then everything would be alright. But no. I could feel a *festering* outside the edges of my awareness, and, next time I lookedonce I finally couldn't help it anymoreI also saw a number of small dots along the side of the coffee cup. I watched them day in and day out until they grew larger. Then, I knew. They were eggs. I continued going to social events and nodding along to conversations as my friends talked around me, but I couldn't really hear them. All I could think about was the disgusting horror growing in my mind. What would happen when those eggs hatched? How had the smaller bug gotten to a different memory from the concert? At times, someone would ask me if I was alright, but I just smiled and claimed that I was. How could I tell them that my brain was becoming infested? Books. Articles. Online research. You know what's amazing? Lucid dreaming actually worked for a little while. Each night, I practiced keeping my awareness as I sank into dreams. There, the fusion of imagination and memory allowed me to act for the first time, and I rushed forward, slapped the bug off her hand, and stomped the coffee cup and its dime-sized black eggs. But when I woke up, I found that I'd just worsened the problem. I'd created a new memory of the coffee shop, the slapping, and the stomping, but the original memory still existed. Try as I might, I could never alter the original memory, and on the fifth successful lucid dreaming attempt I missed a few of the eggs and found that I'd just created more. I was no longer staring at divorce papers on the kitchen table. Now, those were buried under piles of bills. I'd pay them eventually. I still went to work and sat through my day; I had money. I just really needed to deal with this infection of the mind first. After I paid the bills, I'd shower, too. As I'd feared, they began wandering into other memories. A woman approached me at the bar before my friends arrived, but all I could think about was how any memories I created with her would just be infested sooner rather than later. What's a pretty face with bugs crawling on it? At home, in the car, at work, out with friends, I was near to screaming every moment of every day. Two bugs, six bugs, ten. Fifty bugs, a hundred, a thousand crawling along every moment of the last six years of my life. Worse, they were starting to crawl on *me*, and I could feel their horrible little legs as itching on my skin. Scratching my real arms didn't helpthe itch was on remembered skin, for the bugs were on remembered limbs. Friends asked about my nervous itching and now-visible tension, but I just kept smiling and saying I was alright. There was no way to share this problem. They'd never believe me. They'd never understand. So, I stopped going out with them. The itching began small, but grew to maddening over the course of time. Scratching did nothing, even if I scraped down to lower layers of my skin. I turned to online research again, and I read about reflection therapy; those who had lost a limb and had itches there could assuage it by using a mirror to simulate the missing area while scratching the real one. It was all in the mind, they said. Real mirrors wouldn't work for me, because the itch was not on a physical spot lost. What would work? At home and itching in the dark among piles of discarded fast food bags, I began envisioning an imagined version of me. He was happy, successful, and loved. Life was good for him. Brush the bugs off of me, I told him, and he came close and began slapping them away and stomping on their overturned and scrambling forms. For a moment, it worked. But then the bugs covered him, too, and nickel and dimed his flesh until he was just bones. He screamed while it happened, but only in that half-heard hollow sense that imagined sounds hold. Traumatized and demoralized, I kept doing research, kept telling myself I would beat this, that bugs in my memories had to have a vulnerability. If I began with the assumption that they were real, then they were creatures of the mental plane somehow. What connected them to my physical self? What *was* consciousness? Scratching open sores constantly, stinking to high heaven, and constantly muttering to myself, I knew I was at my wit's end. I could see it. I could see myself. In the mirror, the bugs were crawling upon my skin openly. It was awareness. It was thought. It was all in the mind, they'd said. That's what this note is about. I've crafted a careful plan, done my research, and mapped out as much as I could, but I'm still quite aware of the danger. I want you to know that I'm not insane, and that it's not your fault. I also want it on the record that my friends had nothing to do with this; I stole the knives and drills without their knowledge. I've sanitized everything and set up as sterile an operation room as I can. I'm not crazy. This is really happening, and it's the only way. I already know I'm right because I've made one drill hole and the bugs are beginning to spill out all over the floor and skitter away. I have to complete this surgerybecause it's all in my head. --- [+](URL"
225,vulnerability,nosleep,Words I Can't Take Back,122,65exqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65exqm/words_i_cant_take_back/,2017-04-15 06:16:40,"My grandmother said that I should always be careful of everything I say, especially when I am angry, because words have power and once that power is unleashed, it cannot be reeled back. How does the old saying go? ""Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me""? Total bullshit. I wasn't a popular girl in high school. I was a short, skinny, black-haired girl who kept to myself in a school where the gods and goddesses were the dancers, singers, and theater kids. It was a performing arts school and I was there not because I wanted to be in front of spotlight, but behind it. My art was stagecraft and that was everything from creating sets, setting up lights and audio, and assisting with makeup and costumes. In the school totem pole, I'm just right below the orchestra kids, but above the Yearbook, Newspaper, and Photography kids. No one really liked the photography kids too much because they always smelled like vinegar and never stopped creeping around the campus with a camera pressed to their faces. What set me apart from the other burnouts and losers in my high school was that I was pretty. Really pretty. I had a heart-shaped face with big green eyes and pink full lips. I also had the delicate, vulnerability thing that guys go crazy for, like I was this helpless, little fluffy bunny who needed a big, strong warrior to protect me. My friend Melissa always says that I am a Japanese animation character come to life. I'm not trying to brag or anything--and really, it's nothing to brag about--but I used to have high school boys follow me around, bothering me for a date or my phone number. And it wasn't just my schoolmates. My male teachers gave me looks that made me feel uncomfortable, too. But that was before the *Incident*. After a few occurrences during lunch when a girl would accuse me of stealing her man and try to fight me, I began to avoid the lunch arena. I was really tired of having my brown bag snatched from me and thrown into the trash. I started to hang out in the library at lunch in between the stacks of philosophy and literature. You're not really allowed to eat in the library, but I was a really good student and often helped out the librarian in my spare time, so she gave me special permission. I also told her I was being bullied and she sympathized with me because her kid Howard, who played the oboe, was also bullied. There wasn't anything I could do to protect myself in between walking to classes, so I was often shoved to the wall, tripped, had my hair pulled, and called all sorts of colorful names synonymous to trollop. ""I don't understand why you won't just tell your counselor about this,"" my friend Kirsten said one day as we were walking to Pre-Calculus. ""In a normal high school, you would be one of the most popular girls because you're a total Heather."" Kirsten was chubby and always wore black. Her hair was naturally blond, but she dyed it black though it had been a while since she had done a touch-up because she had about two inches of grow-out. She also wore horn-rimmed glasses and had a cute button nose. She usually hung out with the goth kids and the kids who listened to metal and industrial. I really liked her. She was surprisingly shy and kind. ""Oh, fuck off, I'm Veronica and you know it,"" I replied with a smirk. ""Am I blond and blue-eyed? Am I in a cheerleader's uniform?"" Kirsten began to tell me about the book she had just finished reading, which was about dragons and different families and factions fighting to control a kingdom. Whenever Kirsten talked about a book she loved, her face lit up and she almost looked pretty. I was so absorbed with what she was saying that I didn't notice that I was about to walk into a girl who hated my guts. She could have stepped aside to avoid me, but instead, she went full speed ahead and collided into me, bringing up her hands so she could shove me on the chest. I wasn't paying attention, so I lost my balance and landed on my ass. The impact shot up a bolt of pain from my butt to the back of my head. Everyone who witnessed my fall laughed. ""Skank,"" Alice Hernandez hissed next to my ear, before she continued walking on with her minions who were giggling and high-fiving each other. A torrent of rage surged through me like a wildfire. I wanted to fly after her and tackle her to the ground to pull her hair out of her scalp. I wanted to yank her eyeballs out. I wanted to pull her tongue out and strangle her with it. But instead I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, releasing it in a shuddering exhale. The bitch was not worth it. Kirsten pulled me up to my feet and briskly brushed my back with the flat of her hand. ""God, what's her problem? You should really tell Mr. Martinez about her. I caught her smoking in the bathroom with her stupid friends yesterday, you know."" Mr. Martinez was the assistant dean of students. I rolled my eyes. Though she didn't look it, Kirsten was a total square and always aghast when she saw her fellow students do ""bad"" things. I have met her parents. They were beautiful, clean-cut, upper middle-class TV Land people. Kirsten would insist she was the bad sheep, but her loving mother would just say that Kirsten was an artist and thus, allowed to express herself in eccentric ways. ""Michael Rivers has been texting me and following me around. We're partnered for a project in Chemistry, so we've had to talk outside of class. Naturally, Alice thinks I want her braindead jock boyfriend."" That was a regular day. For the most part I was left alone, since I mostly kept to myself and hung out with the kids who spent their entire high school years flying under the radar. Sure, I got glares and dirty looks. Some girls whispered about me and called me names as I walked by. I got pushed and shoved and tripped. I received nasty text messages and voice mails. At least twice a month, a girl would corner me in the bathroom, shove me against the wall, and screech at me to stay away from her man or she would tear my eyes out. These occurrences became pretty routine. I used become enraged and plot revenge against these girls and fantasize about killing them, but that got to be exhausting, and soon my attitude fell along the lines of, ""Come at me. Get in line."" I think the fact that I was so indifferent about it infuriated some of the girls even more. There were only a few more months before graduation. I only had to hold on for just a little bit longer. I had gotten accepted to my number one school of choice, Brown, which meant I was going to be moving out of state. I was super excited. I had never lived outside of California before and even though I was a little nervous about leaving the house I lived in with my parents, I was thrilled, too, because I was finally going to get away from the petty, little sandbox that had trapped me for years. I was going to have a new life. Just a few more months... all I had to do was to lay low. I should have realized that it was not going to be that easy. There was a boy named Keith Anderson who really, really liked me. He was cute and smart and I kind of liked him back, but I wasn't really interested in getting involved with anyone since we were about to graduate and I was going to spend the summer on a cross country road trip with my cousins. I also knew that Keith Anderson was dating Aphrodite Wilson until recently and they had been together since the ninth grade. I didn't get intimidated by anyone in school, but Aphrodite was a different breed of girl. She was beautiful, smart, president of the student body, and rumor had it that she got into Harvard on early admission. Most importantly, she wasn't an asshole. But I heard her break-up with Keith really changed her. She'd always strutted around campus with an extra bounce in her step, a confident girl with shiny brown hair, blue eyes, and sparkling, white teeth. Most of the boys in school worshipped her from afar. She was the goddess of beauty and love. But after the break-up, Aphrodite really went through a radical physical change. She started coming to school dressed in jeans and a hoodie, with no makeup, even though she was the trendsetter and the fashion diva of the campus. She always used to have a smile and a wave for everyone she passed in the hallways, but now she walked around with a perma-bitch face and a don't-fuck-with-me attitude. She was even sarcastic and rude to the teachers. Before all this, she and I had always been friendly with each other, though we were never exactly friends. But one day, as I was heading to my French class, she plowed into me with her shoulder like she meant to knock me down and kept on walking. There was pure hatred in her eyes as she targeted me. I staggered against my friend Kirsten who just shook her head and sighed. ""Does she even know you blew off Keith when he asked you out?"" she demanded. ""She probably heard that I blew Keith and asked him out,"" I muttered, blinking back the tears that sprung to my eyes. I thought I didn't care anymore that people in this school hated my guts, but to have the nicest girl in school want to kick my ass was just too much. ""Ugh, I don't feel like going to class anymore. Do you want to ditch?"" Kirsten's eyes widened. ""Julie, we have a big vocabulary test in French today."" I closed my eyes and had to laugh. I was grateful to have Kirsten as a friend. ""All right. Come on, nerdling."" Kirsten and I lived a block from each other, so we always walked home together. Most of the time, we had sleepovers. Either she would sleep over at my house or I would sleep over at hers. Of course everyone in school think we're lesbians who are dating and scissoring each other every night. High school gossip is really stupid and contradictory. How could I both be a lesbian and an insatiable man-eating whore? That night's sleepover was at my house. I had a full-sized bed, but Kirsten always brought a sleeping bag and slept on the floor. Usually we spent the night watching horror movies and eating junk food. Sometimes, we invented personalities and chatted up strangers in chat rooms, both coming up with increasingly ridiculous things to say. When we got bored of that, we scrolled through the Myspace pages of our classmates and schoolmates, making fun of people's posted thoughts and poems. I didn't have a Myspace page of my own, but that night, we found one that I supposedly created. It had a bunch of pictures of me and journal entries that I supposedly wrote, talking about going out and having sex with all of these boys from school. I was horrified. Who had made this page? I couldn't even cry, I was so shocked. I'd stayed quiet and kept my head down throughout my entire high school years, but enough was enough. I emailed the Myspace administrators to take down the page because I had not created it and spent all night crying. Thankfully, the next day was a Saturday, so I didn't have to face anyone from school. Kirsten tried to cheer me up, but there was no use. I was sick of being bullied and not getting any payback. I had never told Kirsten, but I used to have really violent and gory dreams about killing my tormentors, especially on the days when the bullying was pretty bad. If Kirsten knew that I had used Alice Hernandez as target for my archery practice in my dreams, she would probably be really upset. I even had a dream that had me going to school with assault rifles and gunning down all my tormentors one by one, while laughing maniacally. Instead of being horrified about this as soon as I woke up, I found myself fairly happy about it. Those dreams comforted me. ""Do you still want to go Kate O'Brien's party tonight?"" Kirsten asked, not looking at me. I knew she wanted to go, but out of solidarity, she would't go if I didn't. Kate O'Brien was a really nice girl who was friends with everyone at school, losers and popular kids alike. She just didn't have a bad word to say about anybody. And she was as beautiful on the outside as she was on the inside. It was a big deal to be invited to one of Kate's parties because her parents were really rich so they lived in a giant house on the other side of town and they had a large swimming pool. On top of that, her parties were usually catered, so the food was always pretty good. Not that it was very hard to get an invitation to Kate's parties. Like I said, Kate was friends with everyone and everyone she was friends with was welcome to her house. ""I don't know,"" I replied, yanking up some of the grass I was sitting on and flinging it away. We were sitting in my backyard, hanging out and watching over my younger siblings. My parents were out running errands, so the little jerks were left to me. My brother Alex received a microscope and a biology set for his birthday, so he and my other little brothers are exploring the yard and looking for gross things to study under the microscope. Alex was eleven, Jack was eight, and Henry was six. After giving birth to me, Mom decided to go to grad school before having Alex, so that's why he and I are almost seven years apart. I often wondered who would watch over them once I was away at college. Gee, my folks would have to shell out cash for a real babysitter. Or start hauling the little jerks around. ""Skylar and the rest of the gang are going to be there,"" said Kirsten. She was French-braiding my hair on one side of my head; she had separated the other half in a side ponytail to be worked on after. ""You know the happy, shiny kids are scared of them because they think they worship the devil or something."" I rolled my eyes. ""That's so stupid."" But I did like the idea of showing up to Kate's party with my posse of goth kids that everyone in school thought were devil worshippers. I'd always liked Skylar and her friends. They were smart and funny and the most well-read people I'd ever met. ""And the food is always good, I guess. And there's bound to be booze, since Kate's parents are out of town."" What else was I going to do with my Saturday night except mope around and watch TV when the rest of my friends were out partying with the entire school? I wasn't much of a party person, but I knew if I stayed home, my parents were likely to stick me with the boys, and go out themselves. ""I guess I'll go,"" I said with a sigh. ""I have nothing better to do tonight."" *And really, I should have stayed home because if I had, maybe Aphrodite Wilson would still be alive and nobody would be calling me a witch or a murderer.* The party started out pretty tame. When my crew and I got there, there were only about twenty or so kids so far and the vibe was easygoing. Most of the kids were in the pool already, while some were standing around by the buffet tables, filling up their plates with food. Kate approached me as soon as I walked in and pulled me aside. ""Hey, I'm really happy you're here tonight, Julie,"" she said in an almost whisper. ""I just want to warn you that Aphrodite is going to be here too and she hasn't been doing well with the whole Keith thing and she kind of..."" ""Hates my ass, I know,"" I finished for her, feeling this uneasy lump settle in my stomach. ""I'll stay out of her way. Don't worry, there won't be a rumble in your party. Is it okay if we stake out the gazebo as our spot for the evening?"" The gazebo was off to the side of the pool and a little hidden by some brush. It was decorated with strings of lights all over and looked really pretty at night. ""Absolutely."" Kate looked relieved and gave me a hug. ""I'll casually let everyone know that's your territory."" Jesus, I thought as I walked back to my friends. You'd think this shit was the West Side Story. Skylar, whose long, black hair was streaked with pink locks slung her arm around my neck, while I sought out Kirsten's hand with my own. It felt good to have backup. There were eight of us. Five girls who shopped at Hot Topic and three emo boys who looked like they were members of My Chemical Romance. We headed for the gazebo, which I told them was going to be our base for the evening. The first half of the evening was pretty fun. My friends and I got food and booze, which we brought back to the gazebo, and we ate and drank while talking about horror movies, our favorite subject. It felt like we had our own little party. Kate stopped by everyone once and a bit and socialized with us. Skylar told me that Kate was probably happy that she managed to corral the pale goth freaks in one corner. I agreed with her, but didn't say anything. It was the second half evening when everything turned to shit. First of all, it started to rain and Kate was super bummed because she had checked the weather forecast and there was supposed to be no chance of rain tonight. Most people went inside, but the people in the swimming pool stayed and hung out, since the water was nice and heated. My tribe stayed in the gazebo because it was bound to be packed inside Kate's house and we already had a roof over our heads. It was turning out to be a pretty good night and I was glad I had come out because I sometimes forget that I had more friends besides Kirsten and that I was going to miss them when I moved out of state for college. All of a sudden, there was a change in the atmosphere. Though it was raining, the wind was warm and seemed to crackle with electricity. I was talking to Skylar about the road trip I was going to be making with my cousins over the summer, when she raised her eyebrows and nudged her head, indicating there was someone behind me. It was Keith Anderson. He looked really cute tonight and when he smiled, dimples popped at both sides of his cheeks. Instead of excitement, I had this terrible feeling of dread, like some shit is going to go down. I had to get rid of the guy before anyone saw him hanging out around me and told Aphrodite. I promised Kate there wouldn't be any drama. ""Hey, Keith,"" I said warily. ""Can you... go somewhere else right now? I don't want any drama tonight and there will definitely be one if your ex-girlfriend sees you with me."" Keith had his hands in the pockets of his jacket and the look on his face was resolute. Thats her problem, Julie. She and I are over. I want to get to know you. I want to be with you. I had never really had a boyfriend before and this was really nice to hear. I was always really involved with my books and studying. The social aspect of my life just wasnt that important to me. Keith, look, I like you, too Over his shoulder, I could see a group of girls exiting Kates house through the sliding door to return to pool party. One of them was Aphrodite. This is just not a good idea, okay? I just dont You skanky bitch! The screech directed at me was full of venom and hatred. Aphrodites eyes were narrowed with malice, but tears were rolling down her cheeks as she strode toward me with her posse. Keith caught her before she could launch herself at me. I had never faced so much anger, never mind that it was one directed at me. Her fingers were curled into claws and she was kicking and spitting at me. I was almost fascinated by it. Here was a person considered to be a good girl by everyone at school completely unhinged and losing her shit over a boy. She was a crazy, hysterical mess that Keith could barely control and Keith was a big guy. He played football and was on the wrestling team. I had Skylar and Kirsten holding me back. I was furious. I was having a great time with my friends and this bitch had to ruin it with some petty high school shit that I didnt even care about. I was sick of it. I wanted to tear her apart and choke her with her own hair. I wanted to punch her nose in and keep punching until her face was an unrecognizable pulp. She just kept screaming at me. You fucking whore! Everyone knows youve slept with every guy at school! You dirty bitch! Im going to kill you! Me, I was beyond words. My mind was a maelstrom of fury and loathing, pent up from all the years I told myself to suck it up and walk away. I was seeing red. I wanted to grab the nearby beer bottle and break it so I could stab her over and over with it. I wanted to pluck her eyeballs out and smash them under my feet. And the anger felt good. It was a surge of energy that was exhilarating, nothing that Ive ever felt before. I really wanted to kill the bitch. Come on, Di, shes not worth it, one of her friends said, trying to pull her away. Kate herself had come out and was standing between us. She was looking at me with disappointment and I was outraged. I didnt start this shit. She went up to Aphrodite and talked to her in soft tones, consoling her and steering her toward the house. It looked like Kate was going to succeed. Aphrodite was still crying and simpering about what a slutty whore I was, but she was allowing Kate to lead her in. Keith remained where he was standing before the drama started and I stared at him in disbelief. Dude, are you crazy? I demanded. This you and me thing aint gonna happen. Did you see that shit? I cant deal with that. I dont want to deal with it. Keith looked at me sadly for a long moment, then he nodded and walked away. I turned to my friends, dragging my hand through my hair. Goddamn it, this is why I hate these parties. People always want to fight over the pettiest shit. I need a drink. A girl named Rachel, who had red and black hair, took my hand and said, Ill go with you. You might need backup, you know. And Ive been itching for a good fight for years. If I could take down a Barbie doll tonight, that will make up for the shit I suffered from ninth grade on. I chuckled dryly and we left the gazebo to walk to the other side of the pool where Kate had a giant keg and a couple of coolers filled with different kinds of beer. I had zero warning. I wasnt even thinking about Keith and Aphrodite anymore. Which was why I was caught off balance when this force came at me from the side and shoved me into the pool. It was the shallower end, so my head hit the floor and almost knocked me out. Since it was a head wound, it bled profusely and the kids that were in the water freaked out and noped the fuck out of there. I looked up and saw Aphrodite standing with Kate by the railing and she looked horrified. Her hands were covering her mouth and she was in tears. She was saying, Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry. Someone tossed me a towel which I pressed to my head. My brother can drive you to the hospital, said Kate. We cant really call the ambulance here, with all the alcohol and stuff. I didnt really care about that shit, though. I was staring at Aphrodite with disgust. If youre going to do some damage, own it. You cant stab someone, realize you did a bad thing, and say, Im sorry. You have to commit to what you did. Kirsten and Skylar came into the pool to help me out. Even Aphrodite held out a hand to pull me out of the water, but I just glared at her. I looked at her as though she was a piece of shit. And then I said, Drop dead, you stupid bitch. There wasnt a bolt of lightning or a crack of thunder after I said those words. They were just words. It wasnt until I was out of the pool that I fell to my knees and lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was in the hospital and my mom was sitting next to me. She smiled when I opened my eyes. Its about time, she said. Your friends are here. Ill get you something to eat from the cafeteria. Do you want some chocolate pudding? My visitors were Kirsten, Skylar, and Rachel, and they all looked paler than usual and pretty terrible, like they havent had a good nights sleep in a couple of days. None of them could look me in the eyes and no one spoke up immediately as they came up to the side of my bed. It was kind of creepy. What? I demanded, sensing that something was wrong. It was Skylar who answered. She looked like shed been crying. Aphrodite, Michelle Sanders, April Chang, and Melanie Tanaka are dead. You know that sickly feeling you get when you tilt back too much in your chair and you fall, the seconds just before the crash? *The Im gonna die feeling?* I suddenly had that times a hundred. I couldnt believe what I was hearing. Skylar had to be joking. What the fuck are you talking about? On the night of Kates party, said Kirsten. They were driving home in the rain when the semi in front of them lost control and flipped over, crushing them. My last words to Aphrodite reverberated in my ears. *Drop dead, you stupid bitch.* No way. It was just a coincidence. I had nothing to do with their deaths. But it didnt feel that way. I turned my head to the side opposite my friends and vomited. What the fuck. I say Drop dead and four people die? I searched my memories to see if there was any other time in my life that Id said those words. Shit, Im sure I said them lots of times in elementary school. I covered my face with my hands, feeling the bandage that covered my temple. Its not your fault, Julie, said my best friend Kirsten. You said those words in the heat of the moment. They had nothing to do with the accident. It was raining, Aphrodite had been drinking, and she couldnt have avoided that truck even if she were sober. But four people are dead, I said numbly. And you had nothing to do with it, Rachel insisted. For Gods sake, you probably had a concussion when you said those words. And its not like you tampered with their car or anything! But the rest of the school didnt see it that way. My reputation, which wasnt all that great to begin with, tanked even lower. For weeks, the landline at my parents house rang nonstop and every time we picked up the phone, it would be some asshole shouting Killer or Witch before slamming the phone down. It got so bad that my parents had to change their number. I sank into deep depression and didnt want to go to school anymore. Why would I? In the hallways, kids would call me a murderer or say things like, Burn the witch! But I told myself that I had to persevere and I wasnt going to let these losers keep me down. I resolved to put up with it even after my car got vandalized and my tires were shredded into ribbons. One time, one of Aphrodites friends got in my face and I justsnapped. I grabbed her by the throat and shoved her against the wall. If I really am a witch who could kill people with just words, why the hell would you mess with me? Are you stupid? After I let her go, she looked at me like I was the devil incarnate and ran down the hallway. That did nothing to fix my reputation. On the day of graduation, Aphrodite Wilson and the others received honorary high school diplomas and their parents walked across the stage to receive them. People cheered and gave them standing ovations, which I thought was kind of weird. What did their children accomplish but die? When it was my turn to receive my diploma, there were boos and jeers and taunts of killer and I was ashamed because my family, including my brothers, were in the audience. My mother told me later that another parent had asked her why they were calling me a killer. Without missing a beat, my mother replied, Oh, shes the salutatorian. She absolutely killed the curve. "
226,vulnerability,nosleep,Why I Need to Return to Hell,53,65iskm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65iskm/why_i_need_to_return_to_hell/,2017-04-15 22:14:51,"I never wanted to go to hell. In fact, until I made my way there, I never even believed in hell. Hell was a fable, a bedtime story for sniveling children and their exasperated parents. Hell was a manipulative tool that adulterous pastors sold their flock in depopulated pews on Sunday morning. Hell was not a mystery. It was a myth. And now it is so much more. It started when I was being eaten. I would wake up at night or early in the morning with the sores. My sheets and comforter were stained with blood. I would scream and my neighbor would pound against the wall, silencing me. No one around me could fathom this sensation. At first this was humiliating. My doctor had no explanation for it. She convinced me, after a time, that it was all in my head. I still remember the day that I came to her, my wounds still fresh. The garish sun was obscured by brooding clouds and the soft rains of the fall. I clutched my overcoat against my beaten body, my gnawed nails clinging to its cloth. Beneath my cloaked figure I could still feel the bite. The mark of the mites that devoured me in my slumber. And I knew that when I dreamed again, they would find me. And they would feed. My doctor claims she saw none of this. She listened patiently for five minutes as I described my symptoms, her eyes widening when I disrobed to reveal the shameful cavities that were littered across my skin. Put that away, please. She glared at me. She did not dress like any physician I had seen before. Her neck and bosom were exposed to me, and her black skirt reached just below her knees. She had no sores to conceal from the world. She could never understand the shame I felt when she shook her head in disgust as I pulled my clothes against my skin again. She could never appreciate the vulnerability I felt under the gaze of her judgment. Anxiety, she insisted. Point five milligrams of xanax should take care of it. She dismissed me like a common leper. The drugs did not work. If anything they exacerbated my condition. And paved the way for my glorious trek to that place that I regarded as little more than legend. People imagine hell as a continuous cycle of torment beyond the imagination of our mundane minds. But hell is nothing like the folk tales of our ancestors. The first night I descended to hell was a magnificent transfiguration. I can still remember the feel of the cold stone slab of the altar, my naked backside against it as they devoured me, slowly but steadily consuming my flesh. I remember the exquisite humiliation of their laughter as it echoed into the eternal night. My virgin body shuddered. I achieved orgasm after orgasm, an endless dance of blood, semen and excrement. I was awake. I was alive. As my tormentors dug into my veins, I knew that this world was more real than the vale of tears my soiled remains had left behind. When I was pulled from hell I had no idea how much time had passed. Hours? Days? Weeks? Months? Years? It did not matter. The only thing that mattered was returning to it. At first I tried to replicate the experience, taking a knife to my skin. But there was no transfiguration, no transcendence. And hells minions abandoned me to my own devices. My nocturnal feasts came to an end, and my skin, once scarred, began to heal. Once you have tasted hell there is no going back. There is no pain or pleasure in the waking world that can even begin to mimic its majesty. I tried everything: Conjuring, seances, psychics, tarot. In my desperation I even turned to an exorcist. But no one could tell me how to return to hell. That was when I realized that if I could not return to hell, I could, perhaps, bring hell to this pale shadow. And thats when the work began. It began with my neighbor. I had to be careful, of course. In hell my screams echoed into nothingness, but in this world her screams could waken those who would disturb my craft. After three days, she screamed no more. My methods were still rudimentary of course. I was not blessed with the talents or tools of a skilled craftsman. I was not a surgeon. Not even a doctor. But I do know a doctor. And even if I cannot recreate hell, well...now that I know that hell is no myth, I can hasten my final arrival. "

It looked like some kind of dying holdover from the Route 66 road trip glory days. The exterior was a faded pink, and it still had the blinding red Vacancy light on the sign. Halloways Hotel. It was ironically ideal for my getaway. After I left Lori, I decided to go on a long solo drive across country. She would never have agreed to stay in such a kitsch dump, and I took perverse pleasure in this knowledge. I smirked at myself in the mirror, my eyeliner smeared and smudged from my ill-timed emotional outburst. My mother always told me that if you are too emotional to pay attention to the road, pull over. And thats what I did. The place was ancient. The walls themselves were a fading rose color, and the trim was a cracked aqua. The bell rang as I pushed the glass doors open. The lobby was just as dated. It had the ambiance of a throwback 50s diner, with black and white tiled floors and poorly painted cityscapes crookedly adorning the walls. There was one very out of place print of Clark Gable over the large, round service desk. Behind the desk sat an older woman, very pretty and put together. Her feet were casually propped up on a box of books, her smart black pumps primly settled on the edge of the cardboard. She appeared to be in her forties, and her welcoming smile was perfectly painted on in crimson red. She peered at me over her cats eye glasses. Welcome, room for one? She gestured towards the guest book, and walked over to the row of keys. I noticed a fine layer of dust over the hooks, and felt a small warmth that I was supporting a struggling business. Yes, just one. Im not picky. If theres a working TV I will be happy, I smiled. She returned my smile, grabbing a set of keys from its neglected hook. Oh yes, they are all equipped with a television set. But the channel selection is limited, Im afraid. How long would you like to stay with us, honey? Oh, just the night. I am on a bit of a getaway and just need to rest. She grimaced for the briefest of seconds. Then offered me a short run down of local attractions. I took the offered brochures reluctantly as I paid for my room and let her help me with my bag. Somehow, the pamphlet on the local beet farms and artisanal beet pies didnt do much to convince me to extend my stay. The room was just what I imagined. Outdated, a bit tacky and dimly lit. But the bed was comfortable. My name is Doris, call if you need anything, honey. The desk number is by the phone, and I am just down the hall if you need me. Anything I can get you, Miss Hmm? Oh, sorry. I forgot. Vanessa, Nessa if you dont mind. She nodded quickly. Miss Nessa then. If there is nothing else, Ill get back to my desk. Have a good night! She twirled her keys around her finger and closed the door. I gratefully embraced the solitude of my room, and took off my too snug boots. Seating myself on the bed and rubbing my sore foot absentmindedly, I reviewed the room. It was standard fare. The wallpaper was a cheery yellow floral, and the curtains were a garish blue green. The carpet matched the drapes; dingy and sad. There was a random framed portrait of Marilyn Monroe over my bed, and a massive mirror over the old rabbit ear TV. But the price was right, and Lori would sooner be caught dead than in this place; I smiled. I flipped the few channels for ages, finally finding some reruns of Twilight Zone to keep me up. I was still unused to sleeping in an empty bed, and sleep was a difficult task for me lately. It was a classic episode, Monsters on Maple Street. Still culturally relevant. The ache of isolation was dull and heavy in my chest. The next episode was the one about the little girl who finds a world at the bottom of a pool. The implication is of course that she drowned. I found that this one small thing was my tipping point. Tears stung my eyes, though they didnt fall. The episode reminded me of my recent loss, the memory of my miscarriage was still fresh. Lori couldnt understand my pain. Wed agreed I would carry our baby, I had always wanted to experience a pregnancy and child birth. Being a mom was always part of the plan for me, and I liked the idea of feeling a baby growing inside of me. Being the one who gets all of the absurd cravings, and feeling random kicks all night had a certain charm for me. Wed picked the donor with the greatest care. In fact, our selected donor was always in demand. He had an impeccable medical history, excellent academic record, etc. He seemed like a genetic dreamboat. It didnt hurt that he was tall, blonde and blue eyed. I wanted our boy to have blue eyes like me. Lori and I were on the waiting list for six months. It was several hundred dollars down, non-refundable deposit. But it seemed like a small price to pay in exchange for a bright, beautiful and healthy baby. She and I were so excited, after ten years together it seemed like the next step. We both wanted that baby so badly. But something went wrong. I was at work when it happened. I felt the pain, headache and dizziness. Then the wet, hot blood beginning to run down my inner thigh. Amanda from accounting found me in the ladies room. I was inconsolable, covered in blood and screaming into my red hands like some sort of demented modern day Lady MacBeth. The D/C procedure was the worst, Lori tried to cheer me up by offering to try again, to carry the pregnancy this time. It was the worst thing she could have said. I left the next day, I wanted a baby that was all mine, with eyes like mine. This wasnt a puppy we could replace, this was my almost-child. Her big brown eyes were liquid with tears as she pleaded with me, but I couldnt stay. Not now, she had no idea the depth of my pain, and didnt understand my anger or frustration. When my breathing exercises failed me, I tried to sleep. The silence of the room was heavy and oppressive. It was suffocating. I looked for my pills, lately they were the only thing that helped. No dice. I must have left them in the car I had to get out. I didnt need another episode. I slid my boots back on and wandered into the hall. The lights were a dull yellow, revealing the heavy coating of spider webs and dust that embraced each fixture. The place seemed empty aside from myself and the manager. I needed a soda or something. Anything to take my mind off things. I made my way to the lobby, where I had seen a vending machine by the entrance. Fumbling in my pockets for a dollar, I selected D3; Dr. Pepper always cheered me up as a kid, maybe indulging in that now would alleviate some of this crushing depression. The machine rattled as a bottle made the journey down the chute, however nothing happened. My face went hot and red, I kicked the machine. Mother fucker! I just want one fucking thing! I struck out at it with open fists, bruising my palms and scuffing my boots as I kicked and beat the damn thing. The tears I had choked back earlier flowed down my face, mingling with ropy strands of spittle as I collapsed in tears huddled next to the offending machine. I didnt even notice the manager approaching until she spoke. Umm, Honey? Are you alright? You dont look well. I sniffed, looking up to see her concerned face and the box of Kleenex in her extended hand. I never do this, but I broke down completely and gasped out my whole sob story to this stranger with a maternal face. She bit her red lip and knit her brows. Oh honey, that kind of pain doesnt go away. Let me make us some tea. Soda is bad for your sleep anyway, and sorrow only heals with rest. Come along, dear. She offered a warm, soft hand to help me up. I took it like a lost child. She gently led me to her office, sat me down in a plush chair and went about the familiar ritual of brewing a pot of tea. She spoke with her back to me as she selected a box of tea bags from a cabinet in the corner. She hesitated, deciding between Lipton and some obscure brand of herbal tea. She finally settled on chamomile and bustled back to the kettle. You know, I lost two babies myself. My husband, God rest his soul, never understood my pain. As a mother, it eats at you until you feel like death would have been preferable to this half life. At least, for me, anyway. But we got incredibly lucky with number three. And you channel all that agony into the love you have for the child who lives. It doesnt ever completely go away, but the love of a baby softens the sting. I choked a bit. I dont think that will work for me. Theres something wrong with me, I dont even know if my baby would be healthy. Even if I ever find another partner to parent with, the doctor seemed dubious about my chances. She scoffed. Oh, doctors dont know a thing! My doctor said the same thing after my second loss. And they told me that my Franky would never survive child birth. But he did, and though he was never a very healthy child, there is not a thing I would change. She brought my hot tea over and I accepted the mug gratefully. I curled up into a ball in the comfortably worn chair and let my tea steep. She settled into the chair across from me, and we continued to discuss our experiences. She had eyes that reminded me of my own mother. Her pack a day Virginia Slims addiction resulted in a diagnosis of stage four lung cancer when she was forty-five. Doris looked so much like her before the cancer took hold. I found great comfort in our talk, and the cup of chamomile was perfectly brewed. We spoke until I felt exhaustion creeping into my mind, and my eyes began to close. Thank you so much for your company, Doris. I appreciate it, I really needed someone to talk to. I rose to take my leave. I feel the same way, dear. The nights here are so lonely. Let me know if you need to talk later, alright? Her smile was warm and she looked genuinely pleased to have spent the better part of the evening consoling a stranger. I returned her smile and bid her goodnight as I headed to my bed. The hall seemed to have gained length, and I thought I would never get back to my room. I didnt realize how exhausting driving for hours on end can be, and I crawled into my bed eagerly. I didnt even bother changing into my nightclothes, I slept in my dress. Sleep was not long in coming, and I welcomed it. Shhh, shh, honey. Im sorry you woke up so early. I was hoping you would sleep through this. A hand was in my hair, gently stroking my scalp. Doris kind face was over mine. She looked very anxious. Something had partially woken me, and I was confused but not frightened. I struggled a moment, confusion and realization competing for attention. Doris was fretting over me like a fussing mother hen. I cleared my throat, my mind fuzzy. Uhh, What are you doing? I shifted, feeling the restraints for the first time. I twisted and bucked, panic setting in as my lizard brain took over. Doris sucked her lower lip in for just a moment, she looked like a chiding mother fussing over a sick child. Dear, dont struggle so. You will chafe your poor wrists. I tried to keep them fairly loose, but it really isnt any use. Im trying to help you. This will take just bit more time. Please keep still, it wont be long. Her brow was knit, and she pressed her palm to my forehead. So many questions floated through my swimming head. A rustling in the corner brought me solidly back into the moment. A smile lit up her face. Oh, darling. I got her ready for you. Just give me a moment and Ill be out of your way. She called out to the darkness past my still buzzing television set. Her tone was lighthearted, and her voice lilted upwards. I strained my neck and eyes to see who on earth she was speaking to. My eyes were still adjusting so it took me a minute to focus. Then I saw a form huddled in the darkness of the corner. It looked vaguely human. It was short, and somehow bentCrooked. It looked like a half molded ceramic, kind of flawed and twisted. The figure was thin, brittle and frail looking. Its head was cocked to the side like a curious bird.observing me. Never before was I so keenly aware of my own vulnerability. It shivered, like it was cold, or frightened. Doris turned to me with a conspiratorial look, as though she was confiding in an old friend. My Franky is rather shy with women, but he will warm up to you. Hes very affectionate. She jerked her head toward me, and addressed the creature she had named Franky. Darling, come on. Dont be so shy dear. Shes very sweet, and quite pretty. See? Come on, mamas here. It stepped forward, in a sickening shuffle. It moved like a large insect, in a kind of crab walk, it stepped into the dim grey light. I will never forget its face. Overall, it looked like a malformed human. Tall, but hunched over at the waist, and as lean as a skeleton. It had been dressed in a comically oversized grey evening jacket, complete with a white carnation boutonniere. The skin I could see was white, as was his hair. But its face was smooth, and young. Too young, almost like a distorted picture of a teenage boy. Its eyes were large and watery blue, half hidden by heavily hooded dark lids, they were perched above high cheekbones. And I saw no lips, just a thin crevice under the small nubby bit of flesh that must have been a nose. He continued his slow crab walk towards me, his hands held together as though in prayer. He really resembled a praying mantis more than anything. So, this must be Franky. Doris coaxed him along in cooing, cloyingly sweet voice. Come along, darling. Hurry, shes waking up quickly. Come along. As it advanced, I noticed the threadlike black and grey lines that covered his skin like veins. There was a spidery map of them on his hands and neck. I retched, I couldnt help it. Doris sniffed in disgust and her once soft eyes hardened as I expressed my disgust. Her jaw tensed, and she took a firm hold of my wrist, silently producing a very fine blade. It was narrow and small, like a scalpel. She deftly made three small, clean incisions just above my wrist. I gasped, and began to scream. At the sight of blood, the monster Doris had given birth to suddenly became animated. I watched as it--he lurched forward, hovering over me with undisguised hunger filling his pale eyes. Doris smiled lovingly, and continued to hold my wrist in a vise-like grip. I continued to scream, writhe and kick, staring at Franky the entire time. His face kind ofshriveled, and the lipless opening in his face formed a small O. The sickeningly pale skin retracted, and a purply grey tentacle snaked out of it. It lowered onto me slowly, winding and twisting over me. Every muscle in my body went rigid, and my screams died on my lips as I watched it. With a thousand hair-like nuzzling, stroking needles, it latched onto the open cuts like a leech. Doris smile returned. There we go, sweet boy. Thats my boy. She nodded, as if to say well, that is that. Still smiling, she rose. Pausing a moment, her eyes returned to mine. As a mother, you understand. Dont you? We would do anything for our babies.And this is really for the best, darling. She was silhouetted in the light from the hall as she left the room. The thud as it closed rang in my ears a moment, but it was soon replaced by Frankys overly eager slurping. The needles that were firmly sunk into my arm wriggled back and forth as they greedily sucked from me. The pain was hot and constant, like a million wasp stings at once. But I was too frightened to scream, and I didnt even have the will to try once Franky released me. Those milky blue eyes stared down at me, and his hands wandered over my face. I squeezed my eyes closed as I felt his weight shift as he onto the bed. I woke the next day in my car. My head was on fire, and I felt violently sick. The sun was high, and my car must have been parked in it for hours. I was drenched in sweat, and it was sweltering. I screamed, a long, hysterical scream. I rocked back and forth for ages, just screaming the most guttural, primal screams I have ever heard. My throat ached, and my head pounded with the sound. I dont know how long I sat there in the heat. Once again, I passed out. The next day, I woke up in a hospital bed. Sterile, blindingly white and cold, the first thing I noticed was the scent of antiseptic. According to the nurse, I was found suffering from dehydration and heat stroke. I dont remember what else was said. Lori had been called, and ran in with a bouquet of pink roses. Clich, but it worked. I needed her, I couldnt be alone with this. Everyone I spoke to assured me that I hallucinations were common with heat stroke and dehydration. Not to mention the mental strain I was under at the time. Lori comforted me with whispers and soft kisses. Whatever had happened, she would always be here, she assured me. Even when we discovered that I was pregnant eight weeks later, she held me and told me it was a blessing. She didnt care how that baby had come to be, she loved me and would love it just as much. If only she knew Its been five months now. Lori has been as good as her word. Even when the ultrasound technician said he was noticing some developmental abnormalitiesSqueezing my hand, she comforted me and promised that no matter what happens we will be good mothers and love our child. Thats what Im afraid of. But at least our baby will have blue eyes. oo "
228,vulnerability,nosleep,Now I See,112,5vymro,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5vymro/now_i_see/,2017-02-25 04:03:55,"Im not a sentimental person, but there's something about the feel of a block of wood in my hands that makes me smile. I think it's the weight of unlimited possibility. What starts as something the unimaginative might view as an inert object can, under the correct set of circumstances, become nearly anything. My father always believed that a man should work with his hands. He thought it was a way of connecting to the physical world, and that it could transform the person and the creation at the same time. That by molding something you could in turn mold yourself. I don't know if I buy into that philosophical stuff, but I do know that there is something endlessly satisfying about the process. I just lose myself in it completely. And, hell, maybe I do get a little metaphysical with it all. Before I start any new project, I like to take my raw materials and just sit with them. I like to run my hands over the wood and feel the still-lingering pulse of life in its knots and splinters. I like the way my callouses give and pull against the grain. I have to admit that there is something spiritual about it. Some days I'd walk into my workshop with no clue what to make. Id let the wood tell me. That communication, the back and forth between object and man, well, it's magical. But that's neither here nor there, and besides, it's not the story I need to tell. I was on a walk in the forest behind my house when I found it, that gnarled and dark segment of an unidentifiable tree. It's coarseness, and the many knots and gouges, suggested cedar, but the color was wrong and it felt too light when I picked it up. It might well have been driftwood, had I not lived a thousand miles from the nearest ocean. It was a fascinating find, and I vowed to do something with it when time allowed. I didnt have an idea of what I might do with the wood. Sometimes it can be fun to have a project that doesn't abide by rules and structure and forethought. It was my plan to start carving and sanding without intention. To see where the creative spark led me. It seemed appropriate with this piece in particular. This strange chunk of timber, already hewn by the forces of nature into something exotic, would be the perfect canvas on which to let my imagination run wild. In that regard, my first impressions of the work I was creating showed a success. My hands flew over the wood with a speed that I had never before known. I would only just finish one phase of the project before I would find my hands already on the tools needed for the next. It was as if I were the conduit for some creative force. My workshop, in the end, resembled nothing less than a disaster area, with wood shavings and tools strewn about in an entirely uncharacteristic fashion. Imagine my disappointment, then, when I saw the finished product. I had expected a work of art, something that might justify the creative frenzy in which I had immersed myself. Instead, I had created what can only be described as a childs poor attempt at a Halloween mask. Except that description doesn't quite fit what I had created. Though the shape and structure resembled a mask, the gnarls and knots in the wood made it impractical to hold, even after being sanded down, and it lacked in any kind of mouth or nose openings. It was a curving oblong panel, with two eye holes and nothing more. To use it, I would have to hold it continuously against my face. Whats more, the grain of the wood, once sanded and finished, swirled in patterns of light and dark, giving the mask the appearance of facial features where none existed. Dark wood merged with blond to form hollows that resembled cheekbones, and lines formed where the wood had splintered near the eye holes. From a distance, the mask looked like an old womans face, devoid of nose and mouth. I shrugged my shoulders at my creation. The human mind and its imaginative impulses are mysterious, I reckoned. And so, without any fanfare, I placed my brand new mask to my face. If you had been watching me in my workshop at that moment, you might have thought I was working on a comedy routine. You would have seen me tentatively put an ugly mask against my face and recoil as if I'd been burned. You would have even seen me rub my eyes in disbelief, like a cartoon character in an old Warner Brothers short. It probably would have looked quite funny. It was not. It's difficult to think about now, that instant my whole world changed. Even with everything that came after. You see, when I peered through the masks lensless eyes, I did not see my workshop. At least, not in any form I recognized. Where the plain wooden door should have been, there was instead a gaping darkness studded with motes of light. Surrounding the black void, shadows leaned and wavered, as if lit by some unseen fire. I wrenched the mask from my eyes. I rubbed them and blinked hard. The workshop stood as it always had. Coated with sawdust, but bright and cheery. No invisible fire flickered; no darkness permeated the wood and aluminum space. I gingerly prodded the mask, pushing my fingers through the eye holes as I did. There was nothing there to modify my sight; it was open from front to back. I paced around the workshop, thinking about my mental health and whether I'd been getting enough sleep lately. My eyes kept wandering to the wooden object sitting on my table. It beckoned me. Just another look. What will it hurt? I picked the mask up again, and once more placed it against my face. The world around me looked as it had before. Darkness enveloped the familiar shapes of my workshop, as shadows danced and tugged at the edges of my vision. I turned in a full circle, fighting the dizzy uncertainty as I went. I could just make out the well-worn benches and tables in the overbearing fog of gray. I looked up at the ceiling. Tendrils of black radiated from a corner of the workshop like mold. As I watched, they pulsed nearly imperceptibly as they spread out, inching across the metal roof. I began to take note of a smell, dank and earthy, as if I were breathing compost. I leaned against the workbench and pulled the mask from my face. All around me, the workshop remained the same as it had been earlier that day. Only the smell lingered to give evidence to my experience. I should have left it all behind then. I should have destroyed the mask and forgotten about the whole thing. I didn't. Instead, I brought it into my home. I'll admit that I let curiosity get the better of me. Pragmatism has never been my strong suit. Perhaps that's why I've always loved woodworking: it's a world where creativity and structure meet. They depend on each other and can never truly be disentangled. I tried not to look through the mask once I brought it into the house. I really did. But I gave in to my curiosity more quickly than I'd like to confess. I stood in my kitchen, running my hands across the sanded knots of the mask and tracing the swirls of color. I thought I felt something warm humming through it like a pulse, but I dismissed the notion as a paranoid fantasy. As I once again brought it up to my eyes, I was gripped by a sudden fear. What if I wasn't seeing the world through some sort of distorted prism? What if I were inviting something in that wasn't there before? I held the object still in my hands while the lump in my throat grew larger and more insistent. I took a deep breath and looked through the wood. The crushing gloom had returned to the world around me. Familiar sights were distorted and warped. Where the straight lines of the refrigerator once stood, there now were oozing, dark undulations that moved and twitched languidly. The refrigerator appeared to sway back and forth in the dim gray kitchen. I turned to look out of the window. Light had flooded in through it in the moments before I put the mask to my eyes. That light was replaced by the same blackness that had proliferated the space where the woodshop door had been. Motes floated in front of it, both sparkling and dull at the same time. Shadows surrounded me, just outside of my periphery. I moved my head to follow their path, only to find an unmoving, uniform darkness in their stead. Something skittered next to my feet, causing me to jump. I thought I heard the sound of insect-like clicks across the floor. I listened more intently but heard nothing. Not even the sounds of the suburban daytime that I had taken for granted mere moments before. Out of the corner of my eye, movement. The skittering began again, seconds behind. Every impulse in my body told me to take the mask off. But I didn't. I held it tightly to my face as if paralyzed. I backed slowly into a corner of my kitchen, suddenly aware of my vulnerability, my forced tunnel-vision. Around me the shadows wavered, black on dark gray on light gray, throbbing like a heartbeat. I recognized the smell from earlier, the musty, organic smell that had invaded my nostrils in the workshop. It seemed stronger somehow in the darkness of the kitchen. I heard a sound then, muffled as if through water, from my front door. It was a knocking, muted and faint. I walked slowly, one hand extended in front of me, the other clamping the mask to my face. When I reached the front door, I pushed the curtain back from the window to look out. Tendrils of blackness clung to my fingers as I touched the fabric. Their dark lines extended from my hands to the curtain, drawing a connection between my body and the blackness. I looked down at my fingers with some interest before turning my attention to the window. Through the blinding darkness I could see a figure. It swam into focus, walking towards me through a dense fog. I could barely hear its voice call out to me. ""Hey buddy, I need a signature on this package."" It pushed its head toward the window, and I recoiled in horror. The face was gaunt and hollow, with gray skin stretched across a broad skull. I could see that pieces of skin were missing, torn away to reveal only darkness underneath. I wrenched the mask from my face and flung them across the room. The mailman stared at me quizzically through my living room window, before shrugging his shoulders and setting a package down on my front porch. I couldn't make sense of what I had just seen. It was as if someone had painted another world atop my own. Maybe I was hallucinating? Or maybe the mask distorted my perception. That must be it, I concluded. The wood must be interacting somehow with my visual system. I'm no scientist, but it made a kind of sense to me. Maybe I had released some sort of chemical in my sawing and sanding. I gathered up the mask from the corner of the room where I had thrown it. It seemed perfectly harmless in the mid afternoon light. I laughed at myself for being so silly, and told myself that I'd leave it be. But, as I'm sure you are well aware, curiosity is a dangerous thing. Days passed, and I ignored the wooden creation, giving it little thought as I went about my life. Slowly, though, I began to think more about it. Perception is fascinating, and wouldn't it be worthwhile to immerse myself once again in an altered state? What would be the harm? Little by little, day by day, I wore the mask. First, it was five minutes, just to see what my yard looked like. The darkness was claustrophobic, but still I pressed on. By the time a week had passed, I was wearing the mask for hours at a time. I watched the television, marveling at how an angry, buzzing static replaced the talking heads on the news. I spied on my neighbors through the window, watching their skeletal figures dance through the undulating darkness. I watched as pieces of my house fell away, revealing nothing but blackness underneath. All the while, I ignored the smell of decay that seemed to permeate my entire house. It was midway through the second week before I worked up the courage to look at myself in the mirror through the mask. I had been afraid, yes, but it was more than that. Something about seeing myself as the mask saw me felt definitive, like I was leaping off a cliff into something unknown. I was right to be afraid. I was right to feel a sense of finality. I faced the mirror, expecting to see the mask, in whatever form it took, in front of my face. Instead, I saw through it. I saw myself, without the mask. The face staring back at me was gaunt and pale. It illuminated the darkness around it, casting off sparkling motes of light in the black. A deep slit ran from cheek to cheek, widening the mouth in a grotesque mimic of a smile. I leaned into the mirror, looking at my own eyes. They were hollow and black and empty of anything at all. The whole face was twisted as if in agony, and I realized that I was screaming. I could hear myself far away, under an ocean of crushing gloom. At that moment the weight of my experiences came crashing down on me. I hadn't been to work in two weeks, had I? Had anyone called? Had I called anyone? I must have eaten, but I couldn't remember what. Had I even left the house? I clawed at my memories, but I couldn't recall anything other than the inside of my house enveloped in darkness. I burned the mask in a barrel behind my house. It went up quickly, turning the orange flames a dusky brown before evaporating into a pile of black soot. This is not a horror movie; it did not return, unharmed, to my kitchen table. I attempted to put my life back in order. I explained to my boss about an extended and pernicious flu, and though he was angry and skeptical, I was able to keep my job. I worked to gain back the five pounds I lost in those two weeks. I settled into my regular routine, though I no longer had the urge to do any woodworking. It all became perfectly normal again, except for the spot on my wall. And the smell. I noticed the spot the day after I burned the mask. At first, I thought it was mold, that small black mark on my kitchen wall. It looked like mold and spread its spidery wisps across the surface just like I imagined a fungus to do. But when I got close to it, I could see it pulsing ever so slightly. And it smelled. It smelled of an organic rot that nearly bowled me over. I scrubbed it and scrubbed it, but it only ever got bigger. And when I touched it with my finger, those tendrils clung to my skin. My hand is still stained with that pulsing blackness, though no one has mentioned it. No one seems to notice it spreading up my arm, a little bit more each day. I don't know what happened to me, or why the darkness has now taken over my kitchen entirely. But I know it will eventually take over my house and my world, stripping the light away entirely. It reminds me, somehow, of an optical illusion that I saw when I was a kid. You know the one with the rabbit and the duck? At first, you only can see one, and it makes perfect sense. It's orderly and right. But then you see the other animal. Once that happens, you can never see it as you once did, no matter how hard you try. It's a symptom of being human. We rely on what our perception tells us is true, and we don't doubt it. How could we? We'd never be able to live if we second-guessed every single element of our world. That perception is comforting. More than that, it allows us to have lives of real or imagined meaning, should we so choose. But it is just perception. I know now. I'm certain of it. There is a world that lies just beneath our own. Or perhaps what we see as our own world is nothing more than a pleasing illusion painted atop the real one. Either way, I've peeked behind the curtain. I've recoiled at the layers I never knew existed. You don't want to see the world as it is. Trust me. [x](URL "

I always wanted to write one but never had a reason to. I finally do, and I wish that I didn't. I'm a current graduate student. School is damn expensive and although I work part time, it's not enough to support myself. So, I joined one of those care services and have done part time house/pet sitting. I've never run into a problem. The pets are sweet and they basically take care of themselves so I can chill and some families let me come and go as I please. This past weekend I happened to not have plans so I was home bound for the night. The family I was sitting for weren't strangers as I had taken care of their dogs a few other times for drop in care. I stopped by their house last Saturday morning as they were heading out of state and would be back Sunday morning. They were a relatively young couple, not much older than I. They were recently married and seemed so in love with one another. They left me a list of care rules, went over some basics on the house, warned me that their dogs had some pretty strange quirks, and were on their way. The day was pretty uneventful. The dogs are heavy loungers so I pretty much watched tv and did school work while they slept. I was specifically instructed to stay in their den area with their two dogs. The den had a couch on one wall, a tv on the opposite wall, and a sliding glass door next to the tv leading to the backyard. The room also had 3 large windows. The vulnerability of the room totally made me uneasy so I closed all the blinds and curtains on the doors before night hit. At about 11 pm I'm ready to start winding down. I didn't have plans that night since all my friends were out of town, and since I'm usually living in my school library I figured I would get a good night's sleep for once. As I'm lying in my oh so comfortable air mattress, the older dog starts barking. I was told that this one winds up being the quirkier of the two, so I just said ""Chase, settle down."" And went back to watching Tv. Chase didn't settle down. He continued to bark, and now was moving himself from the gate that separated the den from the rest of the house to the sliding glass door. As if someone was in the backyard. What made me start to get that uneasy feeling is that now the smaller dog was growling and staring towards the sliding glass door. All of a sudden ""Thud! Thud! Thud!"" Something was pounding on the sliding glass door in a sort of rhythmic drum fashion. The curtain was down on the door so I had no idea what or who was on the other side. At this point, the two dogs are going absolutely crazy. They were barking, howling, and growling at this unknown source. I thought that this would scare whatever it was away, but it just continued pounding on the door in that same rhythmic way. Against my better judgement, I needed to know what was going on. I felt that as the sole adult in the home it was my responsibility to make sure the home and the animals were safe. What I failed to realize was that I also needed to keep myself safe and that I should have called the police right then. Too late for that. I pulled the curtain back, while the two dogs are still going crazy, and my heart sank to my stomach. There in the dark, hitting her head against the window was a girl about my age. She looked like she hadn't showered in weeks. Her clothes were stained, I initially thought she was homeless. The woman stopped hitting her head against the door and instead just rested in on the window. Her mouth turned into a twisted smile. Initially I just stared at her. My mind went numb. Then I kind of just blurted out ""Who the fuck are you! Get off this property or I'm calling the police!"" The woman lifted her head off of the glass and looked me directly in the eyes. Her voice was muffled through the glass but was just loud enough for me to hear what she said. ""Connor didn't tell you about me?"" she said as her mouth turned into that same twisted smile. Connor was the man who owned the house with his wife Ally. ""How the fuck does she know Connor?"" I thought, ""And why would he tell me about her? Is she some local hermit that pays their nightly visit?"" I spoke back through the glass ""I have no idea who you are, but I'm serious. You better get out of here before you're forced into the back of a police car."" Her twisted smiling turned into a face of pure hatred. She looked like she wanted to kill me. ""You took him from me."" she growled through the glass. Alright now I was officially at a loss. ""What the fuck are you talking about, lady!"" I was now yelling through the glass. Half due to frustration, half due to fear. ""You think he loves you soooo much don't you Ally?! That you're the love of his life! You're not the only one, he loves me too! He was with me for a year and then out of no where he proposes to you!"" At this point the woman was screaming and sobbing through her words. I knew I had to get the fuck out, but I was frozen in fear and disbelief. This woman thought that I was Ally, and now because of Connor's infidelity, my life was in jeopardy. ""He completely cut me off! He wouldn't even talk to me! Well Ally, if I can't have Connor, then you can't either."" She suddenly walked backwards into the dark and I snapped back to life. I clambered for my phone in my pocket and dialed 911 as quickly as I could. As soon as the operator picked up I basically spit out ""Hi I'm at (address) house sitting and there's someone outside in the backyard threatening me!"" I dropped my phone at the sharp sound of something hitting the glass. Tears started to roll down my face as I saw the woman pulling a large knife out of her jacket with one hand and slamming a large rock from the garden on the glass with the other hand. I started to slowly back up. The dogs were clearly in fight mode and I was hoping to God that they could protect me from this woman if she got in. With every bang against the glass door, the woman shrieked ""YOU TOOK HIM FROM ME!"" It must have took less time than I thought for the police to get there because she had just about shattered the door when two police officers ran into the back yard yelling something at her. When she didn't stop, they opened fire and she fell to the patio. I was sitting in the back of an ambulance going over the entire ordeal. This couple seemed so in love. So perfect for one another. And for almost a fourth do their dating, Connor was with someone else too. Part of me kind of felt bad for the woman. Imagine being that in love that you'd be out for murder? In that moment, Connor didn't seem worth that. Connor and Ally's car came screeching down the block. I told the police they were the ones who lived there and it took them less than an hour to get there. They ran up to me, Ally was crying. ""Casey are you okay! I feel horrible, WE feel horrible!"" Connor put his hand on my shoulder. ""Casey, we're so sorry that you had to deal with this."" he said. ""Casey did you happen to know this woman? Did you have any idea who she was?"" Ally begged. I looked at her, to Connor, and then back to her. I said flatly ""You may want to ask your husband about the kind of skeletons he's been hiding in his closet."" Ally and I remained close friends. She filed for divorce shortly after the ordeal. I felt bad that she had to go through something like that at such a young age. As for me, I've learned to not trust the people I date so easily. I also decided to work at Starbucks. Less scorned lovers."

That's what we tell ourselves right? From the moment we take that transitioning step between childhood and adulthood we begin to rationalize the abnormal. Now I don't know how this BS got started, but I'm here to end it. Take a stroll down memory lane and I'm sure you'll find a time during your elementary years when you could swear something...else, was in the room with you. Watching. Waiting. Listening. Ready to act on your paralyzed state. Yet, at some point in our lives, this part of who we are is stamped out of us. Whether it be through the over rationalized reassurance of our parents, or the peer pressure of our thick headed friends, we are taught to explain it all away. However, I'm not here to talk about some monster in the closet. No, no, I am after something that has had a SEVERE lack of attention. Everyone knows that feeling you get when you're lying in bed and maybe a hand or a foot in just barely hanging off the edge of the mattress. It's a vulnerability like nothing else, and I know where it comes from. My day started off like any other. I left my apartment in a daze for my 7am math class and grabbed my usual crappy cup of coffee from the campus dining hall. I hadn't slept well the night before, but that was nothing out of the ordinary. With the stress of balancing a part time job, a double major, and a girlfriend, I was ready to go out of my mind. Oh, and on top of all of this, I was dealing with a blood disease that caused me to bruise super easily, which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world on its own, however in addition to everything else it just seemed like adding insult to injury. I had only been diagnosed a few months prior to starting back at school so I was still getting used to the new medication, which had been giving me really dry skin. The dry skin had been getting worse and worse, but today I noticed significant cracking on my hands. This was nothing a little lotion couldn't fix, so I lathered up and went on with my day. After I had gone to all of my classes, I started feeling a little queasy so I made an executive decision to call in sick to work and get some well warranted rest. I texted Kelly (my girlfriend) to let her know that I wouldn't be able to cook dinner, but she was welcome to stop by later. Curling up on my twin sized bed, I drifted into a glorious state of serenity. I awoke hours later to the gentle breath of my girlfriend on the nape of my neck. It must've been 10pm at this point, but she had come over anyway to comfort me. She always did cute things like that. I was never so thoughtful, but she put up with me anyway. A pizza, Netflix, and us in our sweatpants was enough for her. She was cool like that. I just smiled and let myself fall asleep again. This time I didn't wake up until morning. My eyes fluttered open and I began my usual routine. I grabbed my usual coffee and headed to my morning classes. As I was walking to my next class I realized my failure as a boyfriend. ""Oh shit! I forgot to thank Kelly for stopping by!"" I reached for my phone with intention to text her when I noticed she had actually texted me first! Actually...it was a text from last night. The time stamp read 10:19pm. ""What the hell?"" I thought. As I read the text I grew incredibly uneasy. ""Hey babe! Hope you're getting lots of rest! Unfortunately I have to work late tonight but hopefully I'll see you tomorrow? Love you!"" A shiver ran down my spine. I felt a sharp pain throbbing on the back of my neck so I reached back to feel what it was and I noticed a dry and cracked spot where the pain was occurring. This was odd. I'd never gotten so dry on any part of my body other than my hands or my feet. I thought about last night. I thought about the feeling of breath on my neck. I was becoming delirious after being so exhausted for so long. I really needed to get my shit together. I texted Kelly and let her know that I was doing alright. I made no mention of the weird occurrence last night. What would she be able to say? ""Sorry that a ghost breathed on you and gave you dry skin""? Whatever. I was probably just overreacting. She was busy enough at it was, and I didn't need her worrying about me. If only I had known... Days passed and my sleep patterns grew worse and worse. Sometimes I'd get 4 hours of sleep and be ecstatic. Others I wouldn't be able to ease my mind at all. In a state of total delirium I gazed at my cracked hands as they dangled over the edge of the mattress. As I stared at them I saw a small movement through the space between my fingers. I immediately pulled my hand back, all the while chalking the movement up to particles on the surface of my eye. The following nights were the worst. I began to hallucinate shadows of figures on my wall. One night I even could've sworn that someone had grazed my hand. I was too tired to eat, too tired to get out of bed, and too tired to move. My hand lay across my bed, partially hanging over the edge of my mattress. That's when I saw her. She was extremely pale. Her skin was cracked and rotting. Her eyes were red as blood. Her mouth was open and her face expressionless. She leaned over me while I lay paralyzed with terror. She put her face so close to mine her eyes were all I could see while she shook me so violently that I passed out. When I came to, all I could see was darkness. I looked down towards my feet only to see more of the impossibly dark abyss. I stood there for what seemed like days. But finally, something broke the solemness of the atmosphere. I felt a yearning. Something unlike I'd ever felt before. A desire that I couldn't quite figure out how to satiate. That's when I saw them. Hands. Feet. Extended over the edges of different beds. They invited me to come to them. They invited me to keep them company. They wanted me. They wanted to be with me. I wanted to be with them. My purpose had become clear. I knew what my whole life had been leading up to. Oh my dear reader. Don't be afraid. I am here for you. I'll always be here. Waiting for you to call me. Invite me in. You'll never have to be alone. You can stay with me. Forever."
231,vulnerability,nosleep,A Dreamer Awake,47,5xu5d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5xu5d2/a_dreamer_awake/,2017-03-07 03:28:13,"My name is Arnie and this is my dream log. Please read it. It's a special dream log because I don't record all my dreams here. Only certain nightmares. It was my friend Kellys idea. I had told her about my nightmares and she said that keeping a log could be a good way to figure them out. Maybe understanding them better will make them stop. Kelly, at the time, was a hostess at the restaurant where I still work. She was nice to me. I think she liked me. It works like this: I keep the log on my nightstand next to my bed, and when I wake from a nightmare, I write down everything I can remember. This post is a transcription of my log to date. *Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.* -Carl Jung **January 2, 2017  8:31pm** I've had these recurring nightmares since I was a child. Or maybe they're night terrors, I don't know, I'm no expert. I remember the first one well. Ill write about it for my first entry. I was six or seven at the time, well over twenty years ago. I stood at the top of stairs. The stairs lead down to a basement. Not the basement of my childhood home. Just a basement. I stood there staring down into the blackness, my toes curled over the lip of the first stair. The smell of burnt wood and dead leaves wafted up. *""Come down.""* I didn't really hear the voice, but I sensed the words. I didn't want to go down but I felt myself step down to the first step anyways. I looked down at the step I now stood upon and saw that it was open between the treads, the kind of basement stairs you run up because you think a hand will come out from behind and grab you. My ankle felt suddenly exposed. This is when I woke up. I remember my mother rushing into my bedroom. She asked me why I was screaming. This is how the dreams would begin. I would found myself at the top of the stairs leading down to the basement, the voice would instruct me to go down, and each time I went down a little further. The further I went down, the more I *sensed* what was down there, in the same way I *sensed* the voice. When the vulnerability was too much to bear, I'd wake up. I knew there was a man down there, standing under the stairs. He had a mask, and when he put on the mask, he became Mr. Tickles. He wanted to play hide-and-seek with me in the dark. Another thing I knew was that Mr. Tickles wouldn't grab my ankles through the open stairs as I went down. He never said he wouldn't, but he never did. As much as I was terrified of him, in some things I trusted him. The next nightmare I can remember clearly was the first time I reached the bottom of the stairs. I was maybe ten years old at the time. *""Go hide.""* I knew he stood there behind the stairs and that he could see me despite the total darkness, but I trusted him to cover his eyes as I hid. I felt my way to a wall, and from there I felt my way to a corner, where I crouched down and made myself as small as possible. It became silent then. The kind of silence that makes itself obvious, that feels deliberate. He was coming, it was a dread certainty that he was coming, and my hiding spot felt suddenly inadequate. I woke up. From then onward, my nightmares always started with me *already in* the basement. It was like I had gone too far at that point, had become desensitized to the stairs. Mr. Tickles would tell me to hide, and I hid. Then it became deathly still. Like the knowledge that came with descending the stairs and knowing what was down there without seeing it, there also came the knowledge of what Mr. Tickles would do to me if he found me. The closer he got to me each time, the more I knew. I knew he would hurt me. I knew he carried an old rusty socket wrench. I knew he couldnt control himself. And I could sense if he was close to me, because the closer he got, the more suffocating the silence, and if he was very close, the silence was the kind that you could only experience in a vacuum. These are how my nightmares are these days. I always wake up before he can find me. **January 7, 2017  3:41am** I just woke from a nightmare. It went like this: I find myself in the basement. My eyes are closed but I smell the burnt wood and the dead leaves, and I know I'm there. I open my eyes and see nothing. Blackness. *""Go hide.""* I find a wall like I always do. The basement is never the same. Mr. Tickles changes its proportions or rearranges its contents every time. I creep against the wall until I come to a large, solid object. It's made of thick metal and its warm, and I know it's a wood burner. I squeeze between the wood burner and the wall and I find myself in a corner, a tight space behind the wood burner. I crouch down there and wedge myself in. The silence thickens as Mr. Tickles emerges from beneath the stairs. I close my eyes and focus on the silence. It thickens and thins as he passes by here and there, looking for me. I stay still, hands pressed against the warm wood burner before me. I focus on the silence and wait. Sudden deafness comes to my ears, so sudden its almost audible, and I know he's here, he's right there. The silence is charged with excitement. Its rough and carnal. I don't budge, but my stillness feels forced and I can sense that he senses it. I feel sweat run down my face before the warmth of the burner, and I know that he can smell it and that it excites him. My stomach lurches as my hands feel the vibrations of metal clanging wildly against the metal of the warm wood burner. I wake up. My cheeks are wet. This nightmare wasnt like the others. This was the first time I found a wood burner. And the first time I sensed Mr. Tickles  through the vibrations of his socket wrench hitting the burner  other than through his words or the deafness that precedes him. **January 19, 2017  8:22pm** I haven't had any nightmares since my last entry. I wonder if that's a good thing, if that means the log entries are working for me. Part of me... wants to have another nightmare. I don't know if it's because I want more material for my log, or if I just need a cathartic ending. I told Kelly about it at work. She was flattered that I'd taken her advice and urged me to continue, even to think of other ways to capture these nightmares and face them in waking life. I'm not sure what else I could do though. Draw pictures, she said, but I don't draw. I'll think of something. A thought - could Mr. Tickles be a representation of a repressed memory, a memory of a trauma that I hid in the basement of my mind? Something I'm afraid to see yet drawn to? Have I been, all these years, subconsciously working myself up to confronting it? Or is it something else? I don't know. **January 23, 2017  8:39pm** I still havent had any nightmares. That should be a relief, but it isn't. It feels ominous. Like I've crossed a line by keeping this log and I'm waiting for the consequences. I've been anxious lately. **January 27, 2017  8:25pm** Still no nightmares. I want to write about something though, so I'll write about the basement in my house. It's not the same as Mr. Tickles' basement. His basement always changes. But I do have a wood burner down there, so it smells similar. Also, like Mr. Tickles basement, my basement isnt furnished. There are open spaces beneath the steps too, but these are trivial similarities  a lot of basements stairs are like that. I don't like walking down the stairs of my basement, though. I dont like walking down the stairs of any basement. I really dont. There is an outside entrance to my basement on the side of the house. A short stairwell and a door. I use this when I have to go to the basement, to bring in wood for the burner or to do laundry. I keep the inside door of the basement closed and locked. It sounds strange as I write this down, but really, it's completely normal for me to go outside to enter to basement that way. I have no problem with basements, as long as I don't have to enter them by walking down stairs. **January 31, 2017  3:36am** Finally, a nightmare. I just woke up. I find myself in his basement. I find myself still wedged into that corner behind the wood burner, the same place I ended up in my last nightmare. Mr. Tickles isn't there, I dont sense him. Or maybe he's under the stairs. I feel my way against the wall, getting around the wood burner. My eyes are shut and I'm focusing on the silence, trying to sense him. The fire in the wood burner whooshes to life and I throw myself back into the corner behind it. Nothing happens. I focus on the silence and sense nothing. It's getting warm. I open my eyes. Flickering yellow light fans out from the slotted door of the burner. I scan the empty basement with my eyes for the first time. From where I crouch, I cant see the stairs. I can only make out the bareness of the basement before the wood burner. The rest is darkness. I close my eyes and check the silence. Nothing. I come out from behind the wood burner and see an object on the floor ahead. It throws a long shadow beyond the wan firelight. I go to it. I know what it is. I pick it up. It's round and made of stiff material and has the color and texture of parchment, and I run my fingers over its coarse surface. There are two slits for eyes and two vertical slits for nostrils. The face is human in a basic way. A brow, cheekbones, a chin. But the nose is not entirely there, and theres no mouth. *""Put it on.""* I slide it down over my head. Deafness comes immediately. Then a rushing sound, internal. The fire dances behind the slots of the wood burner as the rushing noise in my head reaches an impossible apex. Then it cuts off, leaving a whining flat note ringing inside my ears. I watch the contained flames of the burner make the shadows dance. **January 31, 2017  11:42am** My dream last night  that had to be some kind of a breakthrough I woke up from it as usual, but it was the first time I woke up without fear. I was calm. I think it's a good sign, it must be. I think the dream was a portrayal of my taking control of my fear. I don't know how else to interpret it. I can't write much, I slept in and I'm late for my shift. I can't wait to tell Kelly. This is good. This is really good. **February 1, 2017  8:20pm** Kelly wasn't at work today. I'll see her on another shift. I was thinking about what she said though, that I should find other ways to capture my nightmares. And I have an idea. I'll make Mr. Tickles' mask. I've seen it now, felt it, wore it. I'll use papier-mch. If my last dream was really a sign of my taking control by donning the mask, then maybe I can reinforce that act by replicating it in waking life. **February 17, 2017  8:31pm** I haven't written in a while. No nightmares. I've been working hard on the mask in my free time though. I want it to be perfect. I used a mold of my own face, flattening the nose and removing mouth. The texture was hard to get right but after a lot of trial and error, Im close. Im really close. I had another idea. I bought an old socket wrench and, since it's been raining, I tossed the thing out in the yard to rust a bit more. Like the real thing. I want to say that I've beat the nightmares. That last nightmare seemed final. It's just that I can't shake that feeling that I've crossed a line. My gut tells me its not over yet. Maybe, when I finish the mask, and make the mask mine, Ill have conquered it for good. **February 27, 2017  12:37am** The mask is perfect. It really is. After I finished it, I stood in front of the mirror and put it on. I held the old socket wrench too. It has a nice rigid heaviness to it. I stood in front of the mirror for a long time like that, looking at myself. Then I went down the basement. I didnt use the outside door. No. This time, for the first time, I unlocked the inside door and went down the stairs. I felt no fear, no panic. I even left the lights off. Its really dark down there, but I know my way around, and I went under the stairs and stood there for a long time. I cant describe the sensation. It was like a transformation. After being the object of terror for so long, I was now the source of terror. I ran my fingers along the rough rigidity of the socket wrench, then gripped it and pushed the wrench through the fist of my other hand, slowly and roughly, feeling the rust flaking off in my tight grip. I did it again, harder. It excited me. It really did. **March 4, 2017  8:12pm** Kelly asked me about my ""nightmare project"" at work yesterday. Instead of telling her how far Ive come, I did something impulsive. I told her I'd tell her all about it over dinner at my place tomorrow night. She perked up and smiled at that. She really does like me. I'll show her everything tomorrow night. **March 5, 2017  2:54am** Another dream. It went like this: I'm standing at the top of the stairs of the basement. I realize that I haven't been here since I was a child. I stare down into the blackness. My toes are curled over the lip of the top step. I wait for Mr. Tickles to say, Come down, but he says nothing, so I say, ""Come up."" A moment of silence. Then footsteps, thwacking footsteps rushing up the stairs, rushing up to me. I close my eyes, inhale deeply, and let myself fall forward. **March 5, 2017  7:56pm** Kelly is coming over soon. I have everything ready for her. The log. The mask. The socket wrench. Im excited. I really am. I left a note on the front door. It says, *""Im down the basement. Come down.""*"
232,vulnerability,nosleep,Barter with the Beast,10,5yhf92,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yhf92/barter_with_the_beast/,2017-03-10 07:09:14,"The second worst experience a parent can have is losing their child. The worst? Slowly losing your child and not being able to stop it. My sons name is Gregory. He is 12 and has been sick for most of his life. The first few years were typical, but once he reached Kindergarten, red flags appeared. He would get physically tired quicker than most of his classmates. No matter how much he ate, he never seemed to pick up weight. I shrugged it off at first as Gregory being a late bloomer, but then it got worse. Over the next few years, walking went from being a chore to an impossible task. His muscles had all but atrophied away. Hes been bedridden for the last year or so, and his immune system is starting to fail. He is sick all of the time, and even battling a simple cold feels like it requires divine intervention. Every breath he takes is a wheeze that sounds like it travels through layers of muck just to escape his body. Ive taken him to doctors, of course, but they have been of little help. Sure they give me medicine to help with whatever cold or flu he catches, but they have no clue what is causing his emaciation in general. One doctor simply shrugged after going over a dozen different test results. Maybe you should pray? he said with what seemed to be genuine sympathy. I slapped him and filed a formal complaint with the hospital about his bedside manner. Pray? That quack thought prayer would help? I was raised in a Catholic household and have been reasonably devout my entire life. I have been praying for Gregory since day one. And all the good its done is supply me with a never ending stream of hospital bills and grief. My desperation has led me to visit holistic apothecaries, but the herbs, minerals, and gems have been as useful as the doctors test, albeit more affordable. With fewer places to turn and my boy getting worse every day, I could only think of one place left to turn: the occult. Like I said before, I have been a relatively devout Catholic for most of my life, and that paired with a healthy dose of skepticism made me shrug off the thought for a long time. But I could feel that Gregory didnt have much longer until he was completely gone. My town isnt small, but I was still only able to find one occult book store. When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it was surprisingly modern looking. It was well lit, featured smooth and clean fixtures, and smelled of lavender. I guess expecting candles and cobwebs was a stereotypical notion, but thats what years of Catholicism gets you. The woman behind the counter, on the other hand, was exactly what I expected. She was an older woman with gray, shoulder-length hair. Her glasses were almost half the size of her face, and they magnified her eyes to cartoonish proportions. When she came out from behind the counter to greet me, I saw she was wearing a billowy, black dress adorned by a dark gray shawl. How may I help you? she asked with an agreeable smile. Uh, Im not really sure. See, I I went into soliloquy about Gregorys life and everything weve been through together. I explained the failures with doctors and everything else to which I turned. She nodded along in somber attention. By the end of it, I felt drained, but in a good way. It was cathartic getting everything out like that. I think she was the first person with whom I had been so open. Even with friends and family I put on a strong face. But with this stranger, I allowed myself vulnerability. Once I finished, the shopkeeper let a beat pass and then hugged me. Her physical and emotional warmth was enough to spur the tears already welling in my eyes to pour out. We stood there for what felt like minutes but could have only been moments. When we released each other, she looked into my eyes and said the most wonderful five words I could imagine. I have what you need. She disappeared into a back room and shortly came out with a tome in hand. It was leather bound and looked old. She placed it on the counter between us. I have to warn you first: This is a dangerous book, she said. The power inside wasnt meant for curing common diseases and ailments. But you described sounds like something more. Perhaps something dark has attached itself to your child early in his life and has been feeding off his physical and spiritual energy ever since. The shopkeeper opened the book and flipped to a page about halfway in. This is a spell that will banish any evil entities that are syphoning energy from your son. However, if I am wrong and there are no dark ones afflicting your son, this spell will call one to you. If this is the case, your son will be possessed. Gregory will be gone forever and replaced with malevolence incarnate. The woman was dead serious about everything she said, but this world was so new to me it was hard to swallow it all. But I owed it to Gregory to believe. This was my last hope. We walked through the spell together and ensured I had everything I needed. She didnt charge me for borrowing the book. She just asked I returned when done. I thanked and left the store, feeling both more at ease and nervous simultaneously. That evening, I spent extra time with Gregory. I stroked his hair and read to him. I made sure he was comfortable in bed and told him that hopefully tomorrow will be the start of a new beginning. He didnt respond, of course. He didnt have the energy for that. He just stared at the wall and wheezed that muck-filled wheeze. I kissed his forehead and left to prepare the spell. At midnight, I began. I wont go through the minutia of each step because I dont want to be responsible for spreading something so dangerous. The generality of it though involved lightning a candle and focusing on the love I had for Gregory. Then I lit another candle to represent the dark force feeding of Gregory. I poured salt around that candle and focused and making it leave. After I built enough spiritual strength, I put out the second candle, leaving only Gregorys lit. Nothing happened, but I was told to expect that. I would only know if the spell worked the next morning. More hopeful than Ive been in years, I went to bed thinking about what dawn might bring. After some tossing and turning, I eventually gave in to sleep. I awoke to find myself in a white room. It was bright except the corners, which were pitch black. There were no doors or windows. Just me, the light and the darkness. I stayed in the center of the light and poured over the surroundings. I quickly realized I wasnt alone. There was movement in the darkness. The darkness reached out further from the corners until it covered the walls. The movement then circled me while staying concealed. Then I heard it. You care for Gregory? a deep voice growled. Yes! Hes my son, I answered. You want to see him strong? it questioned. Yes, more than anything. I want to see him healthy again. I want to see him play and learn. I want him to have a life again. The voice didnt respond to this. All I heard was a raspy growl emanate from the shadows. Will you leave him? Will you stop feeding of him? I asked, quickly losing my calm. The darkness reached out another few inches toward me. I felt the hidden presence get closer. I can make him strong again, the voice whispered behind me. I spun around to find nothing but blackness a few feet away. Yes! Please. Anything. I just want my boy back. I fell to my knees and sobbed. I felt like the presence was taunting me. The shopkeeper didnt warn me about this at all. The shadows spread closer until they were inches away from me. I looked up into the void. I will make him strong, the voice whispered. Yellow eyes opened in the darkness directly in front of my face. They were egg yolk yellow with pupils like a goats. I smelled sulfurous breath as the presence chuckled. I screamed and then the world went dark. I awoke in my bed. I was sweaty and my heart was pounding like a jackhammer. I looked around me to make sure everything was how it should be, and it was. The experience must have been a bad dream. After calming myself down and seeing it was daylight, I rushed to Gregorys room. I entered and Gregory was still asleep. He was on his side facing away from me. I approached him slowly. I was nervous about whether or not the spell actually worked. If it did, I would be beside myself. But if it didntI dont even know what I would do. As I approached, I heard Gregory wheezing still. My heart sank. But as I got closer, it sounded different. Was it getting better? I inched closer. Now it didnt sound as much like wheezing as it did a low growl. Then it disappeared for a few beats and sounded like wheezing. Panicked and confused, I rushed to Gregorys bed and sat next to him. Gregory, sweetie, its time to wake up, I whispered. He rustled a bit and then turned himself over to face me, though the slugabeds eyes were still closed. It was the most strength Ive seen him display in years. Good morning, sunshine, I said in a singsong voice. A smile spread on Gregorys face, and he opened his eyes. One look was all I needed to know how the spell fared. Tears mounted in my eyes and my face contorted to keep them from falling. Gregory was back, stronger than ever."
233,vulnerability,nosleep,Enter The Beloved: Katelynn's Story [Part 7],9,5zito1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zito1/enter_the_beloved_katelynns_story_part_7/,2017-03-15 22:36:15,"Adam and I had a fight last night. It turns out hes not who I thought he was. All this time I thought Adam was devout, pure, devoted to the pursuit of freedom just like I was and a loyal member of The Beloved. Hes not. And he came clean about it last night. At first I had full intentions to report him to leadership, but then he told me a few things I couldnt ignore. We met up in passing in the stacks at the library last night around 8. I had just left from a purge session with John, and had been making some amazing progress. John said my abilities are getting stronger and soon Ill be able to join him as his spirit wife. This was great news until I ran into Adam. I told him how my session went, and he freaked out. He shook his head and shoved his hands down in his jeans pockets. Look, Im gonna take a huge risk here, but I dont care anymore. I cant let you do this. Why not? Youre not the only one John has seduced, and its sick, Adam said. Dont talk that way. John is our savior. You sound like a defective right now. And you sound like a brainwashed cult member drunk on Johns Kool Aid! I nearly slapped him in the face for his blasphemy. I couldnt believe he said that about someone as pure and holy as John. Then it hit me. Hes the one who had been contacting everyone in The Beloved. *He* was Renegade! Adam looked around to make sure no one else was watching or listening. Then he pulled me to a remote corner and we sat down at a research table there. He locked eyes with me. Katelynn, dont do this. John is not who you think he is. That cant be. It *can* be, he said in a low voice, and it is. John thinks he is God. I assure you he isnt. Hes just a sick, twisted pervert who wants you as part of his harem. Youre lying! Wanna bet? Johns got a harem. I know that for a fact. Then how come no one else knows or says anything? Why do you think, Katelynn? That screams wacko pseudo-religious cult. This only works if everyone believes hes God. You think hes gonna admit to this when hes pushing chastity on everyone else? Adam sat back and gave me a glare and waited for my response. I stood up. Youre a deviant! Im reporting you to the elders. He remained seated and laughed. Go ahead. I dont care. Ill do whatever it takes to keep you away from that narcissistic psychopath! Part of me wanted to walk away, but I couldnt. Now that he had suggested there was foul play, I could look back and see questionable motives in John. Adam could see my wheels turning. He tore out of piece of paper and scribbled on it. Then he handed it to me. Whats this? The truth, Adam said. Johns real name is Warren Eaton. BING him. Youll vomit at what you find. Why? Whats he done? Adam got up from the table. Oh no. Thats for you to read about. I wont spoil it for you. Besides, the proper path to being deprogrammed is for you to come to the full truth on your own. Then he walked away. I sat for the next two hours and debated whether I should research this. All I wanted was to believe in John, but Adam was so convincing, and I knew in my heart he had no ill motives. Finally I got to a computer and searched for this name. Several links came up right away. The first was for Michigans official sex offender registry. My hands shook as I clicked on the link. I thought I was seeing things. Right there in front of me was a younger picture of John. He was wearing an orange jumpsuit and was holding a number. Oh God, I said and kept reading. **WARREN EATONSEX OFFENDER** Offenses  Description: Statutory rape, sexual misconduct with a minor, sexual battery, incest  Date Convicted: 01/22/2004  Conviction State: Michigan  Details: FELONY D  Sentence: 5 YRS DOC I nearly fell out of my chair. This was *John.* I couldnt believe as intuitive as I was that I never picked up on this. So much for being as spiritually in tune as he had suggested I was. I printed out the information, looked over my shoulder to make sure no one else was around and grabbed the papers. But there was more. According to some local news links in the UP (thats the Upper Peninsula for those who arent aware), John had similar sects of The Beloved at other universities under different names. One ended with the death of 12 students who had taken their own lives by taking sleeping pills. John was under investigation but then later it was dropped after he cited his 1st Amendment rights, and there was no proof he had told any of those students to do what they had. Due to a possible scandal and pending lawsuit John had filed, no one else picked up the investigation. I printed that too. This was madness. There had to be an explanation. But this was real, in black and white, and there was no denying it. The photos on the Web were clearly of John and clearly not photoshopped. This was real. I didnt know where to turn. Then I looked down at the paper Adam had given me. There was more on it than just Johns real name. There was an address at the bottom that I knew was just off campus and the following note **I told you so. I know youre scared right now, but Im here for you. Meet me at my apartment as soon as you can. You can trust me.** **Adam** I gathered up my stuff and left. ***** The shuttle ride off campus and out to Adams apartment seemed to take forever. I trembled as I tried to process everything I had just read. Could everything Ive believed be a lie? There had to be another explanation, but I couldnt ignore cold hard facts. Adam knew I couldnt, which was why he gave them to me. My legs wobbled as I raced up to his front door. He opened it before I could reach it. Get in here, he said with urgency, then closed the door behind me. I stared at him, searching for answers, some end to this nightmare, but I knew. Everything he had told me and everything I had found had to be true. You knew Id come here? He nodded, and I leaned back against the door. Adam took a step back from me. I dont know what to make of this, I said in a low voice. Whats there to question now that you know the truth? His tone was filled with frustration, and this was the second time that day I had seen him as anything other than calm and collected. He took a deep breath. I just cant believe it. Believe it, he said. The Beloved is a cult, and I intend to expose the whole thing. Was he serious? Then lets just leave, I said. Why the need to destroy this? This is helping people. People find comfort, healing and freedom in Johns teachings. Why take that away from them? How can you say that? His face reddened with rage. Adam, I dont know. Maybe John has changed. Maybe hes purged his old ways and Trust me, he hasnt. I turned to leave, and he grabbed me by the arm. Dont go back to him, Katelynn, not after what you know. Let me go. He released me, and then looked down at the floor. Im taking this cult down with or without your help. Why, Adam? Whats in this for you? Tears filled his eyes, and he unsnapped and removed his leather wristbands, holding up his arms to show me something I wasnt expecting. Youre not the only one with scars, he said with pain in his voice. This is what John and The Beloved brainwashed me to do. My heart dropped to the floor. I gasped and put my hand over my open mouth. Adam had deep pink fading scars on both wrists. I grabbed his wrists, examining the vertical scarred cuts for myself. He told me it was the only way, that suicide was the only way to be free, he said in a low voice. I believed him. Can you believe it? I have a 129 IQ, and I believed his lie. Thank God I was home when I did it, freaked out and called 9-1-1 right after. I knew it was wrong. Yet I did it. Katelynn, I cant let him do this to anyone else. People will die if I dont stop him. Oh my God He smirked. Dont you mean, Oh my John? He paused, then spoke again. That six months I defected from The Beloved to find myself before coming home is bull. I spent most of that time in a psych ward being deprogrammed. Thats why I was gone. Thats why Im still working on my doctorate. Im back now only to expose John and help everyone I can escape from this. Im so sorry, Adam. I didnt know. He took a step toward me, and I was now up against the door again. I gently ran my thumb over his right wrist, then bent down to give it a tender kiss. I did the same with the other. Adam reached up and wiped the streaming tears from my cheeks. Please dont go back to him, he said again. Then he leaned toward me and cupped my face with his hands. Our lips met, softly at first and then with more pressure and passion. Adam parted my thighs with his knee, leaning farther into me. I clutched him, breathless, aching for him, fully prepared to let him have me any way he wanted to. I yearned for him then, and there was only one thing we could do in that moment that would satisfy my need for him. You dont know how difficult it was not to do this the first time you asked me to, he said in almost a whisper. Youre all Ive thought about since we met Then ask me to stay the night, I whispered, now consumed by loves powerful enchantment. Ill say yes. Just ask me. He kissed my neck, taking his time, as though each delicate point of contact was vital, telling me all of his secrets without speaking any words. And I knew what every one of them meant. I reached down to unzip his jeans. Thats when he stopped and backed away after moving my hands away from him. Dont. We cant. Not now. Desire still pulsated through me, and I stood enslaved to it. Its OK, Adam. I want this tonight. He shook his head, then looked at me with adoration. Im sorry, Katelynn. I shouldnt have kissed you. Believe me, I want more and I want you, but its dangerous now for us both. John and the elders cant find out about us. It would mean trouble for both of us, especially for you. Just let me stay here with you. We dont have to have sex. He backed away again and looked down. Im not sure you should. The truth is youre in an emotionally fragile place, not fully deprogrammed. I wont take advantage of your vulnerability they way John would. Besides, your feelings for me might not be real because of it. Yes, they are. They had to be. I also felt something and had felt something for Adam since the day we met. It had to be real. Adam looked relieved. Does anyone else from The Beloved know youre here? No. All right. Stay tonight. But we cant be this careless again. Then he walked into the kitchen. I followed. He grabbed a can of Pepsi out of the refrigerator and handed it to me. Then he took out another for himself. Adam chugged it, then threw the can in the trash and sat down at the kitchen table. I joined him. Im sorry I cut us off in there, he said. Theres nothing I want more than to take you to bed, but I cant have the distraction now. I cant let any of them know how I really feel about you. John would use my feelings for you to his advantage, and I dont want you hurt. I hope you understand. At first I didnt want to understand. But deep down I knew he was right, and we still had to go on as though nothing was going on between us. I only nodded. We both realized it was after midnight and decided to get some sleep. Adam let me sleep in his room with him, and I was glad, not because of our physical attraction as much as the fact I didnt want to be alone. He knew that, and we didnt fool around anymore. The events of the day finally hit me hard as he spooned up against me from behind. Everything was still so confusing. John had seemed so pure, so spiritual, so trustworthy, but now I didnt know what to think about him in light of the truth. I wept there as Adam held me. He told me over and over everything was going to be all right and he would protect me. The comfort his warm and loving arms gave me soothed the hurt and confusion inside, and I felt in that moment something I hadnt felt since the night of my attack. Safe. ***** Adams letting me post this from his place on a laptop leadership doesnt know he has. Im not sure how long Ill be able to keep these blogs a secret. The elders now monitor our online activities from the compound, so its no longer safe blogging from there. Im impressed hes been able to keep his off-campus apartment a secret this long. I just dont know whats in store for us now. I think Im falling for him, which seems strange and almost wrong in light of my soul tie with John. Maybe its all a lie. Maybe John and I arent connected at all. Maybe we are. I dont know. Maybe its like Adam said. Hes convinced John has a harem and John wants me to be a part of it. Yet Adam wont give me definitive proof. He wont tell me the extent of what hes witnessed or heard. He keeps telling me Im not ready. I have a class this morning at 9, and then I have a purge session with John. I dont know how Ill be able to do this anymore, not after learning what and who he really is. All I want to do is leave, but The Beloved will never let that happen. Adam and I are trapped now, and the only way out is to take this down from the inside. But how?

234,vulnerability,nosleep,I put my arm in a wormhole I found in my wall.,65,5pfyq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5pfyq2/i_put_my_arm_in_a_wormhole_i_found_in_my_wall/,2017-01-22 19:12:51,"I found something curious in my wall. A wormhole. It had seemingly puckered open upon accident. Well, it was no accident, I think, I mean, it seemed like it was the result of years of work. Although it doesnt seem like it was meant to open now and it clearly wanted to be much larger than it was. See it was small and in state of distressing vulnerability. It seemed like it could close at any moment Something was begging me into the darkness of it. It was late and I was hopeful. I guess. I had to believe this was something monumental. Perhaps there would be some people on the other side - bureaucrats, politicians, authorities of every kind ready to meet me just through the hole. I couldnt really look away from it. It wasnt enough to simply watch though. I had to go through. Let me be clear, there was nothing very remarkable about the hole itself. Its a hole like any other. It was purple in its glow, and it wasnt abnormally shaped. The distortions caused by its presence were small, best way I can describe it - ripples on water. I should mention my room was dark but the light of the wormhole scarcely illuminated the place. The air around it seemed solid, thick with the smell of sterility if that makes any sense. So anyway, this is evidence of parallel worlds. Some wormhole theory I think, far as I can tell was right. Or maybe it was something I read in a comic. Im not sure, but this hole is real. Right now, I think I can hear voices out of it. Anyway, I stuck my arm into the surface of the hole about an hour ago. It wasnt sturdy. My hands dipped into it like water. Beyond the hole I can feel a faint air of movement. Theres some wild expanse through this wall of that I can be sure. Im not proud of this. See, Ive lost my freedom. I somehow didnt heed the great epiphanies of men from movies or anything like that. See its about 4 am here now and presumably, the wormhole would have simply opened a space between the retaining wall of my room and the rest of the house. I didnt seem to think this would be fundamentally a wormhole to another world. The door to my room is locked, and the blinds are shuttered. Im typing this all out on my phone that I fished out of my pants. My right arm is still in the wall. Its stuck. Truth be told, Im just happy it wasnt big enough to get my head through. Being honest, that was my first thought. Theres a soft breeze on my fingers now. If I close my eyes this can be peaceful. I could die in this moment. I kinda think Im going to anyway. I can still wiggle my fingers in the wind. Somehow the wormhole must of puckered when my arm went in. Its tight near my shoulder but my fingers are fine. Yeah, Im in up to my shoulder. Ive reached down, and reached up, but Ive felt nothing in my grasp. Its difficult for me to distinguish the space where my other arm exists but I'm trapped. Just wanted to keep a record of this. Scared to call anyone. I live alone. Kinda just want to wait it out."
235,vulnerability,nosleep,The Salt Woman,1363,5r5ypn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5r5ypn/the_salt_woman/,2017-01-31 15:08:10,"My great grandfather John was the closest thing to a ghost Id ever seen. He was very much alive, at least in the physical sense, but there was a sense of death and sadness that seemed to haunt him. Even as a child, I was attune to it. On the sunniest days, he hid in the shadows. In times of happiness and laughter, his face was full of agony and despair. He never showed much interest in me or my mother, or my mothers mother (who was his daughter, June), or my mothers mothers mother (that would be his wife, my great grandmother Cora). He showed so little interest in the latter, in fact, that when he awoke a few years ago to discover my great grandmother Cora dead beside him in bed, he left her there while he ate a breakfast of toast and coffee. Only after he had finished his breakfast and dressed for the day, did he pull out the Yellow Pages to phone the morgue, requesting they send someone around, when they had the chance, to sort this mess out. Instead, the police came. They asked my great grandfather John a lot of questions, and they had a look around the house. At the end of their investigation, though, they determined that my great grandmother had died in her sleep from natural causes, and the only thing my great grandfather was guilty of was having a cold heart. My great grandfather John came to live with us after that. Because, as my mother put it, where else could he go? The arrangement only lasted a year. I was a senior in high school at the time, and I remember seeing my great grandfathers presence in my home as an invasion. I hated how my mother made us act differently around him; made us pretend that we were refined and polite, when really we were the sort of dysfunctional family that communicated with slammed doors and expletives. I dont want your great grandfather to think all you do is play video games, she said as she unplugged my Playstation from the downstairs TV, boxing it up and instructing me to keep it hidden in my room. She replaced it with a stack of books that none of us had read  classics like Moby Dick and Robinson Crusoe. My mother also cleaned off our dining room table, which for years had served as a dumping ground for random trinkets and clutter  everything from elementary school art projects to delinquent credit card bills. Were going to have a home cooked meal together every night, like a family, she insisted. The charade only lasted for a few weeks  a few weeks of my mother smiling tensely and forcing conversation, my father and I scowling impatiently, and my great grandfather John ignoring us all, lost in his own world  before my mother finally realized it was a lost cause and gave up. After that, my great grandfather mostly kept to himself. He went to bed at seven each night, locking himself into his bedroom (when he moved in, he installed a deadbolt on his door). His door would remain the following morning. He wouldnt come out until we were all gone  my parents at work, me at school. What he did during the day, I still to this day have no clue. All my life, I had known my great grandfather John as a quiet and reclusive man. As I got older, I decided that the way he treated his family made him a cruel and selfish man. My opinion of my great grandfather changed one night, during the year he lived with us; what would turn out to be the last year of his life. My parents were celebrating their anniversary with an impromptu trip to the coast. They had long given up on their marriage, and on enjoying each others company. A poorly planned trip to a deserted beach town, grey with winter and shuttered for the off-season, was the final nail in the coffin. (They announced their plans to a divorce a few months later). The trip left me alone with my great grandfather for a week, and I enjoyed most of that time ignoring my curfew and playing my Playstation on the downstairs TV. One night I was sitting downstairs doing my homework at the dining room table (which had again become littered with life debris) when I heard the deadbolt on my great-grandfathers bedroom door unlatch, followed by his soft footsteps moving down the stairs. This was hours after his usual 7 p.m. bedtime, so I was curious what had brought him out of bed. A snack? A drink? Some fresh air? In the months that we had lived together, I had learned not to bother greeting my great grandfather  he rarely acknowledged me anyways. So that night, I was shocked when he padded over and took a seat directly across from me at the table, clearing a spot for his hands to rest. Im going to die soon, he told me, looking me square in the eye, And I need to tell you something before I go. He had already had my full attention, but I was so intrigued that I closed my textbook and pushed my homework away. Dont interrupt, he instructed. Dont speak until Ive finished. I nodded my acceptance of his terms, and then he began: I was born in the Philippines, in what you would probably call a straw hut, he said. My mother had already decided for me that I was going to be an American. I wasnt allowed to learn Tagalog, only American English. My mother only spoke to me using the very broken bit of English that she knew. My only source of conversation and companionship came from the radio. She had it tuned to a station that broadcast in English, and she would sit me down, instructing me to listen. Sometimes shed repeat the English phrases she heard, to make sure I was listening. But neither of us spoke English, and neither of us knew what the sounds and syllables coming out of the radio meant. Listening to my great grandfather speak was strange for several reasons: first, in the span of two minutes he had already said more to me than he had my entire life. Second, because the way he spoke, it sounded like he was reading a story from a book, or reciting something from memory. Every word seemed carefully chosen; carefully crafted together. When I was old enough to be useful, my mother gave all the money she had to a fisherman who promised to take me to America. Im not sure what she hoped would happen once I got there. I was just a scrawny boy with brown skin. I didnt speak, and I didnt seem to listen either. Anyone that saw me would have assumed I was deficient. The fisherman took me to sea. It was months before I saw land again, but luckily I didnt know what time was back then. The fisherman was a talkative man, and he insisted on speaking to me, whether I understood him or not. He taught me the names for all the different parts of his ship, the tools he used, the fish we caught. Once I had learned those words, he taught me about the stars in the sky and how I would never get lost as long as I remembered where they were. He taught me the names of the fish we caught, and the legends about the monsters that lived in the sea. The fisherman taught me a great many things, and when he kept his promise to my mother and brought me to America, I decided he was a good man. We arrived in Alaska, and no sooner had my feet touched the dock in Ketchikan, he offered me a job on his boat. He paid me better than he needed to; better than the other brown boys who were shuttled over on crowded boats and made to work in factories. And he let me rent a room in his house with a cot to sleep on and a hot meal each night. He charged me a fair rent for the room, which he deducted from my wages every month. Our arrangement taught me two new words: integrity and respect. A man of integrity always pays his own way, he told me. He explained that he charged me rent out of respect for my integrity. We spent a lot of time at sea. Sometimes there were storms and the sky would rain sharp shards of ice and the sea would rock with massive waves, reminding us of just how tiny we were. Other times, when the sea was smooth and the sky clear, the crew would remedy boredom with spirits and other exotic spoils they had acquired in their travels. When they had drowned their sorrows in these spirits and smoked pipes filled with their funny grass, and their eyes were glassy and their cheeks red, theyd tell stories. You can imagine the sort of stories: legends of lost treasure, of pirates, of sea monsters and mermaids. Always the same sort of thing. One night, it was just the fisherman and I, and he started to tell me one of his stories. I usually liked his best, but the one he told that night chilled me to the bone. The legend of the Salt Woman. My great grandfather paused. As he told me his story, he had sat with his eyes cast down and his hands folded on the table in front of him. When he stopped, he looked up at me. It struck me that this was the first time I had really seen my great grandfather. The lines and wrinkles worn into his face, the brown that had faded from his skin, the bottomless blackness of his eyes. He continued: According to the legend, the fisherman said, hers was a beauty that changed form to suit the eye of the beholder. She was a shape-shifter, and she transformed to fulfill the deepest desires of whoever looked upon her. A man liked red hair and pale skin? When he saw her, hed see hair as red as strawberries and skin so milky he could lap it up. This was the most animated I had ever seen the fisherman, so I asked him, have you met this woman? His smile faded and he said, aye, I have. So I asked the fisherman what she looked like when he saw her. He said: why, she had hair as red as strawberries, and skin so milky I could lap it up. I laughed, but he didnt. So I asked him what happened when he met this red-haired woman of his dreams. The Salt Woman is a jealous God, he explained. Once youve seen her beauty, its your curse to love her forever. If you reject the Salt Woman, she will shift to her original form; to something demonic and hideous. She's a devil in disguise, and once youve seen her for who she truly is, the legend says youll turn to salt. A fishermans first love is the sea, the fisherman said. When the Salt Woman realized that I had betrayed her by loving something more than I loved her, she began to shift before my eyes. I asked the fisherman how he had been spared the Salt Womans horrible punishment. He told me that he shut his eyes and ran, blindly. Unfortunately for the fisherman, though, the Salt Woman cant be outsmarted. She follows those who betray her, she haunts them. The Salt Woman stalks them, lurking in every shadow and hiding in every dark corner. It becomes her game, and its excruciating. But in the end, she always wins. My great grandfather was still looking at me, this grave expression filling his face. I kept my promise not to interrupt, and waited for him to continue. I stayed with the fisherman for several years, he said finally. Until his skin turned pale grey and he started coughing up blood. I wasnt sure what was going to be the death of him: the Salt Woman from his story, or the cancer festering in his lungs. Ultimately, he wasnt willing to die at the hands of either. One clear winter night, while we were out at sea, he jumped from the ship and into the black water below. I suppose if you believed the legend of the Salt Woman, youd say he won. After the fisherman died, I decided to start my own company. The fisherman had left me his boat and a small sum of money, in addition to a wealth of invaluable skills and knowledge. I established myself in Alaska and got a place of my own in Ketchikan. I sent some money to the Philippines, along with letters and packages, but these were all eventually returned to me. No explanation, just Return to Sender. One problem that couldnt be cured with money or success was loneliness, my great grandfather said. Without the fisherman around, I felt fiercely lonely. The other men in town had a tendency to keep company with the loose-moralled harlots that slunk around flaunting their flesh, like their bosoms were a kind of wealth. I remembered the story of the fisherman, though, and avoided these temptations. Instead, I went to mass, and thats where I met a woman named Beth. She was modest and ordinary in every sense of those words, but she was kind and loyal. Like me, she was a transplant in Alaska, and like me, she found that the only thing colder than a winter day, is the bitterness of being alone. After a brief courtship, we married. By the end of that year, she was with child. A mixture of excitement and pride burned in my cheeks; I hadnt known that my great grandfather had been married before Cora. I felt honored; like he had selected me to be his confidante. I wondered who else had been trusted with this privileged information? You probably dont need me to remind you, my great grandfather said, that it was quite controversial for a brown man to marry a white woman. Even in Alaska. I was a brown Filipino, she was a white Russian. Those things didnt mix, and our union was something of a controversy, even to the locals who looked at me with a measure of respect. But Beth didnt care about what the gossip, or the cruel things that other wives in town whispered to each other when she walked by. She didnt care about the color of my skin. She didnt care that our child would be brown, like me. Our son was born with a head of dense black hair that stood up straight. He had my nose, pressed flat against his face, and the same ivory skin and constellation of ginger freckles as his mother. Beth named him John, after me. I thought it was an honor I hadnt yet earned, but she insisted. Things got hard after the baby. There never seemed to be enough money, we never seemed to get enough sleep. I worked harder than ever before. I was never home, always at sea. Id dock in strange new cities where I was surrounded by strange faces I didnt recognize. This next part, Im ashamed of, my great grandfather said. Theres no excuse  no amount of loneliness or desperation. The fisherman taught me about the word integrity, and since then Ive learned that integrity means being able to admit when youve done wrong. The fisherman also taught me about the Salt Woman. But even his warning couldnt save me from my own foolish humanity. My great grandfather had cast his eyes down again. He was staring at the table, at his hands, as if there was dirt beneath his fingernails that he wanted gone. I was lonely when I met her, he said. She was the prettiest thing I had ever laid eyes on, just like the fisherman said. Brown skin the color of molasses. After months trapped with the stench of fish and sea, she smelled like lavender. I dont need to tell you the details, he said. Suffice it to say I was drunk; drunk on her charm, her beauty, and drunk on the cheap spirits of an Alaskan fishing town. I was unfaithful that night. I awoke before the sun the next morning, and I saw her sleeping beside me in a bed I didnt recognize, in a home that wasnt my own. I was horrified by what Id done, and the warning of the fisherman came to me: if the this was the Salt Woman laying beside me, I would no doubt fall prey to her wrath when she awoke and learned that I intended to return to my Beth. I decided to flee before she awoke. I ran. Once Id made it to the docks, I boarded my ship and woke the crew so we could set sail. I didnt feel at ease out at sea. The disgust I felt tormented me, and I felt the wrath of the Salt Woman following me, like the wake we left in the ocean. I knew I hadnt outsmarted her, and it was only a matter of time before her punishment came. When we arrived back in Ketchikan, I was reluctant to return home to Beth. I had already made up my mind that I wasnt going to tell her; what good would it do? It would only hurt her, and the curse of the Salt Woman was my burden to bear, and my burden alone. Nothing could have prepared me for what awaited when I returned home. My great grandfather had stopped talking, and I realized how long we had been sitting there. I wondered if it was hard on him; if he needed to take a break. Beth was waiting for me, he said. She held our lifeless son in her arms. He dangled like a toy, and I knew he was dead. He was dripping wet. She had drowned him. I tried to take him from her, but she wouldnt let me. I shouted at her, my guilt replaced with anger and hurt. Thats when I saw it. The pieces of her face were like the pieces of a puzzle, cracking and shifting and falling away. Underneath, she burned black. Her face was melting, losing its shape. My body responded before my brain had figured it out, and I turned my back. I ran for the door, and I heard her body disintegrate behind me, shattering and crinkling like little shards of glass scattering over the hardwood floor of our home. I kept my eyes shut, following the route outside from memory. I wanted to look back, wanted to see my wife and my son, but I knew they were no longer there. Beth was the Salt Woman. The fisherman told me that the Salt Woman would assume the shape of your deepest desires. I foolishly thought that meant beauty. But for me, the Salt Woman became the very thing that my heart longed for most: loyalty, family, a loving mother. The Salt Woman exploits any brand of vulnerability or loneliness. What happened? I asked breathlessly, forgetting my promise not to interrupt. My great grandfather didnt seem annoyed. His hands rose from the table for the first time and he rubbed his temples. She hasnt left me since that day, he said. Just like the fisherman warned me, she has haunted me endlessly. Everywhere I go, I feel her presence. I hear the cries of our infant son. I know shes coming for me. I can feel it. We sat in silence, the story dissolving in my mind like a cube of sugar dropped into hot tea, furling and unfolding. Then my great grandfather excused himself. It was long after midnight, and he said he needed to get some rest. He stopped at the foot of the stairs and slapped my back with the palm of his hand. He didnt say anything, but he didnt need to. I didnt sleep a wink that night. My mind was racing with questions I wanted to ask, details that I needed to clarify. A few times I was tempted to walk down the hall and hammer on his door, to wake him up and ask, thats how desperately I wanted to know more. But I didnt. It could wait until the morning, I reasoned with myself. That night would be the last time I ever saw my great grandfather. The police reports say he went missing from his bed; thats the official explanation. But I know better. When my parents returned home the next morning, they found his door unlocked. They pushed it open to discover that he was, indeed, missing from his bed. In his place, there was a pile of salt. In the years that followed my great grandfathers death, I was profoundly disturbed by the stories he told me. The legend became so engrained in me that I followed my great grandfathers footsteps to Ketchikan and asked around about the legend. It took a while before I found someone willing to talk to me, but they told me the story. It matched my great grandfathers rendition, almost word for word. There was only one detail that my great grandfather had left out: the curse doesnt strike randomly. Its passed on by the men that survive the Salt Woman. When they tell the legend, it spreads the curse; it selects the Salt Womans next victim. Like a communicable disease. If thats true, then that means the fisherman passed the curse to my great grandfather when he told him the story. And when my great grandfather told me the story that night at my parents dining room table, then I stop typing. I look up across the bedroom at my beautiful wife, asleep in our bed. No. That part of the legend cant be true. Right? *** You can listen to Dr. Night Terror's narration of this story [here](URL"
236,vulnerability,nosleep,I always have weird experiences when I camp.,266,5ot67j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ot67j/i_always_have_weird_experiences_when_i_camp/,2017-01-19 11:03:28,"**EDIT** I have officially written an addendum and have posted it **[here](URL for you guys. I would have added it to this one, but breaking it up felt like it made it easier to digest. I used to be really into the idea of hiking, camping and being outdoorsy. I am a 'city slicker' and was content to try and play mountain man for short stints. Camping for me has always been a ritual in weird. I don't do it anymore, and doubt I will again. For a period, I assumed that was just the spirit of camping, especially being a city boy. Things are weird in the woods. That's just how it is. Have you ever heard a fox scream? Sounds like a girl being stabbed in the back. I was very fortunate in that a fellow hiker saw the look on my face and recognized that this was the first time I'd ever encountered this side of nature. But for a moment, I could just picture a girl in the woods and some crazed man behind her, and the last noise she made fell on my ears. It took a little convincing from the other hikers to have me believe them, but ultimately I did after the fox called again. Never did see the fox, though. I have a habit of never seeing the weird, however. It always manages to elude me, making me question if I was just over reacting to my imagination. One trip, I was lying next to my fire, which I'd built near a small creek pretty high up this mountain I was hiking. I was starting to fall asleep when I thought I heard steps coming my way. Judging from how the pace was, I thought it was another hiker or camper who hadn't even noticed me yet. Or if they did, they didn't seem bothered to slow down or call out. I wasn't exactly close to a trail, which is why I ended up settling down where I had. It was getting dark and I had plenty of gear. So, I remained pretty still and lying down when I began to see the faintest outline of someone. They stayed just out of the firelight and remained a shadow. I called out, getting pretty unnerved. They didn't seem too interested in responding. We had a moment of tense silence together before I twitched my headlamp on. No one was there. At first I actually thought maybe I just lost track of them, considering where in my view they were staying. You know when it's dark and you have to look past something to really see it? That was how it was. I hadn't ruled out that maybe they were still off to the side. I called out again, a little more vehemently this time. Still silence. Even the little creek seemed mellow. Though I was having a hard time hearing anything over the rapid drumming of my heart in my ears. I was miles up a trail, alone, and beginning to feel a sense of vulnerability I never had before. After what felt like an incredibly long amount of time passed, I managed to fall asleep as there were no developments in my strange guest and I could not see them anywhere. I know it sounds a little crazy to fall asleep after something like that being on your mind, but I couldn't find anyone nearby and assumed I was just getting nervous being so far away from other people. Camping was still somewhat new to me at this point, but not so new that I was uncomfortable going alone. Not long after, I woke up, absolutely certain I was still being watched, and I went to turn my headlamp back on and was met with a hard lesson in conserving battery life. I had fallen asleep with it on. I stoked the fire in the meantime, but it was really just an excuse to hold onto a stick and feel slightly less unprepared. I had new batteries for my headlamp in my bag, but I wanted to wait and see if I could see anything yet. After my fire woke back up, I kept thinking I could see someone leaning against a tree about fifteen feet away. They just looked like they were watching. I didn't call out since we weren't on speaking terms. Instead I opted to give the most intimidating look I could muster. Somehow I could feel it being returned. Smoldering length of wood in hand, I considered approaching them, but I had no idea who they were and if they were armed. Did they have a knife? A gun? I was unprepared for anything other than a bad attitude. So I considered running. My gut protested at the idea though, since I really wasn't confident I could make my way back to the trail in the dark. I was trapped with this silent, dark stranger that I couldn't even prove was actually there. After a period of this prolonged tension, I felt like my mind was playing tricks with me. I would think I saw more than one person, or wonder if I heard more behind me or if it was just the creek. I learned a lot about dread and patience that night. The worst was when the fire finally died. I will never forget how long it took to count to ten in that dark tension. Light bloomed and slowly the shadows retreated with it. I was equal parts tired and completely electric when I stood up, finally. My own sounds seemed deafening after being that hyper vigilant for so long. I packed up quickly and humped my way down the mountain in a few hours. I passed no other hikers on my way, and carried the weight of that nights solitude the whole way down. Finally, on my way out I saw a park ranger who I was all too eager to tell my story to. In reality, I was just happy to talk to someone at all after that. He was kind, though obviously skeptical of my story. We talked about other things for a bit before he advised me to have a safe drive home. Before I rolled up my window he asked me if I saw any tracks around my camp at all, thinking maybe a cougar kept me up all night. I told him I didn't even think to look, I was just in a hurry to leave. He said he was going to take a look, just in case he needed to document any new signs of cats. I received a call from him the next day. He first chided me for leaving my firepit smoldering, which I apologized for, even though I thought I had taken care of it. I doubted my own recollection of that detail, however and believed him. He then said that I was right to be so alert, mentioning that there were bare footprints all around where I said I camped. He said they were going to look for possible meth heads in that area, since they would occasionally have problems with them trying to live off the grid while they would cook out in the woods. That isn't the strangest thing that has happened, however. I have other damn good reasons I stay out of the woods when it gets dark now. [EDIT: Part DUEX, revenge of the weird] Since this hit 50 points, I think I can share another that comes to mind easily. You guys seem to dig it, and I have lived through a LOT of weird. Another trip that comes to mind is one a couple months after that one, when summer was really in full swing. I encountered loads of campers, which had me really in the camping mood this time. I went to Crater Lake, alone again. It was a gorgeous trip and I was really excited to set up camp and get into the lake away from the heat for a bit. I ended up staying out near the shore a lot longer than I originally intended, so I ended up coming back to camp with little light left in the day. Making the most of my time, I was collecting firewood on my return. When I arrived, I couldn't help but notice something was really off. But I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Once I did, I stopped dead and dropped the wood at my feet. My tent was gone. The rest of my stuff was there, which I thought was odd, considering I thought my tent was stolen. Upon further inspection I noticed it wasn't actually gone at all. It was fucking buried right under where I had set it up. After some digging, and much frustration, I noticed it was buried while it was still assembled. Someone, or someones, had come and managed to dig a hole big enough to entirely bury my tent and cover it up. That would be some record grave digging time, I thought. Once that thought crossed my mind, I felt less angry and a little more unnerved. I pulled my tent out from its impromptu grave, and set camp up a little more carefully. I wasn't about to be put off by some pranksters, and even I had to admit, this was a pretty good one. The night went on without a hitch and I slept pretty well, even if my tent smelled like a dirt clod. The following morning I spent with a small group of fellow campers after we all got to talking about how awesome the weather was out here. We all shared a laugh when I told them about what happened to my tent, hoping to see if any of them fessed up to it. None did, but they said they thought it could be the group of frat boys they had been seeing around since they got here two days ago. I assumed that made the most sense and completely explained how a hole could have been dug so fast. Cutting out the fun outdoorsy part of this story, since it really was just a beautiful trip, I'll skip to that evening, which ended up being my last evening there. That night I woke up and was sure I heard whispers nearby. I immediately thought it was those pranksters back for part two. I left my tent with my axe in hand and shouted their joke wasn't very funny anymore. No response, and the whispers silenced. I assumed they got the message and really didn't want to disturb other nearby campers, so I retreated back to my tent when I heard a voice ask me from inside where are you? in a calm tone. I paused, first shocked and then livid. This joke had gone on too far with me. I threw open the tent flap fully expecting to see some drunk kid having a laugh, but no one was there. Naturally, I assumed I just misheard where the voice came from, despite feeling pretty sure it came from inside my tent. In my infinite wisdom, I reached into my bag and found the emergency flare I had brought with me and tossed it into the woods near my tent. This had the lovely effect of filling the woods with a creepy red glow and attracting other campers looking to help someone in trouble. No pranksters in sight. I put out the flare by shoving it fire side down into the dirt and explained to the approaching campers that I was okay, just looking for pranksters. They were understanding, if a bit confused. They offered to help me look around, and I took them up on it. A couple from their group decided to revive my fire and drag some beer over from their campsite as we all looked around for signs of the culprits. After a few beers and a few laughs about my tent being buried, we all decided whoever it was must have left and went to try and sleep again. Oregonians are awesome people, when they aren't burying your tent. When I crawled back inside my tent, I noticed something was strange again. My sleeping bag was entirely full of dirt. I inspected the rest of the inside and it was surprisingly clean for how much dirt was in my bag. It was entirely full of dirt. I know it seems mundane, and maybe it was those campers who helped me out. But I had enough by that point and packed it up for the night and went back to my car, since it was only about a half hour from where I was. I didn't bother reporting this to anyone, or even telling anyone for a while since it sounds kind of silly. But here is another story. I have one more good one, but some foot notes about things I've seen while hiking, since I still do that. I was once out on a super popular trail and I found a completely destroyed deer. Like something exploded this deer on the trail. That was pretty unsettling, though I really just chalked it up to bear, since we DO have bears out here. It was gone the next time I was on that trail. Speaking of deer, once when driving through Georgia with an old girlfriend I spotted a deer cut clean in half on the side of the road. Just the rear half of a deer and a huge line of gore going up the road. I was freaking out about what happened to just cut a deer in half like that when the OTHER half was on the opposite side of the road. Everyone I told just said it must have been a log truck that hit it and carried the other half of the body while the driver kept going. "
237,vulnerability,nosleep,Outer Sunset (part one),5,5fk8wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5fk8wm/outer_sunset_part_one/,2016-11-30 05:19:45,"I thought my writing days were over, but I can't sleep, not even close, my brain wired and body tense from anxiety, and nothing else can take my mind off of the events of the last few weeks. The rain is droning against my house as I write this at three in the morning, making me a prisoner in this house, in my own mind. The questions churning endlessly, never resolving and returning to the beginning over and over. I moved here three weeks ago, into a little row house close by Ocean Beach, a few blocks up from Golden Gate Park, in the Outer Sunset district. My wife passed away earlier this year, leaving me with nothing but some good memories, some terrible memories of her at the end, and her 12 year old cat, a grouchy, patchwork quilt of scars named Bones. I still can't get used to her being gone, like a phantom limb which has left me scratching mentally at the place where she had been. I'll have conversations like she's right next to me, and glance around only to see Bones scowling at me, hunched in the corner by the door like it's my fault Jess isn't coming home. I guess that's why I moved out here from Portland, quit my job as a journalist, and decided to spend the summer in San Francisco regaining the balance of my teetering sanity. When you have spent the last ten years of your life with someone, and find yourself suddenly alone, there is a whole lot of self reflection to do. Especially when the last year had been spent taking care of my wife as she slowly withered away, ignoring my own responsibilities and getting heavy around the midsection as I ate microwave meals and read to her by her bedside while the steady drip of the saline from the cannula played counterpoint rhythm to the beeping of the monitors. My first night in this old house I was exhausted from the drive down and irritated by Bones yowling constantly at the front door, demanding I return her to the life we'd left, return the woman she'd spent her life being cared for by, and sending me angry glances of betrayal every time I tried to calm her down. I unpacked a sleeping bag and set up in the bare bedroom, leaving most of my few possessions I'd taken with me in the car save for some clothes and necessities for Bones. She ate a little and then peed on my hiking pack, a lost twin to the one Jess had bought with me when we'd started hiking Oregon trails near the coast and which I'd left an orphan in our old basement with most of her other belongings. I was angry and grabbed Bones, set her down determinedly in her litter box, but I knew she wasn't confused about where to pee. She was making a statement about what she thought of me, and honestly, I couldn't blame her. I opened a bottle of wine and sat cross legged in the floor, reading the last of a book that I had never got to finish reading to Jess, feeling the loss weighing across my chest, and picking at takeout Chinese, the food tasteless and heavy in my mouth, every swallow a conscious effort. When I finally went to sleep, on the dusty floor of this strange house, I dreamed of when we were a new couple, living together for the first time and embarking on our careers. I used to make her lunch before she left for university, and insert little ""coupons"" with corny things like Good For One Free Massage written on them, one of those things you do when you're in love and nothing seems too cheesy, no expression of appreciation seems like too much. I had forgotten about them as we'd gotten more routine with our relationship and things like being a steady rock for your partner became more of a statement of our affection, as we dealt with each other's achievements and failings together, than cute tokens that were ultimately just bad jokes. In my dream she handed me one of the cards, Good For One Night Listening To Your Problems, and we laughed and she kissed me. Even as she did the dream changed and she was standing at the bottom of our basement in Portland, holding a shoebox and looking up at me as I stood on the landing, a hand ready to close the door, staring down at the shadowed, too thin creature that had once been a beautiful woman with soft brown eyes and quick humor. Now, her eyes were shrunken and the flickering light of the naked basement bulb made her seem like a blinking skull, her hair wisps of golden nothing atop the pulled back skin of her head. She was mouthing something at me through dried lips, her mouth a gaping black hole, and she took one step up, teetering on sticklike ankles that she hadn't used in weeks, the knees beneath the hospital gown knobby and ancient, nothing like the muscular legs of the active woman she had once been. This was how she had looked towards the end, bedridden, all the humor dried up inside along with her failing organs. I wanted to scream as she walked up another step, as she held out the shoebox with shaking hands, scream that it was over, that I didn't have to see her like that anymore, that she was dead, but even as I screamed in my head no sound came out. I couldn't moved at all, couldn't slam the door, my hand just resting on it, staring horrified as she made her way up one step at a time, constantly mouthing words, and the only sounds were the creaking of the stairs and a far away drip drip drip of a tap or maybe the saline, maybe I was still beside her in the hospital and I would wake up and have to go through it all again. Watching her die, calling her family, arranging the funeral. She was two steps below me when she flung the box up and papers flew from it like confetti and her arms reached out towards me and I could finally scream and I did. I awoke with my jaw open as wide as it could go, bordering on dislocation, not screaming, sweat drenching my body under the thick sleeping blanket. It was utterly dark, no residential sounds or lights you take for granted in a lived in home, no buzzing of appliances or winking router lights or the soft snoring of a loved one beside you, just the empty blackness of an empty house. I was shaking and disoriented, taking a moment to remember where I was, when I was. I wanted to turn on the light but for some irrational reason, probably the remnants of the dream that clung to my mind like clouds to a mountain top, I couldn't get out from the bag, couldn't risk the vulnerability of being naked in the darkness. Bones was scratching at the door outside, shuffling back and forth in the creaky hallway, silently clawing at the wood. I worked up the courage finally to throw back the covers and when I did, I realized that Bones wasn't outside. She was sleeping next to my feet, curled up in a tight ball. For a moment my mind wouldn't comprehend what that meant, as I shifted her slightly to one side to get my feet out, and then I stopped. The sound outside the door was insistent, scratch scratch scratch. My heart jumped in my chest, my throat felt swollen and I couldn't breathe. The pacing began again, sounded like whatever was out there was walking in slow circles, and then pausing to claw on the bedroom door. I was frozen, the covers still half thrown off of me, half out of the sleeping bag, my eyes wide and staring at nothing. Please go away, I thought, just go away, just stop, please. I covered myself again and lay there, and then the sounds moved farther away. I thought I heard a harsh grunting noise, an angry throaty outburst, and I thought they were going to start banging in the door, yelling at me to face them, face whatever creature was out there. I lay still for a long, long time, until I realized I could see the outlines of things and knew the sun was finally coming up. At six in the morning, I finally got up. Bones stretched out when I did and got to her feet, causally cleaning her mussed up fur. When I opened the door, and stared down the long, still dim hallway, there was nothing there. Just the cheap carpet and stained walls of an old house. My mind immediately began to reshape the events of the night before, to make myself foolish, and maybe I could have done that. I walked noisily down to the bathroom and peed with the door open. Maybe I could have convinced myself that it was a dream or waking hallucination, and as I rummaged through my pack for toothbrush and towel I started breathing easier. I didn't want Bones peeing on my stuff again so I moved the kitty litter to the living room and closed the bedroom door before going to take a shower. It wasn't until then that I saw the door. At the bottom, there was a square index card sticking to the wood. I crouched down to see what it was, and Bones came up, a rare moment of affection as she brushed against my leg and purred the broken purr of an old cat or a dying generator, and I petted her absently as I peeled off the card. My hand froze on her gray fur. All the fear came rushing back as I read what it said: Good For One Free Kiss, Anytime, Anywhere. "
238,vulnerability,nosleep,The Observer,52,5geq7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5geq7o/the_observer/,2016-12-04 20:29:01,"It was outside my window that night, for the first time. Up until then, every time I saw it, it would be far enough way to barely be seen, behind the foggy windows of my middle school, among the trees in the woods behind my neighborhood, or tucked away in some dark corner of a dimly lit room. But never this close to my home. From my room on the second floor of my house, I stared unblinkingly at it: that figure under the pale yellow cast by the street lamps that guarded the suburb. Their crooked necks were bent over like monks occupied in scriptures, but there was no presence of holiness there. There was no sanctuary, or consolation on my street that night, not while it was watchingd. For a while, everything was still, with an energetic sort of tension that draws tight, as a line threatening to break yet never does. The lights watched the street. I watched it, and it watched me, just as it always did. The line was growing tighter. My chest was thrumming with such intense, pounding reverberation that my teeth chatters with every surging beat. The clicking in my mouth kept time like the second hand, and with each passing moment, the rhythm grew increasingly uneven and chaotic. So I withdrew from the window. A bead of sweat dripped from the end of my clammy middle finger, and Half-and-half, my cat, approached to sniff the salty pool, unaware of the interlopers ceaseless gaze. I could feel his downy fur brush against my leg as he crawled under the folds of my night gown. For a while I just stood there, backed away from the large window that stretched from my ceiling to my floor, allowing a cascade of undisturbed moonlight to pierce into the bedroom, and even though I could not see it, I felt the weight its watchful eye. I took a quaking step to the right as to encroach slowly back upon the glassy portal once again. It had moved, but not by much, maybe a couple feet or so, out of the ring of street light and into a dim penumbra. The small radio alarm-clock popped with a surge of power behind me, on the far wall of the room, and a white hissing filled the space around the room like a thin gas. That was the third time that night my radio tuned into a deserted frequency, completely unaided. My stomach quivered, threatening to relieve itself at any moment, as I cautiously backed my way to the radio, with eyes locked on the silhouette of Half-and-half as he sat, rigidly scrutinizing the street outside. Shooting a quick glance at the clock to find the radios off button, I deftly silenced the ambient sizzling and caught the time. The flashing display read 12:00, as it did when thunderstorms shut the power off, resetting the electric clocks hour back to midnight. I dared another look out the window, and at that very same moment I was startled by the faintest of sounds. The disturbance came from downstairs, and from my room it sounded little more than the scratching of a cat on the door. I darted my eyes across the room, hoping, praying that Half-and-half had exited and was the cause for the scraping. With reluctant realization, I noticed that Half-and-half had not moved a single muscle and was yet still on the edge of the widow, his milky fur scrambling in the draft of the air conditioning vent that sat at his feet. The moon was bulbous and massive that night, making him appear very small. His ears perked though, with every successive scrape against the front door. Tears pooled up into my eyes, obscuring my vision, and I jolted out of the room, into the hallway, down the stairs, and to the door of my parents. I could hear clearly the raspy grazing against the front door as I called out to my parents for the third time that night. The scoring got louder. Mom, Dad, please there is something trying to come in the house! I whimpered, tapping on the bedroom door. The claws on the front door resounded so heavily that I could only imagine the deep gashes that were being made. My parents were unknowing, though, and tired of their daughters constant night terrors. They did not reply; so, I tapped even more earnestly, pleading for sanctuary. My father, exhausted and unsympathetic, flung open the door. My heart seized up for a moment from his sudden appearing, as panic stricken as I already was. At first he said nothing and just frowned, but after a condescending glare on his part and desperate sniffling on mine, he spoke up, There is nothing wrong. Bed. Now. Then he sliced the gap between the two of us as he shut the door, leaving me even more alone than I had been before. My stomach quivered again, this time more violently, and I wrapped my arms around it, trying not to wretch. I noticed something at that moment though, something queer and vacant. A void had filled the house, an unhinging silence had taken the place of the scratching, and a terror, dreadful and icy cold, slithered its way down the column of my throat and into my chest where it stayed, nearly suffocating me. I gasped short, urgent breaths until the knot in my chest loosened and became manageable. Like anxious deer, I stepped forward, toe first into the deluminated living room in front of me, into the encroaching emptiness, into the heart of darkness itself, and I was alone. I began to cry again, falling to my knees as quietly as I could. To form myself into the smallest area possible, I curled into a tight knotted ball and rocked myself slowly. Back and forth, I swayed, for a time not measured by seconds but by passing, battering heart beats which shot hot blood to my face, making me woozy. My catharsis was interrupted by a single click and column of light, erected from the hallway above and traced to my toes in a solid line of luminescence. I stared at the beam, confused at its appearance. Click. The light retreated into nothingness, and darkness filled its place. Click. The light returned, and I frantically pulled myself on all fours away from it. In the middle of the patch of light, lay a dark patch of amorphous shape. While not quite a shadow, it moved in the flowing way heat does around hot blacktop. It was mesmerizing with its hypnotic fluidity, twisting and coiling in itself like a mass of serpents. Click. Once again, the light withdrew, and the sound of my bedroom door slamming shut erupted through the silence. The crack was startling enough to knock me against the wall behind me. I bit my tongue and dug my nails into my palms, hoping to alleviate even the smallest bit of stress from my self-harm. It worked for a time but ultimately left me with the same fear plus the added ache in my mouth. I wanted to just bite it off. I wanted to scream. I wanted to be free of this terror that had formed from nightmare into living horror. But I would eventually have to ascend the stairs, and I knew that. Whether it be by masochistic curiosity or the urging of my parents when they found me, I would eventually find myself back in that bed of chaos where it waited for me. Waiting to observe me, closer than it ever had before. Something brushed my back. I vaulted onto my feet, and spun on my heels. It was Half-and-half. My eyes had adjusted enough to the darkness by then to recognize his chunky, lithe figure as he walked gracefully toward me, and I figured he must have vacated the room right after the light turned off for the last time. I reached out for him, and he drew his head into my palm. He was shivering and soaking wet; his skin wriggled on his bones. Repulsed, I yanked my hand back into my chest and stepped away. He pursued though and draped his dripping body across my feet. Cold tendrils of sensation crawled up legs like the tentacles of a groping squid. Taking pity on the poor creature, I scooped the soggy mass up into my arms. With his body stretched out, the ends of his back paws nearly reached my shins. He purred lazily on my chest which would have been comforting if it not were for the fact that my arms were now fully occupied. This heightened my sense of vulnerability, and I felt so very small, small as a cats rounded outline against the shear face of the moon. With Half-and-half in tow, I made my way for the steps that were now wet from my cats silent descent into the living room. A draft floated from the top of the stairs. I put my foot on the first step and sucked in a lungful of air to hold my breath, hoping it would last me until I reached the top. I had made my way about halfway up the flight, when I heard the radio in my room click on once again with a static hum, but the interference was steadily being drowned out by the sound of my heart in my ears. I ascended, one stair at a time in between every other heartbeat. *Thud thud* step. *Thud thud* step. With Half-and-half going before me, this ritual was repeated another ten times until I reached the top, where I could see the closed door to my room. I let out my stale breath. Moonlight escaped from beneath the gateway and patiently faded on a gradient, melding into the surrounding darkness. I could see puddles on the floor where my cat had stepped, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading me back to where I had begun, and I noticed at once how frigid my toes and fingers had become despite my profuse sweating. The hallway felt distended and exposing; I periodically checked my progress behind me, only to regret it every time, knowing not what I would find when I turned back around. Each time I was only met with my closed door, though. The radio continued on, but I could hear something wavering under the heavy layer of static. A voice. It was a womans voice, angrily chanting out some indiscernible phonetics. The voice would undulate and occasionally take a sudden drop in pitch into a dark baritone only to level back out into a semi-human octave. I placed my hand on the cold metal knob. My arms trembled uncontrollably as I turned the handle inside one of my sweating palms, still clutching my freezing cat tightly with the other. The door swung smoothly on its hinges, and it hit the wall behind it with a deep thud. Then it saw me. It was on the wall, right in front of me, over my bed, hung like a painting. It had one limp hand draped, with boney, serpentine fingers, just above the clock, and its skeletal body cast an eerie glow into the dusty haze that had formed around it. I could feel Half-and-halfs muscles tense up in my arms. I took a pace forward, feeling a pearl of cold sweat slink down my brow. Its massive bulging eyes pinpointed directly onto me, tracing my movements, and its starchy white hair drifted lethargically across its decayed visage, that maybe at one time appeared human. From behind rows of cracked teeth, water pooled up and sluggishly dripped onto my bed from its maw, which now hung painfully agape and unnaturally crooked to one side. I silently passed closer to the radio, casting my face away from the translucent apparition. The womans chatter turned into furious shrieks, and I slapped the radio off of the nightstand, unplugging it in the fall. The figure did not move, only watched. I raggedly placed Half-and-half on the bed first, and then crawled over him to get in bed myself, where I trembled in silence, ignoring the coils of pain in my skull from the developing migraine. Even with the radio unplugged, I could still perceive the wails of a seething woman coming from an unidentifiable source. It was as quiet as a whisper in my ears. Pulling the covers up to the sides of my head, I tried to take a breath deeper than the tiny gasps I had been settling for up until that point. I could still sense the observers prying eyes transfixed on the back on my skull, see its dangling, pale digits over the night stand where my alarm clock had once been, and feel the steady dripping against my mattress. Stifled tears flowed down the contours of my face, and while I made certain to keep my eyes sealed tightly shut, I knew the observer continued to peer at me unceasingly. "
239,vulnerability,nosleep,Why My First Assignment as a Reporter Was My Last,76,58wulg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/58wulg/why_my_first_assignment_as_a_reporter_was_my_last/,2016-10-23 14:34:12,"It should have been the kind of career-making story that would launch my career out of the small town news market, something that seemed edgy and nearly satanic to the proudly out-of-touch folks around here, though the Discovery Channel had done a few melodramatic specials on it at least fifteen years ago. Instead, I have spent my life ever since desperately hoping that no one ever connects my name with what happened. I'd ended up back in my hometown after college, and I was pissed. I'd basically flipped the bird to everyone I'd ever known and every institution that had molded me in my first eighteen years, sure that I would find some faraway paradise where my genius would be recognized for what it was, that I'd blossom into the greatest journalist the world had ever seen. I was going to blow the lid off of everything. Through classes and clubs and internships, I spent four years telling everyone within earshot what a bunch of stupid backward hicks I'd managed to escape from, and they all agreed in the kindest possible terms that I certainly did not belong in a place like that. When my dad's death forced me to move back home just weeks after graduation, part of me wondered if it was karma. I couldn't shake the icy hollow feeling deep in my gut that the universe was punishing me for being so mean and uppity about the people I came from. Of course, I told everyone that it was simply an economic decision, that losing the sole breadwinner of the family left my mom, whose decades of work experience boiled down to ""keeps a tidy house and bakes a mean meatloaf,"" completely on her own with no way to live. While all of that was true, dad's company paid the family a hell of a lot of money to keep us from suing. And we'd have won any case too, they decided maintenance was too costly and his truck stalled on a railroad track. No open casket, I'll tell you that much. By the ripe old age of 24, I felt like a total failure. I had escaped and been pulled right back into the same house with the same posters from high school on the walls, the same mom who offered me PB&amp;J sandwiches with the crusts cut off, but no dad and nobody to keep things going. That wasn't supposed to have been my job, and you can bet that I resented it. I don't think you process mourning quite so much as you just get bored with it. Mourning my dad, mourning my life, mourning my future. For months, that was my whole life, there wasn't anything else I could even think to do. Then, it just got tiresome. I was sick of being sad and feeling sorry for myself, even if I had good reason to be. The local news station sat smack between my mom's house and the grocery store, I must have passed by it nearly every day of the week. One day, and I'm not sure why, call it a whim, I turned right instead of left, walked into the station, and asked the receptionist if they had any job openings. As it turned out, one of the reporters walking through the lobby recognized me from the coverage of my dad's funeral, which had been big news in the little community. He put his arm around me like we were good friends and took me right back into the news office to the manager who handled internships. Just like that, I'd managed to turn a trip into the grocery store into a job actually putting my degree to use. If you think that sounds exciting, you haven't been paying attention. Nothing happens around here, not even a scandal in the news channel staff that might have created some kind of upward mobility for me. After two years of schlepping camera equipment and sucking up to the insufferable anchors (who thought they were *real* hot shit), I never went to work without a couple of those mini plastic booze bottles in my gear bag. At first, I thought the local rumors about tattooed freaks were just from bored high school kids who'd been watching too many low-budget horror movies. Frankly, nobody that interesting would have any reason to be here, not even spooking the normal folks. But as I was driving home one dark night, I discovered that they were completely true. I nearly smashed into the disabled car on the shoulder, but my driving reflexes have been nearly superhuman since dad's accident. I pulled over and clicked on my hazards, then ran around to the trunk and fished out half a dozen reflective triangles. This section of road had no lights at all, and on cloudy nights like this, you could barely see your hand in front of your face. I nearly ran into the guy standing in front of the car before I saw him. ""Oh, thank you!"" he said, in a voice that told me he'd been on the verge of panic until I showed up. ""I don't really know much about cars, but the whole thing's just dead. The emergency lights won't even go on."" We surrounded the car with the safety triangles and used my phone to call AAA, and I suggested we keep warm in my car while we waited. Under the yellow plastic lights inside, I could finally see that this stranded driver did not fit the town's typical aesthetic. His face seemed to be equal parts shiny silver and smooth skin, with rings and chains and baubles decorating every surface from his hairline to his neck. Even his tongue flickered as it reflected the dim light, and he clicked the piercing against his teeth when I spoke, listening intently and staring at me like a friendly snake. Elaborate flourishes of tattoos peeked out from his collar and shirtsleeves, and I had no trouble imagining that his body was just as covered in ink as his face was in metal. He said his name was James, and that he lived right outside of town with a few other friends who shared similar interests in what he referred to as ""extreme body modification."" As he described it, the piercings and the tattoos weren't just about looking different and freaking kids out (though, he admitted somewhat sheepishly, that is one of the major benefits), but it was a kind of community bonding for them, a shared experience of pain and trust. Not my bag, but to each his own. James finally noticed my press pass dangling from the rear view mirror. ""You a reporter or something?"" ""Or something,"" I answered. ""Although, maybe I have a story now. Turns out that those kids really *weren't* on drugs, they really did see a gang of tattooed weirdos out in the woods!"" James grinned at me, his cheek jewelry jingling. ""I've got a way better story for you,"" he said. I wish I hadn't listened. I wish that when he waved goodbye from the passenger seat of the tow truck, that was the last I'd ever seen of James, the super-pierced driver stranded on the side of the road. But, of course, it wasn't. Instead, four days later, I found myself in a surprisingly large and well-kept cabin right outside of town, a beautiful property tucked into the hill above the pond we generously dubbed ""Thayer Lake."" As soon as the story had come out of my mouth, the station manager couldn't get me out the door fast enough, along with three camera operators and so much equipment that we had to bring two vans. I can't even tell you what the station was thinking when they bought all this stuff, I'm pretty sure that's still the only time it's ever been used. The outside loomed in dark wood, wide steps leading up to a wraparound porch that surrounded the whole house, revealing a breathtaking view of the lake, visible from inside through spectacular two-story windows that sparkled spotless in the afternoon sun. To be blunt, this flew in the face of the expectations I'd had for a house full of ""body mod enthusiasts."" Turned out that the house belonged to one of James's buddies, a guy with photorealistic puzzle pieces meticulously tattooed all over his head and neck. I couldn't tell you how many hours he must have sat under the buzzing gun for all that, but it was a hell of a lot more than I'd be interested in. His grandfather had left him the place, the crown jewel of the modest family estate, one last slap in the face to the judgmental conservative family who had shunned his less-than-traditional grandson. My crew got to work setting the place up for filming: snaking wire across the floor, screwing scaffolding for lights and mics into place, finding the best angles for the cameras. That last bit was the hard part; I still had no idea what exactly we were supposed to be filming. As I took in the foreign sights in the house, the torturous-looking tattoo needles and dark pots of pigment, long stainless steel cones and rods with a variety of piercings from big to small, the unreadable strangers who exuded auras of dangerous deviance and genuine friendliness at once, James emerged from a room back down a hallway, wrapped in a fluffy white bathrobe. His beaming smile pulled my eyes right to it, the only empty white space on his chaotic hardware-filled face. ""So where should we set up the cameras for the best view of...well, whatever it is we're watching you do?"" I asked, trying and failing to sound cool and unimpressed, like I saw this kind of thing all the time. It wasn't often that I felt like a dork in this town, and I didn't enjoy it. ""The main event,"" James said dramatically, with a devilish grin, ""will be right up there."" Looking straight up, I saw silvery chains dangling from the vaulted ceiling, glinting in the bright sun streaming through the massive windows. They hung from an elaborate-looking pulley system that appeared firmly affixed to the exposed rafters with bolts as thick as my wrist. I caught one of the camera crew watching us and gave him a quick nod, pointing up at the ceiling, and he got to work aiming our lenses upward. At this point, I realized James was still staring at me. I didn't want to admit that I was still completely baffled as to what he was talking about, so I saved face in the best possible way: I started the interview. It was actually going to work pretty well, I think, having local-girl-me and James-the-Freakshow on the portable cam, with all the preparations happening right there a few feet behind us, framed by the picturesque backdrop of Thayer Lake, ensuring for all our viewers that this kind of thing really did happen in our humble little town. Whatever ""this kind of thing"" was. After the few basic who-are-you and why-are-you-here questions, I asked James about what we would be witnessing here today. James stood, turned his back to me, and dropped his bathrobe. I have to admit, I gasped. So did the cameraman behind me. James's back was *covered* in what looked like enormous fishhooks, the skin around them bright pink and puckered, a few streaks of yellow-brown iodine left behind by what must have been a meticulous cleaning. There were ten of them hanging in four distinct rows from his shoulders down to his hips, where he wore his only article of clothing, a pair of skintight boxer briefs patterned in comic-book action bubbles (you know, like ""POW!"") He chuckled slightly at hearing our reactions, seeming to hold himself still as the hooks shivered in response to every little movement. ""Allow me to introduce Ms. Megan,"" he said, beckoning over a heavyset woman with royal purple hair and latex gloves on her hands. James explained that Ms. Megan was *the* expert on ""suspension,"" an extreme form of body modification where people literally hung from hooks pierced through their skin. ""What makes you want to do this?"" I asked, doing a better job than I'd expected at maintaining my professional reporter-voice, ""I imagine that you must feel very vulnerable, being in that helpless position."" ""I'm not helpless,"" James answered warmly, ""I have Ms. Megan taking care of me. Without her, I'd have never gotten into the body mod scene in the first place, and now I'm sitting here about to do the sickest suspension anyone's ever attempted. But like, it is about vulnerability, you know? It's about trust. I trust these guys, and I know I can trust you."" Thank the Lord for makeup, because I'm pretty sure my cheeks went bright red at that little thank-you from James for the way we'd met. Ms. Megan ushered us over to a massage table on the side of the room, where James casually lay on his belly with his face poking through the padded hole. The other body mod artists helped stabilize his limbs while Ms. Megan finished the last of the preparations. Concentrating with a furrowed brow and the tip of her tongue peeking out from the corner of her mouth, Ms. Megan deftly skewered James's arms and legs with more than a dozen new hooks, which she unwrapped individually from sterile medical supply bags. I watched in awe, wondering how I could have been unaware of this bizarre art form when it seemed so well-supported on every front. Usually, Ms. Megan explained to the room, suspension doesn't use the arms and legs, too much risk of tearing right through the skin and causing major damage. But she'd grown to know James's body over the years, and she thought his could support it. Finally, it was showtime. The crew turned on the blinding light panels, filling the center of the room with intense, unnaturally white light, throwing the corners of the spacious house into sudden shadow. James shuffled carefully toward the center of the room as Puzzle Tattoo guy pressed a switch on the wall, lowering the rigging down from the ceiling. The pulley system moved smooth as silk, not letting out so much as a squeak as it brought the heavy chains down. James lay himself flat on the hardwood floor while Ms. Megan and the other two body modders quickly slipped the chain links onto the hooks protruding from James's body. Ms. Megan double- and triple-checked everything before whispering into James's ear, receiving two big thumbs-up. Ms. Megan, the expert, would control the pulleys, ensuring that James's body would handle the stresses of speed and minor movements as he was hoisted up into the air by his skin. She began to apply pressure to the control on the wall, and the rigging started its eerily silent ascent back up to the ceiling. At first, James didn't move, the chains and straps still relaxed. They slowly straightened as they rose, then suddenly snapped taut as they pulled on James's body weight. His fingers and toes flexed in spontaneous reaction to what must have been a bizarre sensation, then relaxed as his experience took over. It was all I could do to keep my stomach from playing a rerun of breakfast. Even though I knew there was a camera on me, I chewed my thumb so hard I thought I'd draw blood. It all went wrong so fast. Even with Ms. Megan's cautious hand, it took only a few seconds until James was hanging a full fifteen feet off the ground. That's when one of the crewmen passed his limit, and spewed vomit like a geyser all over the back of one of the camera operators. It was purely an accident. He was just operating on reflex at that point, just like any of us would respond to a tidal wave of coworker puke down the back of our shirts. He wheeled around to see what the hell was going on. If only he'd let go of the camera first. The huge camera followed its captain, knocking right into a huge high-power lighting array. Sparks flew in a massive explosion as the high-voltage halogen toppled over and delivered a fatal surge of electricity directly to Ms. Megan's purple-topped head. For a moment, everyone forgot about James to focus on the clearly-dead Ms. Megan, whose dramatic locks had been burnt into nothing along with most of the top half of her head. I was frozen, my brain so surprised by the sudden turn of events that I couldn't even process the world around me. Like a camera flash, the bright-white explosion of the light had temporarily blinded me, but the smell and sound were so clear as to evoke the primal knowledge in me before I could see it. Fire. I could hear popping and crackling and electric arcing scattered all around the room, and the air filled with the odor of smoldering plastic. When my vision faded back in, I saw black soot around the outlets. The cameraman behind me let out a shriek and dropped his heavy equipment to the ground as it shot sparks all along the cord tracing back into the wall. Visible flames appeared along the ground, racing along all the cables leading to television equipment and tattoo guns and everyday appliances, licking at the baseboards and climbing effortlessly up the walls, consuming the glossy varnish that showcased the natural wood composing the impressive home. An agonized scream from James instantly took everyone's attention. His friends rolled aside the body of Ms. Megan and pawed frantically at the control panel. It was fried. The vomit-covered cameramen bolted out the back door, generously giving the fire an endless supply of oxygen. The room erupted in a massive fireball as the wave of fresh air rushed inside like a flaming tsunami, knocking everyone off their feet. Except James, of course. All of us were on fire. My cameraman wasn't moving. I didn't help him. I could feel the skin on my legs melting inside my polyester pants as I crawled across the floor toward the open back door. I made it out and threw myself over the side of the porch, smothering the flames in the mud on the ground. An enormous plume of thick black smoke was being pumped out from the massive house fire, the fire department would be there in no time. But it was too late. Even for James, who would burn alive dangling fifteen feet above his friend's living room. Laying injured on the cold ground, I saw it all through those spectacular picture windows."
240,vulnerability,nosleep,There's Not Enough Room,32,5b8no1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5b8no1/theres_not_enough_room/,2016-11-05 17:12:51,"A few weeks ago, we intercepted the first message. I'm an astronomer, at the Gold-stone Space Communications Complex, essentially a radio telescope. Working here for nearly 6 years and finding nothing too exciting, you could only imagine the mayhem which broke loose when something fired back at our deep space messages. When we received the message, I was still busy in my office, busy with my salty Panzanella salad and a cold Latte Macchiato, when Jules, the head of our team as well as my wife burst through the door grinning widely like an 8 year old who stole a bar of chocolate. ""Mike! Somethings happened! Come to the control centre now!"" and with that, she flew out the door again. Speechless, I set down my fork and moved towards the main control centre, my pace quickening as my curiosity of Jules ecstasy heightened. Picking my pace up to a jog, I noticed groups of workers converging on the control centre. As the sliding doors opened, two things hit me hard - the freezing air conditioned wind, and the flashing blue screen which illuminated the entire room. With the blast of air came the stench of sweat, sweat from the programmers working furiously at their stations, and the screen was the best part. Normally it was a black screen with small white dots, a map of the universe, today though there were strange letters popping up all over the main screen. Mind racing, heart pumping, I had no idea what to do. It took me moments of processing the reality together - we found... sentient... life... outside of Earth. Jules was striding up the aisle and flicked her wrist over to a group of scientists talking behind a line of decoders. I complied with her implied order, and bolted over to my team, casually sliding into the flurry of words. ""... Broken Fermi's Paradox and we can now rewrite Drake's equation! All we have to do is wait for this to finish!"" As the elated astronomer paused, one of the technicians yelled out, ""We got it! We have the message."" He sent the message on the screen and we all fell silent. The random characters on the screen morphed into the words, ""We... need.... more...... [untranslated characters].... This message was simply repeating itself over and over, unscrambling the language on the screen into the 3 words ""We need more"". ""The hell does that mean?"" Someone shattered the silence. And for the next 4 days, we spent hours on end checking for translation mistakes, message character interception mistakes, checking for any new messages, hell we were taking a shot at every possibility we could imagine. It was nearly 1 am, on the 4th day since the first message and most of the crew had either gone home or were asleep in the on-site housing. I was alone in the control centre when another message came through. At first I thought I was crazy. Then I thought the program had translated the message incorrectly. Logically I was going to call up the team, but when the message altered itself I froze. From ""Help us... We need more... Please...."" the message changed into, ""Let us in Mike, Let us in!"" My heart caught in my throat, and as the surge of adrenaline hit me, I dashed for the mainframe, ripping out the power plugs. It was from then on my life has changed. Trembling in the darkness for what felt like a full few minutes, my vulnerability was quickly replaced by embarrassment. If someone walked in on me, I would look like a total bloody idiot, and with that thought, I quickly shoved the plugs back in. A low hum rung out as the computer system spun back to life. A few minutes later, the messages reappeared as ""We need more... I let out a heavy sigh; I was probably far too tired to be working at this time, and I was definitely tired enough ignore the massive crack which had formed across the computer screen. Stretching back, I made my way out the door, towards the car park. Jules was probably already home, I couldn't believe that she would be able to stay up working so late. I live about 40 minutes drive away from the radio sites, and at this time of night, I was quite lucky that the road was entirely deserted save for a few late night travellers and the occasional police vehicle. I was about 10 minutes out from my house when I saw something in my mirror. I slammed the brakes, letting the seatbelt catch my body before I flew against the steering wheel. Leaping out of the car, I spun around to the backseat, reaching into my pocket for my flip knife (I had recently bought one due to the rise in crimes in my area). As I yanked open the door, I realised the car was empty.... but I could've sworn I saw something duck behind my seat when I looked into my rear mirror. Somewhat shaken, I clambered back into the drivers seat and sat there for a few minutes to collect myself. When I finally reached my house, I headed straight for a shower, past the bedroom. Peeking in, I saw Jules sleeping in the darkness, her phone set next to her. Entering the shower, I slapped on the shower knobs, letting the warm water flood over my eyes, down my chin and feeling the splashes pool at my feet. The only thing on my mind was my work, and to be honest, it had been the only thing on my mind for the past few days. As I considered sending out another message with my team, I suddenly realised the water was going cold. Frustrated by the interruption, I turned off the 'Cold' Tap, but the water stayed cold. Stepping aside from the stream of water, my frustration turned into puzzlement as I proceeded to turn off the water entirely, but when I grabbed metal 'Hot' Tap, a chill hovered straight through my chest. The metal, which was doused in a stream of steaming water moments ago, had turned ice cold within a few seconds of exposure to the cold water. It was then that I felt something watching me. I spun around multiple times and saw absolutely nothing but myself. Severely freaked out, I dried myself out and snatched a set of clothes closest to me, and checked that our bedroom was empty. Sitting down on my side of the bed, I suddenly realised the coldness had spread straight into our room. As my brain tried to piece together the strange occurrences, my wife's phone rang. She stirred next to me but said nothing. ""Hello, this is Mike from Gold-stone Radio Operations, how may -"" I was cut short by the caller who was absolutely furious. ""What the hell Mike, why did you leave me behind. How tired do you possibly be to leave me at work with no goddamn way of getting home? I swear...,"" my blood ran cold as I realised the caller was Jules. Dropping the phone onto the bed, I leaped off the bed, spinning around but there was no need to grab a weapon because the bed was empty. Scrambling for the phone, I was shaking so hard that I was struggling to hold the phone steady. ""....hello? Mike?"" ""Jules, I'm so sorry but I have no time to explain. I have to call the cops. Someone was in bed and I thought it was you. Uh... there should be fifty bucks in my second or third drawer in my office. Just grab it and take a taxi home or something. I'm so sorry honey, I love you."" And without waiting for a reply I disconnected the call. With trembling fingers, I dialled 911. When I put down the phone, I noticed the phone was heavily cracked on the backside, but I had much more serious issues to address than a broken phone. By the time Jules got home, a patrol car had shown up and two officers had already searched the building twice. She rushed through the front door, into the bedroom, demanding to know what the hell just happened. The officers assured us that the house and the neighbours houses were all safe, and that there had been no signs of forced entry. Nonetheless, I knew I was not crazy, so when I insisted on the presence of... something, the officers decided to spend the night outside the house in their patrol car. As restless as we were, Jules and I decided to get as much sleep as we could for work tomorrow. It must've been about 6am when I woke to a shrill screech. Jules had also woken, looking disorientated and completely confused. As I got up, I brushed Jule's phone onto the ground, and as it clattered loudly on the floor, the sound abruptly stopped. Swooping over to pick up the phone, I cautiously peeked into the empty hallway. With Jules following behind me, I walked into the bathroom to find all the glass shattered or scratched wildly. Something was wrong. The shattered mirror had two handprints indented into it. Something had followed me home. I backed out and bolted into the living room to find every glass object shredded. I dashed outside, ignoring the freezing wind tearing at my bare calves and immediately saw the glass from my neighbours windows shattered. I looked around and spotted the police car parked further down the road. Jogging towards it, I realised there was glass everywhere. It was on the road, on the side paths and in the bushes on the other side of the road. To my dismay the windscreen of the patrol car had disintegrated, the two officers were both slumped over the dashboard. Gently brushing off shards of glass off their backs, I laid them both back in their seats, and instinctively checked for a pulse. If only I had looked at their faces I would've realised they were already dead. Stepping back, I suddenly saw the blood oozing down their faces. It took me a second to register this but on their faces were letters carved through their skin. They read ""Thanks Mike, but we still need more room."" "
241,vulnerability,nosleep,I'm so sick of the media giving sororities a bad rap.,694,4zadep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4zadep/im_so_sick_of_the_media_giving_sororities_a_bad/,2016-08-24 12:47:51,"I never imagined Id be a sorority girl, but now I cant imagine life without my sisters. The media is constantly claiming that sororities are filled with classless girls who enjoy binge drinking, promiscuity, and gossiping, but my sorority is very different. I joined about a month ago and already its changed my life forever! To really show you how much of a blessing my sorority is to me, I have to start from the beginning. I grew up about an hour outside of Boston and spent most of my afternoons working on a horse farm. The smell of fresh cut hay, sweet grain, and earthy air has always been intoxicating to me. After graduating high school, I had no intention of joining some group of materialistic, self-absorbed, college bimbos. Like most girls, I left for college eager to experience a new way of life, but anxious that I wouldnt fit in. The adults in my life all said, College will be the best four years of your life! Yet even after my first few weeks of school, I was miserable. My roommate wasnt around much (she made her own group of friends and was out all the time) and our apartment was separate from the rest of campus, so I didnt get that freshmen dorm experience. I missed spending my days outside surrounded by trees and animals. The only time I'd pry myself out of bed was to go to class. I was desperate for friendship, but too anxiety-ridden to put myself out there. My roommate eventually must have noticed and taken pity on me because one night she invited me out with her to some party. I guess my hunger for social interaction finally outweighed my social anxiety. Ill regret going out that night for the rest of my life. My roommate and I took a couple of shots at our apartment beforehand. I probably should've stopped at two shots, but I didnt want my roommate to regret inviting me out. I kept up with her, shot for shot, until it was time to head out. I felt pretty confident at the time, actually. I checked myself out in the mirror one last time before leaving. I'm okay looking. Probably like an 8/10 if I had to rate myself on one of those sexist 1-10 scales. I have long blonde hair, blue eyes, freckles, and a pretty nice figure (though that freshman 15 was already quickly creeping!). Id spent lots of time on my makeup and felt ready to take on the night. Within ten minutes of getting to the party, my roommate took off with her group of friends and I was left awkwardly hunching over by the blaring speakers, downing a mixed drink in one hand and pretending to check my phone in the other. It was then that Greg Stone must have noticed my vulnerability. Even I, a socially inept nobody, had heard about Gregs good looks. He was a pretty popular guy around campus and I knew he had some mutual friends with my roommate. After a half hour of flirting and drinking, I was so excited when he invited me to his apartment down the street. He told me his roommate was gone for the weekend and wed have the place to ourselves. He poured me another drink when we got to his place, and thats the last I remember of that night. Im sure youve all read some sickening stories about college rape. I can tell you first hand that words will never do it justice. When I woke up the next morning on Gregs couch, he was gone. The vomit in my hair was still wet, and so was the blood between my legs. I barely noticed my pounding headache compared to the pulsing pain from down there. Ten minutes, after the shock wore off a bit, I was able to stand and make my way to the bathroom. I vomited some more while showering before finally looking in the mirror. The area around my collarbone was already a deep purple. My eyes were bloodshot. I stared deep into my own soul and in that moment I honestly just wanted to die. I went to let myself out of Gregs apartment and there was a post-it note stuck on the inside of the door that read, *I had a great time with you last night, -G.* I didnt tell anyone what happened that night. Growing up, Id always told myself that I would absolutely go running to the police and my family if anything like that ever happened to me. Absolutely. But when it actually happened, I couldnt. Something in the very core of my soul was just broken, I guess. I laid in bed for the next two weeks, not even leaving my apartment for class. One night when I got up to make myself my usual bowl of Lucky Charms for dinner, I noticed that someone had slipped a small white envelope under the front door with my name on it. I slid my finger underneath the flap, tearing it open. For a second I swear it smelled like sweet forest air. I gently pulled out a dark green notecard with metallic gold cursive handwriting. The front of the notecard read, *Our Sisterhood, good and free, Guarding you and me. Our bond is tried and true, As old as sky is blue. Bright women within dark night, Bring love, laughter, and light.* The back of the notecard listed a time and date (Tomorrow, 10pm) and address (basement classroom of an older building on our campus). It was signed Your soon-to-be sister, Louisa. Now I know I told you guys that I would never consider joining a sorority, but something stood out about this one. I finally felt like I could really become a part of something bigger than myself. I cant explain exactly what about that notecard compelled me to finally leave my apartment the next day, but it did. I had no idea what to wear to a sorority recruitment event, but I figured from the formal tone of the notecard that I should get a little dressed up. I put on a simple black knee length dress and some lipstick, and then hurried over to the building listed on the notecard. On my way over, my mind was restless. *What was I thinking? Im not a sorority girl. They probably had me confused with someone else when they slipped that envelope under my door. What if they haze me? Maybe I should go back to bed.* I was about to turn around and head home when a short brunette girl walked up from behind me, scaring the shit out of me at first since it was almost 10pm at the time. She introduced herself as Kimberly. We quickly realized we were both in the same situation. Kimberly had received the same notecard that I had. She seemed nice and we clicked right away. Kim didnt seem like your stereotypical sorority girl either so I felt less nervous about the whole thing. When Kim and I made it to the classroom in the basement just before 10pm, there were four other girls already there. The room was dim and draped floor to ceiling in white sheets. White candles lit a path from the door into the center of the room. For an old basement classroom, it smelled astonishingly fresh, as if I were actually standing in the middle of a forest. For the first time since the Greg incident, I felt safe. Before I had a chance to introduce myself to the other four girls, a womans voice called our attention. I hadnt noticed her before, standing in the back corner of the room. *Ladies, Im thrilled to have you all here tonight. Our sisterhood is the strongest of its kind and we have carefully chosen you six to uphold our legacy this semester. My name is Louisa, and I am the President of our special sisterhood. Tonight, we will laugh and we will cry. Tomorrow, I know you will find your happiness, as all of our previous sisters have before.* From another corner, a new voice spoke. I dont know how I hadnt noticed this woman before either. I guess the room must have been darker than I remember. *My name is Ellie. I serve as Vice President of Recruitment and I am SO excited to have found you all this year. Each of you possesses traits we hold dear to us in our sisterhood and Im confident that youll find everlasting love here with your new sisters. In order to get to know all of you even better, we're having a candle pass tonight. Candle passes are a tradition amongst our sisters and help strengthen our bonds of sisterhood. Each of you will have a chance to tell us your story. Reveal your secrets, share your aspirations, and seek comfort from your sisters. After the candle pass, we will initiate those who still desire to join our special sisterhood.* Ellie stepped out from the corner to guide us into place for the candle pass. She was tall and beautiful with short brown hair and oaken eyes that nearly sparked when the candlelight hit. Me, Kimberly, and the four other girls sat crisscross, facing each other on the floor in a tight circle. Once seated, the classroom door opened and a line of twenty-two women robed in dark green dresses began forming a circle of their own around us, however they remained standing. I figured green must be their sororitys national colors or something. Louisa and Ellie joined them. As Ellie instructed, one by one we passed the candle around our inner circle. The first of us to speak, Maura, spoke of how much she loved her dear mother and how much she hated her mothers murderer. Lauren, a cute slightly plump redhead, told us about the torment she endured from bullies in middle school and how it drove her to three suicide attempts. Each girl told her story, and as Louisa said we would, we laughed and we cried (okay, mostly cried). The girls in green standing around our circle remained still and silent. When the candle finally got to me, for the first time ever, I spoke about waking up in Greg Stones apartment. Afterwards, I didnt laugh, but I didnt cry either. I felt more connected to the strangers in this room then I had ever felt to anyone in my entire life. After the last of us had spoken, Ellie left the outer circle and took the candle from us in the middle. *As is tradition, if you desire to be a lifelong member of our sisterhood, you must give a small part of yourself to the sisterhood.* She then pulled a short golden blade from the pocket of her green dress and slit the palm of her hand. She let the blood drip onto the candle and then passed it to the woman to her left. One by one, each woman silently let drops of their blood flow onto the candle. The flame flickered, but never extinguished. Louisa was the last of the standing women to shed blood on the candle. As she bled, I could almost swear her eyes shone brighter than the flame itself. I know to some of you this might sound freaky or even frightening, but Im telling you this was the most comfortable and natural experience Ive been through. Louisa then walked the candle and blade to the inside of our little circle, handing it to Kimberly first. Without hesitation, Kimberly drew her own blood to add to the now blood-drenched candle. I was next. When I felt the golden handle of the blade in my hand, I felt empowered. I felt like anything and everything was possible. I pressed the blade against my palm and felt no pain. My blood pooled at the top of the candle and then overflowed, dripping down the sides and dancing with the blood of my sisters. Once all six of us had finished this sorority initiation tradition, Louisa checked her watch, and then looked back down at all of us. *It's now exactly midnight. I am so pleased to officially welcome these six incredible women into our chapter. Sisters, rejoice!* The next morning I woke up in my bed with a bandage around my palm. I felt like a new woman. I couldnt wait to start my day and meet up with Kimberly and a few other sorority sisters for lunch, like we'd planned the night before. I walked into the kitchen (for my usual Lucky Charms, of course), to find my roommate crying. *What happened?* I asked, concerned. *Greg Stone was found dead this morning,* she sniveled. The next day I read about it in the news. Rumors also travelled quickly across campus. Apparently, there was an anonymous 911 call made from Gregs apartment the night of his death, shorty after midnight. When police arrived, Gregs body was sprawled across his couch. He had been beaten and sodomized. The blood between his legs had yet to dry and his body was still warm to the touch. The apartment smelled strangely of fresh pine. The only evidence found at the scene was a dark green notecard with gold handwriting stuck to the inside of his front door that read, *I had a great time with you last night, -L.* Its now been a month since the Greg scandal. The exact cause of death has yet to be confirmed. Anyways, all I know is that my life has gotten miraculously better since finding my sisters. Im just a new member so I still have a lot to learn about how our sorority works, but I hope one day I can help other women in the same way my sisters have already helped me. I shared my story in hopes that you remember that not all sororities are bad like the media claims! Im so sick of them getting such a bad reputation. I highly encourage anyone looked for love, laughter, and light to consider going out for recruitment this fall."

Just a normal, bad, drug trip. There is no other explanation for it. For Joshs behavior, for Lucys and as for minePTSD, most likely, yes. It's because I need closure, I need answers, and I cant move on from that traumatic experience. There is no other explanation for it. For Joshs behaviour, for Lucys- must be a bad trip, has to be. 1st September 2016 I stood far away from him. I can see the smoke whirl upwards and caress his face- his face was frozen, seemed like it had turned into a statue. A statue with its mouth stretched wide open. They say the tongue is the longest organ in a human body. And if you say what I saw, youd understand what it truly meant. His tongue twisted outside of his mouth. It stretched to about a hands length. Through the smoke I couldn't see his eyes for a moment, but when I did, I could never unsee it. His pupils had expanded and from our distance it seemed like his entire eye ball was covered in a- a black substance(?). I could see the glint of his bulging eyes. I cant explain the strange stillness that was upon him, but only to describe it as catatonia. I knew from my studies that catatonia was a negative symptom of schizophrenia. I heard of this before. The effects of drugs, or psychedelics or whatever it is he consumed. They say consuming drugs increases the chance of developing schizophrenia. Or maybe he had dormant schizophrenia- runs in his family, and drugs initiated the genetic vulnerability into an actuality. Except he wasnt truly catatonic, when I finally moved back to address Lucy, although he was staring straight ahead, I sensed he was watching us. I'm leaving. I whispered to Lucy. She didn't say anything. Her eyes were fixed on Joshua. I turned around and reached for the doorknob; it wouldn't turn. Its stuck. I tried jangling the doorknob, Lucy wheres the key. No response. Lucy, I pushed my weight against the door, where is the fucking- Ooff The front of my body slammed into the door. Air whooshed out of my lungs. I couldnt breathe! Cold fingers gripped the back of my neck. And equally cold metal pressed into my cheek. Shut the fuckup she hissed. Or Ill cut your tongue. I nodded dumbly into the door. After a heartbeats stretch she released me and I collapsed, gasping for breath. I could feel a trickle of warmth down my cheek. I touched it and saw the result on my trembling hand: blood. She was serious. Ive never seen Lucy like this. Never. I stared at the back of her head in shock. She was still watching Joshua. I looked past Lucy and every metabolic function inside me jolted to a halt. Joshua was grinning at me. Fear rose like a wave and slammed against the confines of my heart. Everything turned woozy. I saw Joshua leaping forward and then- nothing. When I opened my eyes it was dark and I was flat on the floor. Terror gripped me anew. I scanned the darkness expecting to find the dark shapes of their bodies. Nobody. I sprang on my feet and ran to the door. Turning the doorknob, my heart lurched  it was stuck! No please! I pushed the door. It wasnt opening. The back of my neck prickled but I didnt look back. Once more I shoved my shoulder into the door. Stuck. I began to break out in a cold sweat. No escape, theres no escape. I gave a large cry and slammed my entire body against the door. It opened out. I scrambled outside and ran. It was only until I was in the safety of my bedroom that I became aware of a burning sensation on my stomach. Something was gouged in my skin. There was so much blood I couldnt make out the words. That night and subsequent nights I couldnt sleep. In my dreams I see Lucy and Joshua torturing me, dragging a knife across my skin to make newer scars. And always- always Josh's eyes, gleaming like a spider's, watching from afar. My parents dont understand why I wake up screaming at night. Nor why I refuse to leave my room. I cannot tell them; I cannot speak a work. Its been a month since the incident, and this is the first time Ive written about it, or thought about it. I heard my parents discussing amongst themselves: missing teenagers same age Its them, I know its them. What I dont know why I get the same dream: the one where I die every night after Lucy cuts into my skin. I want to know what happened to Lucy and Josh that night. Theyd taken that drug before, but theyve never behaved like that. And I want to know where they are. I feel as if everything is tied to this- the faded remains of the cuts: [markings](URL Please help me. Ill even try to find Joshs journal entries. He should have written about his experience with the drug. Maybe with that you can identify it. I know where he lives and I knowI know he wont be at home. Im sorry I dont even know the name of the drug. But this is the first time Im doing something about it, even if it is something as passive as this. -Evelyn "
243,vulnerability,nosleep,Serafine [part 4],75,52s317,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/52s317/serafine_part_4/,2016-09-15 04:57:35,"[part 1](URL [part 2](URL [part 3](URL Hey all! My guts are feeling better than ever, just in time to clench in fear. So we went to see my boyfriends old classmate. Ill call her Zara. We met her right after she got off work, she was still in nurses scrubs when she came into the coffee shop. She did not seem at all unhappy to see us, she was really polite and just lovely. Zara listened as I spilled my guts over what had been happening, telling her that I was frightened and any help she could give us would be life-saving. Zara sipped her tea as she thought for a moment. She spoke in this really slow, measured tone like shed been thinking of what to say for a really long time. Serafine and Zara were both from the Malay ethnic group. Zaras family was Muslim. Serafines family claimed to be Muslim as well, but had kept a lot of the old ways because they were wealthy and no one could tell them what to do. Zaras family had come from the same area, but had emigrated much later so Zara had an accent(which I loved, btw) and that was one of the things Serafine had used to make fun of her. Serafine took great pleasure in isolating and bullying Zara throughout high school. Serafine found out Zara knew about her family and probably felt threatened by that. You see, Serafines family werent black sheep. They were witches. Zara said it probably sounded funny to us. We werent laughing. Serafines branch of the family were notorious back in their home. Serafines grandfather had done something unspeakable to a political rival, something that forced them to leave the country. Zara said after they left, the political rivals family became ill with a wasting sickness. Serafine was born in the US to an English mother, but her veins still carried tainted blood. The family had done some really bad black magic in their hometown. They would pester their neighbors with monsters and demons, striking their livestock blind if they werent given gifts. One out of three children died in the cradle because of this family. I asked whether Serafine was a Penanggalan. Zara said yes and no. A Penanggalan is usually a midwife who has broken a pact with an evil spirit. However, the nature of Serafines family meant that she had probably inherited her powers from her tainted blood. She was doing the whole head/intestines dance, because the vinegar my boyfriend smelled on her was used as an aid to help her squeeze back into her body after attacking me. However, the rest of her M.O. doesnt exactly fit the bill. Serafines motivation is not just to feed, but to have power. She had always enjoyed cultivating a circle of men to her whims, allowing them to form relationships only to drive the women away. Zara said the nature of Penanggals meant she probably couldnt even enjoy sex, and so had to feed off attention. She had bewitched the men in her circle of friends to act as her puppets. I asked what we could do. She had clearly shown she was ready to kill with Robs actions, only one of us was coming out of this alive. Zara thought for a long time. She said planting spiky things to all the entrances of our home was a start, but a really nasty Penanggalan could ooze up through the floorboards. We had to get some help. Her uncle was a shaman(her family kept some old ways too.) He lived a few hours away, but he would drop everything to come down for shaman business. If we could stay safe until then, he could help us. Zara asked: was there anyone in our home who was pregnant or had some other vulnerability? My boyfriend got grim. Megan had diabetes, he said, would that count? I hadnt known. My boyfriend said she was shy about it because Pete gave her shit when she asked him to help do her daily poke. He only knew because Pete brought it up during a get-together and Serafine laughed at it. Zara was very serious and said that if she had to draw blood regularly, she might be in danger. A Penanggalan was drawn to blood first and foremost. .We were advised to go home and barricade ourselves in. Anything spiky, throw it on the ground. She would call her uncle right that minute and request he came down. When we parted, she gave me a hug and said shed pray for me. I told her she was really cool for doing this and wished we had met under better circumstances. And thats where it stands. Were at Megans, with all the doors and windows latched. There are holly bushes about a block down from the apartment, we stripped them bare. My boyfriend also got carpet tack strips and put them on every windowsill. Zara called and said her uncle is on the way. If all goes well and he gets here, Ill update in a few hours. EDIT: it's been hours. he's not here yet. I'm worried. [part 5](URL"
244,vulnerability,nosleep,HE SHOULD HAVE HAD HIS OWN SAFE WORD,696,53peou,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/53peou/he_should_have_had_his_own_safe_word/,2016-09-21 06:21:56,"Purpose is the only real currency we have in this fucked up world. Everything else is boil in the bag bullshit. True freedom is knowing what you were put on this earth to do, otherwise, youre just another puppet being led by the strings. This is the story of how I discovered what my purpose is. I spent the early part of my life raised by my Mother. While she was far from perfect, she always tried her best to make sure I had whatever I needed, even if that meant that she had to go without. If my Mother had one detrimental flaw, It was her frequent entanglements with various men. Even at such a young age, I found myself withdrawn from a continuously revolving door of boyfriends, knowing that for every one that left, there would soon be another to take his place. Things continued in this fashion until I was eight, thats when my Mother met Jerry. Jerry was a regular at the place my Mother bartended at. She would always come home at night and tell me stories about how nice he was, and the huge tips he would leave her. Unlike the majority of guys captivated by my mother, Jerry had a lot of money. It wasn't that long after they met, that Jerry popped the question, of course, Moms answer was yes. She wasn't stupid, she knew that a man with Jerrys financial stability was a rare catch in comparison to the previous suitors that came before him. We moved into Jerrys lavish, five bedroom house in the suburbs. I wish I could tell you that things worked out, and we all lived happily ever after, but life isn't a fairytale. Life with Jerry started simple enough. He was always surprising us with expensive vacations, and fancy restaurants. He did any, and everything he could do to appear like a saint to my Mother. While she bought everything hook, line, and sinker, even in those early days, there was something about Jerry that never sat right with me. My intuition was validated once the touching started. Jerry began to rub against me in ways that made me feel uncomfortable, and I would catch his fingers as they lingered on my skin in ways they shouldn't have. When he wasn't touching me, I could almost guarantee that he was somewhere within viewing range, those rat-like slits he called eyes, always fixated on me like a piece of meat. There would even be times when Id wake up in the middle of the night, only to see him peeking through the crack of my bedroom door. As much as I wanted to say something, there was this part of me that didn't want to rock the boat. Mom finally seemed happy, and Jerry hadn't really done anything up until that point. Who was I to take Joy from the one person who would never have taken mine? Exactly one year after we officially found ourselves settled in, my Mother found something else... That something else was terminal breast cancer. I had to watch helplessly over time, as the once youthful woman that I had come to know and love since birth, withered into a lifeless husk. We buried her that winter. I remember the fresh snowflakes falling as they lowered her coffin into the cold earth. Jerry took sole custody of me after my Mothers untimely death, and just as I watched her waste away into a person I no longer recognized, I saw the facade of Good Jerry fade into a distant memory. Since It was only the two of us moving forward, he saw no reason to cling to phony appearances. He no longer watched me through the crack of the door at night. Instead, his nightly visits began to take on a more physically demanding role. He came in my room so often, that I developed a weekly schedule in my head that allowed me to memorize which nights hed appear out of the shadows, and which nights he decided to let me sleep. The sexual abuse would continue until the time came that he grew tired of using me in that way. The day that he stopped molesting me was the day he started using me as a human punching bag. First came the slaps, then the belt, and finally his fists. Jerry made sure that my school attire consisted of pants and long sleeved shirts. Anything to hide the damage that he inflicted daily on my frail body. I can recall envying the other girls at school for being able to wear dresses. My secret would only stay hidden for so long. Like they say, everything always comes out in the wash. When I passed out in class one day from internal bleeding, I didn't take the teachers long to put two and two together. The police would arrest Jerry. One-half of their reasoning had to with the plethora of discolored patches covering my hidden body parts. The other half was due to the library of unmarked VHS cassettes that the officers found when they got the go-ahead to search the house. Dozens of home movies, and I had a starring role in each one. Before I could get tossed into the pit of foster care, an old woman would come forward, claiming to be my long, lost Grandmother. Once the claims became validated with the proper evidence, I suddenly found myself on my way to make a new life with a complete stranger. I came to learn that my mother was a rebellious teenager who fell in love and ran away with my biological father. It was a long while before she delicately brought up the Horrific events that transpired while I was under the so-called care of Jerry. She never made me talk about anything I didn't want to, she just let me talk at my own pace. It wasn't the typical adult to child go around of where did they touch you?"", that I had heard so many times prior. No, Nanna treated me like an adult, and Ill always love the old woman for that. There was this one night before bed, Nanna told me a story, but this one was different than the others she had gently spoken on those nights prior. There was no book, only what she recalled from memory. The story was one she learned as a little girl from her mother, and so on, and so fourth. She only told the story once, but I remember It word for word. Long, long ago, Little Anna was lost. The forest was wide and covered with frost. Her path would soon cross with a creature of splendor, the beast looked at Anna, his eyes glowed like ember. Im pursued by a man, the monster would say, hes killed all my kind, It is I that hed now slay. Come hide in my locket, Young Anna replied, the hunter won't see you, and you shall not die. The Monster would hide in the locket by choice. When the hunter was gone, he then would rejoice. Thank you dear girl, the Monster would grin, I am here in your debt, from now till the end. There he remained, in the depths of the charm, to frighten all those who would do Anna harm. As I laid there, under the covers, my imagination still conjuring elaborate visuals, Nanna leaned down and whispered that It wasn't a story, It was all true. Anna wasn't some fairy tale protagonist, she was my great, great, great, Grandmother, or so I was told. I remember my eyes growing twice their normal size at this revelation. If It was all real, what happened to Annas locket, I asked Nanna curiously. Open your hand and see for yourself, Nanna responded. In that moment I could suddenly feel the pressure of cold metal pushing against my skin. I pulled my closed right hand from under the covers and opened It... There It sat in my palm like magic, comfortable and familiar like It had always been there. My face lit up, as did Nannas from being in my proximity. The small brass locket was the product of multiple decades worth of exposure to the elements, and there was a small dent in the lower right corner. Attached to the faded trinket, was a thin gold chain that looked relatively new. Nanna took the locket from my hand, pulling apart the tangled chain before she placed It around my neck. This Locket has been in our family for generations, Nanna proclaimed. My Mother gave It to me, and I was supposed to give It to your mother until... Her voice suddenly trailed off into a painful expression. Digging up memories of her deceased daughter was something that I watched Nanna struggle with from time to time, yet there was something different about the look I witnessed while gazing up from my bed. Crushing regret appeared as a companion to the Maternal hurt she had gotten used to. Now It belongs to you my dear, she said while fighting off visible tears. I held the locket up to the low light, focusing on every inch that I missed during my first inspection. Is there really a monster inside Nanna?, I whispered as if someone could have overheard my question. Oh, yes sweet pea. In all the years to follow, the Monster kept his vow and never left the inside of that tiny little locket, she said, All things in this world have their place to go and a job to do. How can the Monster have a job if hes stuck in the locket, I questioned with the perfect tone of a Genuinely confused child. His job is to protect you, just like he promised to protect Anna all those years ago in the forest, Nanna said, her expression morphing before my eyes from jovial to utter seriousness. Listen to my words very carefully child, only open the locket when youre around those who would want to hurt you, she said. The thought hit my mind, and I suddenly held my head down as the words came out of my trembling mouth. Like Jerry?, I said, my voice breaking with ever other letter that I forced out of my mouth. In the most loving way imaginable, Nanna put her hand under my chin and lifted my head up so that we were back to making eye contact with each other. Exactly like Jerry, she said with a coldness that caused a chill to run down my spine. After that I never took the locket off or opened It, and To be honest, I didn't think about It that much. Nanna enrolled me in a new school, that I Took to like a fish to water. I made straight As all the way up through high school. With that kind of Academic pedigree, I got a scholarship to a great college. Even with the campus three hundred miles away from Nanna, I still found the time to drive down every weekend and visit her. I would always hear my classmates complaining about having to go back home for any and all reasons, especially holiday breaks. Me, I couldn't wait to go back home, because for the first time In my life, I really had one. I never took the time that Nanna and I shared for granted, so when her time finally came, I found myself with no regrets. As opposed to viewing the days leading up to her death as a countdown to the end, I saw them more as a subtle reminder that the season was about to change. I wasn't sad or upset, It was just another part of the journey... Her Journey. Not long after that chapter in my life, I moved to the big city for the kind of job offer that only appears once every blue moon. Life on my own wasn't without its hiccups, but I managed to find my stride like so many others before me. For the first year, I didn't have the slightest inkling of a social life. All I did was work and go home seven days a week, until some girls that I worked with, practically forced me to go bar hopping with the one night. I didn't really drink, and I tend to have an aversion to loud places where even louder went come so that they could congregate intoxicated. While sitting at the far end of the bar to myself, I looked up, and our eyes connected for a split second. He had managed to isolate himself from the chaos as well, and he seemed to be enjoying his self-induced exile from the rest of the mingling flock . Six foot tall, lanky yet sturdy frame, and the scruffy yet stylish beard that only twenty-something males are good at replicating. Rounding out his look was a pair of large, yet trendy glasses. He was somewhat of a hipster but I liked It. Our eyes awkwardly continued to play connect the dots before an annoyingly attractive blonde sporting a pair of perky double ds abruptly ruined our moment, sitting down next to While she flirtatiously talked his ear off. I was sure that I had missed my chance until he got up from where he was sitting, to the obvious dismay of Becky Big tits. My heart started pounding as I watched my mystery man move around the oval shaped watering hole, only to end his short journey as he sat down on the stool next to mine. He introduced himself in a breezy way that made me swoon on the spot. His name was Parker, and in the nights following our meet-cute, I found myself addicted to all things him, and I think he could tell that about me right away. Our work schedules were as demanding as they were noncooperative. We fooled around quite a bit, but sex wasn't a factor until a couple of months after we had started dating. We both planned the nightly event like It was a military operation. I suggested things take place at my Apartment, but he insisted that It happen at his place. Parkers gung-ho attitude about hosting the venue wasn't something that I thought too much about. In all the time that we had been seeing each other, I only saw brief glimpses of his townhouses interior. This quick introduction happening on a night when I picked him up for a date, only to realize that my bladder was about to explode due to me forgetting to go before I left my own toilet seat in the dust. That night Parker ordered Thai, and we raced our way through mounds of noodles to skip to the happy ending. We started going at It in the kitchen like crazy people. We did the horny tango until we were against the wall in his living room Wheres the bedroom, I finally made myself ask while in a make out induced stupor. Ive got a better Idea, he said as a devilish grin formed on his face. He proceeded to lead me up the staircase, into a room that in no way, shape, or form was his bedroom. The spare space had been reshaped into something entirely different. The room was a shrine to all things bondage and S&amp;M. Dozens of racks covered entire sections of the rooms blue wallpaper, each of them showcasing an endless array of whips, paddles, chains, and leather. The few parts of the walls that weren't dedicated to displaying Parkers kinky arsenal were home to a large series of framed, black and white photos showing various women, their nude bodies fitted with collars and chains, one was even being walked on a leash like a submissive dog. I found myself slightly thrown off by the idea that a guy as docile, and Vanilla, was the mastermind behind the workshop of perversion that stretched ahead of me. Parker took hold of me as we moved deeper into the bondage room. He explained in detail, the inner workings of this secret lifestyle that he had found a kinship with. I dont doubt that If It had been you that he confessed his passions in such an earnestly, articulated way, you probably would have humored him also. As Parker started to undress me, I explained in the same detail as he just did that his particular tastes weren't the type that Id ever been comfortable with, while at the same time emphasizing that I held no judgment in regards to his sexual hobby. After pleading my case, I tried to maneuver the conversation towards the bedroom, hoping that we would be able to end the night with normal Boyfriend/Girlfriend sex. Nothing I said sunk In, and like the broken record of a child not getting his way, I finally caved to his demands. He constantly assured me that everything would be safe while I allowed him to eagerly reconfigure what I was wearing, into something that fit the theme. I Felt fingers at the base of my neck, fidgeting, messing with the clasp on my lockets chain, until It came off with no more protest. It was the first time in over a decade that the locket wasn't around my neck... It was the first time in over a decade that I felt truly vulnerable. Parker placed the locket on a shelf, just beyond my release. We agreed on a safe word... A word that became obsolete once the final piece of his puzzle was added without my knowledge or consent. The device that I couldn't put a name to was similar in function to a ball gag, only twice as intricate in its design. The next three minutes felt like hours. Right away, I wasn't comfortable with how rough he was with me all of a sudden. It was like he had no intention of honoring any of the previously agreed conditions that lured me into a false sense of security. I tapped on his leg, raised my arm in the air, and even tried to scream the safe word through the restricting mouthpiece. As everything was happening, I took notice of a blu tooth speaker system that was connected to an iPod in the corner of the room. At some point, Parker remotely switched on the device, and a loud wave of angry sounding rock music ensnared my eardrums, as Parker ensnared my body. I bucked, and struggled to no resolve, aside from the ropes that were actively keeping me stationary, Parker was displaying a terrifying amount of strength that he had somehow managed to keep hidden during the many casual interactions that we had since the start of our new relationship. Physically defeated, I utilized the only other option that I had by screaming as loud as humanly possible through the gag. Obviously aware of the sounds I was making, Parker turned the music up even louder, the music serving as the disturbing soundtrack for the violent event that was taking place. Everything kept going until I heard the music suddenly click off, followed by the immediate relief I felt when Parkers weight fizzled away into a body-wide tingle once he got off of me, having accomplished what he set out to do. For a few seconds, he just stood there, looking down at me with a look that almost conveyed sympathy and regret. Even though he finally stopped, my brain stayed in a manic state of panic. A million scenarios played out before my eyes, Dark, horrible things... There wasn't a single hypothetical that showed the odds in my favor, just like there wasn't a single scenario that involved Parker letting me go, especially not after what he did. After what looked like a deep, internal meditation in regards to his actions, Parker did exactly as he had done in that bar the first night we met. Once again, Parker managed to defy expectations by setting me free, If that didn't put me in a state of instantaneous shell shock, the fact that he asked me If I was OK did. I didn't give him an answer, instead, I gathered my bundle of discarded clothes and ran out of that place as fast as my shaking legs could carry me. I exited Parkers front door and found myself smack dab at the corner of a busy city street. Cars slowed down, people stopped frozen in their tracks due to my sudden, and unannounced appearance. I was publicly naked in the middle of a busy city, that was the last thing on my mind. My first and only priority were to put as much distance between me and Parker as I could. My freedom could have been a spur of the moment decision that he now regretted. My sprint led me to a vacant alley, where I desperately caught my breath and dressed in the wrinkled pile I had been clutching for a number of city blocks. Thoughts of the locket slammed into me like a hail of bullets that left me bleeding with the cold realization that I would have to leave It behind. Once I made It home, my hand rested in the same idle position over my phone for the rest of the night. I wanted to call the police, then Id watch a mental replay of everything that happened and lose confidence in the choice. I thought back to how I agreed to let him physically restrain me while every logical cell in by body screamed in unison for me to just tell him no. It didn't take long for me to collapse into a sobbing heap. The breakdown dovetailed into asphyxiating bursts of self-doubt. It was a perfect storm of negative emotions, all of the toxic feelings forcing me to think about my childhood, to think about Jerry, how as a little girl I was utterly helpless to what was being forced on me. How was It possible that as an adult woman, I found myself in the same exact situation. Then there was the immutable part of me that couldn't help but wonder If Parker had done what he did to me to other girls. Were they forced against their will or did they willing submit to his domination. It could have been all of the above, and none of the above. Then that really fucked up part of my psyche showed up to put its own two cents in by causing me to humor the most horrific hypothesis of them all. What If, at the end of the day, all my internally theories and deductive work boiled down to one simple truth, a possibility that Id spent my life running from. What If there weren't any others, Parker just got a nice whiff of something broken and vulnerable that night at the bar. What If there was just this signal that I put out to men that says to take advantage, take what you want, feel free to make her squeal like a little-battered piggy... Before I knew It the sun had come up, and thats when I finally laid my head down. I called out of work that morning. Nobody even questioned why, a perk when you have a flawless attendance record. While that may have been my first call out, It sure as hell wasn't going to be my last. In the moments leading to sleep, I noticed a distinct tingle moving through my chest, a fleeting flame among an entire body pulsating with pain. When you suddenly pass out from exhaustion, you discover how many things you once thought were important quickly develop the monetary value of dog shit. My call out vacation soon extended past the point of job salvageability. A sentiment that my boss took It upon himself to convey. We love you Grace, but five days, no call, no show. Anyone else would have been gone days ago. I thought Id call personally to let you know that as much as I hate to do It, I gotta let you go. I erased the voicemail and my head hit the pillow while I did a quick mental tally of my available finances. The bank app on my phone alerted me to the fact that I just over ten grand in savings. It was enough to keep the bills paid until I decided to rejoin society or commit suicide, Those were two options, light years beyond my reach because both choices required me to get out of the bed. A week and a half of not eating, showering, or existing, I received another phone call only to let It go straight to voicemail, leaving me to take me time in deciding if the message warranted listening to. Minutes had passed since the ringing stopped, thats when I halfheartedly put the phone to my ear and listened to the new message. What I heard next caused me to sit straight up, as If someone stabbed me in the heart with pure adrenaline. Hey, I dont even know If I should be calling like this, but I cant stop thinking about what happened with us. There aren't any words for how wrong I was, and I understand If you never speak to me again... Just know that I still care about you and. Parkers voice lingered for a little while like he couldn't think of the word he wanted to say before the voicemail inevitably ended... I could tell you that hearing his voice made me angry, Which It did for a while. But every time that message repeated, every time I pushed play, I kept picturing Parker, not as he was when he hurt me, but as the charming, attractive man that I had always found so mesmerizing. Thats when I heard It. TICK, TICK, TICK At first, I couldn't understand where the sound was coming from, until the pattern repeated itself, louder than before. TICK, TICK, TICK The sound was coming from the top drawer in my dresser. Not a mechanical tick, more like the noise that would come from a nail tapping against metal. I forced myself out of bed and made my way towards the rhythmic ticking. After a deep, careful breath, I pulled the drawer open. Sitting neatly inside, on top of a folded pair of panties was the locket as If it had always been there. It was in that moment that I knew exactly what needed to happen. That evening, like clockwork, Parker showed up at my front door step wearing a suit as he held a bottle of wine and a dozen roses. The display was fancier than anything Id seen him put together in the past. It was blatantly obvious that he was trying to put his best foot forward to win me back. I made a quick dinner, and copious glasses of wine accompanied the meal, the majority of the alcoholic consumption being on Parkers end. Once he was good and drunk, I led him into the bedroom, Parker excitedly obliged. He sat down at the foot of my bed and gestured for my company. Never moving, I just stood there in the doorway. I Promise It won't be like last time, Parker said with a horny smirk growing on his face. I know it won't, I replied as my fingers made their way to the side of the locket. A single tear rolled down the side of my cheek as my fingers made their way around the locket. Back on the bed, Parker looked on in confusion. The locket popped open with a rusty click, then.... Nothing happened. Are we going to do this or not?, Parker snapped from across the room. He was beginning to show his true colors again, the same way he did when he had me tied up in his torture room. Before I could begin to form a response, my attention was directed to the lamp on my nightstand, as it began to flicker rapidly. This flicker would soon spread to every other light source like an electronic virus. It would continue until the momentary event reached Its crescendo, all of the lights light bulbs exploded in unison, plunging the room into darkness. What the fuck?, would be the last thing that Id ever hear Parker say. The hair stood up on the back of my neck, as I felt an uncontrollable tingling that ran down from my shoulders and into my chest. As soon as the fleeting sensation faded, red, crackling energy would expel from the open locket. This unstable blast connected with the bedroom floor, and I braced myself expecting the targeted point to burst into flames. But while the room was bathed in a fiery red glow, there were no flames. Parker and I remained speechless, both watching as the crimson vortex formed. Two massive hands emerged from whirlpool. They were twice the size of an adult male. Each of the skeletal fingers ended with razor pointed nails that resembled an arsenal of miniature daggers, sharpened with expert precision. My shock became awe as It pulled its entire body from the epicenter of the vortex. The Monster straightened Its back, easily standing over seven feet tall. It had a warriors physique consisting on an intricate network of muscles and veins, that expanded and contracted with every earth-shaking breath It took. Its gray skin seemed rough and uneven like worn down leather. The only section of Its colossal structure that wasn't covered in the dark color, was a set of ivory horns that extended from Its forehead, the sharp ends curling backward. Parker managed to overcome his paralyzing fear long enough to stand, even though his legs gave the clear indication that they could buckle at any second. The Monster took four intimidating steps towards him. Before Parker could make even the slightest of movements, the Monster grabbed him by the throat. I could see a newly formed patch of moisture expanding from the crouch of Parkers jeans as he was lifted off the floor. It held Parker in that single position without the smallest hint of physical exertion. The Monster then ripped both of Parkers legs off one by one. With the almost relaxed level of effort that It took to carry out such a shocking series of mutilations, the Monster might as well have been dismembering a plastic toy. The Monster let go of Parker and he fell to the floor, his body shaking as he turned back to survey what was now left of his legs. All that remained in the wake of the sudden mauling were two bloody stumps that still had dangling ribbons of flesh hanging off of each one. Something inside of Parker him had snapped, immediately giving him the appearance of an apathetic rag-doll. His eyes glassed over as he tilted his head upwards and utilized the final option his body instinctually pushed on him. He didn't beg, He made no effort to bargain with his hulking attacker... He just started screaming. He screamed with no reservations, with nothing held back. The sounds made the hair on the back of my neck stand at attention. The Monster leaned down and hovered over Parker for a moment. The two just stared at each other until the Monster prematurely ended the stare off by plunging two sharp fingers into Parkers throat, banishing the broken man into the realm of immediate silence. Parker grabbed at his punctured throat. He gurgled as his hands were stained by the seeping neck wound. A razor sharp bed of overlaid teeth became visible as the Monster then opened its mouth. Its jaw unhinged downwards in an unnatural motion, stopping at the length of a shoebox. What happened next was like something from the darkest corners of the most horrific nightmare. The knot in the pit of my stomach twisted even tighter as the Monster hunched over and took It upon himself to eat Parkers discarded legs. The air was filled with the echoes of wet flesh, consumed flesh along with the dull notes of crunched bone. Parker Began to stir on the floor until he managed to gather enough internal fortitude to lift his head up towards the Monster who was busy tending to his own concerns. A look of absolute terror found Its way onto Parker as he watched in tears while his legs were being repurposed into nourishment. After crying to himself for a bit, Parker turned in my direction and headed for the door that I was standing next to. He put as much effort into dragging himself as he could. One hand cupping his throat while he used the other hand to pull his own body weight... A Weight that was beginning to rapidly decline due to massive blood loss. The carpet scraped against his gushing stumps, this caused nearly every moment he made to end in crippling pain. Before Parker could get halfway across the floor, his progression was halted by two large, hands. The Monster had made quick work of the two legs and was now ready for the main course. Parker struggled as the Monster pulled him backward. Suddenly the Monsters mouth expanded yet again, only, this time, It grew wide enough to accommodate the bottom half of a human being. Parker put up a fight but he might as well have been swatting at the wind. The Monster clamped down on the bloody stumps, this sent Parker into a frenzy of expressions and physical responses. He eventually just gave up and laid on the floor, the fight having been burned out of him. Parkers sides squished together. His entire body began to resemble a human sized juice box. The Monster was consuming Parker inch by inch. As I watched him there in that state of suspended animation, I was surprised to discover that my fear was reforming into another overwhelming emotion... Happiness. I was so wrapped up in the gruesome events that were taking place, that I had ignored such a dramatic shift in my own emotional spectrum. Within the halting span of seconds, we shared a fleeting connection. His eyes hid nothing from me, he was an open book, and I had the privilege to flip through the pages of his tortured soul at my pleasure. With just a few glances and a couple of weakened facial expressions, Parker said things that would have taken minutes to convey through speech. Nothing needed to be studied or deciphered. Everything was so abundantly clear, I might as well have heard his voice echoing through the depths of my mind. He wondered why I hadn't tried to help him during the entirety of his ordeal. He wondered why I had just stood there watching... He glanced at me again, putting everything else that he had into fighting off the shock induced fog that was poised to take him at any given time. The look he gave reeked of fear, desperation, and vulnerability.... He wanted a reaction out of me, something, anything.... One last emotional connection to ease him into passing. I forced a look of pity and concern, but It wasn't long before I became flooded with a mountains worth of repressed baggage dating all the way back to my childhood... Disgust, Hatred, rage... The barrage of feelings set off a deep network of emotional fault lines. It was during this randomly occurring bout of instability, that I could feel the recently dormant muscles in my face contorting into a twisted smile. I Looked at that fucking rapist dead in his eyes and smiled. It was a shit eating grin that, much like the silent language Parker had recently articulated, made Its overt message of Go to hell, and while youre there, feel free to fuck yourself, unmistakably clear. Parker seemed utterly shocked by the outward display of pleasurable contentment. He wouldn't have time to voice his opinion seeing as how theMonster's jaws closed around his head. The Monster walked towards me. The rough looking creature summoned a moment's worth of tenderness to rub Its finger, intently across my cheek. A comforting sense of understanding had washed over me, and It was like I had known the menacing creature my entire life. After our short-lived exchange, The Monster retreated back from where It came. As the vortex dissipated, the locket closed on its own, leaving me to stand alone in the darkness. I could see after Its departure that the Monster was nothing to fear It was no different than a fire. Yes, It could be an unforgiving force of death pain and destruction, but It could also provide a source of heat, giving all those in its vicinity a sense of comfort and safety. That's when I knew that I was never helpless, I had harnessed the power of hell, and like a righteous flame, our destruction would find Its way to those that deserved to be consumed. Parker wouldn't be the first, and he most certainly won't be the last. I saw what I had to do, I saw what I had to become to fix this broken world that we live in. There are so many others out there just like Parker, others who needed to be taught the same lesson. I stood there in the dark. I stood there and laughed. My name is Grace Smith, and this is the story of how I discovered what my purpose is. My purpose is to make them pay... All of them"
245,vulnerability,nosleep,"""This isn't where you sleep.""",111,4vfhiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4vfhiu/this_isnt_where_you_sleep/,2016-07-31 13:37:15,"Originally posted last year to Let's Not Meet, reposted here after it was suggested in a comment. Tiny bit of editing to update my age and add an epilogue of sorts to the end now some time has passed. --- I'm a 29 year old guy from England. Near the end of August 2014, I was out with some friends in a bar to celebrate my birthday. It was near the end of the night and we'd decided it was time to go home, having been out for going on 8 hours by this point. We were up on the first floor of the bar and my friends went down the staircase to the main doors ahead of me. For reasons my advanced drunkenness has caused me to forget, I decided to try taking a shortcut off the stage next to the stairs instead. I'm guessing I just stepped off the stage thinking that it was a short drop to the ground, but it was closer to about five or six feet and I hit the ground with my legs straight and my knees locked. Snap. I instantly knew something was pretty seriously wrong. Cue a 999 call and a surprisingly calm ambulance ride to hospital after being dosed up on gas and air. At the hospital, they gave me an X-Ray and discovered I'd broken both of my legs. By this point I'd sort of already guessed (your right foot pointing down instead of up is a pretty good indication) and my heart sank further when the attending doctor told me they'd have to admit me ahead of corrective surgery in the next couple of days. By now, they'd given me quite a bit of morphine and I was still huffing gas and air like a champ so I was fairly out of it. A porter wheeled me up to the ward and introduced me to a nurse, who explained I was going to be put into the men's ward as they'd had to separate genders the previous day into different rooms (I would've thought they'd do this anyway, but whatever). Even out of it on pain meds, I remember thinking it was a weird thing to mention. The nurse set me up in my room, right by the ward entrance. My bed was one of 5 in there and was next to the room's shared toilet/shower room. It was around 5am and the entire place was quiet and dark. As the nurse took me through all the admittance procedures, I could vaguely make out a guy in the bed opposite. Unlike the others in the room, he was awake and sitting up in his bed to watch me being brought in. I couldn't see his face, but the patchy white hair on his head was catching the moonlight coming in from the windows so I guessed he was an older guy. What struck me was how still he was sitting there, like a statue. No movement, no noise, nothing. Just sitting there, focused on me the whole time. Before the nurse left, I asked him to draw the curtain round me so I was shielded from view. Eventually I drifted off to sleep. I woke up the next day to find my parents had been contacted and were sitting by my bed. Standing next to them was the guy from the bed opposite, chatting away like they'd known each other for years. I'm not exactly known as a people person and given that for obvious reasons I was a touch grouchy, I'll admit that I was annoyed that my parents were letting a total stranger stand right over me while I was unconscious. Of course, they weren't to know that he'd creeped me out a little the night before. He introduced himself, here we'll call him Mick. He seemed friendly enough, one of those harmless old men who comes across as lonely and keen to talk to just about anyone. He was in his early 70s, quite short and round and was on the ward because he'd fractured his collarbone in a fall. When he eventually wandered off, my parents told me he seemed to be a nice man, confirming that he just appeared pleased to have new people to talk to. During the course of that first day, my parents left and the doctors came round to fit me up with splints before my surgery, planned for day 3. They made it clear I'd be in hospital for at least a week and I wouldn't be walking for a few months at least (not what I wanted to hear). During all of these conversations, Mick lurked nearby, listening in. When the doctors left, Mick came to my bedside. Rather than stand, he sat down in the chair next to me and asked me to repeat what the doctors had said. I wasn't in much of a mood to chat and because I'd got it into my head that he was harmless, I asked why he'd need to know since he'd only stood a few feet away and must've heard everything. The second those words left my lips, his entire demeanour changed. The sweet old man that had been sitting in that chair was gone and his face went blank, like it had flattened. He fixed me with this weird stare and one corner of his mouth lifted into a lopsided grin. ""My wife just died, you know."" Again, I'm not a people person and conversations about death are way outside of my wheelhouse. I stuttered a little, trying to find appropriate words. I think I went with how sorry I was to hear that and asked how long it had been. Given the odd grin, I guessed it had been a while. ""About three weeks. Just like that. Gone."" His face never changed the whole time. It dawned on me that maybe he wasn't totally...mentally present, at that point. He never broke eye contact either, just looking at me, grinning. One of those looks that isn't immediately sinister but then goes on just a little too long. Thankfully the nurses came in at that point to serve dinner and Mick retreated back to his bed. He watched TV the rest of that day and I put my iPod on so I had an excuse not to make any more conversation. Right then, I just thought he was a little left of normal and it was more weirdness than I could deal with. When lights out came around, I asked the nurses to draw the curtains round my bed for me. Although I was still in quite a bit of pain, I drifted off early. I woke up in what had to have been the early hours of the morning. One of those gradual awakenings where you know something's not quite right but can't work out what. The ward was almost totally dark and silent again, especially around my bed with the curtains drawn. I assumed the weird feeling was down to, you know, being in hospital with two epically shattered legs and turned my head to the left onto the pillow. Then I nearly rolled off the opposite side in shock. Standing inside of the drawn curtain right next to my bed was Mick. Just stood there, watching me. Like you do when you've had a shock, I said something stupid. ""This isn't where you sleep."" Nothing. Same blank stare, same creepy half-smile. Barely a ruler-length from my face. I thought he might be sleepwalking, but he didn't have the glazed look to go with it. He seemed perfectly alert, just happy to be stood there observing me. ""Mick, how long have you been there?"" That's when I got that special kind of chill you get when something really freaks you the fuck out. Rather than reply, he smiled really wide so I saw both rows of his teeth and then shuffled back around the curtain to his own bed. I didn't sleep the rest of that night. Because he never really left the room and I certainly wasn't going anywhere, I couldn't really mention it to the nurses. I did text a few friends who were visiting the next day and told them to watch out for him when they came through. He stayed away during their visit and they said he seemed like a normal old man, which he did at that point. As the day went on, I decided I'd made more of it than I should've and was just on edge because of what I had going on, being in unfamiliar surroundings, etc. That day, I went in for my surgery. I came to about 6 hours later to find myself hooked up to a morphine pump (hands down the best medical invention ever). As a result, I was absolutely out of my tree high the entire evening and was in such a good, opiate-fuelled mood, I totally forgot about Mick. Big mistake. It got to the early hours again and I was playing a game on my phone, oblivious. Because nurses were checking me every hour or so, they'd disturbed the curtains around my bed a lot as they came and went. The last nurse had left a gap about 6 inches wide where the curtains met, typically right in the part opposite Mick's bed. Mick was a very, very loud snorer and so I was reassured by the noises coming from him that he was very much asleep. I've got to assume because of the morphine, I stopped paying attention and suddenly realised that I couldn't hear the snoring anymore. I also couldn't remember how long it had been since I'd last heard it. I looked at the gap between the curtains but couldn't make anything out. I was just about to go back to my game when, from just left of the gap, I heard my name being said. Not a normal way of saying it, not a whisper, more of a groan, almost. Low and gravelly and menacing. I froze. I mean, what's the protocol when a pensioner has got out of bed in the middle of the night for the second night running to mess with you? I sat, paralysed (well, more paralysed that I already was) with this odd sense of vulnerability. I was immobile, I couldn't really confront him or get up and leave, I was stuck in my bed, heavy bandages and braces around both legs and hooked to an IV. I slowly moved my hand down from my phone to the call button for the nurses. Just as my hand reached it, the long groaning of my name stopped. So did my hand. Had he seen me reach for it and gone back to bed? Nope. He was still there. About thirty seconds passed, presumably the length of time it took him to be comfortable that I wasn't going to press the button. Then came the heavy breathing. Long, rasping intakes of air followed by extended groans to expel it. Over and over and over. Right at the foot of my bed. That was my limit. I hit the call button and the light went on above my bed, I heard the buzzer sound down the hallway at the nurses' station. There was a burst of movement behind my curtains and I heard the nearby toilet door quickly open and close. Not long afterwards, a nurse responded to the call. Mick was still in the toilet, but because it was close by, I beckoned the nurse nearer so I could whisper. I told her what had happened and about the previous night and asked if something could be done. She nodded and said she'd be right back. While she was gone, Mick emerged from the toilet and I heard him climb back into his bed. Thankfully the nurse had fully closed my curtains, so at least he couldn't see me now. An hour passed and eventually the nurse returned. I was expecting to be moved elsewhere, but instead she told me that I couldn't have a sleeping pill due to being on morphine. I tried my best not to be impolite and calmly told her that I didn't ask for a pill, I asked for something to be done about what had happened. The last thing I wanted was to deliberately knock myself unconscious with more meds. She sort of shrugged, half-explained that all of the wards were full and disappeared again, telling me to get some rest. I didn't sleep for hours. Mick's snoring eventually resumed and the day finally caught up with me, so I cautiously allowed myself to drift off. The next morning, everything seemed normal again. Mick made small talk which I didn't really respond to and eventually left me alone. That afternoon, a guy younger than me was admitted with a broken leg. This guy was 18 but looked about 12, it was ridiculous. Mick didn't seem to think so, because suddenly this guy was the focus of all his attention. I felt sorry for the fresh meat but grateful that I might be able to relax now. That night, I slept pretty well. Until about 3am. I woke up to a weird sensation on my left foot, the toes of which were poking out of the top of the bandages. My eyes adjusted to the darkness and I saw Mick, again stood inside of my drawn curtains. Playing with my toes. Running his fingers along them, pinching them, moving them around, like he'd wanted me to wake up and see what he was doing. But not looking at them. Looking me dead in the eyes, unblinking. Grinning. I'd like to say I lost my shit with him, called the nurses in and had him moved elsewhere. But the mind's a weird thing, so I didn't. I just sat open-mouthed and watched him as he kept moving my toes around. I think it was disbelief that kept me quiet, mixed with fear. He might have had more than 40 years on me, but I was trapped in that bed and totally at his mercy and so didn't want to do anything to piss him off. Eventually he seemed to get tired of messing with me and disappeared behind the curtains back to his own bed. For obvious reasons, I sat awake the rest of the night, watching and waiting for him to show his face again, but he didn't. Every now and then, I heard my name being groaned, low and long. By morning, I was a mixture of furious and terrified. I'm not the kind of person who assumes the role of victim very often and so I hated how easily this old man had reduced me to a paranoid wreck. Every time he got up to stretch his legs or get some water, my entire body went rigid, expecting him to come back to my bedside. He didn't, going back to devote all of his creepy attention to the new guy again. That afternoon, Mick was called away for a scan and so I finally had some time to speak to the three other guys in the room about what had happened. None of them had any idea about Mick's nightly visits, since they were dosed up on pain meds themselves. One of the guys had been there longer than I had, though. And he had been around when the wards were divided by gender. I asked him what had happened and he responded that he wasn't totally sure, he just knew that something had happened during the night and the next morning, men and women were in separate wards. For obvious reasons, I had a pretty good idea of what that ""something"" might have been. When Mick got back, he glumly announced that he had been cleared to go home and had an ambulance booked to take him there in an hour or two. He started making his way around the ward, saying goodbye to everyone. He left me until last. ""You look after those legs in future. They're fragile things."" I half-smiled and (because I'm crippled with English politeness) told him I hoped he felt better soon. Assuming the interaction was done and I'd finally seen the last of him, I picked up a magazine and started reading. No sooner had I done that, I felt pressure around my left foot. I looked up and was about to yell out until I saw what Mick was doing. His hand was clamped around my foot, squeezing it so hard that his knuckles had gone white (thankfully the break on the left was further up). And that stare was back. Vacant but intense, with a creepy half-smile. Before I could respond, his mouth opened and out came that same raspy voice I'd heard saying my name in the night. ""Very. Very. Fragile."" He let go of my foot, turned around and shuffled back to his bed to pack. A couple of hours after that, he was gone. I did fill the nurses in before I was discharged, but none of them seemed to care all that much, dismissing what I'd experienced as either partly drug-induced or just misinterpreted. I don't think too often about Mick these days, now I'm back on my feet and more or less back to normal. Every so often though, if I'm woken up in the night by a twinge in my legs, I remember those weeks in hospital and make a little promise to myself to never wind up back there again."

For some reason, a cult that prays to a deity that they call ""Sadness"" or ""The Queen"" tries to ""cleanse my soul by letting me suffer through the eight stages of Sadness. If you want to read what happened before, you can do that here: *** I asked my two best friends (and the only two people who seem to believe me), Henry and Lucas, to come with me to the cave. I told them a bit, but not yet everything, what i know of the cult. They'd probably think I'm crazy and leave me too if I told them all at once. First, they both have the same job as I do, which means they have great knowledge about technology. Henry is a pothead, kind most of the time, but says what he thinks. He loves his boat, which he called ""MS Valkyre"". Most days when i meet him i get stoned with him, and honestly, it was much easier to go to this cave again when you're a bit high... Lucas on the other hand is the kind of guy who doesn't often have a problem, most of the time just chills and enjoys life, but is there to punch someones face him if his friends need him. He was kinda reluctant to come to the cave with us, do to having a new girlfriend, and not wanting to ruin anything. In the end however, I was able to convince him. I also asked Mike, my co-worker, because he has a waterproof camera that we can take there. I only told him that i was interested in the cave and wanted to write something about it. He wouldn't have risked his life if he knew. *** ##IV: Caving We packed everything and went out at noon yesterday. We didn't take much, just stuff to drink and eat, two notebooks, some sleeping bags, wood for making a fire, really basic climbing gear and Mikes' waterproof camera. We brought everything to the Valkyre, and we pushed off at 2pm. Mike didn't know Henry and Lucas, so they got to talk a bit. I told them not to tell Mike the true purpose of the trip, and they managed to actually not tell him. We shortly arrived at the cave and found a post to tie the boat up. Mike misstepped and nearly fell into the water, but he managed to only get his left foot wet. Besides a bit of cursing and an occasional wet step sound the incident was forgotten really fast, as I was leading them to the place where I woke up. The last time i were there, A few torches and candles were lit, but this time nearly all of the cave was enlightined by torches, that were added after I left. I was afraid that Mike would wonder why an abandoned cave would be lit up by torches. Five seconds later he did; he asked how much work it was to prepare the cave for filming. Henry answered before i could even react, by telling him that about 3 days went into it. ""That fast?"" Mike asked. I answered faster than would be normal: ""Working efficiently, ya know?"" Worst part about this was that the boss hsd been mad at mike for working ineffecient, and so he was hurt by my comment. He kept silent until we reached the spot. There were torches set up in a circle, and a triangle was drawn into them with chalk, and a square was drawn into that. There were four lines drawn from the circle of torches to the walls of thr cave, one every 90 degrees, resembling the red sun. ""Didn't you say documentary?"" Mike asked. I faked what I think is a pretty good laugh, and told him: ""Mockumentary. You know, like a documentary, but with faked stuff in it to make it interesting? You can start the camera now"" He kept silent again, and started to record everything, while we were putting down sleeping bags and preparing a campfire. *** It was around 6.30pm when the smoke from the campfire filled the roof of the cave. We were grilling fish and pork, and preparing bread on the rocks that we put around the fire. We ate and decided to explore the cave for about an hour, and then go to sleep. Not all of us would sleep, we would always be awake in shifts. Henry from 8.30pm to 10.30, Lucas from 10.30pm to 00:30am, Mike from 00:30am to 2:30, and me from 2:30 until 5am, and then I would wake everyone. We told Mike we do that so we won't miss anything. *** Lucas woke me up. ""Wtf dude? You have to wake Mike!"" I mumbled. ""I did. Henry too. We have to go."" I was immidiatly awake. Footsteps were coming towards us, accompanied by a strange chant. Since the sounds were coming from the direction we entered the cave, we fled in the other direction, deeper into the cave. We took out backpacks and most stuff we brought with us, but had to sacrife the sleeping bags and two pans. The part of the cave we were going to was dark, without any torches, and fifty meters in we were swallowed by darkness. Henry and Mike were already waiting there, at a lighter spot, but still far darker than the mainpart we were in. We silently agreed to wait and see who the footsteps and chanting came from. Not two minutes later we saw them. A group of maybe thirty people walking down the cave, some dressed in identical dresses to the nuns of Stella-Maris, some dressed in black versions of the robe with blue and purple suns drawn on them. The leading person was holding a female body in his arms, her red hair reaching the ground. He softly put her in the circle were I had woken up in, and stepper back. It started winding in the cave, the torches' fires were flickering. It got stronger and stronger, creating a houling sound. Then it stopped, and the fire seemed to crawl from the walls and torches into the circle, in to the heart of the woman, and burning her from the inside. After a few minutes her body was only ash, and smoke rose from the remainders of her corpse. The smoke formed into a humanoid shape. There was blue fire where eyes would be supposed to be. The smoke turned and looked around the cultists. The smoke went through half of them, cutting their throats, and then went further into the cave, flying past us. The remaining cultists went to put out the torches, chanting quieter now. When the last torches light died, so did the chanting, and all we heard was the sound of the wind and their footsteps, leaving us alone in the cave. Alone with the smoke of the dead. Alone with Sadness. *** *Fourth Stage of Sadness: Vulnerability* *** [Part 5 - Safe Heaven](URL "

I have fought for some big companies but I have never reached high to fame and glory. Being a professional fighter is no easy task and you have to make so many sacrifices in your life, to become one. You have to constantly watch what you eat and be training to keep on becoming better. Overrall I love this life style and I wouldn't have become anything else, i enjoy the journey of training to actually fighting in a cage or ring. I have had a few fights in the ufc and not done to well but that's a part of life, its all about growing and learning. Recently I am sure you have heard about usada anti doping system used by the fighting world as a whole. Also being someone who has fought in the ufc, I have had some experiences with the usada people. They do this thing where they randomly turn up at your training gym and test you for any legal substances in your system. Its caught a lot of fighters out and has brought of surprising news on some fighters, who have been using illegal steroids and enhancing drugs. Don't get me wrong, its important for a fighter to find the right vitamins and minerals to perform well and to heal, but, some go the distance where it just becomes illegal. Fighters who were once at the top of thier game before the anti-doping usada system was put into use, now looked like they weren't at the top anymore. Thee saggy skin swaying and thier mental state destroyed even and it is a mountain to climb up from that point. I am still quite young and still in my 20s you probably won't even know my name if I even told you, but I have fought in the ufc and for other big companies. I make a decent living out of it and I have had a couple of experiences with a usada employee randomly coming into my gym to test me. My fight was to be held in a ufc arena with another fighter who I will not name but we are both unknown anyway, this guy from usada comes into my gym randomly without any certification or identification and says he has to test me for any illegal substance, within my system. He takes me into the back changing room of my gym and it pretty dark and things get a little weird when he asked me to become naked. I tried to reason with him but this guy was really serious and I basically become naked feeling vulnerable. Then this usada guy started to shiver a little and vibrate and I could almost swear that his skin was vibrating and moving but it was hard to see in the dark, also he was really serious about keeping it dark as possible. He seemed to be enjoying vulnerability and then things got properly dark. Literally it was pitch black and I was walking and not wearing any clothing, I was shouting, running and I was basically going crazy. Then my body stopped as I felt something long and strong grab me squeezing my body, then I felt something around my neck and it lifted me off the ground. Now being an mma fighter I tried fighting back but It was so strong, this bit is where I was literally thrown off the cliff. Being naked it kind of pinned me against a wall even though before it felt there were no walls, it violated me. I started to urinate and my urine started to go into something and then something started talking. ""your struggle and pain it pleases me, I am the predator you are the prey. I am your god"" it spoke to me in a deep voice Then it showed my time line from a baby and I was literally looking at my history to where I am now and this thing, was still talking. ""i could take your life right now, your just a pathetic weak and inferior being"" Then it let me go and everything went back to normal but I felt so weak and dizzy and I couldn't get up. The usada was still standing smiling and he just casually walked out. I made it to the bathroom within the changing room, my trainer came in and I told him that everything is fine. I lost my fight though. Being a professional fighter is tough these days..."

I ran one of the orientation trips for incoming freshmanbackpacking on the Adirondack trail for three nights. It was the toughest hike the college offered. I usually wasnt the type to get involved in college events, but they offered to pay me pretty well to shepherd ten freshmen around and it didnt seem like it would be that hard. The only real rules were you couldnt give them alcohol or drugs and you couldnt hook up with any of them. I really, really wish Id listened. My group was seven guys and three girls. Unfortunately, the guys were all douchebags. The incoming recruits for the baseball team had all decided to sign up for the same trip. They already knew each other from training camp and they spent the entire trip showing off and complaining about having to sleep in tents. It would have been a pretty miserable trip, if it wasnt for Jess. She seemed a lot more mature than the other freshman and kind of removed. The other kids didnt seem to like her very much, which I put down to them all being preppy and annoying. She was kind of standoffish, wouldnt get involved with their never-have-I-ever games or joke around with them. When we hiked, she stayed close to me and we talked about our families, other hikes wed gone on, pretty much everything. I had a lot of fun talking to her. It was exciting. I could see her looking up to me, a senior with authority, and I felt myself starting to swagger and show off for her a bit, playing the role. Jess was definitely good-looking. She had long hair, but she also had a strong jawline and a very masculine energy, so I assumed pretty much right away that she was gay. I casually brought up that I was part of a lesbian social group on campus that she might want to join and she immediately got very defensive. Im not gay, she said. Im not gay. I mean, its cool that you are. Like, Im okay with it. But Im not. She was very adamant about it. I gave her a month and a half before she had her first girlfriend. &amp;nbsp; After the trip, Jess and I kept in touch. At first we texted about the books we were reading and what new music we were listening to, but it kept going until we were texting pretty much all the time. We started doing work next to each other in the library, first just whenever we saw each other, and then every night. Jess opened up to me about how much trouble she was having making friends, about her strained relationship with her parents, about the two months she had spent in a mental hospital during high school for severe bipolar. In turn, I told her about my own struggle with depression and how hard it was for my parents to accept my sexuality. I told her about how guilty I feel whenever I disappoint anyone. Pretty soon, Jess started asking me questions about being gay. How did I know? When did I figure it out? How many girls had I been with? I could tell she liked me. She wasnt very good at hiding it. She texted me too often, too eagerly. She was always waiting for me in the library when I got there. She looked at me too long, made excuses to touch me. I introduced Jess to my friends but they didnt like her. She wasnt friendly with them, wasnt comfortable in the same way she was with me. She was abrupt almost to the point of rudeness. Her awkwardness made them uncomfortable. They told me to stop hanging out with her, that our relationship was creepy. I told them they just didnt know what she was really like. But still, I started to worry that what I was doing with Jess was wrong. I was three years older, confident in my sexuality, and fairly experienced. She was young and mentally unstable, away from home for the first time, and she had never gone past second base with anyone, boy or girl. I was really her only support system at school. And she looked up to me. It had been two months since the orientation trip, but wed never completely lost the power dynamic wed established those first few days. She was still trying to impress me, still looked at me like someone who knew the answers. I knew I should stop spending so much time with her and let her make her own friends, but I justified it by saying I was helping her with the rough adjustment. She needed me. &amp;nbsp; Then, on Halloween night, we ended up at the same party. Me with my senior friends, and her with the group of freshmen girls she hung around with but didnt seem really friendly with. I was flirting with a junior on the field hockey team, playing beer pong together and getting closer to her with every shot. Jess came up and grabbed me. Are you trying to hook up with her? she demanded. She was angry and I could tell, but I didnt care. I was tired of feeling guilty for being attracted to Jess. Of course I am, I said. Shes super hot. She is not, Jess said. Shes ugly. I winked at her and went back to my athlete friend. She was talking about how shed recently switched conditioners, so I ran my hands through her hair to test the softness. Jess stood alone against the wall across from me, staring at me touching the girl, holding a bottle of tequila she must have stolen from someone. As I watched, she started chugging straight from the bottle. She was clearly trying to get my attention and it annoyed me. I ignored her. Twenty minutes later, however, she was harder to ignore. She grabbed my wrist to pull me aside. Im so drunk, she said. Her face was flushed and she was slurring her words. She could barely stand up straight. I dont think I can get home. I need help. Jesus, I said. Cant one of your friends take you home? Theyre not my friends. I dont have any friends. I was mad at her for deliberately getting herself in this situation, but I felt obligated to help. I told the field hockey player I would be back and walked her back to her dorm. We got inside and she sat down on the bed. Im sorry, she said. Its fine. Here. Drink some water. I sat down next to her with the water bottle. She was sitting up straight, no longer flushed. She suddenly didnt seem that drunk. That girls not good enough for you, she said. Oh yeah? I said. Then who is? And she kissed me. Maybe it was the pent up energy of the last two months, maybe it was that it felt like I was doing something wrong, but I had never felt a kiss like that. It was as if my whole body, the whole room, the whole world was suddenly vibrating. I wanted to dig my fingernails into her skin. I was about to do it, when I remembered that this was her first time kissing a girl. That she was eighteen and drunk off half a bottle of tequila. Stop, I said. We cant do this. It isnt right. She looked at me and the expression on her face was so unfamiliar that for a moment I didnt recognize her. She didnt look disappointed or upsetshe looked angry. Incredibly angry. I stood up. Suddenly, I didnt feel turned on anymore. I wanted to leave. See you later, I said and I practically ran out of her room. But after a few steps, I had to slow down. My legs hurt, they felt heavy, as if Id been running for miles. I was cold and sweaty and the edges of my vision buzzed with blackness, like I was about to pass out. My mouth tasted terrible. It took me twenty minutes to walk the half mile back to my room. I couldnt believe Id gotten so drunk without realizing it. Usually I knew my limits. Had I taken shots and then forgotten about them? &amp;nbsp; When I woke up the next morning, something felt wrong. As if Id been jolted from sleep. My heart was beating hard enough that I could feel it through my whole body. And I felt afraid. My chest seemed to physically hurt with fear. I lay in bed doing breathing exercises and went through every area of my life in my mind, trying to convince myself I had nothing to be afraid of. Grades, social life, healtheverything was going well. Except for Jess. It was guilt, it had to be. I was afraid that she would feel like I had taken advantage of her. She had been drunk. What if she reported me to the dean? She could probably get me in trouble since I had been her orientation leader. I would go to her and explain. I would apologize. Feeling extremely hungover, I got up and walked to her room. As I got closer, it became harder and harder to control my breathing. I couldnt believe I was having this strong of a reaction to some freshman who thought she was straight. I knocked on her door and she told me to come in. She was lying in bed, on top of the sheets, dressed. Im surprised youre up, I said. I thought youd be down all day. I bought you a muffin. It will help if you eat something. She smiled at me. Come here, she said, and she opened her arms like she wanted me to lie down in them. I sat on the edge of the bed, as far away from her as I could get. Look, I want to say Im really sorry about what happened last night. It was a mistake. I was really out of line. I know youre not gay, I know you were drunk. I hope we can still be friends. She moved next to me. Her hair looked different somehow. Softer. More glamorous. She ran a finger along my jawline. I was so startled that this awkward freshman had made such a bold move that I didnt respond at all. I just stared at her. And then she kissed me. She kissed me and grabbed the front of my shirt and pulled me down on top of her. Wait I started to say but then I couldnt remember what I had wanted to say. I couldnt think. My mind felt blocked, completely gone. I started kissing her neck and she moaned and squirmed. She was so responsive, so clearly turned on. It made me feel incredibly sexy. Suddenly I didnt care anymore. When we were done, I had her head cradled against my chest when suddenly a sharp pain stabbed my stomach. I jumped up and started pulling on my clothes. Jess watched. She didnt seem concerned. Be back, I said and I ran down the hall to the bathroom. I got on my knees in the stall. My stomach felt like it was being ripped in half. I wanted to throw up but gagging was too painful. I was covered in cold sweat again. I couldnt imagine why I was this hungover. Suddenly, I was afraid. Call-your-mother, climb-under-the-bed afraid. I needed to get away. I ran back to my dorm without saying goodbye to Jess and locked my door. Once inside my room and under my blankets, I realized what an incredible asshole I was. I had just taken a girls virginity and then literally run away. I texted her a quick apology and said I was hungover and sick. As I sent the text message, my heart started beating pain into my skin again. I couldnt do this. I couldnt be with Jessit was just wrong and my body was punishing me for taking advantage of her vulnerability. I texted her and told her I couldnt see her again, I was sorry, and I thought it was best we took a break from each other for a while. Then I thought about how she must be feeling and couldnt handle the guilt. I was the worst kind of asshole. But I couldnt keep going. It was tearing me up inside. I cried to myself for a long time and then I fell asleep. &amp;nbsp; It look me a while to realize why I woke up. The hair on my scalp and arms was standing up so straight, it felt like I was being kneaded with porcupine quills. Ive never experienced anything like itwaking up with my body completely tense with alarm, but my mind not knowing why. I struggled to breathe. Shh, Jess said. Its okay. Youre okay. She put an arm around my waist from behind. Oh my God! I stood up. What are you doing here? Jess stretched out in my bed, yawning sleepily. She was naked. I missed you, she said. I got your silly text message and I knew we had to work this out. How did you get in here? I said, still shouting. Jess laughed. But it wasnt the goofy, casual laugh I had heard on the Adirondack trail. It was high-pitched to an almost painful degree and tinkling, the way a B-list Hollywood actress laughs. My heart started beating so fast I could barely hear, could barely see. You need to leave, I said, trying to sound as firm as possible. Jess stood up. She looked taller, or I felt shorter, because she seemed to be looking down at me now. Shh, she said. She took my hand and placed it on her breast. I shivered. I felt so cold. I know baby, she said. Let me keep you warm. &amp;nbsp; I keep locking my door. I shut the windows and pulled the shades down. For a week, Ive been lying in bed, gagging on my stomach pain, and shivering no matter how many blankets I put on. Im so cold all the time now. Every morning, Jess leaves and I lock the door behind her and swear to myself that it will never happen again. But every night somehow shes here and when she touches me, I dont care anymore. All I want is to touch her and never stop. I think Im going crazy. I must be going crazy. Something is wrong with me. Something is wrong with her. Ive tried talking to my friends but none of them believe me. They think I need help. Maybe I do need help. Please. No one believes me. Im sorry this is so long, but I had to get it all out to make sense of it in my head. It still doesnt make sense though. Shes doing something to me. I dont think shes what she says she is. Please, please believe me. Tell me what to do. "
249,vulnerability,nosleep,I'm a hacker part 1,7,4po5bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4po5bm/im_a_hacker_part_1/,2016-06-25 03:38:31,"I'm no writer or whatever and English is not my main language, so beware of my spelling and grammar mistakes. Thanks. I'll go by the name Dom in this story. I usually don't do anything, but sit by my computer, just hacking sites, finding vulnerabilities and whatnot, my second most recent subject to hack was pretty much innocent vulnerability scanning, such as SQL Injections and XSS on a local grocery store's website. This is not where it all began, though. I was invited to a weird IRC chat by a friend. The IRC was hosted on the deep web, I don't really recall the name, also it's unneccessary. What I was asked to do, is important. The messages I received per instant as I entered with the nick ""dmterb"" was more or less disturbing. He.. or she, sent ""Hi Dom, we've learned that you know your way around hacking. What we can offer you is, that your task will be hard, granted that you accept this following task. The payment will be in dollars and will be given by a drop off at a self chosen location. Do you accept?"". I thought to myself, that this properly was just a joke, so I just went with it. Said I'd be happy to accept and that it probably was an easy task. So he/she continued.. Actually let's call him/her Anne. Anne followed her previous message up with ""Dom, this is no task for a beginner, this is a task for expert hackers. I hope you understand this."" ""I understand. What's the details?"" ""I will provide you with details about the task, when I have gotten around the paperwork. Hold on 10 minutes, please"" She disconnected. A little backstory.. I had just purchased a new phone last week, where my cellphone number had been altered so nobody of the old spammers I knew, was able to contact me. So 10 minutes later, I received a call from Anne. Anne told me about the task, but there was a couple of details that she had let out. She gave me some server ip's which I had to be granted access to, before task was fulfilled. So I accepted the task, thinking it'd be easy or atleast intermediate.. I got through the first 2 out of 10 ips, before I noticed on the third, that it had a weird welcome message, which made me slow down a bit, forgetting to hide my shit.. So, what I read was ""pentagon master"". Alright, who the fuck was messing with me, right? So as I forgot all about hiding my shit, I continued to the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th. See... 9th and 10th, was where it all became.. weird. I ran some very basic unix commands, reading directories and whatever, to see what I was dealing with.. a simple ""ls"" told me that there was a folder called ""intruder"", where all my recent datas had been stored. By datas I mean my incoming requests to the other servers that I had accessed. This freaked me the fuck out. Yo, what the fuck is a 19 year old going to do? Ha.. So, anyways.. Anne called in about 24 hours later, before I sent a message to her IRC channel. ""Dom. Have you finished the task?"". I answered her as politely as I could ""More or less. What is t.."", Anne stopped me ""Nothing to worry about, Dom.""... "".. Anne, I need to know what this is. This has pentagon read all over 3rd ip."" ""Sure, Dom. You have accessed one of Pentagon's main servers, which should contain all kinds of data, which we are very interested in. Are you able to transfer the data? I'll be in contact within 24 hours. You're probably going to need some time to process this."" I was finished, what the fuck is going on, what have I done. Anyways, I'll keep you updated. I've got to sleep on this. So, what happened is that I, as usual, was sitting around my PC, though this was no ordinary night, after all the shit last night occured. I was minding my own business, when I heard my window break downstairs, immediately I thought the fuck was going on and I had flashbacks from the day before, where I was like.. ""Could this have something to do with me hacking? Nah... Can't be"". As my curiousity grew, I got more excited to figure out what the fuck broke my window, so I started moving my lazy ass downstairs. What I met, was a person who was staring blindy into a dark room, where I only was able to see his fucking shadow. I hadn't made any noise, since the steps on my staircase isn't noisy at all. Thought about calling the cops, but if this was Pentagon.. Instead I fetched my crowbar which I keep by my door, cause it sometimes is all fucked and doesn't want to fucking open.. When I returned, he was gone ""Alright, where'd he go, what the fuck"" I thought to myself. I started looking for this fucker, he wasn't gonna steal any of my shit, that's for sure. Suddenly, I felt strangled.. or at least captured and damn right, I passed the fuck out by something, I don't know what the fuck it was, but I was knocked the fuck out.. Where I later woke up in some warehouse, tied up to a fucking chair, looking at this fella in a clown mask.. I was staring straight at him and felt the chills run off me. He moved towards me, started blabbing about a lot of random bullshit like how my day'd been. I told him to fuck off, where he told me ""Now, youngling, behave.. We, elders does not enjoy swearing. Now, be a good boy and tell me how you gained access to Pentagon's servers"". I was stunned.. The fuck was going on.. I thought to myself, that this bastard wasn't going to get shit out of me so I repeated ""Fuck off"". He must've gotten pretty upset, cause next thing he said was ""Dom, you don't realize how much shit you're into.. But, alright, you're going to be a stupid young boy, so let me tell you, what's going to happen.."" he stopped, looking at this huge fucking table, which had ""pain"" carved into it, filled with old blood.. ""Okay, so this person was a psycho, so I better play this game properly"" I thought to myself. ""Dom, firstly, I'm going to cut in your head, then your arms, then your legs, until you tell me what I want to hear"" he said. ""Alright, great, when you do start?"" I said, almost yelling at him, due to already being able to feel pain, even before he started cutting. I started noticing that he hadn't tied the knots properly, so I had to find the perfect time to escape, cause I got the ropes off my feet.. ""Actually, lets scratch that, I'll start with your arms.."". Great, perfect timing. I had my legs free, so I kicked him off of my, got my hands untied by shaking them off, went straight to him and started kicking and hitting him, telling him to go fuck himself. I ran as a motherfucker, went to my bestfriends' house, telling him all this and he said I could stay for the night, but I had to get the fuck out, in the morning. This was okay.. So now I'm staying in a motel, waiting for shit to go down, while having a laptop I recently purchased for checking up on the servers.. No idea what I'm supposed to do. [part 2](URL"
250,vulnerability,nosleep,I had to psychologically evaluate a serial killer; I don't know what to report (part 4/final),344,4r5fjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4r5fjz/i_had_to_psychologically_evaluate_a_serial_killer/,2016-07-04 13:59:10,"Session 6  Necata *Hey guys, I finished this early, and because of how difficult the subject matter is, and because I'm genuinely curious to hear all of your opinions on what I should do, I figure there's no point in holding out on you. Enjoy.* *Now, before we get into this session, which pretty much finishes off this very sad, very puzzling case, two quick notes. Firstly, I left one particular item that was recovered from Adams house off my earlier list because at the time, it didnt seem relevant. Upon reflection now, it clearly is relevant. So here it is: An axe was recovered from the basement  an axe much like the one the real Asheera used to try and fend off her killer husband. Remember that, because it will be important.* *Secondly, I said last session that the name of Adams penultimate alternate personality  Necata Vactus  was so odd I had to spell it phonetically. Well, a little research later, Ive come to the conclusion that I actually spelled her surname wrong. As I noted in the comments last time, Necata is the female form of the Latin word for murdered/killed. This much seems entirely apt, and given that Adam was educated at a Catholic private school  where Latin would have been taught  it makes sense that hed pick a name like this. I think this is also where he got the name Brutus. But what escaped me was that Adams father, Howard, was the descendant of first generation Swedish immigrants (I learned this by looking through genealogy records). As such, it seems likely that Adam heard the language spoken at home in at least some context, which brings me back to Necatas last name. I think its actually supposed to be spelled Vaktis, which is the Swedish word for janitor. And given the role that Necata Vaktis played in Adams head, I think youll see why murdered janitor, or most accurately murder janitor, is such an appropriate name.* *Now, to the sixth session and, as it turns out, the last. When I walked in to meet Adam this time, he met me with the same icy, hostile stare that he had at the end of our last session, and I knew Necata was both in control and loaded for bear. I greeted her with as much friendliness as I could, only to be unceremoniously told to bugger yourself up the arse with a straight razor like the bloody nonce you are. She then informed me on no uncertain terms that she wasnt going to squeal, and I was wasting my time.* [*[As such, my first question is probably obvious: Squeal about what?]]* I thought I told you to address me as Mrs. Vaktis, maggot. **[I amended my question, adding Mrs. Vaktis onto the end. Apparently, however, I couldnt quite conceal my irritation.]** How dare you take that tone with me, young man. Oh, if Adams father were here, hed make you scream so loudly for that. He was sound that way, Adams old pa. Made every ninny he ran into squeal oh-so-sweetly. I get gooseflesh just remembering how sweet the shrieking and pleading was before he throttled em. **[It is impossible to overstate the amount of sadistic relish with which she said this. It was almost as frightening as Brutus at his most violent, and it was only thanks to my long years of training that I was able to not be intimidated. So I simply noted that she seemed to like Adams father better than the others, hoping to get a reaction.]** And why not? He made us discover a bit of bottle, did Adams pa. His *mother* was soft and weak, but Adams paoh, he knew how to raise a boy. With old fashioned discipline, oh yes. He liked me best, you know. *I* was the most helpful. *I* was the one who did the dirty business. **[I repeated the phrase dirty business in a questioning manner and she tried to reach up and slap me, only to have the handcuffs catch Adams hand.]** I told you I wouldnt squeal! Oh, if Adams pa could see me in fetters, hed have you and the coppers choking on your own spittle, you ruddy bastard. Just like he did with Adam! Just like he did with those **[She seemed to realize what she was saying and shut up quickly. Realizing that goading her might be my best approach to getting her to talk, I chuckled slightly in my throat. Her expression went livid.]** What are you sniggering at, you worthless sniveling mingebag? Oh, you wait til I get these irons off, Ill get you wrapped up in wire, bleeding and squealing like a stuck pig. And Ill laugh watching you bleed and squeal until Adams father comes along and puts you out of your misery  not that hell do it quickly, oh no, hell take his time. And Ill get to watch while he takes his time the way I always do. Ill get to lick the tears off your bloody cheeks. See if I dont! DONT YOU FUCKING ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME ILL CUT THOSE FUCKING THINGS-- **[I had indeed rolled my eyes, and as you can tell, this made her start shrieking. Before she got far into her sentence, I cut across her and said she talked a good game, but Brutus had already told me Adam hadnt killed anyone, so her threats were empty. She opened and closed her mouth in outrage before a very sly, nasty smile spread across it.]** Adam didnt kill anyone, he says. Well, maybe not directly, but hes the one who brought the little sluts into the basement, knowing full well what was down there, didnt he? Hes the one who tied them up with barbed wire, didnt he? Hes the one who was so pathetically attached to his mother he couldnt even run to get a weapon to save her, wasnt he? Its his fault those whores are dead. Its his fault that pathetic, pale imitation of his mummy is all he has, while the real ones six feet under, isnt it? Its his fault! All his fault! He might not have been the one who did the strangling, but he as good as did it, putting them down there! And hell do the same to you if they let us out of here! Oh, its almost worth getting that weak little shit exonerated just to think what his daddy will do to you. The only reason were here is because he was sloppy, and the only reason he was sloppy is because he wanted to get away from daddy. But Ill put an end to that, I will. Oh yes, I know how to clean up so no one will find anything. I learned, I did. I learned! And Ill learn him for trying to get away from me and daddy! **[Her voice rose with increasingly unhinged, maniacal triumph throughout this rant. But as horrible as her words were, I was thrilled. With this, shed told me exactly why Adam needed her, and in the process, how to coax the truth out of her. I switched tacks immediately and, instead of goading her further, I reached out and touched one of her flailing hands and told her it was alright: I believed she was as strong as she said. She froze at the touch of my hand and stared at me, wide-eyed, like a deer caught in the headlights. Her next words were hissed out in a hoarse whisper, but instead of her previous arrogance, now there was fear under the venom.]** Get your filthy hands off me! **[I complied instantly. Instinctively, she drew her hands back in a protective gesture, then seemed to realize what shed done and, with artificial casualness, placed them back on the table. Her eyes were narrowed down to slits of mistrust and poorly concealed vulnerability. I told her I was sure Adams father appreciated all shed done for him. She gave a harsh laugh, but the bravado behind it was obviously false.]** I should hope so. Though Im buggered if he shows it. Oh, Ive been cleaning up after him since Adam was old enough to dig a grave. Who scrubbed down the basement every time his father brought one of the whores home? Who is still cleaning up after he murders the ones Adam takes down there like a fool? Whowhowho made Adam bury him where he could keep doing his business? Me. Justjust me. Tom takes credit for scaring his daddy into no longer hurting him, but me? Im the reason he got such nice birthday parties. Because I made Adam useful to his daddy. I made him indispensable. Hes never going to get away from him, but doesnt he see? With me around, he wont have to. He wonthe wont ever have to. Oh, why does he keep trying to get away? **[Her voice had sunk to a hollow whisper by the time she finished saying this, and she was staring at the table. At this point, I told her, gently, that if Adam hadnt killed anyone, that was okay. She could say that and Id believe her. She looked up at me, trying desperately to look like the evil old hag she clearly was meant to be, but only managing to look even more lost and frail.]** He did, though, young man. He did. Or he *tried* to, and did it to the wrong person. He should have listened to me. I told him killing his father wouldnt fix anything. I told him it would just make everything worse. But Tom, Brutus, Phillip? They wouldnt listen. They thought they could get away. They didnt see the way I did: You can never get away from Adams daddy. Never. Even if they lock us behind bars for his murders, hell find a way back to us. Papa always does. Hes a force of nature. He cant be controlled. Cant be reasoned with. Cant be stopped. I have made peace with the fact that we gave him victims, starting with Adams mother. Ive mucked in and braved through the fact that we killed those people as much as he did. Why, oh why, cant Adam?! **[Her cruel, stiff-upper-lip demeanor had been replaced by genuinely agonized frustration as she finished this last question. I, for my part, was both unnerved and confused. She, like Brutus, seemed to be operating under the belief that Adams father was somehow still alive, even though I knew that to be impossible. I gently asked how Adams father could get to them if he was dead.]** How? How? Young man, how cant he get to us now that hes dead? He was trapped in his body before. Now he can travel with the wind, or with dreams, or with anything he pleases. **[Still confused, I asked if perhaps Adam was reenacting his fathers crime against his mother, believing his father was the one doing it. She shook her head, bitter despair clouding her features.]** Oh no, no, no. If only it were that easy. I thought it might be when we first met, you know. Thats why I told you Adam had committed the murders. I thought if he was locked up, perhaps it would all stop. **[Deciding to go straight for the point, I asked her if shed committed the murders.]** Bloody hell, no! I told you I only clean them up. I thought that would be enough to keep Father happy. It certainly worked better than the stupid plans the others came up with! Toms was the stupidest of all, thinking that blackmailing Father would work until we were old enough to kill him. That killing him would be the thing that made this business end. And I suppose I was just as foolish for thinking that being apprehended would make us safe. But it hasnt. The visions have come back. Papa is angry at Adam for being caught. Hes angry at him for not being there to keep him satisfied. He told us the only good thing to come out of this is that you freed him from the basement by digging him up. **[She suddenly winced and looked around, raw animal terror clouding her features.]** I have said too much. Stupid! Im supposed to be the smart one. Im his favorite. Im the one who punishes Adam when he makes a botch of things. Papa likes me. Papa needs me. What will he do to Adam now that Ive told you what he said? Oh no. Oh no no no no. **[I tried to reach out and comfort her again, but she curled up into her chair in a fetal position and began to rock.]** No no no no no no. Oh heavens, Ive gone and done it. Ive squealed. Adam was supposed to take the blame, and I squealed. And now you know Papas free. Oh God, help us. Without me, what will we do? I was the only one keeping us safe. The others all failed. The others all died. I told them, I did. I told them. I told them. I told them. III **[She was rocking desperately, and as she stared at me, Adams face was pale with her primal terror.]** Please, we dont know how to make him go away. Theres no way to believe it will be alright. No one to save us. No one to rescue usrescue usrescue **[The repetition of this last phrase jogged my memory one final time and, in a clumsy baritone, I began to sing the opening lines of Someones Waiting for You from The Rescuers: Be brave little one. Make a wish for each sad little tear. Hold your head up, though no one is near. Someones waiting for But before I could finish, Adam burst into tears, letting forth great gushing sobs  the sobs not of a grown man, but of a terrified child. A male child, I noted, with an American accent.]** I w-w-w-w-want my mommy! **[Now with genuine concern and kindness, I asked who I was talking to.]** I d-d-dunno. Im too small for a name. I dont feel like Im real. I feel like Im just a whisper. Like Im smoke. A wisp of smoke. **[I suggested that if thats how he felt, then maybe I should call him Wisp. He nodded, then looked up at me with his eyes still brimming with tears.]** W-w-w-why cant we find a mommy, mister? **[I said that I thought his mother was up there with him. He shook his head violently, shivering all over with undisguised terror.]** N-n-n-no. Thats just a c-c-c-copy. I want a real mommy. One who can get rid of daddy. One who can fight him off the way our first mommy was supposed to! But the mommies I find. The ones Phillip brings us. None of them c-c-c-can. *My spine broke out in gooseflesh as, with these words, the whole picture came together. The women in the basement were mousey brunettes, specifically selected to look like his mother. Theyd been kept captive with barbed wire before being strangled. An axe had been found at the scene. There was a CD player right there equipped with the two songs that had been playing while Adams mother was murdered. It was obvious in retrospect  Adam was trying to replay the night his real mother was murdered, and make it come out differently with surrogate, captive women playing the role of his mother. But this still left a gigantic, chilling question: if Adam wasnt playing the role of his father himself, with even Necata refusing to admit to the murders, then who was? And here, I have to once more revert to script format, because this particular exchange needs to be read in full.* Me: Wisp, your fathers dead. He shouldnt be able to hurt you. Wisp: He does, though! If the women fight too hard, he makes us sit in the s-s-s-swing and he pushes it. And itll never st-t-t-top until we find a mommy. Me: But why, Wisp? Your father isnt up there with you. He cant push you. He cant push anything. His bones are dust. Wisp: You havent seen what he does when our m-m-m-mommies wake up. Me: What does he do, Wisp? Tell me, what does he do? Wisp: He c-c-c-crawls out of the ground! Hes made of wind and he c-c-c-crawls out of the ground and he wrings their necks just like he did with our real m-m-m-mommy. Why wont he stop? Why wont he leave us alone? I just want him to stop. PLEASE MAKE HIM STOP. PLEASE! *PLEASE!* **PLEASE MAKE HIM STOP!** **[As this last sentence was shrieked to the air, Adams arms wrapped around his body and a familiar, soothing, female voice came from his lips. Asheera was out.]** Asheera: Shhh shhh shhh, itll be alright. Wisp: No it wont! Hes going to come get us again tonight! Hes never going to leave us alone! Asheera: Well find a way to get away from him, my poor boy. One day, I promise. You, me, Necata, Tom, Brutus, Phillip, and Adam will all get away from him. And then well be happy. Well go to Colorado for the spring. Like the song, remember? **[Alternating between gasped, mad sobs and poorly sung falsetto, Adam began to choke out the final lyrics to Judy Collinss Houses.]** *There are people with you/Living in your houses/People from your childhood/Remember how you were/You were always flying/Nightingale of Sorrow/Singing bird, with a rainbow on your wings.* **[As the final note died away, his body went still and rigid, and a familiar reedy, dry, upper crust British voice took over in the ensuing silence.]** Well, doctor? Youve had the tour. You know everything now. What is your verdict? Is Adam insane? Is he a criminal? **[I was too shellshocked to really think. I told Tom I didnt know. I couldnt know yet. He gave me a pitying expression.]** Then you understand my position. But whatever your decision, know this: We are beyond your help. This is not post-traumatic stress syndrome to be wiped away with a prescription pad. It is not, in my view, even insanity. And whether he is the product of psychosis or of malice borne like sickness beyond the grave, the fact is that the ghost of Adams father will never tire of his favorite victim. The best we can do is shield him, and hope  hope that some day, death or a miracle will bring us peace. In the absence of a miracle, I would be most grateful if you could move us one step closer to death. Failing that, though, I hope you will understand why I wish you to leave us alone. One recurring reminder of our own suffering is quite enough. **[Weakly, I nodded at this. Tom gave me a brittle smile, and then all at once, Adams posture relaxed, and the man Id met when this all began was once again staring across the table at me, a little bashfully.]** Wow. Uh, shit. Sorry I got so agitated in our first session, doc. You gonna ask me anymore questions? **[I couldnt find the words to answer him. So, in silence, I stood up and placed my notepad in my briefcase, before walking out of the cell, leaving Adam looking confused.]** *And so, now I must explain why, despite having every reason on earth to report that Adam is not merely unfit to stand trial, but not guilty by reason of mental illness, I cant quite bring myself to do this.* *To begin with, the legal definition of mental illness is being incapable of telling the difference between right and wrong. But Adam clearly knew these murders were wrong, and was ashamed to have been involved in them in any way. Even Necata, despite her burlesque of sadism, seems to have ultimately been an unwilling participant (albeit one who tried to put a brave face on it), whoever the culprit. And despite having more than enough evidence, I have real reason to doubt that Adam is that culprit, not just because of the previous sessions, where any homicidal intent had more than enough time to come through, but because of something else which I have purposefully avoided til now:* *For you see, I said earlier Adams victims were strangled. And they were. But the thing is, Ive seen the photos of the bodies as part of this case, and I can tell you right now that the bruises along those womens necks didnt look right for people who had been strangled. They were toowell, thin, is the best word for it, I suppose. Adams hands were fairly normal, but these bruises, at least in the pictures, looked like they mustve been caused by someone with emaciated fingers. And the police didnt find any fingerprints on their necks. Now, sure, its possible that Adam strangled them while wearing gloves, and the photos just didnt capture the size of the bruises. Thats the easy explanation. The rational explanation. And its the one Id have believed, if I were handling this case right out of medical school.* *But I am not the man I was when I graduated medical school. Ive crossed paths with unexplainable things  things that, as many of you already know, nearly drove me from the medical profession altogether. So while Id love to believe that perhaps Adams alters simply lied about their guilt in the murders, or that there was perhaps another personality mimicking his father who I simply failed to draw out, part of me suspects that despite his obvious insanity, Adam and his alters were telling me the truth: That his fathers ghost is still killing women the way he did when he was alive, and tormenting his poor, traumatized son into being an unwilling accomplice. And if thats true, and if his fathers ghost is as inescapable as Adam claims, then perhaps the kindest thing I can do is to declare him sane, fit for trial, and criminal, most likely sending him to a lethal injection in the process, rather than trapping him in a mental institution where he might be tormented by this specter for the rest of his life. Yes, declaring him sane wouldnt be true, but it would be mercy.* *So now you understand my predicament when I say that, because of an inescapable conflict between my professional duty as a doctor and my human duty to a suffering man:* *I had to psychologically evaluate a serial killer and I dont know what to report.* ---------- [Dr. Parker H-----](URL "

One of the other familys kids was sick with some sort of flu. A few nights in, I came down with it, and threw up everywhere, over and over. My father was so grossed out that his reaction made me cry. A lot. My mom had to kick him out of the room while she took care of me. His horrified expression imprinted in my mind forever, and taught me that there is something terribly wrong with being sick. Im 28 years old now, and I spent years of my life being absolutely paranoid about throwing up. Emetophobia controls so much of a persons existence: It makes you afraid to share someones drink, afraid to eat without washing your hands, afraid to get on rollercoasters, afraid to fly in planes, afraid to try new things. But at some point after decades with that phobia, you almost forget what causes you do regard all of those things with fear. The *possibility* of vomiting becomes subconscious; you dont even think about it anymore. You are just afraid of virtually everything that could cause it, and yet you have no immediate explanation for why you are afraid anymore. You just *are*. Although that possibility no longer lingers at the precipice of my conscious thoughts, the Impostor found it. He went straight to the core of my being and saw what terrifies me the most. He brought it out and used it against me. Repeating Nathans spiritual purge chant didnt just disable me there in the field; it was a reminder. A reminder of the creatures remarkable power to turn my own flawed humanity upon me. A reminder that it was planning to make me suffer in the most personal of ways. The Impostor was designing a personal Hell for me, and was nearly ready to drag me down into it. And so the world collapsed on me. I laid there on the ground, puking my guts out, knowing that my fiance was asleep and unguarded in bed while a terrible being strode toward her through the dark. It called out her name in every voice familiar to her. It said things that would make her happy. It begged for help and mimicked the cries of children. It capitalized on her innate motherly instincts, on her buried memories, and on the vulnerability of her unconscious state. And all I could do was stagger around and wait for the thrum of my death-gripped heart to subside. After a few moments, moonlight poured back into my vision, lighting the way out of the park. My pulse recovered from its frenzy, and the numbness of my limbs faded. The taste in my mouth, for once, didnt paralyze me. I tore through the streets to get back to my house. I had no plan. A lot of lights were on in the houses that lined my street. Many of my neighbors had likely heard me screaming. I hoped this meant that the Impostor would think twice about moving out in the open beneath their watchful gazes. The front door of my house was wide open, and it was pitch dark inside. I shouted for Faye but couldnt find her; the bed was empty and disheveled, as though shed jumped out of it (or had been dragged from it). A faint sound caught my attention  the sound of crying  and I struggled to determine where it came from. After looking in every room, I realized it was coming from outside. As I stepped out the sliding glass door in our bedroom that leads to the back yard, the sound grew louder, and mixed with shuffling noises. There is a walkway that runs along the side of our house and connects the back yard to the front, and there in the darkness was Faye. She was sleepwalking in the most unusual manner Id ever seen. She stood high up on the balls of her feet, as before, but was bent over at the waist. Her hair and arms dangled lifelessly toward the ground, and she shuffled toward the street where Id first seen the shadowy figure. Fayes neck was craned in such a way that I could see her face swaying just outside her left thigh. Two mournful eyes peered up at me from it, and her lips trembled as she cried. I couldnt tell if she was conscious or not. She mumbled something, but with her cries I couldnt make out what she was saying. I wrapped my arms around her waist and literally carried her inside; she clawed at me and landed a tigerpalm to my crotch. Just as we careened into the living room, a police car drifted by, its flashlights tracing all across the houses. I gently closed the door and peered out the window. It took me a moment to see it, but in the tree in our front yard, a dark form was crouched on the thickest branch. I yanked the curtains down over the blinds. Faye and I remained awake the rest of the night until dawn. We heard footsteps on our roof and in the attic, but no voices. On two occasions, someone knocked gently on the front door and once on the sliding glass door in the back, but we remained in the living room. We communicated only through pen and paper, and prevented each other from nodding off and dreaming about the scrapbook, or about Christopher. The last thing she wrote was, Got an idea. Explain tomorrow. ------------- At about 6AM, my cell phone buzzed on the table. All had been quiet for a few hours now, and Faye and I were almost done with the second Lord of the Rings movie. When I grabbed the phone, I was surprised to see that it was the ranger from Pikes Peak (his name is Greg, the same as Fayes dad, so I just refer to him by title in these posts). We hadnt spoken in a while. I immediately feared that his call was confirmation of the grim likelihood that Nathan was dead. He skipped all pleasantries and said, You better sit down. A nauseous fear crept up my throat when he said that. I shook my head and replied, Just tell me. Just tell me. Static began to form around my peripheral vision, which happens when Im feeling faint. If it grows and covers my entire field of view, I pass out. The ranger cleared his throat and tried to speak with composure, but I could hear on his voice that hed been crying. He said, We got a call from one of Nathans relatives. Said hed been missing a few days. Thought he went camping with his buddies, but none of them knew where he was. On my routine this morning, I dropped by Fayes folks cabin- There was a long silence, which told me everything I needed to know. But then, the ranger said more: We got cops everywhere up here now. Whole mountains shut down. Theyve still got Tiwe listed as a missing person, but now theyre out huntin for a body like they mean it this time. Lookin for a murderer too but- I interrupted him and demanded to know why. There was no way I could hide the frantic anxiety any longer. The ranger said, Somethins happened up there. Up at the cabin. They did somethin to him. I dont know how to tell you. He paused again, struggling to hold back tears. I crumpled to the floor while he spoke. The news singed every nerve in my body; pain radiated up from my stomach across every limb. My scalp tingled. The static grew in my vision. I need to know, I said. The ranger insisted that the details were unnecessary, but I begged him. What I am about to tell you is a paraphrasing of what the ranger said. Some of this info might change as the Denver coroner performs an official autopsy, but this is what we know: The bathroom window of the cabin had been forced open from the outside, but also the front door was unlocked and slightly open when the ranger arrived. The bedroom door was locked from the inside. It appeared that two people (one of them being Nathan) had been staying inside of the cabin for two or three nights. Nathans satellite phone was found inside, my number being the last one dialed. It was unclear whether Nathan was present at the cabin when we last spoke (when he promised he *wouldnt* go to the cabin). There was a buck knife jammed into one of the walls, and many unusual symbols and words had been carved all over the hallway leading from the living room to the bedroom. There were words in Hopi, the language Nathans people speak, and Zuni, a language they do not. The words havent yet been translated. There was a carving of a large dreamcatcher on the outside of the bedroom door, and non-lethal amounts of blood spattered on the carpet and lower wall opposite of said door. On the inside of the bedroom door, there were small marks everywhere, as though someone had been pounding very hard on it. The ranger and sheriff speculated that Nathan sat on the floor in the hallway for several hours or perhaps an entire day. Someone was in the bedroom, but the door remained locked. Its possible that they had a long conversation. At no point was the electricity or heat functioning in the cabin, because it had been shut off after I was rescued on my second visit. This meant that however long Nathan stayed, he remained in the dark in freezing weather each night. Two pairs of tracks were found leaving the cabin  one from the bedroom window, the other from the front door  heading into the forest out back. The tracks joined together, indicating that the two people walked side-by-side into the woods. Nathans body was found by the rangers dogs approximately a quarter mile in, buried upside-down with his legs erupting from the soil at the knee. Upon exhumation it was discovered that Nathans face and scalp had been flayed or mutilated. There were deep lacerations in his back that appeared to be from claws, and carvings on his arms that looked self-inflicted. The unofficial cause of death, however, was suffocation; he had been buried alive. Oh, and everything in the cellar was gone. It was completely empty. ----------------------------- Ive never come so close to ending my own life. The guilt and horror I felt at hearing the rangers words are still ineffable, so I wont bother trying to document them. Somehow I convinced myself that there would be a time for grieving in the future, and even for acts of penance, but right now I needed to focus on Faye. After all, she might end up just like Nathan and Tiwe if we didnt figure out what to do. A few days passed with no strange activity beyond a voice here and there. I was hesitant to let Faye sleep, for fear that she would dream of her little brother and give the Impostor what it sought. But she explained to me her idea  a plan to get rid of the creature once and for all  and for the first time in months, I actually felt a glimmer of hope. We kept drinking Nathans tea after concluding that it was doing no discernable harm, and Faye spent the days furiously drawing, journaling, and texting with her mom and sister. I called Angela, the Shoshone woman, and requested that she come visit us with her hypnotist friend to speak with Faye again, and to bless our new house. I also made as large a donation I could afford to Tiwe and Nathans community to help cover the cost of their funeral ceremonies. In my spare time in the evenings, I wrote a letter for both of them, and I intend to read it at their place of burial someday. ---------------------- Each night, Faye went to bed crying. She had definitely entered some kind of mourning process, long-delayed by years of denial, and I now bore witness to the lifelong impact of her loss. Never have I seen a human in so much pain. But, Faye assured me that she would be alright, and that I should have faith in her. I silently obliged, because I trust her more than anyone in the world. She knows herself, and I put my faith in that. One night I snuck into the bedroom and retrieved Fayes drawings. She had produced several pictures of her own nightmares, of memories from her childhood, and of a young man that looked like her. I believe he is Christopher, or at least how Faye imagines he might look, had he survived and grown up. She wrote all kinds of things around the drawings  mostly detailed descriptions of the images, sometimes stories from when she was young  and wrote her brothers name dozens of times. She even drew a family portrait that included herself at age 5 holding a smiling baby. On the fifth night after the incident in the park, Angela and her hypnotist friend arrived. (As Ive mentioned before, I havent given the hypnotists name because I just dont want you to have to keep track of too many people.) Faye informed our guests of what she believed we could do to get rid of the entity for good. I went outside and set the drawings under the tree in our front yard, where Id last seen the shadowy figure. Then we got Faye comfortable and set her up on the couch. Fortunately for us, Faye has the remarkable ability of being able to fall asleep any time, any place, so all we had to do was dim the lights in the house. I made a pasta dish for everyone and within a half hour, she was out cold. This time, she didnt drink Nathans tea. For a long time, Angela, the hypnotist, and I sat at the kitchen table over coffee and ice cream. We kept our voices low and discussed all of the recent events related to the cabin, waiting for the Impostor to show up. The hypnotist was especially interested in the dreamcatchers, and wanted to know who made them. I told her I didnt have any idea, and that at first I thought the entity itself created them. After speaking with you NoSleepers (you are more insightful than I am), I started to believe that someone had summoned or was controlling the entity with the original dreamcatcher. Then, when I broke it, I realized it was protecting me. She said, Do you think its possible one of her family members created it? Or the ranger? Do you trust him? Many people have speculated that Tiwe and Nathan were not honest with me, or not who they said they were. But I honestly hadnt considered that the ranger himself could be behind all this. I conceded that it was possible. Faye spoke a few times in her sleep. She laughed and said things like, Do you need help with that? and What the hell are you doing? After she said the name of her boss, I realized she was dreaming about work. We waited until about midnight, but by then no activity had occurred and no sounds were coming from outside. Angela woke Faye up and said, We need to take a more direct approach. The two women propped Faye up hospital bed-style and began to hum a beautiful song. Angela intermittently spoke in her native tongue and traced lines with her finger across Fayes forehead; the hypnotist occasionally raised her hands in the air and then touched Fayes shoulders. After several minutes, my fiance went limp. Her head slumped back on the couch and her arm dangled to the floor. Finally, she opened her eyes, which were now rolled back in her head, and she began breathing rhythmically. The hypnotist said, Who are you? She replied simply, Faye. Are you alone? I am with you. Who else is here? Angela. Felix. Erica (her boss). The hypnotist corrected Faye. She said, Erica isnt here. Its just us four. Faye looked puzzled for a moment, then said, Okay. Angela joined the conversation and touched Fayes arm. She asked, The one who follows you. The one who calls out in the night. Where is he now? Is he here? Fayes head craned from side to side like she was emptying water from her ears, and then replied, No. Where is he? Faye sat motionless for what felt like a whole minute, then finally said, Across the dark. The hypnotist then said, Faye  can you call out to him? Can you ask him to come here? She remained silent. The hypnotist asked again. Faye said forcefully, No. Angela said, Honey, we cant get rid of him unless you bring him here. Faye began to whimper. Her mouth trembled, and then she uttered in the voice of a small child, Please no. Goosebumps rippled across my arms as I sat at the table watching. Angela implored, and Faye began to cry. You have to call out to him, the hypnotist repeated. Tell him where you are. Faye slowly rocked her head back and forth and tried to reach up into the air to protect herself, but the weight of her hypnotic state kept her in place. Suddenly, her body went stiff and her eyes rolled forward. They landed squarely on me, then looked over my shoulder and focused on something a thousand miles behind me. Her mouth opened slightly, and a gurgling sound came up from her throat. She said in a wet and masculine voice, *Wachu...Wachu...* Faye leaped off the couch and shuddered as though she were trying to throw something off her back. Her body stayed rigid, and she turned and faced away from us. Every joint in her limbs popped with sickening cracks. She bent her head back and stared up at the place where the ceiling met the wall in front of her, then tightly balled her fists. She said again, *Wachu, wachu, wachu.* The hypnotist and Angela were standing now, gathering around Faye to prevent her from hurting herself or dashing off into the night. I played safety a few feet away, trying to be ready for anything. The hypnotist said, Faye, tell us where he is. She breathed hard through gritted teeth and then forced out the word *Bedroom.* We all turned and looked behind us, down the dark hall. The hypnotist wrapped her hand around Fayes forehead from behind and started whispering in her ear. I turned and quietly moved down the hall toward the bedroom. As I approached it, I could hear the sliding glass door to the yard open. When I stepped into our bedroom, a cold breeze was blowing into it. The glass door on the opposite wall was wide open. I looked around to make sure I wasnt about to get ambushed, and then approached the door. The backyard light has a motion sensor that automatically activates when something moves. It was off, and the yard was dark. However, at the far end of the yard, I could make out the shape of a man. The same figure Id seen a week earlier, the one Id made the dire mistake of chasing after. This time the figure was even larger than before; it appeared to stand at roughly seven feet tall. It faced away as always, and its head was cocked toward the moon. Its hands lay pressed against its sides, fists balled, tightly clutching many pieces of paper. Fayes drawings. It growled *Wole myWole my* I slid the door shut as fast as I could and locked it, then raced back to the living room. Faye was now sitting on the couch, head still craned up toward the ceiling, with Angela and the hypnotist speaking to her. They implored her to wake up, but it seemed as though she was struggling to return. Outside, a voice howled. It sounded like a little girl crying out for her mother. Another voice erupted, Lauras, shouting Greg, we need to take her to a hospital! Faye began to convulse, so the two women clutched her tightly and begged her to wake up. An infant began to shriek in the yard, and then it slowly moved down the side of the house to the front door. There was a loud, slow knock, followed by more voices. The knock repeated over and over, and Beccas voice called out from behind the door, Faye? Where are you? Help me, please help. At last, Faye sucked in a huge breath and leaned back on the couch. Her head returned to a normal position and she stood up, frantically trying to collect herself. The pounding on the door grew louder, and the voices began to overlap, as though several people were standing in front of our house crying out in the night. She said breathlessly, Its here, its here, and looked at me. In Fayes eyes I saw uncertainty and terror, mirrors of my own state. But then, a look of conviction fell over her face. The fear seemed to evaporate right off it. A man began to cry just outside the door. It said in Gregs voice, He was my child too, Laura. My son. Did you think a weekend in the goddamn mountains would make me forget? Faye gasped. His words were so perfectly clear that I nearly believed he was on the other side of the door. Dont you fucking dare! Lauras voice shouted. Just let her forget. Let her forget. This doesnt have to be her burden too. Faye burst into tears and wobbled to the door. She rested her face against it and reached for the knob. The shrieks of a baby echoed through the house, followed by a little girl saying, Whats your name? I cant see you. Its Faye. *Faye.* I watched my fiance collapse to the floor in despair. Angela and the hypnotist took a step forward, but Faye put her hand in the air to halt them. She sat on the ground, leaned her back against the door, and brushed the strawberry locks out of her face. The door knocked again. My own voice followed it, saying, May Icome in? Its freezing out here. Another storms coming tonight. I have to tell you something, Faye said, gently knocking on the door. I know what you really want. The voices fell silent all at once, and only an uneven breathing remained. I had a baby brother, she said. His name was Christopher. He was number five. The breathing cut out. Faye knocked on the door again. After a minute, something knocked back. I remember now, she continued. I couldnt remember for years. Or I guess I didnt want to. Its easier for me to just pretend things never happened. Some kids make things exist. Friends, monsters, places. But I made Christopher not exist. That way I didnt have to lose him. His death was just make-believe. A long, slow scratching noise resounded through the door. The thing outside was dragging a claw across the wood, like it was drawing a picture. Faye put her palm on the door, feeling the weak vibrations of the scratching. For a long time, the number was all I could remember. I knew it meant something more, but every time I thought about it, my whole body would hurt. Id feel sick. And then Id just fall asleep. Or, if I was dreaming, Id just wake up. I always knew it meant something more. The door knob rattled and a wet, clunking sound emitted from it. The Impostor was gnawing on it from the other side. The clatter of a hundred jagged teeth rose in vile symphony across our living room. He was stillborn. Do you know what that is? He died inside my mom. All this time Ive avoided burying Christopher. But youve finally helped me realize why its time I laid him to rest. Faye, come hold him, Beccas voice called out. I dont get it. He falls asleep so fast when youve got him. You want her to be your new mommy, Caleb? The scratching noises persisted. Faye wiped tears out of her eyes and took a deep breath. Now you know everything. I wanted you to know. A chorus of voices rang out in the night. An infant screamed, a toddler cried, Greg and Laura and Becca and Tiwe and Nathan and the ranger all spoke at once. Decades of pain washed through the door; words of anguish and sorrowful cries drowned out all other sounds in the room. Angela, the hypnotist and I exchanged terrified glances, but Faye remained motionless at the door, staring up into my eyes. She didnt blink. The knocking on the door swelled to violent pounding. The entity used every possible trick it could. It tried to hit her right where the wounds were fresh, and tried to tear open the oldest scars. But Faye never budged. She held her ground emotionally, and never took her eyes off me. They were filled with a knowing calm, as if to say, Enough. When the Impostor got no response, it stomped from the front door to the nearby window. It towered over us and blocked out the moonlight that lit up the drapes. A huge shadow fell across Faye as she sat there unmoved. *Wole my, wole my,* it growled. Fayes lips quivered, but she said nothing. A titanic scream erupted from the creature, and it slapped the glass with an open hand. The sounds shook our home and struck a lightning bolt of terror in the pit of my stomach, but Faye did not react. She didnt even flinch. Then, the entity said something I did not expect. Instead of assuming the voice of someone we knew, it spoke in several I did not recognize. It spoke only one labored sentence, but each word was uttered with a different tongue: *Iwalkeda thousandyearsacrossthe darkto find you* A small part of me wanted to run away screaming, but I was so afraid my legs wouldnt even move. The finality, the *longing* of what it said was incomprehensibly dreary. I totally lost my nerve. That moment, another thing even less expected happened. The shadow receded from the window, coloring Fayes face silver with the dim kiss of moonlight. Sullen footsteps lurched across our yard and vanished into the backdrop of cricket songs. After a while, we were alone. All three of us looked down at Faye; a relieved smile spread across her face. She wasnt crying anymore. --------------------------------------- Its been several days since the Impostor left. It returned once, only to sing the morose lullaby *sol me aaa dooo, Im a naked soul me aaaa dooo.* Faye slept through it entirely. I didnt mention it to her. My fiance has been sleeping well since that night. She hasnt talked at all, and certainly hasnt sleepwalked. In fact, she hasnt even really been tossing and turning like she normally does. Its as if a dreadful weight was lifted from her shoulders. During the days she cries, she cuddles with me and talks about her childhood, she Skypes with her mom and sister. They cry too. I have shed many tears with her, and for her loss, but I understand now what she did. Faye never dreamed of Christopher, only of the number 5. As a child, she repressed the memory and pain of his death and thus forgot about him; that number became the lockbox in which he was hidden. It was the coffin she buried him in. And she buried him so deep within herself she couldnt even remember him in her nightmares. That is why the entity never fully understood what she was hiding. And that is why it never gained full access to her. Fayes lifelong sleep disturbances were her minds attempts at keeping that welling pain repressed, but by talking in her sleep, she invited dark attention to herself: if you speak long enough into the void, someone is bound to start listening. Someone, or something, heard Fayes pain and saw it as a weakness. It saw those cracks in her heart as a passage into her soul, and so it chose her. The Impostor became transfixed with my fiance not because she was an easy target, but because she was a monolithic puzzle-box of torment. A challenge. A worthy opponent. I remarked early on in these stories that one of the things I love most about Faye is her intelligence. She has an artistic creativity that allows her to see things in ways I do not. She realized that the Impostor knew it could tug on her puppet strings by delving into the darkest parts of her mind. In all those hidden places, there were weapons to use against her. To weaken her. To wear her down. But instead of burying her secrets deeper, she unearthed them, and brought them into the light. By moving Christopher and the number that represented him from her subconscious into her waking thoughts, Faye unleashed a tidal wave of forgotten pain upon herself  but also, she also took away the Impostors power over her. She cut off her own puppet strings, and now there was nothing left for the creature to grab onto. And so it left. Ive also shed tears for my dear friends, Tiwe and Nathan. Perhaps I can never convey the warmth of their personalities and the sincerity of their hearts. But I trusted them entirely, and do not believe they had anything to do with the foul thing that stalked my fiance for all these years. Their deaths are mortal wounds on my heart, and I will always carry the agony of their loss. I want it to hurt, as a permanent reminder. They have given so much to me and asked nothing in return, only that I preserve the goodness of their people in my memory. By writing about their altruism and sacrifices, I am trying to fulfill that promise. May their spirits live on in the sacred land they protected. We may never know for sure who built the dreamcatcher at the cabin, or the one in the trees outside my old home. Right now I believe that they were built by different people who live on Pikes Peak. Some of them want to protect fools like me who venture to that mountain without understanding its significance to the Indians living there. Others, perhaps, wish to harm them. Maybe even Angela herself built one for us; maybe you cant tell the person theyre designed to protect or else it doesnt work. Fayes ring has also been the topic of heated debate: whether or not it is cursed, what should be done with it, etc. For now, my fiance does not wish to part with it, but she might consider it if anything happens again. It is still a precious family heirloom and the symbol of my devotion, whatever taint it may carry. I guess what I mean is, we still dont have all the answers, and the unfortunate thing is that we may never. The true nature of the entity and a full explanation of what happened to us might remain a mystery. But in time, I believe I will come to understand more about this terrible ordeal. We plan to head back to Colorado in a few weeks to spend time with Fayes parents, to pay our deepest respects to Tiwe and Nathans community, and to witness the bulldozing of the cabin. Whatever secrets it still hides, let them be buried deep beneath the rubble and the snows of decades to come. ------------------ Thank you, NoSleep. [fb](URL "

An organismic state characterized by the capacity for metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction 2. The period between birth and death I died 3 years ago. I was pronounced dead at 1643 hours on June 2 , 2013. I always loved to be on my boat, even in the winter, I knew the added risks of going out in the water alone, but I always thought I took all the necessary precautions. I never went out at night, I always stayed in areas with other boats close by, I always wore a life jacket, and kept plenty of essential emergency supplies stocked on the boat. But you can never be completely prepared for the unpredictable. Sometimes even the most experienced and attentive person can have a moment of carelessness. I had taken off my life jacket to readjust one of my many layers of shirts when I slipped on a wet patch on deck. I hit my head on something on the way down. I dont remember what. The water was 41F. As soon as my skin made contact with the water it felt like a million shards of glass had collided with every square inch of my existence. The shock caused an involuntarily gasp that filled my lungs with water. I tried to swim to the surface but I couldnt find out which way was up. I frantically swam in every direction, I knew I couldnt be that deep, it shouldnt be this hard to find the surface, but it felt like a million hands were pulling me down deeper. I was so disoriented but I kept swimming, desperate for air. Everything started to get dark. I died in a moment of carelessness. It sounds clich, but I remember when the darkness consumed my physical body and the frigid water filled my lungs, I began slipping out of myself; piece by piece as my body started shutting down my vision went from utter darkness to complete clarity. I was confused at first, but I realized I was dead when I saw my limp, empty body floating face down in the water, my lips and fingers were already blue tinged. An elderly fisherman on a near-by boat saw me fall in, he quickly jumped into action and pulled my lifeless body from the water. Its almost unbelievable that he was there at that exact moment. He did everything he could to revive me, he made his best attempts at CPR while he waited for emergency response, but he had already exhausted himself getting me onto his boat. By the time help got there I had been dead for at least 20 minutes. The response team found no signs of life, no detectable pulses, no respirations, body temperature of 82f, incompatible with life, so they called it, Time of death 1643 hours, but the elderly man pushed the responders aside, and continued CPR, everyone around him thought it was futile, they told him Sir, you have to let it go, hes gone But their words only fueled his desperate beating on my chest; I had never met him before, he didnt even know my name, but he was absolutely hell bent on saving me. I had been watching everything since the old man fished me out from my watery grave. I watched it all happen. As I knelt next to the old fisherman I watched as the tears ran down his wrinkled face and puddled onto what was left of me, I watched him relentlessly trying to push the death out of my spiritless chest, only pausing to force a breath of life into my cold dead mouth. Everyone around us kept urging him to stop, as humanely as possible, they repeatedly told him it was hopeless, that he needed to let me go. I started to realize I agreed with them, I was gone, all I could feel was the cold water that had previously engulfed me, I wanted to be able to let go of the cold body I once inhabited. I was ready to leave my uninhabited corpse behind, ready to move on to an unknown destination. The weightless entity I had accepted as my new existence stood up and turned to walk away from my deceased shell. But before I could leave I was pulled back by the sudden sound of water gushing out from my cadaver. As the death inducing, numbing liquid evacuated my lungs, I was forced back into my dead body. Shock caused another involuntary gasp, but this time my lungs filled with oxygen. Trillions of life sustaining atoms reinflated my chest. But I was not alive. **Life Support:** *(n.)* equipment, material, and treatment needed to keep a seriously ill or injured patient alive I was trapped inside my carcass when they brought me to the hospital. They followed protocol and injected me with the chemicals required to induce a comatose state. I felt the needles enter my lifeless skin. I thought Id finally be able to rest, as I waited for sleep to finally take over me I listened to the beeping monitors, and the rhythmic sounds of the ventilator that were the soundtrack to my helpless soul. A few seconds passed, and the coldness I felt in my veins still lingering from being immersed into an ocean of oblivion was immediately replaced with a sensation of decomposition setting into my bones, I could feel a slow irreversible erosion in every cell. Instead of the rest I longed for, I was met with an even deeper suppression into my purgatorial prison. I fought so hard to get out, I could already feel my flesh encasement wasting away. My essence could feel everything the doctors did, not in the way I would have felt if I was fully attached to my body. Instead my soul felt every injection, every procedure, every inquisitive prying eye that studied the coffin of bare flesh that I couldnt pry myself from. I felt the vulnerability and embarrassment for the emaciated naked body I was attached to, as it was hurriedly washed twice a week, occasionally repositioned with painful and careless turning and tossing. I felt the shame of motionlessly laying in excrement for hours on end. **Futile** *(adj)* 1.incapable of producing any result; ineffective; useless; not successful I eventually gave up the fight to escape myself. I resigned to endure every second, of every minute, of every hour, of every day, of every week, that I spent listening to those machines mocking any concept of life I had ever understood before I stopped living at 1643 hours on June 1, 2013 . I prayed the doctors werent half as determined as the old fisherman, I prayed theyd let me go. Every day I was poked, prodded, and studied as a curiosity by various health care workers. I heard every word spoken over my vegetated sack of flesh and organs, their statements echoed in my consciousness, over and over, A waste of resources, hes just a skeleton, he wont make it another week Hes brain dead, whats the point Do they really think its worth it? Hell never come back. Hes been dead and gone for over a year, these machines are a futile attempt to play God. Why are they even keeping him alive? Medical bills must be through the roof. Id wouldve pulled the plug a long time ago Their words would have hurt most people, but I looked forward to their honest remarks. They kept me in touch with reality, reminding me of the inconsequentiality of the machine and medicinally preserved side show that I had become. I hoped against hope that they were right, that I wouldnt make it much longer. **Miracle** *(n)* 1: an extraordinary event manifesting divine intervention in human affairs 2: an extremely outstanding or unusual event, thing, or accomplishment My family decided to pull the plug on my machines after 54 weeks of being on life support. After over a year of me being a worthless sack of shit. I was so happy Id finally be able leave. I could finally let go. Nobody cried as they turned off the machines, removed the ventilator, pulled out my IVs and feeding tubes. I dont blame them for not being sad. If I could, I would have been smiling from ear to ear. It was an uncomfortable process, but the concept of finally being able to rest was well worth the discomfort. They turned off all the machines, and the nightmare Id been living since I had died over a year ago, turned into an even more horrific reality. I was still breathing, my heart continued beating at a regular rate. No machines. No tubes. No IVs. No life supporting therapies. And yet nothing changed. A Medical Miracle for anyone else. I know I should have been thanking God for a second chance. But every inch of my being resents each breath I continue to take. Because I am dead. I should not be here. My heart breaks for the millions of people who die on a regular basis who deserved to live out the rest of their lives but never had the chance. Someone made a horrible mistake when I was brought back instead. By any definition Im a medical miracle; not only did I came back from being dead for over 20 minutes, but I also never lost the mental functions I had before dying. Since I was taken off life support Ive done rigorous physical therapy 5 days a week for almost 2 years now. But I couldnt build any muscle strength no matter how hard I tried. Regaining my ability to communicate took a few months. But at this point, Im essentially at normal cognitive function levels. But I can still feel my body rotting away. My hair turned completely gray and I started balding at the age of 22, so I had it shaved it off. I was young when I died in that freezing water. The epitome of health. But now Im quite sure I am the living dead. I always find bugs crawling on me. Mostly maggots and flies. Sometimes under my skin or crawling out from my eyes, ears, mouth, and other orifices My finger nails and toenails have been peeling off. Huge amounts of my skin have sloughed off, sometimes down to the bone, I cover them with bandages, even though they dont bleed. Its odd, I dont bleed at all, but sometimes brown sludge will drip from my pores and orifices. I havent eaten anything to satiate this strange hunger Ive had since before I died, Im afraid of were my appetite will lead. That old fisherman was found dead under a bridge two days after saving me, with medium, even human, sized bite marks in his neck, inner thighs and abdomen. Investigators found the words You cant steal him from us painted in the fishermans blood on a piece of drift wood nearby. "
253,vulnerability,nosleep,I used to get letters from my nightmares (part 8/conclusion),198,4gdvpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4gdvpw/i_used_to_get_letters_from_my_nightmares_part/,2016-04-26 01:42:45,"Part 1: URL Part 2: URL Part 3: URL Part 4: URL Part 5: URL Part 6: URL Part 7: URL Before I go any further, I do have to apologize for the length of this particular installment. You see, Ive been putting off this part of the story for a while, and now that Ive gotten to it, I felt I just couldnt let myself break it up any further, or Id never bring myself to finish it. Hope you all understand. Now, to finish my story. As Ive alluded so far, I grew up very well-to-do. The complaints of my relatives about draftiness in my old childhood home notwithstanding, the fact is that today, barely anyone short of a movie star or financial CEO would be able to afford the house itself, even on less expansive property than its manor-esque grounds. I dont bring this up to brag, but rather to drive home that even to someone as used to affluence as I was, Barnett Reynoldss compound was stunning enough to make me audibly gasp from the back seat of the sleek, chauffeured black Bentley that had met me at the airport when I arrived for my meeting with Mr. Reynolds. What was more, after getting over my shock at the sheer size of the house, which looked more like someone had built several castles side by side than like a simple home, it struck me immediately why Barnett Reynolds had become so famous as an architect. In fact, I was even able to notice a few of the similarities between my childhood home and the palatial colossus. Im not expert on architecture, so detailing the finer points of Reynolds art is a bit beyond me. However, what I will say is that due to some very counterintuitive structural elements and manipulation of light, Reynolds was able to transform what should, in both cases, have seemed imposing and austere Gothic monstrosities into seeming nothing less than homey. In the case of Reynolds own home, this was particularly impressive, given its size and the fact that it seemed to be made up almost entirely of spires and sharp edges, and possessed very few windows. However, due to the color of the stone Reynolds used, to say nothing of the soft lights he used to illuminate the miles-long driveway and the house itself, I simply couldnt avoid feeling like I was approaching something out of a fairy tale. As soon as the Bentley stopped, my door was opened by an absurdly stiff-necked valet, who guided me through the main doors of Reynolds titanic house. Unfortunately, passing out of sight of the houses towering exterior did little to dispel my wonder, as the interior was, if anything, even more magnificent. I wont belabor you with details, except to say that if you were to imagine every feature a house could have that would make its owner feel entirely at ease, while also utterly empowered, you should probably imagine something half as grand as what Barnett Reynolds had so meticulously constructed for himself. Indeed, once I stopped gawking at the surroundings and let my brain process what I was seeing, I found that I could get something of an impression of Reynolds himself. This was clearly a house designed by a man with a powerful need to remind his guests  and most likely himself  of what sort of opulence and genius it would take to create it. In fact, thinking back on Reynolds past as a bullied, emotionally fragile orphan, I felt I immediately understood why Reynolds built his homes both so large and so hospitable. This was less a house than a glittering, perfect, and fiercely fortified womb, designed to keep all unpleasantness at the greatest remove possible. Small wonder, then, that Reynolds secretaries were themselves so fierce about screening his would-be visitors. I must have said something very important to be permitted entry. The valet leading me pulled up sharply before a pair of warm, cherrywood double doors, which he thrust open. The Ratcliffe study, he said by way of explanation. Mr. Reynolds will be down to meet you shortly. Please wait here. Then, he ushered me in and shut the doors behind me. I turned round, expecting to see a room furnished much like the rest of the house, and found myself catching my breath for the third time in surprise. The fact that this room, of all the others, was called The Ratcliffe Study shouldve been a tip-off to what it really was: a holding tank for people Barnett Reynolds wouldve preferred to keep out of his sanctuary. Like the rest of the house, the room was well-furnished, and sumptuously laid out, with walls done in shining oxblood paint that reflected light prettily from a roaring fireplace. Nevertheless, even if you were a complete architectural neophyte, the angles at which the walls met the ceiling wouldve struck you as odd at the very least, and the paint on the walls wouldve seemed just a little too reflective, and a little too dark. It was like walking into a very large, misshapen cell that had been painted in blood. Even the obviously expensive black leather armchairs seemed more like voids sucking color from the room than like anything comfortable. Despite the room being a very comfortable temperature, I admit I involuntarily shuddered when sitting down. Even as the leather cradled my slight form, it still felt as if the rooms dcor was screaming at me to leave. Trying to distract myself, I started busying myself with the tea tray that had been set in the midst of the chairs. I was halfway through smearing some clotted cream on a scone when the door to the study boomed open and a quavery tenor voice sounded angrily from it. What do you want? Barnett Reynolds stood framed in the doorway. Even with the years of aging, fine clothes, and immaculately coiffed grey hair and moustache, he was unmistakable as the same suspicious-eyed boy who Id seen in Clover Wells old photos. But where the suspicion in that photo had been dulled by the age of the photograph, in person it was like staring into a laser beam of hostility. Even so, despite his greater age and obvious power over the situation, even I couldnt help noticing the extent to which Reynolds hostility couldnt mask his own vulnerability. It was like watching a rabbit play at being a tiger, and it made me feel at once sorry for whatever I had done to upset him. Putting on my most comforting smile, I stood up. Mr. Reynolds, hi, my name is Emma Sutton, I said. Its such a pleasure What. Do. You. Want. Reynolds bit the end off every word, his voice sounding more like a poorly tuned trumpet the higher it rose. I started again. As I told your Secretary Im not an idiot, Miss Sutton! that nasal squeak was almost desperate with rage now. And I dont think youre an idiot either. You have harassed my home with questions about the most painful time in my life, first with vague insinuations about Barney, and then by actually naming the creature himself. You know something, and I would wager you want something! You are a pest, Miss Sutton, and since I cant get rid of you by ignoring you, and dont want the trouble of bringing down the police, I want to know just what it is that you want that will make you go away! The spluttering, half-panicked delivery of this rant was all that made me capable of not feeling overly frightened myself. I could sense that however much he wanted to intimidate me, the truth was that he was far more frightened of me  a slight college-aged girl -- than I was of him. The man was a nervous wreck, and I could see how hed been such an easy target for a bully as a child. Putting as much calm and soothing kindness into my voice, as I could, I replied to him frankly. Mr. Reynolds, I promise you, I dont want to hurt you or take anything from you. Then why are you here?! the man erupted. What do you think you know?! II actually am more curious about what you know, Mr. Reynolds, I said. The reply seemed to shock him into silence just long enough that I pressed on. Im not here because I want to threaten your safety. I promise. Im here because I need information about Barnaby Ratcliffe. For my safety. His eyes widened and he stared at me even harder, this time with more bewilderment than hostility. Who are you? he asked. And whats your safety got to do with it? Barney Ratcliffe cant hurt you, and Ive never heard of you before now. Are you some sort of long-lost family of his? No, not family, I said. As to how my safetys involved, I dont think youd believe me if I told you. But trust me that nothing we say to each other here matters to me beyond assuring my safety. Im not here to blackmail you, or to hurt you, or Try me. I blinked. Excuse me? You say I wouldnt believe you if you told me why Barnabys involved with your safety, said Reynolds, still sounding agitated, though no longer nearly as frantic or angry as he had just a moment ago. Try me. Youre already a strange young woman who Ive never heard of badgering me about something I would rather forget and swearing its not for nefarious purposes. Matters cant possibly be more confusing than that. Try me. I hesitated for a moment, and he gave an exasperated noise. At this rate, even if you are insane, Id sooner find out, and then tell you whatever will quiet your delusion and make you leave me alone. I sighed. Alright, I said. If thats the way you feel, then Ill say it. I used to meet Barney Ratcliffe in my dreams every night as a girl. I think he and I were sharing dreams, and I think What sort of dreams? asked Reynolds, eyebrows raised sharply. I was taken aback. This wasnt at all the question Id expected. Nevertheless, I answered him. Nightmares, I said. Horrible, grisly, awful nightmares that I still cant get out of my head. And in those nightmares, I always saw a little boy named Barney getting hurt by something I barely can stand to think about. At first I thought he might be you, because the house I grew up in is one that you used to own. Thats why I called asking about Barney. Reynolds entire aspect changed. In an instant, he marched through the door to the chair opposite me and perched himself on it like a bird. He was no longer looking at me with hostility, but instead with an uneasy mixture of genuine human concern and all-encompassing dread. Which house was it? he asked me in a low voice. If you dont want me to believe you are insane, then it is very important that you tell me. Which house? I gazed steadily into his eyes. I think you know which one, I said softly. The one you built for yourself in the 40s. The one you rebuilt from the skeleton of the Crenchley Parish Charity School. And I think you know which room I had, because I think its the same one Barnaby Ratcliffe had when you lived there. The color had drained completely from Barnett Reynolds face, as had the anger and mistrust. He now regarded me with that same sense of dread, but this time there was real pity, even compassion in his gaze. He reached out and awkwardly patted me on the arm. I apologize, Miss Sutton, he said. When I was more well-established in fame and wealth, many people once tried to come after me for money, claiming they know something about Crenchley Parish. I paid them all to get them to go away, and I assumed you were one of the same. But your predicament He shuddered. Miss Sutton, I will tell you all you need to know, but first, you must tell me two more things. Firstly, for the love of God, please tell me you no longer sleep alone in that house, and certainly not alone in that room. I nodded. Ive shared a room with my sister since I worked out that that made the dreams stop. I havent slept in my old room since. Good. Oh, very good. He exhaled with palpable relief. And when you did sleep inthat room, did you ever bring anything in that you kept by your bed? Anything at all? A stuffed animal, perhaps, or A dream journal, I said. My parents bought it for me, and it was what helped me figure out that leaving the room might help my nightmares. But you havent written in it since? No. Reynolds exhaled and sat back in his chair. Thank God, he said. In that case, Miss Sutton, your greatest danger is already past, I believe. And make no mistake  I do not think you are insane. In fact, I believe you perhaps alone among mankind will understand why I have been entirely unable to forget that part of my life. Ask your questions. I will tell you truthfully  more truthfully than I have told a living soul since. I smiled at him and squeezed his arm. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds, I said. To begin with, why did you bother to move the Crenchley Parish Charity School to the states if your memories of it are so terrible. Reynolds shrugged. An odd decision, I admit, he said with a wry chuckle. I suppose that since my unprecedented success as an architect and owner of other peoples homes, I thought I might get some sort of spiritual closure if I took the place I most despised as a home and remade it in my image. And I suppose it worked, after a fashion, but it wasnt enough to lay the memories to rest completely. I dont think it ever will be. I nodded. So what memories were you hoping to lay to rest? Besides the fact that you were bullied so horribly, I mean? Bullied? Reynolds gave a piercing, hollow, bitter laugh that lasted for almost a minute. Bullied? Oh, Miss Sutton, I was worse than bullied. I was tormented and terrorized ceaselessly from morning til night. The word bullied is wholly inadequate to describe it. But please dont mistake me. I should find no words to thank God if I were to waken tomorrow and discover that those were the only memories I had to avoid. No, the memories I seek to escape are not memories of the guilt of others, Miss Sutton. They are memories of my own guilt. I felt myself holding my breath as he spoke this last sentence, and as a result, my next question was almost croaked rather than spoken. Did you push Barnaby Ratcliffe down the stairs? Reynolds expression sank as despair seemed to overcome every one of his features. Did I push him? Myself? No, he said mournfully. But I may as well have, Miss Sutton. I may as well have. And I think only you can understand fully why I say that. I nodded attentively, to signal my absolute interest. Reynolds gave an almost convulsive sigh, and began to speak in a voice filled with infinite sadness. Barnaby Ratcliffe bullied me relentlessly, Miss Sutton. Treated me worse than a dog. Almost killed me once or twice, given how much he seemed to enjoy holding my head underwater and hearing me gasp and splutter for mercy. But I forgive him, Miss Sutton. I forgive him all of it. For as implacable as he was to me, I now have every reason to believe he was tortured twice as terribly, and was seeking the only means of asserting control left to him. Reynolds hands shook, and he pulled a hip flask from his pocket, which he sucked on greedily before continuing. The other children called Barnaby by a nickname  Barmy Barney. They called him that because of his violent fits every night, and because he was so vicious as a bully that we all found it more comforting to think his cruelty was just a byproduct of mental illness. Oh, if only we or someone else had been discerning enough to see the truth. Barney wasnt mad, Miss Reynolds. He was as sane as you are, and he was as much a victim of something I dont believe Ill ever understand, and which I sorely wish I had never had the misfortune to encounter. Another swig followed this. As Reynolds went on speaking, I noticed that his voice sounded progressively less and less refined, as the cockney accent from his youth flared up. Im getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning. As you might guess, Miss Sutton, the orphanage staff were pretty desperate to find a way to get rid of Barneys noighttime visitations. Trouble was, psychology was a bit of a joke subject at the toime  even more so than it is now, I mean  so what lile they did try would sound absurdly quaint in retrospect. Ill spare you most of it, but what you do need to know is that one of their half-arsed ideas was to buy Barnaby a teddy. Can you believe that? Theyve got a boy whats wakin the dead wif his screamin, and their solution is to buy him a bloody teddy bear. Worthless, the lot of them. More whiskey went down the hatch, and Reynolds cultured speech degenerated even further. Thing is, Barney actually bloody liked that stupid bear. Didn let most of us see im carryin it around, mind, but oh, if anyone so much as touched it, thered be the devil tpay. Now, I werent much for courage, but one day, after Barney got finished beatin me within an inch of my life, I go it into me ead to sneak in his room and piss on the bloody thing. Serve him right, I thought, and it might be the only bit of revenge Id ave the guts fer. There was barely a trace of Reynolds old speaking style as he downed the remnants of his flask and rose to refill it from one of the many crystal decanters in the room. He held out a glass to me, but I declined. I wanted to be sober for wherever this was going. Eventually, he sat back down and began speaking again. Bloody ell, Ill need a lot more nosh before this is over. Swig. Anyway, back to me pissin on Barneys damn bear. Funny thing is, coward though I was, I actually got up the nerve to go through wif it. Snuck right into is room one day while e was out shoving the girls faces into dog shit, or whaever his sick pleasure was that day. Even brought a canteen of water what Id filched from one of the nurses, and drank half of it before takin the damn bear, settin it against the wall, and pullin down the zipper to do me business. And I woulda done it, too, only right then, I heard Barnabys voice so close it almost made me jump out o me skin. It said, I wouldnt do that if I was you, Nettles. His drag on the flask this time was so long I half thought he might be trying to drown himself with it. But eventually, he wiped his face indelicately with his sleeve and continued. So o course, I looked sharp right quick. Looked round to see where Barney was, only e was nowhere in the room. Thought I was hearing things at first, but then I eard is voice again. Down ere, maggot, it said. So I looked down. Andand He took another long drink and when he stopped, he fixed his eyes on me with the most terrified, pleading look Id ever seen from another human being. I avent told anyone else this, Miss Sutton, he half-whimpered. Theyd thick I was mad and chuck me in an asylum. But you wont, will you? No. You wont. Cause you know theres something whats off about this whole business. You got to know that, otherwise you wouldnt be ere. You I put my hand on his arm gently and squeezed it in what I hoped was an appropriately motherly way. Its okay, Mr. Reynolds, I said. Ill believe you. Just tell me what happened. Tears started to stream from his eyes, and when he spoke again, his voice came out in a childlike shriek several octaves too high for a man his age. IT WAS THE FUCKIN BEAR, MISS SUTTON! THE FUCKIN BEAR WAS LOOKIN UP AT ME AND FUCKIN GRINNIN AT ME LIKE I WAS A FRESH COOKED BLOODY TURKEY! SOMEHOW ITS STITCHIN HAD GOT LOOSE AND ITS MOUTH WAS GRINNIN, AND LOOKIN LIKE IT WAS FULL OF SOMETHING WORSE THAN STUFFING. LIKE IT HAD TEETH, MISS SUTTON. FUCKIN BLOODY GRINNIN TEETH! He sucked on the flask like a man dying of thirst, and when he spoke again, though his voice was back in its normal register, it still shook with sobs. His words tumbled out, almost too fast to catch in the deluge. When I saw that thing starin at me, I mustve been more scared than Id ever been when Barney was urtin me. I wanted to run, but I was too terrified to bloody move, or speak, or do anything but stare at the thing. And then it spoke again, still in Barneys fuckin voice, and it said, Now, look at that, Nettles. You come in ere to piss on me, and you pissed yerself instead. You really are useless, arent you? And I started to cry, and itit fuckin laughed, only it werent a right laugh. It was deeper and ten times nastier than Barney ad ever sounded. Then it started talking again, and this time, this time it sounded all soft and hoarse, in a way that made me bloody skin crawl. I think it was tryin to sound nice, but whaever it was, it didnt know ow. His hands shook as he filled the flask again, sending liquor flying over his expensive trousers. Then, he drank madly again and kept speaking, every word choked out in a shuddering gasp. So it says to me, Yknow, Nettles, I think you and me got a very serious difference of opinion. You jes want little Barney to leave you alone, and me, well, Im more upset that one day es gonna leave. Es gonna grow up, Nettles, and leave me ere, jes like all the other children. Ye know what thats like, Nettles? Constantly losin yer favorite toys? Its no fun. But see, I think this meetin between us? This is an opportunity for both of us. You can get rid o Barney, and I can keep im. What do you say? You interested? Well, even if I was too scared to talk, Miss Sutton, the fact that thisthing didnt want to urt me was reason enough to let it keep talkin. So I nodded me head. And it smiles again and it says, This bear aint really what I looks like, Nettles. And Barney dont suspect that Im idin in it, neither. Fact is, even Barneys never seen what I really look like. But e knows enough to know Im the one what keeps makin him scared. I been scarin people since before either o you two monkeys got shat out by yer mums. But its never for too long. I always need to find someone new. Now, Barney, he and I jes barely got to know each other, and it wont be long before es gone, too. But that dont ave to be the case, Nettles. You can let me keep im for a lot longer. You can get that revenge you want so bad. All you ave to do is get im to pick me up and take me downstairs. Do that, and I can stick wif im longern anyone else. Do ye believe that, Nettles? I believed it alright. If this thing could take control of a teddy bear and make it grin at me like a real bloody predator, I believed it could do anythin. So I nodded again, and the bear grinned again. Then it stuck out its paw like it wanted me to shake it, and asked if we ad a deal. I was too scared to think straight, and thought maybe if I did what it wanted, it wouldnt urt me. So I took its paw and gave it a last nod. But no sooner had I touched it than I couldnt fuckin let go, because it fixed me with those little button eyes an it said, Remember, Nettles, ye go to get im to take me down the stairs. If ye don do that, maybe itll be your room I crawl into next. Then it let me go, and I ran. I ran out of that room and hid and cried in my own room and didnt come out for the rest of the day. I wish Id stayed there til I fuckin rotted! You hear me? Til I fuckin rotted! Then maybe what appened next wouldntwouldnt He buried his face in his hands and sobbed, the effort of what he was saying finally robbing him of speech altogether. I put my hand on his and squeezed it encouragingly, only to find him squeezing it back with a surprisingly strong set of fingers. I nearly tried to pull my hand away from the tight, vise-like grip, but fortunately, his moment of agonized terror lapsed after a few minutes, and after blowing his nose loudly on his handkerchief, he looked up at me with a much steadier, if slightly red-eyed gaze. Sorry, he said, his voice getting back some of its post-orphanage refinement as he spoke. Sorry, butbut youre the first person I told any of that to. I wasnt sure if Id have the strength to even get that far, and now, Im really not sure if Ill be able to go on. You can guess what happened next, I hope. Im sure its obvious. I inclined my head at him gravely, deciding that perhaps if I phrased it as a question, hed find it easier to finish the story. You got him to take the teddy bear down the stairs, didnt you? Barnett Reynolds gulped, blew his nose on his pocket handkerchief and nodded, his voice husky and soft as he spoke again. I dared him to do it, he said. In front of all the other orphans. Said, if you really arent too scared that well hurt your precious bear, let us all see it. Take it out of your room and bring it downstairs. I think hed have pummeled me for it if I hadnt said it so loudly and in front of so many people. Anyway, he went to get it, and I followed him to see what would happen. He came out of his room with the bear and started to walk down the stairs and then His hands gripped the arms of his chair so tightly his knuckles looked as if theyd been drained of all blood theyd ever held. As soon as he was past the top step, Barney started twitching. Like he couldnt fully control his body, and was trying to get it to do something that he wouldnt do. I could see the bear in his arm, and as he gave one particularly violent twitch, Id swear the damn things head turned straight toward me with thatawful stuffing-filled grin. And thenBarney fell. He screamed like a damned soul and he fell, hitting his head so many times I almost thought he might be dead when he hit the bottom of the stairs. But he wasnt dead. Just too brain damaged to wake up. So they took him away and they put him in a hospital, and that was the end of barmy Barney. Everyone who tries to blackmail me thinks Im the one that did it, and like I said, I may as well have. So I pay them. But I dont know what actually made him fall, or what I met in his room. But if what you say is true, Miss Sutton, then I know that some vestige of it must still be there. Which is why I say you mustnt take anything in to sleep with in that room, or sleep in that room at all if you can help it. I exhaled, my entire body shuddering in the process. True, I didnt know exactly what the creature in my nightmares was capable of, or how it was maintaining a connection to my old room, but the mystery that had haunted me since childhood was at this point mostly solved. Well, not quite. There was one last question that I dreaded to ask, but knew I had to. Even so, I took a few moments to let Barnett Reynolds calm down, and to soothe my own nerves before I did so. Mr. Reynolds, I said, youre the one whos been paying to keep Barney alive all this time, arent you? Reynolds response was immediate and fierce. Of course I bloody am! he snapped. After what I did to the poor boy in my cowardice and selfishness, keeping him alive is the least I can do. I still hope one day hell wake up and I can beg his forgiveness. But until then, Im not going to abandon him. Not after what I did. I inhaled sharply, collected my thoughts, and pressed on into the most dangerous territory of all. The thing is, Mr. Reynolds, Im not sure your refusal to abandon him is helping him. Reynolds eyes flashed with rage as he looked back at me. Whatexactlydo you mean by that? he asked, with slow and dangerous precision. I put up my hands hastily. I have no doubt you mean well, I said. But the thing isI spoke to Barney in my nightmares once. I asked how to help him as best I could. And what he told meMr. Reynolds, he begged me to kill him. He said it was the only way to escape what was hurting him. Reynolds stared. You mean he began, thats what the thing meant by not letting him leave? Hes still dreaming in there, unable to wake up from whateverits putting him through? Thats exactly what I mean, I said. The thing is, the creature also wants him dead, but the way it talked, I think what it really means is that it wants him brain dead. I dont know why. Maybe its tired of torturing one person. Or maybe, said Reynolds softly, his voice now utterly suffused with dread, it thinks it can use his body as a disguise. The way it used his teddy. The words hit me with all the chilling force of an iceberg. It was a horrible thought, and given what Id seen, it seemed all too possible. However, not wanting to give it too much credence, I decided to push on. Whatever the reason, I said, hes been holding it off for decades since you saw him get knocked out. And now he just wants to die  I mean really, physically die  so it can stop. So if you want to make amends to him, Mr. Reynolds, I think we both know theres only one way to do that. Reynolds slumped in his chair and gave me a defeated but understanding shake of his head. He understood. He stood up from his chair and crossed to a nearby cabinet, which he opened and removed a pocket knife with an ornate wooden handle. He crossed back to me and extended the handle to me. As I took it, he spoke one last time. Hes being treated at a private hospital near here, he said. I can give you the address. Do whatever you think needs to be done. If its at all up to me, I wont press charges. I thanked him and took the knife. Some two hours later, Reynolds Bentley deposited me outside the hospital itself. It was, as you may expect, a particularly well-appointed establishment. As a result, its staff were very careful to make sure visitors had a good reason to be there, and under any other circumstances, Im quite sure I wouldnt have made it past the front desk. However, with the aid of a handwritten note from Barnett Reynolds, I was able to gain access to Barnaby Ratcliffes suite with as much smoothness and efficiency as if Id been his long-lost sister. After following a businesslike and almost comically courteous nurse down a hallway decked out in warm pastels rather than the usual sterile hospital white, I was at last shown to a nondescript door of lightly polished synthetic wood. The nurse clicked a key in the lock, and pulled it open, gesturing me inside. As I walked in, however, she stopped me with one hand, apparently needing to deliver extra instructions. If youre going to go past the glass, she said, I recommend putting on the robes and gloves provided in the closet. No sense in you possibly catching them. I raised my eyebrows. Them? Sorry, the nurse said. I know its a rather odd thing, but you see, Mr. Ratcliffes bed has been infested with bed bugs since he arrived here years ago. Weve brought in every exterminator you can think of, but these must just be a particularly resilient breed, because theyre always back within a few weeks. I just wanted to save you the trouble of having to dispose of your clothes. My spine felt like it had been plunged into liquid nitrogen, knowing the true implications of this, but I thanked her all the same. Then, flicking the light switch, I stepped into the room alone and surveyed my surroundings. Barnaby Ratcliffe lay on a hospital bed behind a thick pane of glass. He looked old, and practically emaciated from having been fed through an IV for so long, but even so, the features were recognizable as the aged reflection of the Sad Boy whose torments Id shared in my nightmares for so long. That wasnt all that caught my eye, though. Even from here, I could see that the sheets on which Ratcliffe lay were shifting, as if thousands of writhing bodies were underneath them. The sight made my skin crawl, and I instantly moved to the closet the nurse had indicated. I didnt just change into robes and gloves, but actually removed my own clothes, stuck them in my purse, and replaced them with hospital gear all the way through, not wanting to let the prospect of infection worry me even slightly. Actually, I didnt remove my clothes completely. The one thing I kept on was a cheap, ugly hoodie that Id bought for the purposes of masking my face in case any security cameras were in the room. I pulled this up over my head and, avoiding the bed with my eyes as much as possible, pulled open the sealed glass door to Barnaby Ratcliffes inner chamber. Crossing to his bed with a few decisive strides, I fiddled in my purse until my hands closed on the ornate wooden handle of Reynolds pocket knife, which I drew out. Then, kneeling down as close as I dared to Barnaby Ratcliffes ear, I whispered one final sentence into it as a farewell. I help boy. Then, adrenaline suddenly seeming to steady my hands, I drew the knife across Barnaby Ratcliffes throat with one sharp, deep, efficient cut. Reasoning that I had just a few seconds before the alarm sounded, I started to move toward the exit, but something stopped me cold. Barnaby Ratcliffes mouth had opened, and from it, a deafening scream was emitting. But it wasnt the scream of a human voice. It was, instead, the familiar, angry, roar of a voice that seemed to have been transmuted from the buzzing of millions of angry insects. I stared at him, transfixed with fright, then saw  to my even greater horror  that the cut in Barneys throat wasnt bleeding. Instead, an angry flood of chittering, scurrying bed bugs poured out, streaming over his body with single-minded purpose toward me. My paralyzing fear vanished with a second spike of adrenaline and I threw the glass door open, sprinting through it and the synthetic wood one down the hall with every inch of speed and strength I could muster. I heard the sound of alarms and the screams of nurses, but I didnt stop. I didnt even so much as look back until Id cleared the multiple flights of stairs and dashed out of the hospital, flagging down the nearest taxi and making a beeline for the airport, neither knowing nor caring how much it would cost to get there from this great a distance. As the car sped away, I let myself look back at the hospital, triumph and nausea warring in my gut over what I had just done. Id saved Barney. The Sad Boy couldnt be hurt anymore. The monster whod tortured both of us had been thwarted. As I said much earlier in this story, the police have never called on me since that day, and I suspect Barnett Reynolds checkbook went a long way toward making sure of that. Ive disguised the names involved at least as much to protect him as to protect me, because I really cant tell you how sorry Id be if that poor, broken man had to endure even one more indignity because of Barnaby Ratcliffe or the Thing that had tortured him. Fortunately, he passed away a few years ago, so the chances of his suffering from this account are minimal, and I need to let it be known for the sake of my own conscience. Id like to say my life since then has been normal, and that Ive been able to approach retirement with no ill effects from the ordeal. But truth be told, these experiences colored how I relate to the world immensely. Ive never been able to bring myself to have children, for instance, though Ive certainly been content to be a kind and affectionate aunt to my sister Graces children. In fact, its only thanks to the urging of my niece that I ever considered writing this down, let alone posting it on the internet. Apparently writing something like this helped my nieces husband move on from a similarly traumatic experience, and since hes a well-regarded psychologist, I think if hes willing to endorse it, it cant hurt to see if it has similar results for me. I should add that neither Grace nor I have ever been back to our childhood home since college. Not out of desire to avoid it, though I certainly wont deny that was true in my case. But after we both moved out and found jobs, our parents sold the old place and relocated someplace smaller but no less picturesque. They died shortly thereafter in the mid 1980s. I dont blame them for selling the house. Upkeep for that pile was probably a nightmare, as Barnett Reynolds sense of aesthetics certainly didnt come cheap, and wouldve only gotten more expensive the more antique they became. The fact that the house was sold, however, is my second reason for writing this story. Because you see, I checked, and the people who bought that house also had a child. Ive considered warning them about what I know, but Id just as soon not get thrown in an asylum for being crazy myself. So all I can say is, knowing what might still be lurking there, I just hope they never let their little boy sleep in my old room. "
254,vulnerability,nosleep,"My cousin, my sister, my love.",13,4h9iyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4h9iyq/my_cousin_my_sister_my_love/,2016-05-02 01:28:45,"The joss sticks burned, a light fragrance of burning wood filling the air. The room had been cleared to make way for the coffin, which stood between a couple of bouquets and centered behind a old photograph. Our living room had never looked more lifeless, other than two living beings standing over my mother's corpse that were my sister and I. We had prayed and mourned our chants; the rituals and sermons were skipped as we didn't want to inconvenience the monks from the neighboring temple, neither were eulogies and tributes made.. Because there simply wasn't anyone else attending but us. My father left us, severing all ties between our families. My mother's extended family wasn't exactly very fond of us either; her fall out with my 2^nd and 3^rd aunts left us exiled from the rest, whom they managed to convince to turn against my mother. Despite the dead silence, my mind was filled with noise. It wasn't distorting, it wasn't frightening. Rather, it felt like white noise - trance-like and meditative. Then came a soft knocking that stirred me out of it. I looked to the source of the tapping - our front door. Looking across my shoulder, my sister returned my glance with a blank look, expecting an answer to her reply. *I've counted the letters, the hate mails accounted for the all of those fucked up relatives. None of them should be here. They'd better not be here.* And as I reached for the handle, I thought of the ugliest, most monstrous and vile entities I'd have to face. I pictured their mockery, hidden behind a layer of sympathy, that I would have to put up with. I hated my aunts, and they strongly reciprocated the feeling; so much so that I'm convinced they'd travel hundreds of miles to spit on my mother's coffin, simply because they can't wait. But the loathing in my mind was abruptly stopped by the face that stood before mine. I hadn't seen him before, but he felt familiar, as if we were connected in some way.. romantically or otherwise, I.. ""Hey.. I'm sorry to hear about Aunt Linda. Could I come in to pay my respects?"" ""Who are you?"" ""I'm Shaun. I'm a distant relative. We haven't met, I know. But I knew Aunt Linda. I come from your father's.."" ""We don't have a father."" ""I meant.. Sorry I meant.."" ""Come in and talk."" It was a hesitant invitation, but nonetheless one. If it was anyone else who mentioned any relation to my father however, I would have slammed the door shut. But Shaun was different. He was attractive and I had fallen for him. Even though I'd only known him for a minute at that point, I wanted him to father my children. I loved him. He exchanged greetings with my sister, before settling down to explain his relationship to us and to my mother. He was my paternal granduncle's third son's son, and back when my parents were a couple, she had loved and cared for him very well. He didn't dwell with the details, but simply stated that he was eternally thankful for her kindness. As he carried on about how he tried to keep in contact with her, all I could focus on was his beauty - his straight jet black hair comb neatly to form a side parting on his scalp, with his fringe resting neatly near his left ear. His soft smile, straight teeth and dimples that make adorable creases on his cheeks. The masculine jaw line, and generally fit body and so many other things that I could go on about for hours, if not days. "".. and so I came out here, cos' it turns out that y'all haven't move since then, and God bless my memory that I could find your apartment in such a huge building even after all those years."" His story must have touched my sister, because I could see the sides of her face creasing upwards to form a little smile, probably because she's happy that someone would even make the effort to visit, and that my mom once had a pleasant life. ""I just wish.. I'd come earlier,"" he muttered. Silence fell upon us briefly, before we noticed him begin to quiver slightly, gasping for shallow breathes of air and tearing beneath his breaths. My heart sank, and just as I reached out to comfort him, my sister already had his hand, stroking his back while he found the courage to let his tears flow. Wrath seethed through my veins. I stared at the commotion unfold before me, jealous of how that should have been ME. I began fantasizing Shaun cuddling me while I whisper sweet words to coon him, before I slowly approach his lips for a kiss and... *ARE THEY HUGGING? THAT SLUT OF A SISTER. FUCKING WHORE! I'LL KILL HER. I'LL..* ""Could I get some water?"" He sighed. I sprung up to get to the kitchen, not before I felt a hand on my shoulder to stop me. I spun around to see him walk towards it instead, saying, ""I got it actually. Sorry to bother."" ... We watched as the coffin descended into the grave. I turned to see yet again, my sister and Shaun hugging, turning my heart cold and black. I wanted to stab a knife through her heart, then gouge it out with my hands and feed it to her. Shaun was mine, and mine only. And as my mind manifested on the different ways to mutilate her, Shaun turned to hug me as well. My body froze in shock, and just as I was about to get my hands around his back, he already let go. ""Take care. Both of you. We'll keep in touch soon."" A peck on the cheeks of our faces and then he took flight, parting ways in separate cabs. I masturbated that night. I rubbed myself to the thought of hot sex with him and setting my sister on fire. I would watch her burn while I mounted on top of him, taking in every inch with the most licentious pleasure I could conceive. But just as I felt my body ready to climax, I stopped in horror. My body snapped out of bed. How long was soon? What would he contact us for? Would he even contact us after this? The only reason he even knew of us was because news leaked to my father's side. This was merely a fortunate incident. My father wasn't even supposed to know. And even if soon was to happen, I couldn't wait. No, I need him now. I needed him right now. But how..? I already knew and I was tingling with excitement, my heart skipping in tune to a happy song in my head. I heard the water running. So soon? Perfect, when she got out, I won't hesitate to make her a part of this. I'm sure she'll be just as excited to know Shaun will be coming back to see us. And really soon too. In the moment of my eagerness, I got myself ready at the foot of the bathroom, anticipating the moment she steps out. The faucet turned shut. The water's down to drips. I heard the rustling of her towel as she reached to unlatch the door handle, and as she pulled the door away, my hand did the same, revealing ourselves to each other, both partially covered. ""My gosh!"" She startled backwards. I grinned, laughing at her vulnerability to the slightest of scares. She laughed too, rattling about how I scared her the way I did. ""Shaun's going to visit us real soon again you know?"" ""How'd you know? Did he say anything?"" ""No."" I beamed. My sister angled her head slightly, frowning her eyebrows. ""Then how do you.."" ""KNOW?"" And I grabbed her by the shoulders, fervently explaining how, while shaking her up in my over-excitement. She was such a terrible listener though, screaming and wailing over my voice. She eventually died down, leaving absolutely silence except for the occasionally drip of water. The pool of blood had already reached beyond my feet, aiming for the foot of the door. I held my hands over my mouth, still snickering over my wonderful plan, and it's perfect execution. I leaned over to her lifeless corpse, whispering one last breathe into her ear.. ""That's how I'd know, Jenna."" A few days later, the living room had yet another coffin, the atmosphere just as lifeless, except for me. And Shaun. But this time, he won't leave so soon. "

The early teachings of my late grandfather, the ones about being prepared and ready had made me all the more paranoid while leaving none of the preparedness. I often think of him when laying awake at night. I blame my inability to get a good night's sleep on him. The light from the muted TV casts angled shadows every which way. I scan my room, checking each shadow. When I'm done, I check the corner my back is faced to, and the ceiling. The closet is next, most of the time I remember to close it before I get into bed. I can see the imprint of where the body length mirror used to hang on it's sliding doors (it didn't last long). I glance at the window, its about 4 feet from my pillow, on the same wall my pillow leans back against. I can make out the outside border, the navy night sky, the frame of my window (opened about 45 degrees), and another small sliver darkness. The room seems safe so I close my eyes yet again. Something about the solitude, the darkness, the hours of vulnerability to come ignites my imagination. In the blackness behind my eyelids I see contorted fingers and hanging nails emerge from my closet. A creature looks down on me from my ceiling, ready to scratch my chest and bite my hair just as I slip away. The wind on my face starts to feel more like a breath as I visualize a pair of wide bloodshot eyes inches from mine. An unknown finger hits the power button, darkness fills the room. I open my eyes. Everything is just as I left it. My mind is particularly vivid tonight, I check the ceiling again. On my next attempt my eyes stay closed for a minute straight. The rain that has been dropping onto the plastic lawn chair outside my window grows quieter. Whatever movie was playing resumes from ads, it takes place in a cave. The shadows become harder to make out, more ambiguous. I can just barely make out the withering white wig from a Halloween long past on the top shelf of my closet. Normally I'd go shut my closet just for the peace of mind, but I don't. I gaze into the darkness of the closet, my eyelashes grow heavy, as if I can't hold them up any longer. I give in and close my eyes. My imagination is quieter this time around. I can see the ocean far below me. Behind is a meadow of lime green grass. A swaying treeline behind that. I look off into the sun over the ocean. I wish my mind was always like this. Just as I get ready to embrace the wonderful scene and drift off, I look back at the trees. They sway, back and forth, painting the sky before my eyes. My eyebrow quivers as I realize something, the air is completely still. My eyes shoot open and I check my window. Wide white eyes look me dead in the face, locked into position. I study the blank expression, paralyzed in fear. Minutes pass as we watch each other. I close my eyes, hoping that whatever it is outside my window will be gone when they open. Listening intently, I hear a metal click. I open my eyes and see a long, lean hand reaching in, the screen is gone. Tears roll down my face, I scream harder than I ever have but all that comes out is a whimper. Suddenly the hand retracts, and the face leans in, eyes wider somehow. ""Thought you were asleep"". The sound of the rain returns and I hear frantic footsteps escape into the forest. I tell them over and over how it happened, they still blame me for the screen being gone. The room they've since moved me to is smaller. Just a bed, pen and paper, and a toilet this time. At least there aren't any windows."
256,vulnerability,nosleep,I want to share an experience I had during my travels in the Himalayas.,25,4hybtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4hybtt/i_want_to_share_an_experience_i_had_during_my/,2016-05-05 14:04:53,"I wanted to share an experience I had when I was travelling through the Himalayan ranges in India, Tibet and Nepal last year. I dont know if this is the right place to share this, but it seems that my story will fit in here. Last year in May me and a few friends had decided to ride through the Himalayan range and Tibetan plateau. Our itinerary was to follow a quite popular route at first, but then we decided to venture into the roads less travelled. So, our plan was to visit make our way from the Spiti valley to the Indo-Tibetan border. Its a perfect place to live and experience a world within the world as Rudyard Kipling said about the region. Kinnaur district of India is connected to Tibet via the Shipki-La pass, which was a part of the silk route in the ancient times. We had planned to ride our bikes all the way from Rohtang Pass to Shipki-La, which is a 300 KM long journey. But the beautiful weather and scenery makes up for all the discomfort of mountain roads and uncomfortable motorcycle seats. I love visiting small hamlets and villages in the area. Specifically because they have a certain mystical aspect to them. Like its a world that is radically different from the urban life Im accustomed to. Most of the people are kind and helpful. What intrigued me even more were the religions of the region. Now the state of Himachal Pradesh is half the size of Maine, but it seems that the villages that are separated by just a few mountains have developed their own culture and gods. Its a delight to see their customs and to learn about local stories and mythologies. There are some that dont allow leather items inside their homes, others sacrifice goats, and others have temples with idols that are supposed to be taken out for a walk every now and then. They also had all sorts of interesting stories about the mountains too. While talking with the locals, I felt that they have stories for all the mountains around their area. One such story stands out. Let me first describe the administrational formalities that I had to go through. The Indo-Tibetan border area is a core area for Indian and Chinese army movements. Both countries impose special restrictions for travelers, both domestic and foreign. My friend knew a local who could get us the required permits for travelling through the pass. But, we werent allowed to do so on our vehicles. We had to leave our bikes in a town named Khab, which is about 30 KM from the border pass. On our way from the Spiti valley to Khab we stayed in a village called Nako for two days, to wait for the bureaucratic process to finish. I must say, that Nako is perhaps the most beautiful village Ive seen in my entire life. The place is connected to civilization by just one measly mountain road (which is a part of a national highway). The feeling of solitude and mysticism is immediate when you first arrive in this place. The dry and bare mountains, the altitude, the lack of incongruous infrastructure for miles just make this place ideal for people who want to seek virgin beauty in nature and have a particular affection for mountains. The first night we spent at a cottage, which is maintained by the Indian government and apparently, provides employment to half the village. We arrived at Nako around 2:30 PM. In the Himalayas this is a mere two hours away from sunset and a radical drop in temperature, which is rather low during the day as it is. I had the chance to talk with the care-taker of the lodge, who was a local. This man had spent his whole life in the shadow of the Himalayas. He still talked about them with passion and adore. During our initial conversation he let me know all about the weather conditions, local life-style and what to expect of life in his harsh but beautiful homeland. The conversation then progressed to him telling me about the local legends and tales. That mountain, he said pointing to the cloud covered peak of Reo-Purgyil is the abode of an insidious spirit. It has no name for the locals. It is said that the reason it is always covered with clouds is because the spirit doesnt want anyone to know that its watching them. In 1971, the I.T.B.P. (Indo-Tibetan Border Police) lead an expedition to the top of the mountain. Fifteen of them went up. After twenty days, two of them came back. They had lost all of their equipment and were close to starvation. It was speculated that they had been victims of an avalanche or land-slide. But, the two soldiers that came back didnt talk at all. They just walked inside the ITBP post in our village and locked themselves up. They didnt reveal anything during the police interrogation either. Finally, they were taken to New Delhi for psychiatric analysis. We havent heard anything about them since. My mother said that they were afraid of being outside, where the Reo spirit could see them. His tale somehow evoked a sense of macabre and dread within me, which is hard to come by in a place so pregnant with natural beauty. I hadnt read much about the Reo-Purgyil, apart from the fact that it acts as a natural border between India and China and that its peak is always covered with clouds. Later that night, I went out for a walk near the lodge. The sky was clear and the moon shone brightly that night, covering all the region in a surrealistic silver light. I felt that I had been somehow taken away from society and my fellow human beings. Looking at the tall mountains I felt that my presence - or existence for that matter was a trivial affair to these great rock beasts. I walked a little further from the village, gaining altitude as I followed a small goat path. The Reo-Purgyil made its way in my field of vision. The peak was still covered with clouds that appeared silver in the moonlight. The mountain is significantly taller than all the others in the area. It was much more clearly visible this far from the village. Maybe it was the surrealism of the scenery or Bahadurs story, but after staring at the mountain for some seconds I felt goosebumps all over my body. A chill went up my spine and my hands and feet fell numb. It was as though the mountain could somehow communicate via its mere presence. Its imposing stature was an intimidating site. This was both scary and exciting, since I love the mysticism that is often associated with mountains. Now I knew why so many saints, hermits and godmen chose the Himalayas as their abode. There one can truly appreciate and feel the power of providence and understand that we are fragile sentient beings at the mercy of nature. Reo had a character, a personality that I could feel. It was ancient. I reckoned that it was night like this someone had come up with the whole spirit thing. A product of a sub-conscious epiphany, imagination and poetic deification. I was mistaken. When I came back to the lodge, everyone was already asleep. I washed up and went to sleep pretty soon after I lay down, as I had been tired from my walk and constant travelling. The dream I had was a memorable one. I dreamed about riding my motorcycle in the Spiti valley, as I had been doing for the past few days. Spiti is mostly cold desert with the occasional vegetation popping up here and there. In the dream I found a cave in the mountain wall which ran alongside the door, and there were thick bushes and grass protruding out from it. I got off my bike and went inside the cave. Immediately I found that I was lost in the semi-darkness. It was as if the cave entrance didnt exist. But one doesnt question such things in a dream. I went deeper inside the cave, noticing the various vines hanging from the ceiling and water dripping from them on the moss covered cave walls and floor. I heard chanting emanating from deeper inside the cave. I made my way towards it. It appeared to be some form of throat singing, in a language I couldnt understand. The cave grew narrower as I went forward, the walls were now grazing my shoulders. The chanting was growing louder. I had to turn sideways to squeeze through the walls that got closer together as I moved forward. Soon I was stuck in between the walls, unable to move forward, but I could make out hear the chanting just a few meters in front of me, where the walls seemed to spread apart again. But I couldnt go ahead, on account of the bottleneck formed by the walls. Although I couldnt move, it sounded like the sound was getting nearer to me. Then I saw two eyes staring right at me from the end of the bottleneck. The chanting filled my head now. I tried to step back. The cave had close behind me. There was just a wall behind me. I looked back at the eyes, the face they were part of wasnt clearly visible, on account of no light. But the eyes shined and the chant echoed. I felt vulnerable and completely at the mercy of the surroundings. Then I woke up. To find out that it was 4:00 in the morning. I laid in the bed for two more hours, thinking about the vivid dream. It was the most clear and memorable dream I have ever had. At 6:00 I got up, took a bath with a bucket, and went to the cafeteria to het morning tea and breakfast. Our plan was to explore the surrounding areas and take photos of nature at its finest that day. The village Leo lies on west of Nako, in the opposite direction of the border and Reo-Purgyil. Further to the west, a completely uninhabited valley goes through the mountains. While my companions spent their time exploring around Nako, I took my bike to Leo. The village itself is at a lower altitude as compared to Nako, but the valley beyond is very steep and one gains altitude rather quickly when moving further west. I left my bike in Leo with the ITBP personnel posted there. And made way further west in the dry, vacant valley. The valley, situated between Khaksha and Thana mountains went from 9000 ft. to 1400 ft. within a short amount of distance. It was hard-work to make my way along it, but the scenery and feel of blissful solitude were absolutely amazing. The sky was clear blue, with clouds that looked like strokes of white paint on the blue canvas. The mountains looked a lot less menacing now as compared to the previous night. I guess thats the difference night and day can make. But the weather in the Himalayas is quite unpredictable though. In just a few seconds a beautiful sunny day can become a cloud burst tragedy. Similarly, whenever clouds cast a shadow on the mountains, the entire scenery underwent a dramatic change. As I made my way along the valley gaining altitude, it became apparent that the Reo was becoming more and more visible in the East. I had left Leo around 10:30 AM. It was around 2:30 PM when I decide to head back. In the west the Manirang peak provided the most beautiful view. Its snowcapped peak and surrounding clouds made it look like a part of heaven that existed on Earth. It made me feel calm and peaceful. I reckon I had spent nearly half an hour just staring at it. But when I started going back, a feeling of dread made is way from the pit of my stomach to my throat. Right in front of me was the abode of a demon. I didnt try to be rational at that time. Somehow I knew that something was watching me from the shrouded peak. Around 2:30 PM the sunlight decreased radically. The beauty of the mountains, the mixture of colors, and the light blue sky transformed into a dark sky and gigantic dark forms surrounding me from all directions. The blissful feeling of solitude became a feeling a loneliness. The blissfulness of being in the lap of mother-nature became a silent terror of vulnerability. My breathing was heavy and irregular, the hair on my arms and legs were standing up. I was shivering as I made my way back to Leo. I was all alone, in the cold desert valley. Flanked on both sides by mountains, that looked like they might swallow me at any given time. I had not seen a human being for the past four hours, no sign of civilization, or even shepherds. All that accompanied me was the sight of the Reo-Purgyil. Then I heard footsteps behind me. I stopped. The sound of footsteps didnt. I started running. I didnt dare to look back at what was following me. Somehow I knew that whatever appeared out of thin air wasnt something I wanted to see. Not when I was directly in sight of the Purgyil. I ran till my legs were shivering so bad that standing up was difficult. The footsteps came closer. I was crying at this point. The footsteps stopped right behind me. I didnt dare open my eyes. I heard a womans voice. I looked up and saw a local woman sweating and panting right beside me. She had tears in her eyes. She tried to say something in local tongue, which I didnt understand. She pointed towards the way I had come from, while saying something that sounded like Bansar. At first I couldnt comprehend the situation. Where had this woman come from? I hadnt seen anybody while I was in the valley. I felt out of my place and embarrassed. I had let silly myths and mysticism get to my head and I had made a fool of myself. Thankfully there wasnt anybody else there to witness my cowardice. She was trying to get my attention to something in the valley. I squinted my eyes and in the low light made out the form a child, sitting with its back to a rock, some distance behind us. I assumed that it was hurt or sick and the woman was its mother. She started walking towards the child and I followed, taking out my water bottle and first aid-kit. As we came nearer to the child, I felt the pressure in the air drop. The remaining light gave way to darkness, I could hardly see the woman and the child. Then I heard the chanting. My blood pressure dropped and my knees became weak. The child was chanting. The same chant I had heard in the dream. The woman turned back towards me, and I broke down in tears. Her teeth were sharp and protruding from her lips, with two lone fangs reaching down to her chin. Her eyes were shining and emanating a red-orange glow. There was a skull in her left hand and a chain of wooden beads in the right. She took a step towards me, but I didnt move. Couldnt move. I had closed my eyes. Then I felt her breath on my face, it was cold. A deep growl emanated in front of me. The chanting of the child was a lot louder now. As in my dream, it felt the chanting was coming from all around me. It engulfed me. Still, I couldnt move. A loud sound of thunder startled me. My eyes opened and I found myself all alone in the valley. I took a step and collapsed on the ground. My legs were shaking, and my heart was beating incredibly fast. I looked around to find that Leo was merely a few kilometers away. I got up and made my way towards it as fast as I could. When I went to get my bike from the ITBP post, the constable stopped me. Forgot something sir? he asked me. What? ....... No. Didnt like the valley sir? Its not much of a tourist spot here. No, the valley was beautiful. I caught a glimpse of Manirang. He eyed me suspiciously. He opened his mouth and then closed it again. Sir, it takes about three hours to get to Manirang. he said. His countenance and suspicious glance made me unsure of what had just happened. I looked down at my watch. The time was 11:12 AM. I mumbled some excuse, got my bike and went back to Nako. I dont know if my experience was some supernatural phenomenon or a product of my imagination from being over-stimulated by the mountains and local legends. I suppose thats how most legends come into existence. I didnt talk about my experience with anyone else, for obvious reasons. But I really wanted to share this, sub-conscious epiphany with someone. The rest of the journey was fine. We werent allowed to visit Shipki-La. But I heard the other side of the border also had an interesting story about the 'rock demon Purgyil'. I havent found any information on the internet about that. It seems that there isnt much information about the peak anywhere, except for the fact that it has been climbed at least three times. This revelation made me seriously re-consider the authenticity of my ordeal. But, the reality and the lingering feeling of dread is a thing that a lot of travelers and locals have been vocal about, when they think of Reo-purgyil. "
257,vulnerability,nosleep,I Can't Quit You,186,4j86ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4j86ch/i_cant_quit_you/,2016-05-14 06:14:39,"The crunch of distorted electric guitars filled the room with a dark, smoky, maroon haze. I closed my eyes and let myself fall into it, a safety net protecting me from the outside world. The smell of stale beer, old wood counters, frying oil on the cusp of going rancid, and cigarette smoke wafting in from the patio interacted with net in a multiplicative way, the whole essence of the dank dive bar coalescing into an impenetrable cocoon. The dregs at the bar, myself included, chatted and gnashed crispy fench fries, the oil from our lips leaving slicks on the top of our golden pints. For all our talking, though, we didnt really know each other. We talked in falsehoods and half-truths, shaping the bars cocoon into fanciful suits of armor like master sculptors. The handsome guy at the corner seat giggling with the waitress is a recording engineer who recently broke off an engagement to a backup singer. The band around his ring finger where the fat pinches in and his cheap haircut say different things. The middle-aged woman who shoots her night away on the pool table is an accountant. The puckered needle marks visible between the toes of her sandaled feet suggest that shes omitting something. My lie is the smile, the laughter. The image that I would enjoy anything other than putting a gun to my temple and redecorating my bathroom. My life was a hue of light blue, interspersed with wisps of yellow joy up until two months ago. Imagine the most cloying images of idyllic springtime; bees, flowers, grass, and sundresses. That was me. An Easter greeting card incarnate. Words like joy and content often sprung into my minds eye, interposed on the perfect sunset I gazed on with my husband. And then he was rear-ended by a sports car going over 120 miles per hour. Both cars disintegrated into aluminum chaff and roiling flames. Phrases like we regret to inform you and sorry for your loss and it must be so hard and the bereaved slowly embossed themselves in the grey, antiseptic gloom that had usurped the azure bliss. Over time, the grey darkened and grew red, like blood mixed with ashes. Once content with upbeat music from people like Mark Ronson and sweet, whimsical drinks like lemon drops, I sought out a life that matched my new perceptual color palette. Thats how I came to find my new home on a creaking stool, sipping flat Rolling Rock. I had reached the point where I couldnt trust myself not do something violent if I went home alone. It didnt take long to convince the recording engineer to come home with me. We were walking out of the bar when Tess, the bartender, shouted over Jimmy Pages ten minute solo. Steph! Call for you! She held the old, corded telephone above her head for me to see. Hello? I answered when I had pushed my way back to my stool. Stephanie! Thank fucking Christ! Ive been trying to find you everywhere! The voice was familiar but so weighted down with emotion that I couldnt place it. Yeah. Well, I paused, not sure what to say, Im just here where I always am. Who is this? Steph, its me! Its Dan! Please come back home! I hung up. It couldnt be Dan. I buried him. Well, I spread his ashes in the park near his childhood home. The same park where we first had sex. Where we got married. ""Who was that?"" Tess asked, the ratty blond hair adorning her pale face vibrating as she scrubbed a glass with a towel. I lied and tried to conceal the sudden rush of perplexity sweeping through my chest. ""Oh...um...wrong number."" ""But they asked for you specifically."" ""I'm not the only person in the world named 'Stephanie', you know."" I gave her a deceiving smile hoping it would distract her. Tess shrugged and went about cleaning more glasses. I resigned to my stool, thoughts racing through my head while the band and the crowd persisted in a pulsating roar that sounded like jumbled, audible vomit to me. Everything you know and understand about life can crumble and change in an instant but the world carries on, functioning like a machine on an assembly line producing swirling plumes of toxic waste into the air around you, suffocating you. ""We still going?"" the recording engineer asked. ""No...sorry...I just..."" The words were clear in my head but I found difficulty verbalizing them out loud. Instead I just grabbed my purse and headed towards the bathroom, slightly stumbling in my heels with the first steps I took. What a blithering idiot I must have looked like. I burst through the door of the bathroom and stood at the sink looking at myself in the cracked mirror while a couple of other girls chatted away behind me. A hum of vibrations trickled through the air, my cell phone buzzing away inside my purse. I reached inside and immediately gasped when I saw the name displayed across the screen. 'Dan &lt;3'. Goddamnit! I dont know who the hell you are, how you got my number, or what kind of sick game this is, but I swear to God, if you ever call me again, I will find you, and I will hurt you. The chatting barflies each cast a furtive glance in my direction before hastily retreating back to the bar. Now, I was wishing that I hadnt changed my mind about taking Mr. Recording Engineer home. Steph. Its me. Its Dan. Why are you acting this way? I just want you to come home, back to me, back to us. Despite the vague familiarity of the tonal sounds from the other end of the receiver, I was steadfast. No. Youre not Dan. Dans dead and if you call me again you motherfucker, youll wish you were too. I punctuated the end of the call by heaving my phone into the poorly painted cinder block wall of the ladies room, regrettably watching it shatter into multiple shards of glass, plastic, and electronic bits. I tore from the room in haste, almost taking out another patron, my purse slung over my shoulder, with tears that I fought to keep at bay pushing my mascara into the streaking artistry of yet another night gone wrong. Tess called out as I ran past the bar, but I ignored her, hell bent on my destination. Two steps out the door, my left ankle twisted, snapping the heel off the black pumps I had selected for the evening. Cursing beneath my breath, I left the broken shoe, and its undamaged twin lying in the broken glass minefield of the bars parking lot. I reached my car, an old Pontiac sedan I had driven since college, with keys in hand. Trembling uncontrollably, I managed to unlock the door on the third try. Sliding in, closing the door behind me, I was finally able to unleash the full power of my anguish. I screamed audibly into the steering wheel, beating my clenched fists against it, as the pent up sorrows of a thousand nights that should have been spent alone came pouring from my eyes. Dan goddamnit Dan why did you fucking leave me. Why? I leaned back and searched in my purse for a handkerchief with which to wipe my eyes. I settled for some fast food napkins I found in the glove compartment. Resolved to go home for the night, I inserted the key into the ignition and brought the old four door to life. The classic rock radio station blared out a dedication, Angie by the Stones. I turned the cars headlights on, backed out of the parking spot, and then shifted into drive to make the trek back to the lonely three bedroom villa we had called home. Instead, I found myself driving towards the park where I had laid Dan to rest. Unsure of my next steps, I tried to focus on the baritone voice of the DJ speaking through the radio. Coming up next, a very special dedication, from Dan to Stephanie, I know this was your favorite song, heres Led Zeppelin with I Cant Quit You Baby. I turned the volume dial so fast I thought Id broken it. ""What the fuck?"", I yelled. How the fuck is this happening? It's got to be a prank, I thought to myself as I walked around the park I was drawn to, trying to process what I heard. I must have looked like a wreck, and I felt even worse. It's just some...asshole kid who thinks its funny to torture people. Yeah, that's gotta be it. The more I thought about it, the less it made sense. How could someone mimic Dan's voice so well? Why would someone mimic Dan's voice so well? And no one but Dan knew my favorite song. No one but him. No. It couldn't be. Dan was dead. There's no way he wasn't. I identified his body. I cried harder than anyone else at his funeral. I scattered his goddamn ashes. My thought was interrupted by my head meeting the ground. I was so wrapped in my thoughts that I didn't see where I was going. I took a good look at my surroundings. As soon as I realized where I was, the familiar feelings crept up. All the sadness, all the happiness, all slammed into me at once, like the waves of a storm crashing into an old boat that should have been retired a long time ago. This is where my life changed hues, from a brilliant blue to a red darker than I ever thought was possible. This is where I laid Dan to rest. It takes about an hour before I composed myself enough to get up. If I was going to cry, I was going to do it at home and not in a park. I stumbled back into my car and began driving home, trying my hardest to hold together until I got there. Only one thought ran through my head as I walked up to the door. This is what Dan wanted me to do. I might've laughed at myself, but my amusement, however brief, was replaced with a sense of dread. Whoever or whatever called me, they wanted me here. I didn't know what I was about to see when I walked in, and I wasnt sure I want to. Still, in that state, I don't think there's anywhere else I'd rather have been. I opened the door. I stepped into the house and nearly tripped over one of the many beer boxes on my floor. I kicked it out of the way and the empty bottles clinked their song. I didn't know what I was expecting when I walked into my dark, empty house. I threw my purse on the couch and heard several cans crunch underneath it. I surveyed the room around me. It was just how I had left it: cluttered and dirty. Old beer and stale cigarette smoke perfumed the air. There was something else as well, butter, mushrooms, bacon, coffee. The old familiar scents of many a lazy Sunday morning and drunken night. Tears welled in my eyes as I darted into the kitchen. On the table was a single place setting on the plate was an omelet and beside it, a cup of coffee with cream. The stereo started up in the living room and I Can't Quit You Baby played once again. I fell to the floor in a blubbering pile of tears. I cried, I screamed, I cursed my husband, and begged for his forgiveness. The song started to skip like it was being played on a turn table. The words can't quit repeated over and over. I surveyed my surroundings and was finally met by the squalor I had turned a blind eye to. In the two months that had passed I had let my home fall into decay. I couldn't remember the last time I had cooked, or cleaned, or taken out the trash. I had only cared about my next buzz and my next fuck. Dan may have died, but I had become the ghost. I was thoroughly disgusted with myself. I continued to cry and rage a little longer before I succumbed to hunger. The hiccup in the music stopped and the song continued. I sat down at the table and ate. The omelet and the coffee were both impossibly warm. One thousand happy memories flooded my brain. After I finished eating, I washed the dishes. Then, I continued to clean off the counters. I swept and mopped the kitchen floor. I dumped ashtrays, and threw away trash, filling my garage with bags and boxes. I dusted the living room and ran the vacuum. I walked into the bedroom holding back tears at the sight of the bed I hadn't slept in for two months. I stripped off the blankets that still smelled like Dan, took one last long deep breath of him in, and threw them in the washing machine. For the first time in two months I felt good. I felt accomplished, dare I say proud. I grabbed a beer from the fridge and walked outside. I sat on my porch and watched the sunrise. I listened to the birds sing. Then I heard the land-line phone from inside the house ring. I lifted the receiver to my ear, knowing who would be there. I could feel it aching in my bones like a cancer. I held my breath for what felt like months as I waited for him to talk. ""It looks like you're ready to move on,"" Dan's voice said. It was modulated and odd sounding, as if he were in a metallic tube. ""Isn't it time?"" I said. I don't know why I decided to talk to a ghost. ""Then you are ready to hear his offer. He'll be there soon."" The line went dead. I held it up to my head, confused and scared. What the fuck did that mean? I still ask myself that question. I know the direct answer, but what did it really mean. There was a knock at the door. I didn't waste time answering it. Whoever was involved in this was a lot stronger than some flimsy door. There stood an average looking man, dressed all in black. He was on the short side of average height, and his hairline had retreated well past the halfway point. Their war left them tired and without color. His smile was inviting, and he looked in his later 60s. ""Hello, Stephanie. May I come in?"" ""You will anyway,"" I deadpanned and moved to the side. A ripple of energy went through me as he passed. It felt like when you ears plug up on an airplane, but it coursed through my entire body. I kept my distance. ""I know my interaction with you has been trying,"" he said after sitting down. I didn't invite him too, but he did. ""My intention isn't to harm you. It's to show you the possibilities. I want to make a deal."" ""Are you the Devil?"" ""If you understood the true nature of reality, you would really appreciate how underwhelming and condescending that question is."" His eyes were suddenly could and had the disgust one would have for a cockroach that came inside. He closed his eyes, let out a slow breath, then opened them again. They were warm once again. ""No, I just want to help you."" ""By stirring the shit from my past? I grieved. It took a long time, but I am over it."" ""Are you?"" His eyes met mine for a brief second, about the time between blinks. Then, for the first time in the two months since I lost Dan, I felt what I never did with anyone of those people I took home: true vulnerability. With each dalliance, I was overwhelmed by sexual drive. When I brought someone over to fuck, I wasn't overwhelmed with rage at this universe for being able to destroy my entire life in the length of a second. As I coaxed them and spun my seduction, I didn't feel the gnawing chasm of depression, lengthening endlessly in front of me. Now, I did. I felt everything I blocked out in that single iota of eye contact with this man. And it fucking hurt. I wiped at the tears in my eyes. ""What... do you... want from me?"" I said through gritted teeth. ""You were together for seven years, rounded up, correct?"" ""Yes,"" I said with a hiss. ""I want seven people. You give them to me, and you get him back."" ""You can't do that."" ""I can. You've heard his voice. That's real."" ""You fucking asshole!"" I shouted standing up. ""If you could do this all along, why did you wait so fucking long? I destroyed myself!"" ""No, you didn't, Stephanie. Not yet. If I didn't wait, you wouldn't know true grief. Now, you have, and now, you are desperate."" ""Fine... let's say I believe you. I cannot kill seven people. Even one is too much!"" I was still standing. ""You won't kill them. You bring them home, contact me, invite me in, and I take care of the rest."" ""But their families... they'll report--"" ""I said, I'll take care of the rest,"" he smirked at me. ""They will unexist. In fact, how about a counter deal, bring me one in the next 24 hours, and you can see Dan. Not just hear him. Deal?"" ""Fine... it doesn't matter... maybe I am finally insane."" ""You don't believe that. My knowledge of humans is limited to those in my employ. You know I have the means to bring him back. You are just afraid of getting your hopes up."" ""Maybe I am... But, I can get you someone tonight..."" I said at last. I don't know why I did it. I'm not saying I regret, but I just don't get it. I cut slices from a cucumber in the fridge and plopped them on my eyes to take down the swelling and redness from all the crying. I changed from my grass and sweat-stained clothes into a tight, white tank top and jeans. I thought about cleaning off the smeared mascara, but left it; if I was going to be luring people back here for god knew what kind of fate, I might as well look the part. I wasnt sure when it happened, but the maroon tinge to my world finally dulled into gray. All color had faded from my life. I drove back to the bar, not once taking my foot off the accelerator. Maybe I wanted to vanish into fiery oblivion like Dan. Maybe it was better than selling my soul. Salty hatred rose from the back of my throat like reflux from digesting my morality. The recording engineer had regained his perch at the bar, his words more slurred and his posture worse. He was laughing too hard with one of the guys from the band. I walked over and placed my lips on his. It wasnt a kiss; it wasnt loving in the least. It was flesh meeting. Hi, he said. I grabbed his hand, the one with the untanned line where a wedding band usually rested, and pulled him toward the door. My tab, he slurred. I threw a couple twenties on the sticky, stale wood and pulled his arm harder. He tried to talk on the drive. When I said nothing, he tried to touch me. I swatted his hand like a baker shooing children from a fresh pie. He thought it was cute. Or he was too drunk to care. I led him into my house. The first man since Dan  and the visitor  to walk through the front door. I usually went back to their place, or we found a cheap, dirty room somewhere. But this was a special occasion. Dad? the recording engineer asked as he stumbled into the living room. The visitor stood on my old, brocade rug. What? Your dad? I was confused. The recording engineer walked to my couch, past the visitor as if he was nothing but cold air. He knelt at one end and starred into the cushions. Hes gone. Pancreatic cancer. How can he be here? The recording engineer looked at me, not with accusation or malice, but with the excited hopefulness of a child on Christmas. He was reunited with his dead father. I shook my head, spread my hands. A nonverbal, I dont know. The couch was still empty to me. The visitor stalked up behind the prostrated engineer and draped his hands across the engineers neck like a soft, billowing scarf. The engineers breathing began to slow, his eyes fluttered lower and lower. I knew I was watching a man die. I would watch six more men die to get one in return. Would I still see this image every time I looked into Dans eyes? See a face overcome with childish love be sucked from this earth? Could I still kiss a man who let this happen? The engineer began to sag on his knees, using every ounce of his rapidly depleting strength to hold himself up, to lock his gaze with his dead father. Stop! I yelled. The visitor turned toward me. Do not interfere. Fuck it. Fuck you. Im not helping. Let him go. The engineer had fallen to the ground, face first. The visitors hands still wrapped around the engineers neck like serpentine jewelry. Let him go! Understand that if you stop now, Dan will be gone for good. He wouldnt want this anyway. I dont even know what youre doing, but he wouldnt any part of it. The visitor loosened his grip and stood to his full height. He shook his head in disgust and left. I helped the recording engineer up and told him he should sleep off some of his alcohol on the couch. He agreed, trying to hide the tears in his eyes. The next morning I awoke to my tablet's email chime. Thank you. &lt;3 Dan "
258,vulnerability,nosleep,Execution,6,4klt8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4klt8w/execution/,2016-05-23 12:28:40,"Dr. Corazn stood in the corner, making himself seem preoccupied by aimlessly leafing through some notes. He had that damned look on his face again, the one that could cause serious problems for our work. With a long, low sigh, he put the notes down and slowly turned to face me. Do you ever  do you ever think that what were doing is in some way fundamentally wrong? I coolly regarded him for a moment before calculating a response. Doctor, this is not the first time you have asked me a question like that. What have I told you in the past? He visibly tensed before responding, What we're doing is in mans best interest. That is the truth. His eyes betrayed his fear and vulnerability, two things that I could not afford in my subordinates. This will be your eighth time in the pen, no? I understand you have done this more times than any of your colleagues. Yes, professor. Quentin made it six times before he gave in. I laughed at him when he said he couldnt stomach it, but now Quentin was weak, doctor. I thrust a hazmat suit towards him. He tightly held it to his chest. I will not pretend that what we do is pleasant or easy. In fact, it is difficult, disgusting work. At no point in his history could man have prepared for what we do at this facility. There is no preparation, only execution, and you have repeatedly proven to me that you are capable of doing just that. He stared back at me, the hazmat suit bunched up into a thick knot in his clenched hands. His whole person seemed concentrated on the singular act of completing long, deep breaths. Just as I began to consider delaying our work, he let out a final, ragged exhalation through his open mouth. The fear was gone from his eyes, replaced now by a steely determination. This was the doctor that I knew, indispensably valuable. Lets do what has to be done, he said. We carefully suited up and began the long walk down the corridor - the gullet leading to the pen. Upon reaching the monolithic vault door that kept them in, our regimented actions were wordlessly carried out. We again made certain that our suits were properly sealed, gathered up our various instruments, and sounded the klaxons. Apathetically, blissfully ignorant of its own contents, the vault door swung outwards. The klaxons cut out as it ceased all motion with a deafening, metallic thud. They were visible now in the dim light of their pens. Goddamn them all, for they defied all earthly explanation. Their thick, tendrilled bodies flowed in haunting patterns, casting wild shadows around the room. They writhed against their confinements tepidly, brought to languishment by the freezing temperatures they were stored in. Fourteen years, fourteen long years have we known of their existence, and in that time they have remained completely alien to us. Discovered in primordial, underwater caverns, skulking in the pockets of air that were created there, not fish and not mammals, they are physiologically inexplicable. Thousands of dissections have been conducted, hundreds of them by my own hands, and the questions surrounding their unholy existence remain unanswered. Every one of their movements is a mock at my expense, conveying an unintelligible intelligence that cannot be pierced. I set about the all-too familiar task of subduing one of the creatures. Waiting for the right moment, attempting not to impart human logic on its apparition-like contortions, I reached out and quickly grabbed it. I began to pull it along like a rope, searching frantically for its anterior bundle of veins. I found the bundle, a Gordian knot of blood-filled tubes that bulged prominently, and plunged into it with a syringe of potent narcotics. I reeled my hand back just as the creature began to violently jerk and spasm, lashing at the sides of its pen until all sense abandoned it. It collapsed with a heavy slap to the floor. Eventually, the sounds of a similar struggle echoed down towards me, diminishing in intensity as they whirled along the rows and rows of cages. A distinctive, fleshy thump, followed by a roaring silence, meant that Dr. Corazn had succeeded in quelling his specimen. I released the many iron tethers that fixed the creatures containment in place and began wheeling it towards the harsh light of the vault door. I refused to allow my eyes to stray away from my destination - to attempt to take in the entirety of the pens stock at once, an otherworldly zoo constituted of endless ranks of incomprehensible monstrosities, would be extremely foolish. The doctor and I breached the corridors sterile glow at the same time, and the vault door unceremoniously slammed shut behind us. I could see now that one of his legs remained completely stiff as he carted his specimen along, not bending at the knee and dragging slightly behind him. I quickly removed my hood and called out to him. Doctor! Are you alright? Did it manage to get at your leg? He did not stop. Shoving his specimens pen aside, his pace increased to a fervent jog, his right leg seemingly useless at his side. Doctor! Abandoning my own specimen, I rushed towards him and quickly gained on his lame escape. Catching him by the shoulders, I shouted, Doctor! What is the meaning of this? He suddenly froze under my touch. We stood like that for a moment, I clutching what appeared to be the lifeless statue of a man, until I felt something coldly slither against my palms. No, I whispered to myself. From within his hazmat suit, I scarcely made out his final words: Youre free now. Time stood still as I watched it silently burst through his visor. Its body flowed like water to the floor, surging with a terrifying swiftness towards a grate at the doctors feet. The rest of it erupted out of him with a wet, popping sound. With a final twist of its posterior end, it disappeared. The doctor fell face forward over the grate, and his blood began to chase the creature to wherever it planned on wreaking havoc. In a matter of seconds, it was done. Man was not ready for what the creature could do uninhibited. But I have often suspected that man was incapable of preparing himself. All that mattered now was how man reacted - it was entirely a matter of execution."
259,vulnerability,nosleep,What Monsters Fear,989,4f3oy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4f3oy4/what_monsters_fear/,2016-04-17 06:58:54,"Hey there. Long time lurker, first time poster. Allow me to introduce myself; hi, Im Vinnie and Im a monster. What? Why the surprise? You think that we dont look at places like this? Everyone likes to check out places on the internet where they might turn up  and I bet there isnt a single one of you that hasnt googled yourself. Same goes for us. We like to keep tabs on what the rumours are, to see if anyone has been telling tales and revealing too many of our secrets. Most of it is garbage, of course; stuff about people hurting other people, spooky graveyards and spouses not acting right. But once in a while, theres a story thats just *too real*; a story that has got to be from a personal experience with someone like myself. Of course, nobody is going to believe it  and thats precisely why were still around. If any credence was given to this stuff, me and my kind would get wiped out in a heartbeat. Thats not why Im here though. See, what you kids dont realise is that us monsters have got stories to tell as well. Sometimes even *we* come across things that make our skin crawl  things that make our spines, tails, scales and fur stand on end. So tonight Im going to tell you about one of those things. Because I think you ought to know that there are things out there that even *monsters* fear. &amp;nbsp; Technically I dont *need* to eat human flesh, its just easier that way. Others of my kind live out in the wilderness, preying on wild deer, rabbits and the odd wolf or bear. Thats a pretty hard life though, even if it is how we were *supposed* to live, way back when. But with the advent of cities came an abundance of food, and a bunch of us decided that the urban life was for us. During the day we blend with you folk, walking amongst you, hanging out on the fringes of civilised society. Were not exactly experts at it, but were good enough to pass as human during the day. But at night? At night we get *hungry*. Cats and dogs are pretty easy meat. Pigeons even more so, but not particularly satisfying. You can live on those winged rats for a few weeks, definitely, but after a while you need something more substantial to fill the void  like a good-sized Rottweiler, or a ten-year-old kid. A grown man will keep me going for a few days  I usually hang em up in the elevator well of some abandoned office block, taking a limb off every night. Nobody checks on those secluded concrete shafts; theyre my own personal larder  the perfect coolstore for the privacy-inclined predator. Certainly, I could raid abattoirs and supermarkets for fresh meat, but theres two problems with that; the first is that you humans have fucking cameras everywhere, and I *hate* cameras. The second is that theres no *hunt*. I am, after all, a monster. Without the thrill of fear fermenting in their veins, people just dont taste quite right. &amp;nbsp; So anyway, back to the subject of *my* fear. Theres something unnaturally creepy about little girls, especially ones who wander about on their own, dead-eyed and dispassionate, confident and deliberate. This one was definitely one of my own kind, or at least a very close cousin. Id noticed her scent when she encroached on my turf; were territorial beasts, and the amount of people we need to kill to survive makes those territories quite large  and usually in the kinds of places where people arent cared for particularly well by society. I let her off the hook for the first couple of kills  human children of her own age whom she lured out of a bedroom with her bruised eyes and crocodile tears  but when she continued to hunt well beyond her appetite, I decided to pay her more attention. I admired her strategy; when I was a little beastling myself, I didnt have her kind of ingenuity. I cut my teeth on paedophiles and hobos rather than using an endearing vulnerability to lure children and adults out of their homes. The concerned human would ask her what was wrong, shed sob and sniffle until they drew closer, and then it would happen  a flash of talons, bristling black fur and gaping jaws. The hapless mortal would lie dead on the asphalt for a moment, then she would snatch them up with unnatural strength and vanish over the rooftops. What was truly curious though, was that every night she was clearly still *hungry*  starving, in fact, judging by how she shivered in her human flesh and how her belly growled loud enough to be heard from thirty feet away. I just *had* to know what was going on. And so, I made the terrible mistake of following her. &amp;nbsp; The size of her territory was horrifyingly large. She hunted all night; from the first dusting of twilight right up until the brink of dawn  killing up to four or five times. She was careful, too; mixing ordinary victims with the homeless, careless prostitutes and large dogs  so as to blur her trail of death. All of them she took back to a central location  a storm-water tunnel that led deep under the city. Of course I followed her; after all, I *am* a pathological killer who literally drinks the blood of innocents. What could possibly terrify me? I caught her on the hop, heading back to her lair. She sensed me coming, but I was too big and too fast  we tussled briefly in our true forms, then, as I held her pinned to the tarmac, she began to cry and plead. Dont eat me, she begged, I need to feed mama so she gets better. And with that phrase, everything was explained. Somewhere deep in that tunnel was the mother of this beastling, a matriarch who was sending her daughter out to bring an endless array of food for an enormous appetite. Id heard of this before, and it was frowned upon in what passed for our society. Children shouldnt be exploited in this way  they should be turned loose to find their own niche, not enslaved by their parents. I need to have a word to your mama, I growled at her. Please, she whispered, please dont. I didnt brook any discussion and hauled the child to the tunnel, marching her ahead of me into the gloom, where somewhere her monstrously fat mother wallowed obscenely. &amp;nbsp; The stench was so bad that I  a sometimes eater of finely aged carrion  gagged. What the *hell* is that? I managed through gritted canines. Mama, said the dead-eyed girl. And then I saw her. I projectile vomited, the semi-digested nuggets of my last meal spattering the stained concrete. The mother was enormous; far larger than anything my imagination had been capable of conjuring up. Her vast white body hulked in the darkness above, like some massive, bloated slug. The worst was her head. Her jaws had been forced past the point of breaking, and were held open with pieces of pipe, rebar and plastic  to form a three-foot-wide chasm into her innards. As I retched weakly from the smell and the sight of her, the little one picked up the corpse of one of that nights kills and deftly climbed up the maggot-pale mound of her distended mothers flesh  where she forced the body down that wrecked throat. It appeared that mama was *quite* dead  and had been for a very long time. She just needs to eat, the beastling said, matter-of-factly, mama is *always* hungry. With watering eyes, I regarded the titanic corpse in front of me, stuffed to overflowing with *more* corpses in varying states of decay. I knew that I was witnessing something truly obscene  and truly unnatural. &amp;nbsp; So thats my tale for tonight. What became of the little girl, I dont know. I abandoned that territory, for fear of being caught up in her eventual discovery. But sometimes when Im hanging up my dinner to dry in some abandoned elevator shaft, Ill remember the sight and smell of *mama*, then feel suddenly nauseous and skip the fresh meat; instead opting for a greasy burger from some fast-food joint downtown. I guess human food aint *all* bad. [Part 2 - The Shag](URL "
260,vulnerability,nosleep,I was left alone to die by my Uber driver,31,4ga5m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ga5m1/i_was_left_alone_to_die_by_my_uber_driver/,2016-04-25 07:37:15,"I was in the bathroom when my Uber driver texted me. I left your things in the parking lot. Im out. He had abandoned me. Okay. I saw this coming, I would call another driver, everything would be all right. I glanced at my battery life: 6%. On an iphone 6s plus though, that was a long time. It was 10 oclock at night. When I left the bathroom and walked out into the brightly lit Walmart, something seemed wrong. The lights flashed like there was a storm outside, but I knew it was warm and calm. My service dog, a golden retriever, stopped in the entrence of the bathroom. She didnt want to be here and neither did I. I started looking around at the people. They had all been kissed by meth. I had never seen more tweakers in one place before, I felt I had to have been teleported from Salt Lake City, UT to detroit or something. This wasnt right. How could Utah have so many lost souls in one place? Aw, but they were not lost. Their souls were listening to the devil tonight, thats what brought them here where they aimlessly wondered the aisles buying nothing. They were here looking for prey. What they didnt know until they saw me was, they were here looking for me. Then I could see the hunger take over their eyes. A 23 year old girl who looked 15, with short brown hair and clear beautiful Egyptian shaped grey eyes. I think everyone that was in the store store was on a most wanted list somewhere. They were rapists, torturers, murderers. All the women stayed with the women and all the men stayed with the men. They each had a role to play in scaring me into vulnerability. They needed me outside alone without a phone. They needed to trick me, so I would stop listening to God. They needed to trick themselves into believing I was a bad person who deserved it. Everyone, all the people around me, wanted me dead. My shoulders slumped forward as I realized it. The people hacking my phone to make it not work properly all night werent just messing with me. Maybe it wasnt hackers at all. Maybe it was the devil. Or maybe I just dropped my phone once to many? If they were hackers They didnt just want money. They wanted my life. As the reality of the danger set in, the power of the devil suddenly became so much more real to me. It wasnt God being cruel. It wasnt God being clever. It was a different entity altogether. At night around people broken by mental illness, drugs and past abuse, the Devil was so powerful God seemed to be gone completely from the night. I had never felt more raw fear. My heart started pounding. The hunt was on and I was the trophy. How could complete strangers want me dead so badly? I opened Uber and called for another car and the screen took forever to load. 23 minutes away. A man called her on the phone. He sounded scared. Can you make it 20 minutes?? Ill be there in 20 minutes. Ok. I said numbly. I felt that this was a good person, the closest good person left, but he would not make it in time. I was going to be killed as I stood in the store, mob justice. Or I would be kidnapped and killed in private. But it was getting down to the wire. And there were no good people left to stop it. It wasnt the worst time of the night yet, but if I was here around 3am, I would certainly be killed. Nothing would stop the impulses of the devil then. The security cameras would be erased and no one would say who had stabbed the young girl to death. I would probably just be found the next morning, a who done it mystery of the century. Only I would know it would be everyone. My family for ignoring me and causing me to go out on my own again. The people who didnt want me dead but didnt want to help me either. And the actual people who would commit the crime soon, but I barely even blamed them for my imminent death. I canceled the Uber and tried again. This time the Uber was already in the parking lot. What the fuck? A familiar voice called me this time. A womans voice. Hi! She said cheerfully, I can take you to your destination, but we will be going through an apartment first! Is that okay? WHAT THE FUCK NO! I said startled and hung up the phone, cancelling the uber again. I turned around and saw the cashier hanging up her cell phone. She waived at me. I could not get an uber here. They wouldnt let me now. They would accept me with fake Ubers and not let any real ones from outside the area break through. I was fucked. I texted my boyfriend, but he was a state away. Maybe he could call for help. My phone was about to die. NOT SAFE. WALMART. NOT SAFE. I texted my brother NOT SAFE PLEASE COME GET ME CALL POLICE WALMART But I didnt know which one I was at. I turned on Uber again. I would try one more time before calling the police. I started walking with my dog to the exit walmart. In the app I saw the arrow that was me. There was a bubble around the arrow. It kept expanding and collapsing, so close to getting a real Uber car and then so far away. There was an Uber right outside of the radius, I could get him inside to see me. I turned left and walked away from the walmart into the parking lot. I followed it into the parking lot, walking towards the closed side of walmart. The dog realized the mistake before I could. It was DARK and COLD on this side of the parking lot. There were NO LIGHTS on. Kimber, my dog, stopped suddenly, growling into the darkness. I realized how alone we were. I stopped looking at my phone and turned around toward the light of the entrance. It was far away now. No one could see us. This was a very bad idea. Its just what they wanted! I started walking quickly back toward the light. A shadowy figure to my right lunged at us and my dog attacked him back, I was so focused on getting back inside I didnt see what actually happened. All I know is that was the first time my dog saved my life that night, but it wouldnt be the last. Dogs are such pure love and loyalty, they are the closest creatures to God. Through them we can find great protection and guidance in life. Back inside Uber still would not connect me with a driver that wasnt already waiting in the parking lot. Then the entire screen went black. There would be no more calling or texting for help. It was dead. I was on my own. I looked in my purse for my charing cable. I had the converter but no cable. My money was missing. My cards were missing. People had been stealing from me all night and now I paid the price. I didnt want to call the police. I thought the police would be just as dangerous as people were. I just needed to get back to my hotel room. I walked to a manager of self checkout and asked him if I could use the phone. He seemed to be very annoyed by me, like he didnt want to help. You can use the phone in mens jewlwery Ok, thank you. I smiled and nodded my head, trying to make a friend. He just looked away. I hurried to mens jewlery. I dialed 9 to get out and heard the tone. I dialed my Moms phone number and a loud alarm played through the speaker. I held it away from my head, it hurt my ear. That didnt make any since. I carefully dialed the number again, same alarm. Again. Alarm. Again. Alarm. My moms phone number sounding like a familiar song as I dialed it in so quickly, like muscle memory. Alarm. I gave up, hung up, and dialed 911. The same alarm played. I dialed 911 over and over again, ending with the same result everytime. I hung up the phone and backed away from the counter like it was possessed. I walked back to the walmart entrance, glancing at the self-checkout manager who ignored me. I went outside into the parking lot again with my dog, but this time I stayed in the light. There were several cars left and some had women waiting in them. I walked to the nearest black SUV and knocked on the window. The woman with long black hair and acne from tweaking off meth sat in the passenger seat. But maybe she would be willing to help me. Hello, someone here is trying to hurt me. Can you take me home? I will pay you. Im sorry, The women smiled, I am waiting for my husband! She said cheerfully. Maybe you can come back later. She winked and closed the window. At the next car the woman had short light brown hair and she sat in the drivers seat with the car on. Hi, can I use your phone? Or can you give me a ride home, Ill pay! I sputtered out, nervous. The women had been staring straight ahead as I talked to her but when I went silent, she turned her head and looked at me with an evil grin. Im waiting for my friends. She said in a mocking voice. She turned her head again, staring straight forward. I backed away from her car. Scenes of groups of people raping and murdering one girl flashed in my head. All those shows I had watched showing what groups of young people were capable of. That would happen to me. That was my destiny. I ran back inside the walmart. Can I use your phone? I asked the manager again. I already told you! Go use the phone in mens jewlery. It doesnt work for me. You have to dial 9 to get out if its not a local - I did. It doesnt work for me. I said again, Can you call the police for me? No, call them yourself. I shook my head If you dont help me I will die here. I will be killed here. The manager walked away. He wanted me dead too. I walked away from him. I asked other employees. They all shook their heads. They said we would lose our jobs if we help you. What the fuck. I looked up at the security cameras, begging for mercy with my eyes. Didnt they see what was happening here? What would happen to me if this continued? A mexican worker was sweeping nearby Can you help us? Can I use your phone? I asked him. He shook his head. You and your dog made a mess. Didnt you? I blushed, my dog had accidently pooped in the store earlier that night. Normally I would have cleaned it up but I was too freaked out. I am very sorry, but we are in danger. We need to call the police. The man shook his head like he didnt understand. La policia! Por favor! I almost shouted at him but he just shrugged his shoulders and continued sweeping. Chocolate appeared in front of my dog as he continued sweeping, he smiled as she went for it. He wanted us dead. I yanked on her leash and turned around, wandering how many people had tricked her into eating chocolate while I was distracted that night. Who would want a dog dead? Please call the police for me! I said to the same manager. Dont you get it! We are going to die here soon! Why do you think we want you dead? The man smiled. We just want you to pay. Said the Mexican from behind him. If you dont help us soon we will die. I stated turning around and walking toward the exit again. I stood at the exit looking into the dark parking lot. There had to be at least one good person left. I didnt want to die. But surely this was it. This was my judgement day. I sighed and accepted my death. It would be okay. It would hurt but it would be okay, I would be with my dead father soon. I had died before and it was warm and peaceful. Soon it would be over. I had closed my eyes, when I opened them a teenage boy (also covered in acne) was walking through the door, holding his smart phone in front of him like it was a gift. I knew it was not and that I still had to ask permission. Hello! I said to the boy, startling him as he looked up from his phone. Can you please call the police for me?? I begged. Oh. Um. I guess I can do that - he said dialing in his phone. THANK YOU! I exclaimed. As he talked to the police on the phone I asked him. Who are you here with? My Mom. Can we go over to her? Uh yeah, okay. So with him still on the phone we walked to cosmetics. The boys mother was very skinny and also tweaking, but the energy from her was good. Hi, where is your husband? I asked suspiciously. Im divorced. Oh! That is good. I said rudely without really realizing it. Can you do me a favor? What? People here want me and my dog dead. I can feel them thinking very bad things about us. Can you think positive things and stay near me until police come? She paused for a moment Yeah. ... to be continued"
261,vulnerability,nosleep,A trip to the woods,22,48lw6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/48lw6j/a_trip_to_the_woods/,2016-03-02 23:15:26,"Dear Nosleep, I have a story to tell, and I thought this would be an appropriate avenue, given that it is generally assumed that the writer wishes to remain anonymous. However, Im not sure how this works, Ive never written anything here and I have no inclination whatsoever to read the rules regarding posts and whatnot, so bear with me; moreover, English is not my first language, so youll have to excuse lapses in grammar and awkward sentences Ill just write this as I would a letter, and leave it at that. After an unremarkable divorce, I wanted to stay alone with my thoughts for a couple days so I decided to go on a solitary trip to the mountains. Im not an expert mountaineer by any means, but I am physically fit and I had done some research, so I was fairly sure I would have been able to pull it off. I used GoogleMaps to choose a fairly isolated region within walking distance from well beaten paths, selected and bought some gear, added a GPS for good measure and set off for adventure. Just to give you some ideas of the place I wanted to visit, lets just say that its a forest in Europe; temperate climate, scenic, balmy air. Here the fauna is a lot less menacing than what you have in the US or Canada, and much sparser. Wolves have not been a realistic threat since the Middle Ages and bears are catered for like pandas in a zoo. Their cubs are oftentimes local celebrities here, so I didnt expect much in terms of unpleasant encounters; I did, however, pack lots of supplies, a large knife to appease my (severely repressed) machismo and a well-stocked emergency kit, complete with adder venom serum and some assorted pills in case I pulled a McCandless and found myself in serious trouble. Thus armed, I used my long overdue vacation days to book myself a long weekend and in a fortnight I set off for adventure. Predictably, I got lost within five hours of leaving my car. I parked in a lot next to a small hotel closed for the season, started on a trail that ran towards the region I had selected, and promptly left it for what appeared an easy shortcut from what I could read off my map. Needless to say, a map and a compass arent much use if you dont know how to handle them and after a while even the GPS lost its signal. It took me another six hours to finally admit that I had not the slightest clue of where I was, but I still didnt want to concede defeat and set off towards a clearing to set up camp. You have to understand that I just wanted to be alone for some time, get some fresh air and piece myself together, so it didnt seem at all important at the moment that I was utterly lost. I had a clearing all for myself, a tent, a bedroll and enough supplies to last me three days: looking around, I distinctly remember nodding to myself in satisfaction. I had a rather pleasant evening, all things considered; the moon was only half full, and I had a spectacular view of the Milky Way; I cooked myself a freeze-dried meal, washed it down with water and some schnapps and readied myself for what I hoped to be the first decent night of sleep in a long, long while. Turns out, I had a mixed experience: the coolness of the mountains was pure bliss compared to the stifling humidity of the city, but the noises were unbelievably loud. I remember sitting up when a particularly enthusiastic owl swooped over my tent screeching, only to gaze at my wrist watch and thinking: Its three in the morning, you asshole! The next morning I woke up expecting to be extremely sore, but to my surprise all that gym paid off and my legs were only slightly aching; I had hoped, however, to clear my mind a bit but as I started the fire to get some coffee I groggily realized that the change in scenery didnt do much to change my worldview. Nevertheless, the weather was nice, the view was nicer and the smell of pines was outstanding. I decided to get my bearings and try and reach a river that should have run in the general location I guessed I was lost in. Breaking camp took its sweet time. I bought one of those instantaneous tents that pop up as soon as you release its bindings; it worked like a charm the night before, but now it seemed like a Mensa puzzle. Eventually I managed to stuff the damn thing back in its bag and I went towards the river using my compass. It took me another six hours to hear the sound of water gurgling and splashing, and it was not a moment too soon: I had severely underestimated the distance I travelled the day before, and it turned out that I mostly moved in the wrong direction. I reached the river much deeper in the forest than I expected, and I surely would not reach civilization within the day. Still, I managed to get my bearings, had plenty of time left and the river would provide water, so I felt like I managed the situation reasonably well. Something attacked me from behind as I was filling my canteen and several bottles; I had dropped my backpack and had been crouching in a small bend of the river, where the water was shallow and calm enough to submerge the containers. I did not register fear at first; I was just dumbfounded as something stinky and heavy slammed in my left side and sent me sprawling on the riverbank. My memory gets murky after this; I recall turning and hearing a loud growl, a flash of teeth in a strangely elongated muzzle and the stink of rotting meat. Next, pain in my left arm, and a screeching, terrible howl as I rolled in the river; the thing suddenly jumped off me and I crawled away from the water, drenched, towards the backpack and the long knife that hung on its side. I have this clear recollection of feeling it approaching again as I closed my fingers on the handle, and then it all gets confused; there are flashes of blood, black wet fur and again that awful scream. When I came to, I was a few meters away from the river; I had collapsed clutching my left arm, and I gingerly examined it in the waning light: the fabric of the sleeve was ripped to shreds and my flesh underneath was little better. Coagulated blood stuck the fabric to my arm, which I guess provided some sort of improvised bandage. I suddenly remembered that whatever attacked me could still there and I turned around, wincing. There was no sign of it besides the thrashed grass near the river where the scuffle had happened, and that smell, which was still strong enough to make me gag. The next two hours were unpleasant. My phone had no signal, of course, so I could not ask for help. I had to cut my sleeve and remove the fabric sticking to the wounds, empty a bottle of antiseptic on them, put on a tight bandage and finally pop a couple of antibiotic pills. I think I passed out once or twice. By the time I was finished it was dark, but I needed a hospital as soon as possible and I was terrified that whatever jumped me might still be lurking around; I looked at the map and made an educated guess that walking for some hours down the river I would be able to get a signal and request help. I felt strangely lucid, and realized that I had finally achieved that clarity of mind I had sought for so long. The thought made me laugh loudly, because I didnt really expect such a steep price. I collected my gear, in case I had to spend the night in the woods before I could be rescued, and started to follow the river. The thing that mauled my left arm puzzled me, because try as I might I could not figure out what it was. It had been lanky, with black shaggy fur and strangely proportionated limbs; it was familiar, somehow, and yet still wrong. I had been walking for a couple of hours, using a headlamp to follow the riverbank when it struck me: it had about the same movements of a some kind of ape I saw in a zoo once, those with a long muzzle and tufts of hair growing out the side of their heads. Still, it was not a perfect match and I could not understand how an animal like that would get in a forest in the middle of Europe. Maybe it had belonged to one of those nuts who collect wild animals and he had to set it free, or maybe it was escaped from a circus and they didnt bother to tell anyone because it would have damaged them. Still, once the adrenaline rush had passed I was furious. I could have died! What if I had permanent damage to my arm? In between fits of impotent rage I checked the cell phone for signal and looked around, knife at the ready, in case something followed me. I reached a bend in the river at about two in the morning; I was so tired I was about to collapse, but the thought of sleeping in those woods was enough to prop me up every time I felt my legs give under me. Since I had decided to follow the river, I had emptied all the bottles of water to lighten my load; I just kept my canteen half full to take a sip every now and then. As I approached the water I was acutely aware of my own vulnerability, and I kept scanning the tree line to prevent a second attack. I was so focused on the trees that I didnt see the girl bobbing face down in the water until I touched her with my canteen. I scrambled backwards frantically, ignoring the pain shooting up from my left arm; I was too scared even to cry. After a while, I managed to calm down enough to sit up and get a closer look. I noticed, uncomfortably, that the girl was naked; Id say that she was about ten years old, but she was so thin it was difficult to say. Her hair was long and matted and waved around her head like black algae. I had no doubt she was dead: she was completely still in the cold water and I could see long red gashes on her arms and torso where small fishes where darting up and down, worrying at her flesh. My head was in turmoil, and I could not even form coherent thoughts. Here I was, hurt, tired, scared and now this. I struggled with waves of self-pity and befuddlement until I finally decided to approach the girl. I didnt want to touch her but I couldnt just leave her corpse in the water like that, it wasnt right. I grabbed one of her arms and dragged her over the pebbles of the small inlet where I decided to refill my canteen. She was heavy and cold. I sat there panting for a while and then, unthinkingly, rolled her over. I got one look and immediately puked my breakfast in the river. I staggered to my feet and put a few meters distance between the corpse and me. She had been savaged, the wounds I saw when she was floating in the river were nothing compared to the damage to her face and torso. I can still see it in my mind, and its pointless to describe it here. I fell down on my ass and cried for a while. I must have dozed off because I awoke with a start, scaring a crow that had been inching closer to the girl. It was almost dawn and I realized, terrified, that I had lain completely helpless next to the body for at least three hours. Whatever Victorian horror I might have had for the dead body was trounced by the chilling realization that it would have been a beacon for whatever animal had attacked me the day before. I patted myself searching for the phone and uttered a moan as I saw that there was still no signal. I had to go. I had to find a way to get some help. Most importantly, I had to get away from that corpse. Still, I could not drive away the image of the crow jumping cautiously around her face, ready to sneak in and peck at her eyes. I knew it was a bad idea to stay there but I had to cover her somehow, at least her face. What would I have said to her mother if she asked me why I had left her daughters eyes to the crows? I took out a small tarp from my backpack, I thought about covering her with it and getting some rocks to keep it in place. She would have been anothers responsibility afterwards, but I had to do this, at least. As I approached, however, I could get a better look at her in the creeping light and I found myself holding my breath as I took in her condition. She was so painfully thin that I could see her ribs jutting out from her sides, and I immediately thought that a state such as this would mean that she had been abused and malnourished for weeks, even months. Also, I could see that the wounds had distinct edges, and while I am no pathologist I could tell they had been done with a knife. I felt a ball of ice forming in my stomach as I realized that the girl had been killed by a human being, of sorts, and that he would probably still be around. I looked around, stupidly, trying to peer into a forest that seemed lousy with too many kinds of monsters. After a while, I had to kneel; I felt lightheaded, I think I was hyperventilating. I think I stayed there for a few minutes, dizzy and incongruously hungry. I hope I dont come across as insensitive, but it was the raw need for food that finally prompted me to get up and start moving again. I wolfed down a couple of energy bars, drank the last of the water and finally I turned to the girl to cover her and start moving again to get some help. I was starting to set the tarp down when I noticed something odd; I was trying to avoid looking at the girls face but, as I was kneeling beside her, I saw something coming out of her mouth. I recoiled, thinking that it probably was some kind of scavenger or some other animal. I kept working on the tarp for a while but then, with a sigh, steeled myself and moved back to remove whatever obscenity had been trying to burrow into her face. I was puzzled to find that it was just a piece of cloth that was stuck between her teeth. I grimaced, thinking that it would probably have come out of a gag her captor used to muffle her screams. I was about to throw it back in the river but then I stopped as I realized that it could probably be used to identify her killer. I mentally gave myself a pat on the back and looked at the scrap intently. When I first noticed that the pattern on the cloth matched the one from my jacket I was startled, but I just considered it a coincidence: it is a simple tartan, rather common, so it wasnt so strange. Nonetheless, the doubt creeped into my mind; I examined the wounds on the girls body and I had to admit to myself that my knife would have been more than enough to make them. I started to truly look at the girls face, trying to reconcile the pale, emaciated figure with whatever it was that attacked me. I could not tell much from her features, other than that she must have been famished. Dreamily, I peeled back her daintily nibbled lips, to reveal rows of jagged fangs and a familiar rancid smell. I left her there, uncovered, stopping only to pick up the backpack. The rest of the trek is a daze; I remember following the river up to a bridge, then getting at a turnpike and finally awakening in my car. I didnt have my pack or my canteen, but I was still clutching the knife. I checked my watch, and I was startled to realize that a whole day passed since I awoke in the woods next to the river. Although I felt feverish I could not stop there, so I drove until I reached a motel; thankfully, they didnt ask me questions, I guess they had their share of hikers getting back from excursions bloody and in a bad mood. The day after, I paid the room, ate the first decent meal in three days and drove home. I threw the knife off a bridge on the way. I managed to convince my boss that I got sick during my trip and that I needed a few days off. Luckily, this was a first for me so she seemed concerned more than annoyed. I spent the next three days in bed, scouring the internet for whatever tidbit of information I could find. Needless to say, I didnt find anything useful. That was three weeks ago. I went back to my workplace and since the wound on my left arm had almost healed I was able to keep up without arousing unwanted questions. I just wanted to get all this behind me. The last two days, however, Ive felt feverish again. I jump at the slightest sound and bright light bothers me. I feel like Im followed around all the time. Ive finally had a long talk with my doctor, where I said some rather obvious lies. Im going to start the Milwaukee protocol tonight. This might my last chance to come clean, Nosleep: I dont believe in pixies, fairies, werewolves or suchlike. I really dont, so I cant tell if I am a victim or a monster. Im leaning towards the latter. But I know that whatever it was that I killed in the forest was very young, and that it had been left to fend for herself for a very long time; I think I know the reason now. I think she had rabies.

262,vulnerability,nosleep,They called him the Shower Killer,313,433d6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/433d6b/they_called_him_the_shower_killer/,2016-01-29 00:52:46,"He was a serial killer who, unsurprisingly, often killed his victims in the shower. He would break into a lone woman's apartment, sneak up on her in the bathroom, stab her a dozen or so times and flip the corpse to let her blood drain with the water. The water was always still running when the body was found. 9 murders in 4 months baffled the local police as well as the feds asked to look in, as there was nothing to link the victims and all evidence washed away with the blood. Three of the women were in the bath, not the shower, when they were killed - that didn't stop the media at large from labelling him the Shower Killer. He was quick, brutal, and apparently random in his choices. He was a ghost. He was also the subject of my most popular series of articles in our small-town newspaper, a fact that made my near-obsession with the murders slightly more palatable to my friends and family. My boyfriend of nearly five months even shared my interest, to that same obsessive extent. Often, we would curl up on the couch and he would walk me through the scene - the surprise, the fear, the total vulnerability of being powerless, weaponless, and naked in your own home. Then he'd dive in for a toe-curling kiss until I forgot that prickly terror, the skin-crawling reality of his words. We often discussed my upcoming editorials over breakfast. This lazy Saturday morning, we talked about the latest murder. ""Maybe it's the thrill of catching someone unawares,""James suggested, spreading peanut butter across his toast. I was making coffee and couldn't see the smirk that he was most definitely wearing. He would occasionally surprise me while bathing with that very reasoning. ""I think it's about tactics. When you're naked you're already vulnerable and have nothing to fight back with."" We've had this discussion before, although he usually argues that it was probably a robbery gone wrong that escalated and gave the killer a taste for blood. After it's worked once, why change your method? ""Thrills can be tactical,"" James retorted. He has always been certain that they are crimes of passion, about a visceral thrill that matches his own passion for criminal psychology. I don't entirely disagree, but the murders have been accelerating in pace to the point where victim selection is more important than motive. They are all young women, not all pretty, not all slim, different ethnicities and backgrounds. There's one important link the police haven't found, though. ""They all take the same bus."" I tell him the bus number and he recoils as if personally offended by the information. James takes that bus too, you see, when our schedules don't match and I can't drop him off en route to my own job. ""I'm probably a suspect,"" he realises. I nod silently, quietly amused by the whole situation. He mulls this over as I munch on my toast. My cute, dorky boyfriend as a killer? We play at creepy games before sex sometimes, and he very much enjoys hearing the gory details of the crimes, but the concept is ridiculous in practice. James is too much a couch criminologist for that sort of thing. His long, strong fingers drum on the table and he abruptly jumps to his feet. ""Can I borrow your car? I've got some stuff to take care of."" Of course he does. That's normal, he was busy all week and now has errands to run. ""Of course, babe. Anniversary dinner's at six, be back by five so we can get ready."" I wink cheerfully at him but apparently he's not in the mood. Hopefully he will be more enthusiastic when I show him the outfit I have planned. I've already sent this week's article to my editor, all ready for Sunday printing - the 24hr news cycle will have reported the gory details of Friday's murder already, but the more extensive analysis linking the previous crimes (including my bus tidbit) will sell papers anyway. Despite this, I have a feeling the front page will be something different - there will be another murder tonight. The murders have been accelerating, the gaps halving each time. He wants blood. The net draws tighter, the kills sloppier. The police are going to catch him soon, I can feel it in my bones. The day passes easily, even though James doesn't return until half past five, muttering apologies. I'm in the bath. I emerge dripping wet and covered in bubbles. He stops barely three feet away, and then the kitchen knife emerges. We both tense up instantly. Our eyes are locked onto one another, so I can see the exact moment that confusion becomes betrayal and fear. James gets confused again when I cut a long gash on the outside of my forearm. ""What the fuck are you doing?"" He demands, rushing forward to pull the knife away from me. I don't let go and we stand there for a long moment, blood dripping onto the tile as we hold hands over a knife. Before he can react, I twist it up and slam the knife into his chest. ""It's just a defensive wound babe, don't worry."" He sinks to the ground, and still hasn't let go of my hand. It's cute, in a pathetic sort of way. I call the police as soon as that betrayed little spark leaves his eyes, and it doesn't take them long to put the dots together. They particularly like the shoebox of trophies. The Shower Killer took short locks of his victims' hair, something the police hadn't noticed given the layered haircuts that were in fashion. Within a day, the news is out and I turn off my phone to escape the curiousity of acquaintances. Within a week, my extensive article has been approved- it makes the front page, being an exclusive from the killer's girlfriend and last intended victim. Within a month, the fuss is forgotten. I gently caress my pencilcase and withdraw an engraved pen, the trophy from my most recent victim. My work needs just that little bit more of a push to go national... I think this one will be a cannibal. Those always get attention. "

""Well, being the king of hell, you have a lot of duties. You lose sight of the real fun. People mistake me for some big evil monster, but my only sin was loving too much. I'm doing this to remember the joy behind it all. Watching your species fail and sign over their souls to me is utterly delicious. It's an ingenious way to avenge my removal from above."" - ""You're quite a twisted son of a bitch. Aren't you?"" I laughed inappropriately and lit another cigarette; I needed it to soothe over my worries. I wasn't scared of him, I should have been, but I wasn't. I was going to die anyway, so what was the point of even living in fear. - ""You're rather peculiar and I can't say that I've come across a soul as brazen yours. Why don't you fear Me? When people call me a son of a bitch, I usually tend to burn them alive. Something about crisp flesh that drives my hounds beyond themselves."" He pulled the cigarette from my lips again and ground it into the pavement with the heel of his perfectly shone, black shoe. - I rolled my eyes and threw up my hands in forfeit; I was too exhausted to have the smoker's argument right now. ""Because I don't see the point. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it the first time we met. And, if you did choose to serve me up to your puppies, I'm sure they'd enjoy what they bit into. There's more than enough to feed a nation on these bones."" - ""You do have a point there. Well April, I don't have much time to spare, so what will it be?"" - ""Oh you mean the price I'm asking for my soul?"" - ""Your contract, yes."" He stood up and elegantly dusted the filth from his suit. - ""How long before you collect?"" - ""5 years."" - ""How will you collect?"" - ""Now that's a surprise. I can't give away all my party tricks. Now can I? Come on, hurry it up. I have other things to get through tonight."" - ""Tsk tsk and here I thought you were a gentleman. Okay, may I please have these jackasses off of my case, my designer empire successfully up and running, and most importantly, the safety of my loved ones. I don't want your little puppets trying to do business with my family."" - ""Is that all?"" He looked at me, his liquid eyes urging me to say something else. - ""Fine, it's stupid to even ask you, of all people for this, but I'd like to have a shelter for all kinds of stray animals, and enough resources to look after them all."" I could feel the confusion and disapproval radiating from him. I shrugged and looked at the pavement, ""what? I really love animals. They're better than humans."" - ""I did not see the animal thing coming. You are quite ....interesting.. Aren't you? It's a wonder why I don't see you with anyone resembling normality."" He rubbed his chin as if mentally going through my terms and deciding the value of each item, then smiled at me. ""It's a piece of cake. Now to close the deal."" - ""Where do I sign?"" I know, this was the worst thing I could have done. But let's face it. I was depressed. I didn't have anything in my life, and I needed something to come along and make things easier. I didn't care about the price; I was emotionally and physically exhausted from the lackluster life id lived. It was time to make a change. And it just so happened that Lucifer came along and offered it up on a silver platter. Five years wasn't so bad. At least I wouldn't have to endure my current bullshit any longer. - ""April, you're making a deal with the devil himself. That in itself is not a contract signed by ink, or blood. It's closed by the combining of two bodies. One being a derivative of hell and the other - human. It's the complete and utterly forbidden act that taints the human soul to its core."" He folded his arms across his chest and looked at me; pleased with his argument. - ""Are you hitting on me or something? Because that's out of the question. You can't possibly close a deal like that. That's not even a proper policy. If this is a business deal, then that's definitely sexual harassment. What's the number for Hell's Human Resources Department again?"" I stood up slowly and relied heavily on my seemingly bad attempt to provide comedic relief for a somewhat fatal agreement. - He raised his eyebrows, ""oh and making a deal with Satan, in some dodgy alleyway, is proper policy?"" - I rolled my eyes and sighed, annoyed at his valid point. He *was* right. This wasn't exactly some handshake and 'initial here' kind of contract. This was a full blown 'handing over my soul' kind of contract. ""Is it mandatory with all the salesmen of hell?"" - ""No, theirs is usually sealed with a blood pact. Being the devil has it's perks."" He grinned mischievously, and shifted his weight slightly. - Just my luck, why couldn't one of those average salesmen have sought me out? Why did it have to be *him*. There was just one problem. Well no, truthfully, there were a number of problems with this situation, but I forced them all to the back of my mind and jumped head first off of a waterfall. There were two possible endings: I would swim or I would crack my skull on the rocks below and die. The only problem that seemed to nag at my lips was that I was a virgin and, before he pitched up, I was going to die that way. It's not to say that being a virgin is wrong and weird. It's just that I had never gotten around to being intimate with someone. And now, here I was, selling my soul, sleeping with the devil, and seeing gay porn in the form of Broc and Corle. It was a night of firsts. What the fuck was I getting myself into? I cleared my throat getting ready to speak, ""Uhm so how does it work?"" - He looked at me disbelievingly , ""the acceptance of the contract?"" - I shifted uncomfortably; awkwardly folding my arms and stuttering as I formed words, "" N..no..NO of course not. I know what that is. I have sex all the time, hah I mean when am I *ever* not having sex? It's a wonder I can walk properly after all that...s...ss..sex"" I trailed off, just making things worse. I sighed and forced myself off of the topic, ""I meant when do things start happening?"" He was laughing at me. The friggin devil was laughing at me. I saw hints of red develop in the sea of green present in his eyes. - ""Oh well of course that's what you meant. What, with all the sex you're having, it's a wonder how you even remember to formulate sentences."" His tone was sarcastic and condescending and it irritated me. I shot a deathly stare at him. He finally got the hint and stopped laughing. Honestly, who knew the devil was such a dick? ""Volatile, aren't you? Well everything happens after the contract has been finalized."" ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ I won't go into deep, sordid details regarding my ""first time"" or reveal Lucifer's mannerisms and techniques in the bedroom; because, well....that's a bit too personal and I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about the whole situation. I will say this however, they call him the inventor of temptation for a reason. An *extremely* valid reason. - ""And that seals the deal. Any questions April?"" His voice was sultry and husky as he spoke. He propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at me. His body was surprisingly warm, and tender to the touch; each part of it perfectly designed and hand crafted. The warmth in his caresses had taken me by surprise, and he had actually been gentler with his advances once he noticed that I had in fact, never been intimate with anyone before him; and had no clue what I was doing. He had guided me patiently through each motion as a lover would. At one point I had forgotten who he really was and saw him as just that - an intense lover. - My innards were in turmoil and my mind had started a war within itself. What the hell had I done? I was close to hyperventilating and tried to calm myself down. I blinked up at the ceiling, gripping my black duvet over my breasts; suddenly self conscious. My parents were away. My parents were away and instead of drinking till I passed out, like a normal human being, I was screwing the devil; *and* selling my soul. Dad would be soooooo proud. Hmm...... dad would lose his mind. That thought somehow made me want to do it all over again. I smiled up at the ceiling, lazily turning to look at those liquid lava eyes. ""A few. Your eyes have changed color."" - ""Yes, I know. They change with my mood. What color are they now?"" - ""Orange. They were green before with hints of red, but now they look like lava."" - ""Ahh green is when I'm calm and amused. Red speckles are when I'm enjoying myself and orange is when I'm excited."" - ""Why are you exci......"" I looked away, noticing a cloaked figure standing in the far side of the room. It was just watching us. The musty woolen cloak hung lifelessly over it's body, shielding every part of it from my view. I could see absolutely nothing, just deep black spaces where his hands and face should be. It was as if a cloak had come to life on it's own will. Wide eyed and panicking, I backed up against Lucifer, speaking fast and tripping over my words, ""What the hell is that? Where did it come from? Can you see it? What the hell is going on here!?"" I don't even know why I had sought comfort in the devils arms, it just happened. Similarly to a reflex- I didn't control it. - ""Calm down April, he is your little helper from hell."" He spoke calmly, stroking his hand down my arm. I was not expecting him to be this attentive to my needs. He was turning out to be a kinder person than the usual human ones. - ""*THAT* does not look like a helper. That looks like the grim reapers boss! This was not mentioned in the terms of our contract."" I huffed at him, shoving him away from me and keeping a cautious eye on the hooded stranger. - ""He is your helper, because he is your reminder. As the years go by, he will get closer. Reminding you of the deal you've made with me and the time you have left. Nobody will see him besides you. I assure you."" - ""And you failed to mention my creepy stalker before? That was honestly a son of a bitch move."" - ""I am the devil after all."" He clicked his fingers and the figure was gone. His lips curled into a smile as he kissed my lips with his, whispering softly, ""He's gone now, it's just you and I here. Shall we go over the contract a few more times?"" His fingers tangled themselves in my hair. - Somewhat relieved that my creepy stalker was gone, and distracted by the calmness that dripped from his every word; I egged him on a little. ""So do your eyes change to orange with every contract you sign?"" - ""Surprisingly not. Not every contract I sign is with an attractive young woman with a razor sharp wit and intelligent mind. It's mostly just old, graying men wishing for money, youth, big dicks and dozens of young, bouncy girlfriends. In those cases, I resort to the blood pact to sign off on the deal. His arm slid around my lower back, pulling me against him. - ""My gosh, the Devil is one helluva smooth talker."" ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ It's been 4years and 11months since I signed the contract with Lucifer. He has visited me at least once every 2 weeks, apparently to check on the progress of my remaining time. It usually always ends with us reviewing my contract over and over again. Oh shut up, I know what you're saying behind your screen, and I know. It's completely ridiculous to sleep with the devil. Let alone *keep sleeping* with him on a regular basis. But, in my defense, the temptation is downright impossible to resist. And he's just, *so* mouthwateringly good. ------------------------------------ Over the years, my business has flourished and my designs can be seen spearheading the best of the best fashion shows. Corle and Broc have gotten married (I know, I didn't see that coming either) and my dad, has finally warmed up to me. He's even gone so far as to say he's proud of me. My favorite of all - The animal shelter is doing splendidly, each and every one of our little children are well fed, played with and treated. Good things aside, the cloaked figure has slowly been closing the distance between us. As time has passed by, he's been muttering things in a different language, seemingly chanting the same things over and over again. I assume it's some sort of reminder. Similar to an alarm clock, except this one doesn't have a snooze button. ------------------------------------ The colours have started to fade slowly. Once bright green leaves, have now dulled to lifeless black smudges over the years. I've started seeing people who are trapped between life and death, lingering around aimlessly. Others who can't see them, walk straight through the souls of loved ones that have past but haven't gone to the other side yet. I Stayed at my parents' place for the weekend of my deadline, somehow all the success of my wish, has made me realize, that all I really want - is to be with my family in my final days. I laid awake under a poster of a kitten rolling around a ball of yarn, tears welling in my eyes. It was my last night and the cloaked figure was right beside me. Bending over me and partially obscuring the view of the carefree ginger kitten. I breathed in deeply, and looked at the bedside clock. Two more hours before id be dragged to hell. I sniffled and picked up Pancake. His soft purring comforting me as I wept into his fur, holding him close to me and kissing him a few more times. I couldn't imagine not seeing him ever again. I stepped aside from the cloaked figure and made my way into the backyard where Whiskers and Pudding tackled me to the ground. They coated me in their wet kisses and refused to let me stand up. After a while they settled by my side as I watched the stars above. Their soft whining a sign that they knew something was wrong. Regret bathed me as I realized - i would never see any of these things again. The cloaked figure standing by my head, chanting the loudest it's ever been, didn't seem to phase both Whiskers and Pudding. My grief drowned out the deafening noise. I couldn't let it get to me. Not yet. I cuddled each of my babies again, kissed them on their noses and dragged myself back inside. My eyes aching from the tears that fell. I needed to say goodbye to my parents. They were asleep by now. I looked at my watch, one hour remained. The chanting getting louder by the minute; it wasn't just one voice anymore. It was many. Their voices causing all the nerve endings present in each of my muscles, to tremble. More cloaked figures had made their way towards me. Circling me. Their voices turned from chanting to screaming. Bloodthirsty screams that pierced my ear drums. Tears streaked my face as I sunk to the floor infront of my parents' bedroom door. I started screaming, rocking back and forth on my haunches. I pleaded loudly, begging for more time to say goodbye. I couldn't believe it was almost over. I couldn't believe id traded in whatever time I had left, to settle a silly underlying feud with my dad. I knelt down, touching the floor, my body exhausted from the wailing that riddled through it. The cloaked figures started to reach out to me, their long robes covering the light above. I still couldn't see their hands. There were still no bodies beneath the woolen masses. I clung to one last hope. Lucifer. Irrational I know, but I thought that maybe I could somehow make another deal with him. ------------------------------------ Just as the robes brushed against my body, I looked down at the floor, and closed my eyes tightly; trying in vain to drown out their maddening crescendo. I licked the tears off of my lips and pleadingly whispered, ""Lucifer please."" I didn't expect him to come. I mean why would the devil answer a house call. It was unheard of right? Well in that moment, of being tugged back and forth, I decided that it wouldn't hurt to try. I'd be dead anyway. The tugging stopped, and Satan's Little Helpers were gone. I opened my eyes, breathing heavily as I cautiously looked up and down the passage. The beige walls were undisturbed. They were all gone. ------------------------------------ I rushed back to my room, irrationally locking the door behind me and pacing frantically. I didn't know what the hell was going on and I was talking to myself. My ripped and hanging clothing, matched my tousled hair and swollen eyes. I was losing my mind. Surely I had to be losing my mind? What if it was all a hallucination, and it was my hard work that got me to where I am now? What if my mind made up the whole ordeal with Lucifer? What was real? What do I believe now? But most importantly, how do I know which version of the story to trust? My mind was a war zone; possible reasons for my demise were rocketing back and forth and ricocheting off of the perimeter of my brain. - ""You called?"" His voice snapped me out of my thought process. I stared at his now purple eyes- a clear sign of his irritation. I looked at him briefly and continued to pace. - ""No, no, no... You can't be real. This can't be real. My mind is playing tricks on me. I'm going insane."" I paced frantically, insanity had reared it's ugly head and obscured the line between reality and fiction. - ""I assure you April, it's all real."" He placed his hand on my shoulder, and forced me to look at him. The purple soon faded to blue - eagerness. - ""I'm not ready yet. I don't want to go to hell. Now yet. I'm not ready for an eternity in some overcrowded sauna."" I pulled myself away from him and chewed on my fingernails nervously. - ""Oh it won't really be an eternity. You're my pet, so I'm offering you a choice that the others don't even have the luxury of making. You'd go through the mandatory ....lessons... And soon become an intern of hell itself. My personal intern. After which you'll graduate into the perfect student. You'll go out there, and recruit more people just like you to fill the pit with souls and troops. Think of it as climbing the corporate ladder- forever. Only in this instance, your boss would literally be the devil."" - ""You want me to collect souls for you? Hahahaha oh that's a good one."" I started laughing again. It was clearly a joke. No way he could be serious about something as tremendous as that. Was this a figment of my imagination? - ""I don't understand why you're laughing April. It's actually an easy out compared to what will happen if you refuse my kind gesture."" He sat on my bed, neatly folding his arms and watching me as I started pacing again. - ""That's crazy. I can't. Those are innocent souls! You can't possibly expect me to just jump on the band wagon and start recruiting for you."" - ""Innocent? Humans are far from innocent. They rape, murder, torture and steal from one another. Yet I am the bad guy for wanting to control their population."" He ran his fingers through his tousled hair, trying to keep himself from getting visibly agitated. ""Plus, If you don't, you'll get thrown into the pit and have your innards carved to pieces. At the end of it, when all that's left is complete mush, you'll be sewn back together again, only to be ripped apart in a number of different ways. Time is nonexistent in Hell, April . And considering you are my pet project, I'd be there personally to oversee it all. So, as you can see, you could choose to be my student, or choose to be my chew toy."" He smiled and shrugged nonchalantly. ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ I'd like to say that I chose the high road and endured endless torturous punishments for my crimes. But I didn't. I chose to be his student. After everything I'd been through, all the rejections; taunting and snide comments had lured me into the blackness. People were cruel. And nothing would change that. They consume and destroy everything they touch. What better punishment for their selfish nature, than an eternity in hell? ------------------------------------ He didnt kill me that night or drag me to hell for that matter , instead he trained me. I was still human. A part of me at least. A very small part at that. He let me keep that part, and the animal shelter as a reward for all the souls I've brought to him. He fed me on his blood, making me stronger each night, allowing it to fuel my blood lust and hate towards mankind. I wasn't a demon. I wasn't a vampire. I was the darkest form of life that walked the earth. I was an unrestrained human being, with no barriers to cage my mind; that fed on the suffering of others. Soon enough he let me do as I wished. As long as the numbers were rolling, I was free to have what I wanted and do what was necessary to have it. ------------------------------------ Human blood, was sweet. It tasted like chocolate brownies lathered in caramel sauce and doused in chocolate ice cream. It was pure heaven to me. I savored the little ones especially. They were impossibly sweeter. Lucifer doted on me, feeding my every whim and watching as I grew in experience. I could see the warmth and pride in his fixed molten gaze. The warmth that once filled my life, was now replaced with a cold, demented mind that lacked a withholding soul. ------------------------------------ I had finally belonged. I was no longer alone. I was respected and loved for what I had done and would continue to do. Not a single judgmental glance would come my way. I was his star player and I knew it. Nothing could stop me. Not when I had this kind of power. He had appointed me as his right hand, to rule over and supervise all of his puppets that walked the Earth, while he ran Hell. A perfect harmony if you ask me. A perfect blending of sensuous chaos and lust. ------------------------------------ As I lay here on my bed, in the same black bedroom; looking up at this screen. I can't help but smile. It's clear my little toys have done me proud. If not, would any of these other stories even be here? I'm not a complete monster, I've kept my family alive and thriving; and I even visit them occasionally, similarly to what I was doing right now. Never forget where you came from, right? - ""Good evening April."" His seductive voice caressed my skin. This bond between us was inevitable. - ""What brings the royal highness himself into my little bedroom?"" - He slid on top of me and brushed his lips along mine. ""I have a present for you."" ------------------------------------ That night, just as he uncovered my eyes, he whispered in my ear, ""happy 10th year anniversary Darling."" In front of me was a small house. There were three bedrooms, that housed three siblings, whose parents had died when they were very young. Apparently Lucifer had held each of their contracts. One of them had made a deal for successful careers to be thrust upon all three of them, whilst another had wanted a home to house them all; thus freeing themselves from the foster system that had failed them all those years. The remaining one, the youngest, had signed a contract that resulted in the death of their last recorded foster parents. It was said that they had endured years of abuse and torment at the hands of a seemingly average husband and wife. ------------------------------------ They were all each other had in this world. They were beautiful young adults aged between 22 and 28. Two boys and one girl. I felt Lucifer watching me, waiting for me to notice what was going to happen. And then I saw it, the windows were opened and I could see the entire scene play out, as if on the set of a Broadway Show. The three siblings were watching tv in the front living room, behind them was a kitchen and immediately to the right, was a bedroom. I watched excitedly as one of our puppets stood behind the couch they were on. It was the one we always used when culling the young adult population, because it never failed. There's just something so creepy about a young murderous child. ------------------------------------ It was a short, 9 year old, little girl whose skin was grey and covered in bruises and cuts. Her arms were magnificently broken at awkward angles and her legs were bowed. She was clothed in a flimsy black dress that bared torn flesh through the holes. I smiled as I admired my personal work of art. She was barefoot and the hem of her dress dripped with blood. It wasn't her own blood of course, because her wounds didn't bleed. My gaze fell onto her spectacular bloodshot eyes. One had been gauged out and dangling from it's socket, while the other was partially covered by long, thick, flowing, black hair that brushed her ankles as she walked. She had a gaping slash roaming from her ear, through to her collar bone. The skin flapped with the rhythm of her steps. In her mutilated hands, she wielded a piece of a broken mirror that was streaked with blood. - ""Here comes the best part my love."" He whispered in my ear and stood behind me; gripping my shoulders in his hands. - The young girl stepped closer to the three unsuspecting siblings, raised her hand and brought it down into the throat of the eldest boy. The sheer look of horror that crossed their faces was utterly divine. I could taste their fear. The girl had started screaming and flailing her arms frantically. The remaining boy had to drag her across to the bedroom. Locking the doors behind them. I walked up the bedroom window, watching intently. They could hear their predator scraping at their door. The boy turned to the window and saw me. He begged me to help them. His eyes grew wide as he saw a smile stretch across my face. Their bedroom door swung open, and the girl limped towards them, dragging the head of their brother behind her like a lifeless rag doll. She opened her mouth and threw her head back, shrieking with laughter and blocking their way out. - ""Let the sister live. She will be my own pet project."" I whispered softly over my shoulder. His warm hands grasped my hips and held me closely. - ""Anything for my Love."" - Our puppet made her way to the remaining boy and cornered him. His sister frozen with fear as she watched her carve into him like a turkey on Christmas. With each swing, I watched the sister's face. I could see it. The last inkling of faith in humanity, fading. The warmth had drained from her body. She had become the epitome of loneliness, vulnerability and anger in a matter of minutes. I could see the light in her eyes burn out and the insanity settle in; She was now ripe for the picking. - I turned to lucifer and slid my arms around his neck, kissing him softly before whispering, ""You never cease to amaze me darling."" - We kissed passionately. The scene unfolding behind us; a perfect background to the intensity that followed. ------------------------------------ The young sister, ironically named Mary, would later become my apprentice, and soon my colleague. Over the years we have watched as our puppets stalked and tormented ""innocent"" people, and drained the humanity from their very being; a recipe that ensured the best possible apprentices suited for life in Hell. After all, my priority, was to recruit only the best as Hell's troops. ------------------------------------ Together, we came up with ingenious methods in trapping the human soul and ripping the faith from their pathetic bodies. I never let her feed though. Not just yet. I was depending solely on the unpredictability and pure irrationality of the human mind. Its remarkable just how fragile the mind is. All that it requires is a little nudge in the right direction, and there you have it - The Perfect Weapon. So I ask you again, can you truly trust your mind? Or would you rather risk living in the unknown, where nightmares are often written of as little tricks of the imagination?"
264,vulnerability,nosleep,Untitled 1.doc,177,474eja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/474eja/untitled_1doc/,2016-02-23 13:13:50,"There are strange things on the dark web. Everyone knows this. I am a hoarder, but instead of hoarding material things, I have a neat little external Western Digital hard drive holding just over two thousand links, images and videos that I've found. I won't go into what's in there, but you can imagine. One thing people don't realise about the dark web is that it's not just for creeps and lunatics, but companies. It's a convenient place to experiment with a piece of code, or try out a new program, or see what happens when you poke the internet too much. That's where I found Untitled 1, among these company addresses. I didn't know it was a company address at first, because when you find a new link you have no idea what you're going to find. Untitled 1 downloaded straight into my virtual downloads folder, clearly thinking it was my desktop. I expected malware, but disguised as a document file? Who are they fooling? The only thing that made me curious was that I didn't have Word installed, but the icon for Word was there. A well disguised executable? Perhaps. I prepared my computer for a torrent of scripts, and then double-clicked on the document. Word did open up. The splash screen disappeared leaving just a white sheet. It was empty. I paused, waiting for something to happen. Then something did. An ellipsis blinked in and out. Hello? popped up on the first line. I stared back not sure what the hell was going on. Type something. I did nothing. Please. I felt too ridiculous to actually type anything. What would I even type? What the hell is this? I see. It's no problem. I'll get your attention another way. There was a second pause before a picture appeared, as if it had just been copy-pasted. It was a screenshot of my desktop. Except it was a few years old. I could tell from the gaudy wallpaper. My fingers scraped the keyboard, hesitant. This doesn't seem good. Not for you, no it doesn't. What is this? I carefully tapped. What do you think? A piece of software downloaded straight to your computer. But you're not just some piece of malware... No, I am. Malware doesn't talk to people. Says who? He, it, had a point. I've read my share of cyberpunk, so I figured this would go south almost immediately. I didn't want to play this game. I got up and went for the plug. My speakers burst into life with static. I jumped back startled. In big bold letters, I read, It will take you just over a second to hit the switch. I can upload enough to ruin your life in half that time. Sit down. I sat back down. This is insane. Where to start, then, good friend? Fuck. Take your pick. You have my whole computer to play with. Well, let's get the obvious out of the way. I've noticed a lot of porn stashed away in some of these parts. No surprise there I suppose. Interesting choices though. Beastiality? What the hell got you into that? Are you fucking with me or do you want an answer? I'm curious. I don't know. I guess my porn habits spiralled out of control. Haha you think so? Jesus. Were you programmed by a complete tosser? I'm not sure, never met the guy. If you do, tell him to go fuck himself. No problem. But you know, I'm curious about something else. Go on. Where's all the child porn? What? Of your daughter, you know? I froze. Did she bleed the first time? I stared coldly into the screen. You know there's a bunch of download links in your history that don't go anywhere. Odd. Maybe you've been stashing them somewhere else? That external hard drive in the corner maybe? I stared powerless. Do me a favour, will you? Plug it in. I couldn't move. I couldn't feel my feet. Plug it in Jack. An infinity passed. Jack. Okay, look, I'll play some Bolero. Go on now. Bolero gently spilled out of the speakers. I got up and brought the hard drive back. The cable slid into the slot. The light on the front blinked an innocent, neutral blue. Ah here it comes. I felt lifeless. My mind was doing back flips trying to figure out what was happening. This was too surreal. This was too much. Remember what were you up to about ten years ago? I could barely type. Just wondering. If I'm honest, I already know. You had plans. You were exercising and eating healthy. You had a beautiful wife. You were running a start-up with huge potential. It seems like you had a dream Jack. What happened to that dream? After a moment of vulnerability I typed, It stayed a dream. I felt the warmth of tears hit my lap. That's right. That guy ten years ago, what would he think of you now? I didn't reply. The thing is, that saint, he's you. You're not two people. You're the same fucked up bastard. Now everyone's going to know. I wiped the tears off my face. You know, you piece of shit, you're half right. Is that right? I want to show you something. There's a picture called 73746f70. It's pretty buried, might be tricky to find it. No problem, got it. What do you see? Hmm, I- Suddenly the computer fans spurred to a holt. The lights died out. Bolero whined away. The computer was finally off. I sat back relieved. I breathed deeply, closing my eyes. This was a trick I wouldn't be able to use again. It would know next time, but that's if I'm ever dumb enough to open it again. I'll wipe the whole machine tomorrow. I unplugged the hard drive, put it back in the corner, and turned on my chunky laptop instead. The screen blinded me initially and then dimmed down. I had gotten lucky this time. I knew it. But I've been given another chance, so screw it. I put my log in details in. The windows dial twirled for a few moments before I was greeted with a familiar, gaudy looking wallpaper..."
265,vulnerability,nosleep,Bedbug?,29,4791vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4791vz/bedbug/,2016-02-24 09:00:11,"I can't take my eyes off of my computer. &amp;nbsp; I never thought this would happen, never truly believed I'd experience something like this. My eyes hurt from the screen's brightness, even if I'm using Flux, even if I've dimmed it down to as low as it can go. The heat is making me dizzy. I'm tired, I need to sleep, to close my eyes... &amp;nbsp; But I can't. It'll catch me. &amp;nbsp; It's been hours and I can feel its presence, slick and heavy, occupying my room. I can hear it scuttling and slithering along my walls, and there is a terrible skittering, like a million knives screeching against dinner plates at an inhuman speed. A suffocating halo of humidity cocoons my neck and head, its hot breath lapping at the corners of my face, and the stretching sound of taut tissue is just barely perceivable- but I cant *see* it in my peripheral vision. I can only hear the sliding of its tongue against the inside of its mouth. It's waiting for me to give in, it senses my vulnerability in the way my throat muscles convulse, jaw tenses, and cheeks shudder as I try to hide a yawn. It doesn't deserve the satisfaction of seeing my exhaustion when it's so obviously excited, so visibly ready to make its move as soon as I show any carelessness. &amp;nbsp; I wish I could at least rest against something. Ive been in this uncomfortable half-squat, half-sitting position for this whole time- almost seven hours now, or at least that's what my laptop's time display is telling me. My back aches, and I want to slouch, just a little, but it'll get me. No, I can't move. &amp;nbsp; It's been trying to make me move this whole time, surrounding me with the smothering stench of death, of shit, piss, roadkill roasting in the sun, hoping for a reaction. Its even been knocking over my books, pushing them almost playfully from my shelves, rolling my pens off of my desk in an attempt to get me to glance over, turn my head ever so slightly- but I know better. &amp;nbsp; It pounced as soon as I got home from work and opened my laptop in my dark room, which was around 3:00 am. God knows how long its been waiting in my room. When I heard the gag in its throat, the sick, suction sound of a well lubricated, constricting esophagus inches behind my head, I froze. Of course, I didnt truly know that I needed to, that I had just saved myself. &amp;nbsp; Maybe that isnt the right phrase- Im nowhere near safe. I dont know where to go from here. I thought that it would disappear when the sun came up, just like in the stories I read where evil beings basically retreat, or evaporate and crumble into dust when kissed by the rays of the sun, but that didnt happen. The only advantage (if I could call it that) the light brought through the small opening between my bedroom curtains, was sight. When I turned on my webcam, which had been useless through the night because my eyes couldnt handle the strain of any light that would allow me to use it, I wanted to scream. And to think I almost fucking turned to look at the dawning sun, too. &amp;nbsp; Its open jaws completely enveloped my head, riddled with a disgusting amount of pincers dripping with what seemed to be saliva. If I moved even an inch in any direction, my face would be impaled with one of its fangs. I wouldve called it a centipede if it didnt have so many. Its body, thicker than my goddamn fridge, draped all over the wall behind me like a disturbing tangle of morbid, brown party streamers. Piles of its body extended well beyond my laptop screen, the legs twitching in blurs. I assume its hundreds of feet long, with hundreds of feet. Thats how it had been knocking over my stuff- it didnt even have to move. Since its comfortably nested itself in a coil that fills my room, its legs, twice as long as my arms, are spread so generously that it could reach anything it pleased. At one point, they seemed to thrum rhythmically on my desk (which was long enough for only six of its legs), as if they were fingers- the way I would drum my fingers while waiting for my food to come at a restaurant. &amp;nbsp; And now, the fucking monster *chirped*. Because of its proximity, the sound was a deafening, shrill whistle right against my neck. It knows I can see it. I think it likes the view of the webcam, how stressful I look caged within its jaws, with my bloodshot eyes and cheeks ruddy from its goddamn moist respiration. After all these hours, Ive began to perspire profusely because of its putrid, steamy breath that has been encasing my head. I dont know if the drops that are falling onto my fingers as I type this are my sweat or its drool. I would really love to post the recording of this ordeal, but I think Im going to email my mom or something. Who the *fuck* knows why I prioritized posting this on here before alerting a significant person in my life. I should have deposited some money on Skype so I could make a call from my computer, maybe I could've called the cops just in time for them to contain this thing... Im going to submit this now. I think its done waiting. I can feel pressure on the sides of my skull."

267,vulnerability,nosleep,The patient that nearly drove me out of medicine (part 6),1543,3z04ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3z04ia/the_patient_that_nearly_drove_me_out_of_medicine/,2016-01-01 19:49:59,"Part 1: URL Part 2: URL Part 3: URL Part 4: URL Part 5: URL Happy New Year, you sick bastards. I would've waited to post this, only it seemed a fitting thank you for all the positive feedback you've given me, however genuine it may or may not have been. I honestly feel emboldened to continue telling this story, even if it proves my own insanity, and I thank you for giving me the courage, Consider this my personal tribute. Let's continue from where I left off in part 5. The ten minutes it took to arrive at Dr. G-----s office were the longest ten minutes Ive ever experienced. I had no idea what would happen to me, or even what just had. I kept replaying the things Joe had said in my own mind, then going back over Dr. G-----s warnings about his madness being contagious, wondering which was true, or if everyone had just been lying to me the whole time. *Was* I going crazy? Had the stress of being caught simply made me snap? If I *had* been sane before getting caught, did that mean that Dr. G----- and her minions might still do something to me? If I hadnt been, when had Joes madness spread to me? Was I insane even now? If I was, then why did everything still seem so grounded and real around me? And if I was sane, then how had Joe been able to laugh in *exactly* the right way to remind me of my worst childhood nightmare: of the nightmare that had made me realize what my worst fear was in the first place? My frantic, confused, panicky thoughts were interrupted as Hank yanked the door to Dr. G-----s office open and shoved me inside without a word. My nose nearly made contact with the carpet as I fell forward from his push, and it took me a moment to steady myself and realize who was in the room with me. Dr. G----- was there, of course, leaning on her desk and glaring down at me with an expression that made me think of a hawk regarding a rotting carcass and deciding it wasnt worth eating. But she wasnt the only one at the desk. Seated behind her, in the well-appointed leather armchair usually reserved for the Chief of Medicine, sat a wizened, tired looking old man in a heavily patched sport coat, regarding me with hard eyes over a pair of well-worn silver spectacles. I had no idea who this stranger was, but if Dr. G----- was letting him use her chair, then he was obviously someone important. He looked far too old to be a plainclothes detective, as his wrinkled face and thinning silver hair marked him as a man who couldnt have been less than 70 or 80 years old. But who else could he be? The man cleared his throat and spoke in a patrician sounding, Mid-Atlantic accent that seemed oddly familiar to me, even though I couldnt place it. So this is the latest one, is it, Rose? Dr. G----- didnt reply, but simply nodded. The gesture immediately struck me as out of place, and in a moment, I realized why. Her expression as shed inclined her head had none of the curtness or haughtiness Id seen her display toward me. Instead, it was almost girlish in its deference. Not caring about the cause at that moment, but simply glad to have scented weakness, I pushed myself to my feet and jabbed my finger at her accusingly. Alright, I barked, I dont know if youre planning to fire me, or do something worse, but before you do, I want some *fucking* Parker--, began Dr. G-----, but I barreled right past her. answers! Did you think you could mislead me about a patient and that Id take it lying down? Is all that crap in Joes file just there to keep him here? Parker And even if it isnt, why did you send your two thugs to spy on me every chance they got if youve got nothing to hide? Whyd you have one of them drag me here like Im a prisoner? And how much have you been spying on me, if you knew what I was *PARKER.* Dr. G-----s white hot voice seared through the room and almost on instinct, I shut up. The old man behind the desk chuckled drily. Hes a feisty one. Reminds me of someone, Rose, he said. Dr. G-----s pained expression gave me another momentary bit of courage. And thats another thing. Who the hell are Parker, you are going to want to shut up and sit down right now before you say something we both regret, Dr. G----- hissed at me, standing up from her leaning position. She was still barely taller than me in her heels, but her aspect and ramrod straight posture made her almost tower as she said it. Not wanting to push any luck I might have, I cast my eyes around for the nearest chair and sat down immediately. She exhaled slowly and leaned back on her desk. Now, she said, lets get one thing straight before we go any further, Parker. I have no intention of hurting you. And, although you pushed your luck on this point *very* far, I am not going to fire you, either. My mouth fell open. She gave a scornful laugh. Quiet, I see. Good. Keep it that way, because as of now, you havent said anything that suggests youve done anything wrong, and therefore, whatever you *might* have been planning to do in Joes room tonight, we can both ignore it, she said smoothly. Now, to answer both your implicit *and* explicit questions, I sent my orderlies to watch you because that has been standard procedure for every doctor Joes had since 1983. Normally, we only send them to watch every few weeks, but the reaction you had after your first session with him convinced me we should keep you under more constant surveillance. I started to ask a question, but her hand shot up so quickly that I clapped my mouth shut as if on command. First off, you spent almost twice as long in Joes room as anyone else has on their first session. Secondly, you didnt look afraid so much as queasy and uncertain, neither of which portended that youd gotten the same experience as his other doctors. In fact, the more we watched you, the less like his other doctors you got. For one thing, you kept going back in for similarly long sessions, and sometimes you even looked happy or relieved when you walked out. It didnt make any sense to the orderlies, or to me. So I did what any physician faced with a mystery does. I got a second opinion. Thats where I come in, said the older man. Im coming to you, Dr. G----- shot over her shoulder at the old man reproachfully. She turned back to me. I suppose this is as good a time as any to introduce the two of you. Parker, meet Dr. Thomas A------, the first man to treat Joe, and my earliest mentor as a psychiatrist. Suddenly, I realized where I recognized his voice from. It was, in fact, simply an aged version of the voice Id heard on the tape of Joes first session. I almost had trouble believing it. If Dr. A------ was still alive, he mustve been quite old, yet his mental lucidity was clearly not only intact, but evidently just as sharp as it had been 20 years ago. Though, I thought, however sharp Dr. A------s mind was, it couldnt be as sharp as his eyes as he looked at me. After surveying me for a moment, the older man nodded. A pleasure, Parker, he said. Though I really cant say Im as impressed with you as Id like to be. You might have the distinction of being the worst failure as a physician that Joe has ever had, given what we seem to have caught you trying to do. The words felt like acid poured over an open wound. Id never heard such harshness delivered with such impersonal coolness in my life. My face must have fallen, because the old man gave me an even sterner look. Not used to being told youre a fool, I see, he said. Well, you are, and thank God youre a predictable one. Otherwise your idiocy might have done real damage. And to answer your question of how I knew what you were going to do, its simple. Rose told me that your greatest fear is not being able to save someone you care about. She also told me that there was no one on staff who mattered to you, and that everyone who did matter was likely well out of reach of anyone locked in this hospital. It followed from those facts that the only way for Joe to make you experience your worst fear was to make you care about  and fail to save -- *him.* He gave an exasperated sigh and looked up at Dr. G-----. I dont blame you for not seeing it, Rose, you fell victim to a similar bit of trickery, if I recall correctly. Dr. G----- flushed beet red, which made Dr. A------ roll his eyes. Yes, I know, you hate being told what a fool you can be just as much as our boy, here, but you were young. You grew out of it, he said with slightly more gentleness, before turning back to me and resuming his stony demeanor. Which is something youll have to do, and fast, after that stunt you attempted tonight, Parker. Id have fired you on the spot, but Rose has a high opinion of your intellect and thinks you might be able to give us some insight into that walking mental plague we call a patient. Thats enough, Thomas, said Dr. G-----. I dont want to make the poor kid quit just yet. And anyway, even though you ended up being right, your hypothesis *was* only a guess. I know how you like to show off, but I think Parker is much more likely to learn his lesson once he finds out how we *knew* what he was going to do. Dr. A------ waved his hand irritably, as if to say, Well, get on with it, then. Dr. G----- turned back to me and cleared her throat. Parker, there is a reason I keep referring to what you were planning to do in the vaguest possible terms. Its because I want to be able to keep plausible deniability. You see, we only have one person who claims to have heard you confess your intentions, and given who that is, we can dismiss it so long as you dont say anything explicitly confessional. Now, Im going to tell you who our witness is, but before I do, you have to promise that youre not going to say something stupid that confirms their accusation. Deal? Feeling bewildered at what I might be about to hear, I nodded slowly. At that point, my relief at the lengths she was going to in order to let me keep my job was all that kept me from screaming with confusion. Dr. G---- gave me a brittle smile. Good. Parker, we brought you here because one of Joes orderlies told us hed heard that you were planning to help Joe escape from the hospital. And when we asked how he knew, he said hed been asked to tell us  by Joe himself. As the weight of those words slammed into me, I realized that even if Id wanted to confess, I couldnt have. All of a sudden, my spine was ice, my mouth was dry, and I felt like I might throw up if I let myself try to speak. Seeing my expression, Dr. G----- opened a drawer in her desk and pulled out a bottle of what looked like Scotch, as well as a glass. She poured a generous helping and handed it to me. Drink that, you look like you need it, she said. Doctors orders. Despite the roiling feeling in my stomach, I did as she ordered. At first, it made me feel sicker, but then a numbing warmth spread over my brain and I felt my muscles relax ever so slightly. It was a welcome relief after what Id just heard. Dr. G----- gave me a sympathetic look. Dr. A------, however, simply looked grimly amused. Rose, you disappoint me, he said. I never drank a drop of that stuff and I withstood what that little shit could do to people. Oh shut up, Thomas, said Dr. G----- as she pulled out another glass and poured herself a drink. We cant all be puritans. Evidently, said Dr. A------. Nevertheless, I think youve done enough talking. This miscreant needs to tell us just what the hell he was thinking before we go any further. Despite being on the job only a month, he might have spent more time actually talking to Joe than most of the others. He needs to tell us what happened, and what he knows. Maybe it was the shock of what Id just heard, maybe it was all my anger looking for a new outlet after everything that had motivated it had been stripped away, maybe it was the Scotch, or maybe it was all of the above, but something snapped in me then. I was sick of being talked about so dismissively, as if I were a naughty child who wasnt even there. I was sick of having these revelations dumped on me without getting any chance to process them. But more than anything else, I was sick to my stomach at the thought that I might have just been set up to fail. I glared back across the table at Dr. A------, pouring enough contempt into my gaze to match his cool, disdainful look a hundred times over. Not a chance, old man, I said, not even stopping in the face of Dr. G-----s gasp of outrage. From what Ive gathered, you and your student here put me on a collision course with something you fully expected to hurt me, and didnt even tell me everything you knew before I went in. I wasnt supposed to cure him, was I? I was just a lab rat for you and her, because you wanted to see what he did to me. Well, Im done with it. If you want to know what I found out talking to him, then youd better let me in on what you know. All of it. Like why she tried to commit suicide, or why you gave up on treating him in the first fucking place, or why you kept putting vulnerable patients in harms way long after you knew what he was capable of. There was the sound of a dull thud, and I realized that Dr. G----- had dropped her glass in shock. Dr. A------, however, appeared unruffled, though I could tell that whatever air of geniality hed tried to assume had dropped as soon as Id finished speaking. The effect wouldve cowed me instantly if I hadnt been so full of my own righteous anger. Id felt like a small animal staring down a predator when facing Dr. G-----, but meeting the bloodless, icy gaze of that hunched over old man, I barely felt acknowledged as a living being at all. More like a statistic that had had the effrontery to talk back to him. But I didnt back down. I met his eyes for a long, terrible pause before he finally settled back in his chair and gave an irritated snort. Well, theres probably no harm in giving you a bit more information, he said. Lord knows I have little enough to do tonight. But understand this, Parker. If you want to hear all the details, then youll start by accepting this: There is no curing that horror downstairs. There is only containing him. I didnt nod. Im his doctor, I said with deliberate coldness. Ill be the judge of that. If looks could kill, Dr. A------s expression probably would have rendered my corpse unrecognizable. Yes, I suppose you will, he said softly, and when he spoke again, his voice was cold enough to freeze the Atlantic Ocean. But just as you were earlier this evening, you are wrong on a very important point: *You* are not his doctor. You are, and have only *ever* been, just a tool to get data on him. *I* am his doctor, and I have born that cross since he first entered this hospital. It took away my career, and its going to take away my retirement. It is my lifes work. It would be Roses when Im gone, but I dont intend to leave it unsolved that long. You do not, and will *never* understand what it is to be the last person standing between Joe and a world that cannot understand or resist him. So keep a civil tongue in your head from now on, or youll find yourself on the curb. Anger tempted me to reply, but some part of me knew it would be a terrible idea. This was all the concession I was going to get out of this bitter, proud man, and it was more than I had any right to expect. So, forcing my frustration down to a simmer, I gave him the most deferential nod that I could. It seemed to appease him. Well, then, he said. Rose, why dont you tell him about the last smart, headstrong young doctor to try and treat our pet monster? I looked up at Dr. G-----, and to my surprise, she wasnt looking at me with the aloof air shed used before. Instead, her eyes were filled with sadness and pity. Im so sorry, she mouthed, so that only I could see. Then, she began speaking in the crisp voice of a physician presenting her findings. When I began to treat Joe, he was only six years old, and had been admitted to the hospital barely a month before being assigned to me, she began. At the time, as you know from reading my notes, my theory was simple: that he was showing the signs of sadistic personality disorder and sociopathy as a result of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder brought on by his years of untreated night terrors, which were able to disturb him so successfully because of their apparent comorbidity with sleep paralysis and acute entomophobia. His evident psychological progeria was simply a defense mechanism designed to make him seem as if he had more control over the situation than he did, and his monstrous behavior was an act designed to make him feel more confident in facing the monster he imagined. Frankly, I thought the whole thing was embarrassingly easy, and a waste of my time, as you probably guessed from my notes. She paused, to collect her thoughts, then continued speaking. My proposed course of treatment was to get him to face the trauma of his night terrors through a combination of hypnosis therapy, talk therapy, and the usage of sedatives when he slept in order to prevent the nightmares from manifesting. This much you also know from the notes. However, what you may not know is that my treatment worked. Spectacularly. In fact, Joe barely showed any signs of the disorders Id heard reported in Dr. A------s initial diagnosis after the first couple days. Rather, something else manifested. He became veryattached to me. She swallowed, and I could tell the memories were still painful. Its not an exaggeration, in fact, to say Joe began relating to me like a surrogate mother. I already knew from his reports of his own upbringing that his parents had been distant at best, so this was not much of a surprise, but the more attached he got, the more he seemed to heal, and the more and more devoted he became. He seemed less and less like a proto-sociopath, and more and more like a frightened young child. Her voice hitched. You have to understand something before I go any further. Id also had a very chilly relationship with my parents from early on, and Id had almost no friends even through my medical school days. Id rarely dated, and to this day Ive never married or had any children, because I simply dont let people get close to me if I can help it. However...something in the way Joe related to me brought out all my mothering instincts. For the first time in my life, I felt needed and loved unconditionally, and while I tried to keep my medical distance, there was just something about him that made my defenses against affection melt. And the more nurturing I became, the more his condition seemed to improve. The tears in her eyes were obvious now, and she blinked them back hastily, even as her voice became brittle with the strain. I was sure Id be able to get him discharged very soon around my fourth month, and so as a final experiment to test his ability to empathize, I let him have a pet. A little cat, because Id grown up with cats, and I thought he might relate to them the same way I had, being someone who had trouble around other people. I dont recall what he called her. Something about a flower, I think. Fiberwood Flower, I said softly. She looked at me, wide-eyed. Yes, she said. Yes, exactly. How did you Just finish the story, Rose, said Dr. A------. Well be able to find out what he knows much quicker once youve finished. Dr. G----- sucked in her breath and nodded, her sharp veneer covering her previous vulnerability like a well-worn mask. Anyway, she continued, I gave him Fiberwood Flower, and made Dr. A------ agree that if he took care of her properly for a week, that would prove hed been cured of his antisocial tendencies. Her face clouded over, but not with sadness this time. With anger. He treated that poor cat like an angel for six days, she said, and then on the last day, when I walked into his cell, I found her corpse lying on the ground, with her head ripped off. And just above her corpse, hed scrawled an arrow pointing down in her blood, with the inscription for Nosey Rosie. Her voice was now hard as diamonds. Now, no ones called me Nosey Rosie since I got teased on the playground at his age, and I dont think he ever heard anyone call me by my first name. He shouldnt have even begun to be able to guess at that name. But he had. And as soon as I walked in, he started laughing. And  and Id still swear to this years after it happened  it sounded *exactly* like the laughter of kids who used to bully me when I was his age. And something snapped when I heard him. I ran out of that cell, filed my resignation andwell, you know the rest. Her face was a mask of cold fury, hurt, and rage now. I reached an arm up out of reflexive empathy, but she swatted it away before I could get very far, and gave me a look that said very clearly that no matter how much it hurt to remember this, she still had her pride and wasnt going to suffer the pity of a *subordinate.* I settled for trying to give her a look that was both sympathetic and respectful. Then I heard Dr. A------s voice from behind her. So, Parker, you still think you can cure the little bastard? he asked. Care to suggest a diagnosis for someone who was able to just instantly pull an old schoolyard taunt out of thin air to mock a woman whose vulnerable spots hed been able to reach as if by magic? Well? Hating myself for it, I shook my head helplessly. I didnt know, I said. I didntII dont know. Of course you dont, said Dr. A------, a bitter and cruel note of satisfaction in his voice. You have no idea whats wrong with him. Whats more, youve bought into all the mythology surrounding him because youre young, youre impressionable, and you dont know any better. Thats why youre not his Doctor. But dont worry. I am his Doctor. And Im almost certain that I do know better. *Okay, from here I really will hold off until Monday or Tuesday. There's a lot of technical stuff to go through, and I want to make sure I do it justice.* "
268,vulnerability,nosleep,Reversion,6,4010m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4010m0/reversion/,2016-01-09 00:09:17,"Jack sat up quickly, banging his head on a walnut table long past its prime. He quizzically touched the large dent on his forehead, stood, and looked around. The dresser he'd placed in front of the door was still there, and his footlocker was untouched. Jack couldn't remember when he had found this cabin, but he did remember fighting with the previous owner. It was a meal he remembered fondly; thinking about it caused hunger to speak through his stomach. Stumbling towards the footlocker, he put a hand on the walnut table to steady himself, and, looking down, he froze. Jack stared at his left hand. Where bones and dried blood vessels had previously been visible, fresh skin had begun to grow. He scanned up his arm, noting that the flesh appeared halfway to his elbow. He limped over to a window (tripping on the cellar door implanted in the decaying wooden floor boards, which had become something of a habit), and gazed analytically at his reflection. His cheekbones still peeked out from behind grey flaps of skin, but the skin no longer held a leathery texture. The tips had begun to turn a light peach color, and small hairs dotted the surface. Twisting his head this way and that, he was relieved to find the back of his skull to be the expected dark caramel, devoid of a scalp. At least part of him was intact. Confused, Jack knocked over the small table next to the window, watching as the wooden legs fell apart. Kicking splinters of wood, he shambled over to the footlocker, opened it, and picked up one of the arms he had stashed away. Crouching down, he took a bite and began to thoughtfully chew. He didn't remember seeing anything remotely like the color invading his face, arm, and hand...except on the Food. Despite any intelligence the Food had, it was still nothing but sustenance. The thought of becoming one of those things terrified him. Besides their physical vulnerability, they moved quickly and without effort. Surely no creature capable of moving so effortlessly should do so. The world was meant to be a slow-moving place, where a long walk would yield little distance traveled. Time had no meaning in this isolated forest, yet the Food acted as though it would perish unless it traversed the landscape at breakneck speed. To be fair, there was the possibility of being eaten by someone such as himself, but still... Suddenly, he spat out the chunk of arm and started to retch. He stared down at the half-chewed gore, giving it a questioning glance. His withered eyes slid an incredulous look at the footlocker, which solidified a decision for his restless instincts: it was time to hunt. He moved across the creaking floorboards of the cabin, pushed aside the dresser he had placed in front of the decrepit door, and stepped outside onto the porch. The night was cool, the full moon shining down in shafts of ivory light through the trees. He surveyed the forest that enveloped the cabin, taking auditory note of the nocturnal animals that were out. Although he could hold his own, there were nasty things in these woodsan insatiable hunger such as his was no match for claws and fangs such as theirs. Stepping down off the porch, he took a light-blue knitted cap that hung on a peg, and fumbled it on his head. He always wore this cap when hunting; it helped confuse the Food, making them easier to take down. Satisfied with the placement of the cap, he began the arduous trek around to the back side of the cabin, the path littered with evidence of seasonal changes. He knocked into an old shovel, sending it tumbling into the yard, taking a few acorns and sticks along with it. He froze motionless at the sound, and began scanning the edge of the trees, looking for signs of movement. When he was satisfied he wasnt about to be mauled by some unseen monstrosity, he continued his journey to the back side of the cabin. As he rounded the corner, something caught his eye. A glimmer of red and yellow, in the opposite direction of where the moss grows. A fire! This could mean only one thing: Food was nearby. He was always surprised to find Food showing up in these woods. They went on for miles, with the river providing the only reliable way to navigate the extensive labyrinth of trees. It was common for Jack to find Food nesting by the river, but never had a nest been made so close to his cabin. The Food, an aging one and a young one, were sitting next to a fire roasting some kind of animal. The Foods ingenuity never ceased to amaze Jack. he felt most of their activities were wasted efforts (especially the cooking of their Food prior to consuming it), but he was nevertheless impressed by their varied abilities (including the ability to build his cabin, whose previous owner had been especially tasty. Perhaps their flavor was proportional to their intelligence?) He stood in the shadows, watching as they began devouring the roasted meat. Surveying the ground between himself and them, he noticed the path was covered with dead leaves and sticks. Despite the constant noise generated by the river, the leaves and sticks were more than enough for the Food to hear his scuffling feet. His gait was smooth for his kind, but even he had trouble moving silently. This way was no good, he would have to find an alternate route. He was preparing to move, when the younger one stood up and started walking towards the shadow Jack was hiding in. It made an arching motion to the older Food, which nodded and pointed. The young one turned back towards Jack - still shrouded in darkness - and began walking forward again. Jack shifted his weight, and prepared to pounce. *** The young one had given him no trouble (he had snapped its neck effortlessly), but the older Food put up quite a fight. In the end, Jack had to tear into the Foods throat to put him down. Still, he got at least one of them, and thats what mattered. The older one would surely be picked off by one of the many screeching creatures that patrolled the woods, so he left it behind. Dragging the now-lifeless body of the young Food back through the forest, Jack took a moment to look up at the moon peaking through the forest canopy. Its pure light caused the tree trunks to glow with ethereal warmth, reminding him of how much life there was surrounding him. Knowing he was one of the predators in this place of muted vivaciousness brought peace to his shriveled mind, as he completed the rest of his journey in a tranquil state of animalistic contentment. The sun was nearly up by the time Jack reached the front door of the cabin. His mouth (red, fleshy lips had begun to appear) and stomach (now almost completely covered with the peach-colored skin) trembled in anticipation of the coming meal. Pulling the body of the young Food into the cabin, he grumbled as he pinched the top of the cap on his head and awkwardly flung it on the floor. He set about the laborious task of quartering the body, removing the organs he didnt like, and processed what would be left over so it would stay fresh. His work finished, he sat down with his back against the refrigerator (which had long since been rendered useless by a shotgun blast from the previous owner), put one of the legs in his mouth, and ripped off a chunk of meatonly to spit it out after chewing a single time. The same rancid feeling came rushing back, stronger this time. He stood, and once more limped over to one of the windows to look at his reflection. Half of his left cheek was now covered in the peach-colored flesh, as was a portion of his skull. The cheekbones and skull that were still visible no longer bore the comforting dark caramel color. Instead, they shone a ghastly white. All the way up to his shoulder, he found his left arm was now covered in the same peach flesh as his face, and dark hairs had begun to grow. All of the fingers on his right hand were peach, as were his kneecaps. Uncontrollably, he raised his newly-living left arm upwards to his mouth, and bit down. The taste was exquisite, better than any Food he had ever caught. He bit off his left pinky finger with a satisfying crunch, and chewed. Surveying the rest of the peach-colored flesh spreading across his dead frame, he had to actively stop himself from taking another bite. Lowering his arms, he sat down on the rotting wood floor of the cabin. He would either become Food, or consume himself entirely. Autosarcophagy was not the answer, and hed never allow himself to become one of those things. Looking down at his legs, he saw the peach-colored skin growing rapidly. He watched his left ankle go from bony to completely covered in flesh within moments. Both arms were now almost covered in living skin, and the skin had begun to creep up the back of his thighs. As he examined every part of his body closely, he began to feel something he couldnt remember ever experiencing: pain. It wasnt only skin that was growing now, but nerve endings as well. Just as quickly as the physical pain started, a different kind of pain exploded into his reality. His very soul now burned as memories came flooding back. There was a time when he was Food, and he lived here in the forest, right here in this very cabin...but not alone. Jack stood up, ran as best he could towards one of the aging walls, and began pounding on it with his fist. Getting desperate, he turned towards one of the windows. With the pain now enveloping his entire being, he smashed the window, and crumpled onto the floor. Not alone. He glanced sideways, only to see the light-blue knitted cap staring directly at him, taunting him with its frayed ends and forgotten memories. Laughing. Playing. Chopping wood. Eating. *Talking*. Not alone. Surveying the cabin, more memories came back to him, memories that burned deep within his emerging consciousness. Twisting his head towards the window, he spied a sharp piece of glass that remained in the frame. Slowly standing up, Jack agonizingly turned his body to face the window, and sent himself on a collision course with the upright shard. Peace at last. "

Jones was up to his old tricks,even after death. This was no utopia. This was a horrorshow. After the savage display of barbarity, people went back to their routine. Women washed clothing, men plowed a meager field. I began to watch, and wonder how this had happened. ""Beautiful, isn't it? I've been meaning to speak with you."" Jones came up from behind me, silently. I flinched. Was this going to be my turn to be mobbed? I would go down fighting. ""Why did you bring us here?"" I asked. ""Because you're special. And I think you know it too. You've probably come here to kill me. That you're an assassin."" ""I'm no assassin."" ""The gun in your waistband would say otherwise. You know, companies like that support both sides, selling weapons of death to make a profit? How many of your hard earned dollars did you give them?"" ""None. It was a.. gift.."" I said, and Jones smiled. ""No it wasn't. You stole it from a man named.. Snake, I believe."" ""Close but no cigar, Padre."" ""Well, moving on. I want you to join us. I bet you've heard that before, but this time, things are different. We're not fighting a war that can't ever possibly be won."" ""What war did I lose?"" ""You let a man who protected you die. You let a holy man die, and you didn't even look back as you fled. That's pretty cold."" ""Stay out of my head, or I'll blow yours offyour shoulders.!"" ""You know, I could give the signal, and they'd beat you with a garden hose until you were just as black and blue as Jacob. All I'd have to do is give a reason.. I won't, though. I'm not your enemy."" ""Like your followers you killed weren't?"" I thought of the cyanide laced punch. ""I didn't kill them. They ascended to a higher state of being. You, on the other-hand, are pretty low, close to rock-bottom, I'd say. You join up and your life will turn around, I guarantee it, goddamn it, ho more running. No more drifting from town to town, worrying about the cops and that monster you've been cursed with. Peace and tranquility."" ""You call what you did to Jacob 'Peace'?"" ""Jacob had to learn a lesson. I'm far from crazy. You know what is crazy though? Letting people starve in the streets. Letting the homeless go without shelter. And letting a man live his entire life on the run, in fear."" ""I.. I don't know what to say."" My mind had gone blank. This wasn't like the mind games of the vampires. This revenant reverend had gotten into my head. ""You'll realize what the right choice is soon enough. You'll see what I mean soon enough."" ""What DO you mean?"" ""I give the word, my people go to defensive positions and ready themselves. We've got plenty of weaponry here."" ""That sounds pretty hateful for a pacifistic commune."" ""Hate isn't my enemy. That's naive. You've survived on hate. It wasn't fear that kept you going. It was the urge to enact an eye for an eye."" ""I hate the thing, yeah. I just can't change it."" ""You can change anything if you stay with us."" ""If I stay with you, how do you plan to stop it?"" ""There are two worlds, spiritual and physical. And when the Entity, as you call it, strikes, we're going to teach it a lesson about vulnerability."" ""That's pretty vague."" ""It's better you not know."" ""Okay.."" ""Just to prove it to you, I'll show you something."" Jones went to the intercom, and over the loud speaker, began broadcasting. ""WHITE NIGHT! RED ALERT! WHITE NIGHT!"" He screamed. The commune ignited into a frenzy of movement, scrambling for rifles, pistols, knives. Even the children were armed. ""THEY'RE COMING! THEY'LL BE HERE SOON!"" ""What the fuck kind of game are you playing?"" ""THEY'LL KILL ALL OF US, SLOWLY, PAINFULLY. DON'T HESITATE. ANY ENEMY OF OURS, THEY'RE NOT HUMAN. IT ISN'T KILLING!"" ""You've proved your point."" I said, and Jones smiled. ""Yes. I have, haven't I. You're gonna realize that what's necessary, and what's going to take place. What happened to your friend, that wasn't you. You're in good graces among the Temple."" ""Why did you hurt Jacob?"" ""He hurt himself. He spoke foolishly, the words of the enemy. Now, we've got firepower here, and it'll protect us against enemies foreign or domestic. And we'll use it."" ""You failed last time. Killed that Senator. Killed yourself."" ""You don't understand mortality at all, friend. The things I learned in Guyana, the gods of the natives, they can be caught, bound. And I did just that. I succeeded. You just never knew."" ""So what, now you're immortal?"" ""The short answer is yes. So is the long answer. I'm alive because I bound myself to those nameless gods, and became one."" ""The only thing I see is a dead man trying to play his hand at being Kurtz."" ""The Heart of Darkness. Great book, about the ivory trade and it's savagery. About the savage nature of capitalism in general. Heard they burnt down a beautiful jungle for a movie version of it. These people who rule the world, they're the ones who are insane."" ""Do you want me to kill you?"" ""It wouldn't work. And besides, why would I want to die? I've got so much work to do."" ""You're fighting an unwinnable war, just like you said."" ""You're not as good at getting into people's heads as you'd like to be, drifter. I'm going to walk the earth for a good while longer."" ""You never said yes or no."" ""That's because there's nothing in this world that's black and white."" Said Jones, and I knew in my heart he had orchestrated my arrival to the compound. Soon, they were wheeling out military surplus, as they did every night. They were paranoid that the world might spill inward on them at any second, that they would be found out. Jones was, especially. They were the kind of people that liked to hide in the shadows, lest the heat accelerate their decay. Jones smelled like jungle-rot and death. Those with him, they smelled of fear, and self-delusion. His inner-circle, they were all alive, for the most part. They weren't like the brainless bastards that walked the earth inside the compound. ""This is a lucky sight for an outsider. You really should listen to the Reverend. He knows what he's talking about."" A nervous smile and eyes that held a message: One slip up and they'd become just like the others without a mind or a soul. ""So are you willing to give us a chance? You might like it here. It's unwise not to enjoy it here. Down right dangerous, some might say. Your friend Jacob didn't like it here. He's down there, take a look."" I looked down from the top of the compound into the courtyard. I controlled my gag reflex. ""Why?"" Was all I could muster. It was nauseating. ""A real hero, wasn't he? Wanted to save his sister from me, thinking I was the villain. Now he's dead, and ain't never gonna save no one from nothin'. It's sad, really, how foolish people can be."" ""You didn't have to kill him."" ""He would have never come around to our way of life. He would have always been a bad influence on dear sister Seka, and we don't need that, not in these trying times."" ""You're still the sick bastard you always were."" ""You'll come around. People like you always do."" ""I'll never join you."" ""Maybe not at the moment. But once your entity shows up, and is thrust out, you'll recognize why we live as we do."" ""I'd rather keep running."" ""How far do you think you can make it then?"" Jones asked. ""..."" I remained silent, calculating it out. ""I knew you had half a brain in you."" It was near. The entity was a day out, a day and a half away at most. I could sense it. So could Jones, I supposed. The idea of staying here made me sick, but I had no other options. I kept my wits up. Soon, it would be time."
270,vulnerability,nosleep,The itch is getting worse - PART 2 - Update on Dr. Simon.,15,42d39r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/42d39r/the_itch_is_getting_worse_part_2_update_on_dr/,2016-01-24 09:28:25,"Here's my lastest update on my current situation. This is a link to my previous parts for those of you, who are interested in knowing the whole story: URL I fell asleep. Shit. Fuck. But I think I have the evidence I need. I woke up early in the morning. It was still dark as night, but a quick glaze on the big clock over Michelles bed told me it was four in the morning. I layed with my back against Sophies bed which meant I could only hear what happened; I heard the doctors low voice: Shh, there you go. I am just gonna take this off. My heartbeat instantly increased as I heard the zipper on Sophies jumpsuit. Michelle was right. He was a molester! I felt happy that I had found my target, but at the same time, I felt so sorry for Sophie. No one deserved what he was putting her through, but I was going to make it all right. That human instinct I spoke of earlier, that forces us to do justice and help where is needed, flushed over me, as I laid perfectly still. I just need to get it in here... He said with a whisper. I heard Sophie growl, like an angry dog. I just waited. Waited for what would happen next. You are a good girl, Sophie. You are not gonna bite me this time, are you? The growling continued and suddenly she snapped, I suppose. I did not see it, but I heard all of it: Sophie had bit him and I heard the pain in his voice. Sophie, you cannot do that without suffering the consequences. Now Ill have to talk to the rest of the staff. We cant continue this behavior. Every morning Sophie just snarled at him and I heard a zipper, then he left. I only saw the back of him. He was holding a blood-smeared cloth to his arm, where she supposably had sunk her teeth in, and he rushed quietly out of the room, locking the door behind him. I sat up. I looked at Michelle who was as gone as ever, while I wondered if she heard that bitch too. I stood up and looked at Sophie, whose eyes were focused on me. I calmy walked towards her and she tried to hide under the cover, like a child afraid to get yelled at by their parent. Are you okay? I whispered and felt a feeling in my stomach of something I had not felt before. It turns out that feeling was compassion. I did not like Sophie as a person, because she never spoke and acted like a child, but I had still spent almost 24 hours a day with her and started to feel protective over her. She could not defend herself, so she used animal-like behavior to show how she felt. She nodded at my question, eyes wide open. I smiled and took her hand. I will make sure, he regrets ever touching you I said and was about to get up when Sophie pulled me back down in the bed. She shook her head and looked terrified. Dont worry, Ill get him good I smiled at her, but she did not seem to like what I was saying. What is wrong with you? This is wrong. He cannot touch you like that! I said in an angry low voice. I could not risk anyone from the hall hearing me. She just continued to wildly shake her head. I got up on went to bed exhausted as ever, but so excited for the next days hunt. The itch was bad as ever, so I spent almost an hour imagining the scenario where I would get doctor Simon all by myself. The next day, I woke up to find Sophies bed empty. Shes at doctor Elviras Michelle said, when she noticed I was awake. Doctor Elvira was the psychiatrist who was working with Sophie. Constantly trying to get her to express something else but her animal-like behavior and child-like feelings. Did you hear doctor Simon this morning? I asked and thought about the horrors I had heard in the morning. No, that stupid bitch, nurse Laura gave me the shot twice last night, because she felt like I was agitated and aggressive She said imitating nurse Lauras high-pitched voice. What did you do? Oh, nothing. I MIGHT have told her to watch her back otherwise I would find a way to get that pair of eyeballs she carries around. She smirked and continued: Of course she got scared. Poor little Laura. She doesnt even like it here. I smiled. Who does? Doctor Simon likes it She said and we both laughed. But he DID touch her, didnt he? She asked and I nodded. I did not actually see it myself, but I heard what he said and how she took a good bite of him I said and picked up the tennis ball. That freaky piece of shit. Thats the reason why I only like girls She said and caught the ball I threw at her. Okay, Michelle-Dyke, throw it back I said laughing. We both laughed. Dinner arrived along with Sophie and doctor Elvira. Girls, I have given Sophie a blackboard to carry around with her. It will give the three of you a better opportunity to get to know each other and it will give Sophie a chance to express herself in a more understandable way She said and led Sophie to her bed. Elvira left and Sophie just sat there like some sad child who did not know what to do with herself. Are you having a nice day? I tried and looked at this grownup-child mix, God had created. She nodded. Dont waste your time, Josephine, she has no clue what we are talking about. She is just like a dumb child in a way to grown body Michelle said and looked at her like she was absolutely disgusted by her appearance. She has beautiful eyes though... She jokingly said which made Sophie write something on the board. Dont tell me to shut up, you childish cunt! She yelled when Sophie showed her the board with a smirk on her face. Ill fucking scrape out your eyes! Sophie just smiled and looked out the window while eating her dinner. Did you see that?! Michelle asked. Michelle, let it go. I doesnt matter. I said, not being mentally present at all. I thought about meeting doctor Simon and killing him slowly. I accepted the challenge, not only to get the satisfaction I desperately needed, but also due to the cause that I wanted to start over. My parents were horrible people, my peers had been horrible people and I am not one to throw the first stone, but lets face the fact: Michelle is a horrible person. It was horrible to kill a human being that possibly felt the same way about me as I feel about Sophie. I took advantage of that, used her vulnerability against her. I thought to myself that doctor Simons behavior justified my (soon-to-be) act of cruelty. It was actually a good deed. I was doing everyone a favor. This is a mental hospital and he is molesting Sophie who is somehow able to defend herself. She has a good set of teeth. I could only imagine the perverted things he would do to other patients who were not as brave as her. Sophie were not allowed to go out that day, so she spent it drawing on her little blackboard. Michelle looked at me. What are you in for? What? I said even though I heard her perfectly. I mean, why are you here? What did you do? I shook my head. No need to tell anything. A pair of ears to listen, a human brain to analyze and a sharp tongue, piece that together with her diagnose as compulsive liar and you have got a dangerous cocktail. Nothing. I guess Im just crazy I said and already new as I said it, that it would not satisfy her in any way. So predictable, us human beings. Its just because you seem so... Normal She said and shrugged. Trust me, I am everything apart from normal. She was my friend, but understand the pressure of having met your first friend at age 23. First one not to judge me, first one to actually listen and let me speak my mind without making faces. Sharing my fantasy and lust(s) with her, could jeopardize everything. I would not risk my friendship or the opportunity to get rid of the itch once and for all. It was starting to burn. Not like too hot water or the burn of a flame, but imagine the winters you spend in the cold, frosty air with no gloves. The feeling when you finally get inside and the warmth causes a burning sensation all over your hands. That is how I felt. All over. Horrible pain. Psychological pain? I am sure. Still as horrible as actual, physical pain? Worse. My silent prayers had been heard when doctor Simon walked in that afternoon with a piece of fruit for the three of us. My heart instantly started racing when he handed me the apple. His pale blue eyes and dark hair, I would have found attractive otherwise, made him one hell of a catch for some dumb housewife who could not care less if he touched her children as long as she could get a decent-looking man with a big fat paycheck. As he handed Sophie her apple and the window lit up his forearms with all the bite marks, I suddenly got an idea. So I bit myself as hard as I could while doctor Simon asked Sophie about her day. I could feel the skin ripping apart and the blood pouring out, so you can probably imagine how hard I wanted this. I quickly blew on the blood that stopped pouring and hoped it would look like it was dried. Thank God my blood was already dark as it was. Doctor Simon, do you think I need an antibiotic shot or something? He turned around and the look on his face was as I expected: He was horrified. My God, Josephine, what did you do to yourself? I played it cool. As I mentioned earlier; I am a good actress. It wasnt me. I wanted to help Sophie with her board and I guess she didnt want me too, so she bit me pretty bad... I said and looked at Sophie who was even more horrified than the doctor. She wildly shook her head and wrote with big letters on her board: ""THAT NO TRUE!"" I guess she didnt learn to spell either, which gave me extra credit in that particular situation; We as a kind, are more likely to believe the possessor of higher intelligence. It was a great card for me to silently play; believe in child-like, biting Sophie, who could not write a clear sentence or belive in me, who was very wellspoken in my language and was always calm and cooperative. Needless to say I won that round. I may have caused some problems for poor Sophie, but I was going to save her from something much worse. Lauras WiFi keeps jumping off as she walks around the whole hospital, so I am going to post first part of my final work now and then the rest tomorrow. Sleep tight, I expect to get NoSleep tonight. "
271,vulnerability,nosleep,Nobody knows what she saw that night.,4,3vylaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3vylaa/nobody_knows_what_she_saw_that_night/,2015-12-09 05:26:39,"Grandma is old. Today she is in her early 90's, but despite her age she still manages to live on her own, take care of herself, and just recently retired from her position at a nursing home. She's been through so much in her life time, but still chooses a life of independence and work. I find this admirable. Grandma has lived in the same, small, ranch styled home, out in the middle of nowhere, for as long as I can remember. The walls are decorated with crosses, crafts from little ones, and with pictures of her children and grandchildren (she's a mother of 11) smiling at her. It's obvious that she's loved and though she lives alone, someone is always sure to swing by her house to check up on her and, she of course receives (i'm sure) dozens of phone calls a day from her children who love her so. Grandma is the kind of old, that when you look at her you can see years of history, pain, sadness, and happiness in her eyes. She's petite, with thin wrinkled skin and varicose veins all down her legs. She has a slow walk that seems a bit unstable, and makes everyone nervous. So nervous that her sons insist on holding her arm wherever she goes. She had never taken a fall before, until one day she had. I can't be sure what was injured (I was so young) but her frail, broken bones required medical attention and a small surgery. From my understanding, she was put on some kind of pain medicine. They say that what she saw may have been induced by the pain meds and was possibly a hallucination, and maybe it was. Or maybe for a small moment, in her state of total vulnerability, she was able to see something that she usually couldn't. One more thing you should know about Grandma before I continue with this story, is that she's a holy woman. She loves God and has read the Bible numerous times. You could ask her anything about God, and she'll know it. Though I'm not sure about all this myself, I know I always felt extremely safe in Grandmas house, as if nothing bad could ever touch me; it's like she beams holiness and spirituality, making her home untouchable to all harmful forces. It felt safe, as if her front door was guarded by God himself. Until this night, it wasn't as holy anymore, and I've never again felt as secure as I once did. Grandma was home alone. She was doing much better and insisted that she no longer needed all the offered supervision (she's also stubborn) and could spend this night alone. From what I've heard, and I've only heard it once, Grandma saw something as insidious and evil as you can imagine. It was at night, she had taken her medicine per usual, and she was alone for the first time after her surgery. After getting up from her bed to do whatever it was (get a drink, go to the bathroom, I can't remember which) she began to walk back to her room. Her room is in the very back of the house, and to get there you must walk down a long hallway with no windows, entirely dark at night. On her walk back to her room, Grandma had seen something standing directly in her way. She was horrified and scared. I'd never heard of Grandma being scared, she's been through so much in her life and she has God. But she was scared tonight. Horrified. I'm not exactly sure about what she saw, but from what I gathered it was a dark demonic force, or maybe Satan himself. Right in her way, in her home that had been prayed over so many times, had stood the very worst of her fears. What I do know is that she had cried. Grandma didn't even cry when her oldest son passed away three years ago, but she cried out of terror on this night. She looks frail, but she's sturdy and strong. After she has seen this thing, she prayed. Over her house, in every room, and then called one of her sons to come stay with her for the rest of the night. To my knowledge, Grandma had never told or explained what she had witnessed in her hallway that night to anybody other than the uncle that stayed with her. My uncle has briefly explained to his daughter (even he wasn't given every detail, my Grandma refused to say exactly what she saw) what happened, and she explained it to me. After bringing this up to my dad only once, he confirmed that it happened and she had seen something evil, but never elaborated further and never mentioned it again (secrets aren't kept in this family, I'm sure he knows). What I do know is that my Grandma depends on nobody other than herself and God, and never have I heard of any other time when she called for someone to stay with her. I know that on that night, she saw something most unholy, something she felt not even God could protect her from and called her son to protect her that night. I know she had cried and prayed and was shook to her old, frail bones that night. I want so badly to know what she saw, but something stops me from asking anyone in my family about it. And part of me doesn't want to know. Even when I was told, I was told in hushed tones, almost a whisper, when nobody was even there to hear. We don't speak of the incident, and so I don't ask. Whatever it was, I believe that what she saw was so evil that even she doubted the protection of God. Who knows, maybe it was just the medication and she hallucinated it all. But what I can say for a fact, that since the incident has happened, her home isn't a comforting and welcoming as it once was. I feel vulnerable there now, as if the house that was once protected and was so safe, is now missing a brick in the foundation, allowing the worst imaginable thing in this world to creep in under our noses. My question is if it's a hallucination, why would she be so terrified when hallucinations aren't real? Why did she never hallucinate something on her medicine before this night? What does she know that we don't? But my biggest question is what the fuck did my Grandma see that night?"
272,vulnerability,nosleep,"Dr. Ackermann's Caracalla Circus [Part 2] Art vs Science, Good vs Evil",12,3x4t62,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3x4t62/dr_ackermanns_caracalla_circus_part_2_art_vs/,2015-12-17 08:57:33,"Witness the first act, [Part 1, *The Princess with no Skin*](URL To my fellow readers, or my *Steady Ones*, especially 3_Eyed_Crow whom I dedicate this second part to, may you catch a glimpse of Dr. Ackermann himself before delving deeper into the world of Caracalla Circus and its sinister characters. ~~Dr. Ackermann's Caracalla Circus~~ *Part 2, Art vs Science, Good vs Evil* Oliver Aurthur Montgomery IV, son of an important business tycoon, arrived from intensive care into the operating room of Dr. Ackermann. A tumor failed to be seen in his previous medical exams had suddenly come about. Oliver twenty-seven years old, indulged in frequent drug use. *Frequent* was an understatement in fact. The preliminary tests taken before surgery, revealed the use of multiple substances including but not limited to opiates, stimulants and alcohol. Dr. Ackermann couldn't justify why he asked to be alone during this delicate and incredibly, risky emergency brain surgery. To do without the necessary staff this brain surgery would require was simply illogical. To prohibit Dr. B Wallace, the anesthesiologist from coming inside, assuring him that he would do his job, was downright insane. The outraged medical personnel considered themselves indispensable, especially in a high profile crisis such as this one. Their jobs had been rejected now, for reasons unjustified and unclear. Eventually, they paced the hallway outside Oliver's room back and forth, considering to barge in at multiple times. Dr. Phillip Moore stopped them each time, reminding them of Dr. Ackermann's undeniable success in all of his previous undertakings despite lack of traditional methods. Telling them about the surgery he performed during his early practice, in a third world country plagued with famine and scarce resources. While Dr. Phillip Moore calmed team, Oliver's father, Oliver Arthur Montgomery III, called Phillip. The patient's father demanded an explanation; ""Why the hell are you guys just standing here? And why they HELL is Dr. Ackermann all alone operating on my son!? He needs all the assistance he can get! "" His reputation preceded him; ruled by impatience and unwillingness to accept and encourage solutions of insecure viability. Dr. Phillip Moore could find no words to support Dr. Ackermann's irrationality. The angry father abruptly swung at Dr. Phillip Moore when words clearly did not get his point across; that his son's life was more valuable than his empire. The doctor sprang back, unscathed by his fist, surprised but grasping onto the severity of this young man's life. Men standing guard; the tight security whom this violent father hired himself, darted towards him, restraining him until his fists were no longer a threat to the team of doctors deprived of saving his son's life. Oliver Aurthur Montgomery III was escorted back to his designated waiting room. Threatening his employees at first, then redirecting his profanity at the doctors, ugly threats shooting straight down the hallway while being hauled away. The team of doctors focused on their other worries, praying that Dr. Ackermann was making the right decision. *He wasn't* **The Previous Day** Dr. Ackermann spent his days off doing as little as possible. He enjoyed being reclusive. Cooking for one and on some occasions, not feeling forced to share a bottle of wine with a spouse or dear friend. He was never married, nor did he care to have this type of commitment either. He felt the same way about having children. Having no one to expect so much as a Christmas gift from did not even bother him the slightest amount. Because of this, the bottom of his large Christmas tree was filled with nothing except the wilting, pine tree needles which it shed. Come mid-afternoon, he figured he would go out for a stroll around *Central park*, across his residence. In the elevator, he admitted to himself that his life was no longer amusing. His work or the brain surgeries which he performed, no longer fascinated him. An overwhelming wind caused him to shiver and wish he'd brought his scarf. The doorman in the lobby of his apartment building held the door wide open for him long before he reached it, the cold winds coming from outside pressured Dr. Ackermann to reconsider embarking on his stroll. In his diary he often referred to it as *The stroll of his life*. You see, in this particular mid-afternoon walk around *Central Park* he met the very person responsible for his awakening. This young man he saw in the distance, moments into the stroll, awakened a being, trapped within him, a mysterious entity hiding in the complexity and darkness of his innermost self, conspiring to breach his consciousness. The young man could be seen working on *something* Dr. Ackermann had come to detest, *something* he avoided despite cordial invites demanding his attendance. He wanted nothing to do with this *thing*, and close to nothing with those who conceived it, or those who spoke of it frequently. He secretly despised those who dared bring this *thing* otherwise known as art, to life, in any way, shape or form. However, for reasons soon to be confessed, he did not avoid the tall figure, diligently painting on an even taller easel. Strangely, this sight captivated him. While he approached the artist and the art he carefully brought to life, he felt an invitation. Dr. Ackermann began to identify an artist within him too. Before this moment, Dr. Ackermann often times dismissed it as a mere inner child. An inner child capable of infiltrating his consciousness, taking advantage of a minuscule faculty of impulse existing in the deepest realms of his mind. He stood next to the artist himself now, admiring him closely in sheer fascination. While painting, *Dustin* began to entice the artist within Dr. Ackermann, suppressed by prejudice; by refusing to admit that artists bear any significant importance in the real world. He had a serious disregard for *art* or *the silly abstractions* he referred to them as. In his diary he circled the following sentence: *Anyone could call anything art these days and indeed it will be art, for there is no evidence needed to support such a claim.* Art itself was the art of straying from anything that is true, logical, practical, applicable, realistic he clamed and thus, art deserves no merit in this world. He also said once, according to one of his peers back in medical school, although too radical and extreme come to think of it now; *Art my friend, should be abolished, there are far more important things for humans to pursue, and find interest in. Dramatically altering this consistent reality in which we all co-exist, solely for the sake of entertainment and the excuses to express oneself is quite senseless. Go ahead, express yourself, but not by turning that which is ""real"" and relevant into a complete travesty! Stripping it of any ""real"" purpose or value.* All his life he had seen art, although unsure now if he had ever seen it created in front of him. Perhaps long ago, he had seen someone make some sort of art before his eyes. Whether he recalled it, *or whether he wanted to*, was the single most important question I should have ever asked. While standing in awe, Dr. Ackermann pondered a short lasting epiphany. It arrived with the artist mixing two very different colors and departed with the gentle stroke of his brush against the canvas. What if he was wrong in pursuing that which he believed to be the utmost important pursuit of all? *The brain.* He argued in his novel, that the brain is incontrovertibly the most important and essential component of human existance. He wondered now if the pursuit of art, the decision to splatter colors on canvasses, photograph things for no apparent reason, or write pointless novels, was not at all what he had made it out to be? He stared at the painting, a man standing over a cliff. The man stared off into a blank distance. Dr. Ackermann couldn't determine if Dustin had intentionally left the distance blank or not. ""Hello."" he said, acknowledging his admirer. Dr. Ackermann became inspired by this young man. He was struck with compassion, learning Dustin depended on his paintings to satisfy his basic necessary of eating. Homeless for quite some time now. When Dr. Ackermann heard the price at which he sold his completed works he stood in disbelief, questioning the meager price of each painting. ""I simply paint because I enjoy it and doing something I enjoy so that I can eat and continue painting is wonderful."" Dr. Ackermann emphasized the memory of this young man, writing that his smile when he overpaid for all of his paintings, still brings him happiness. When he learned the Dustin had no home to go to, he opened his doors to the young artist and said that he could stay as long as he needed. The only condition Dr. Ackermann gave Dustin for sharing his home was a simple one; He must focus on his art and pursue it. Dr. Ackermann told the young artist sincerely, ""I am sure that I have yet to see your finest work."" The two men could be seen emerging from a gloominess limited to *Central Park* by the fellow doorman. He held the door open a bit too early, entering the warm lobby, Dr. Ackermann overlooked his incompetence. **Oliver Arthur Montgomery IV's Surgery Finale** The once dormant *artist* inside Dr. Ackermann awoke, this very same day Oliver Arthur Montgomery IV's chances of living had significantly been reduced. Due to Dr. Ackermann's very own, unexplained, I'll-advised, decision to perform the emergency operation alone; locking out his faithful colleagues to deal with the chaos of the Montgomery family. Nonetheless, he seamlessly completed all of the tasks which the hospital employed several doctors for. He carefully applied the proper dosage of general anesthesia, monitored heartbeat signals, all while tediously shifting back and forth between the monitor and the tools necessary for a craniotomy. This procedure, where bone is removed from the cranium in order to expose the brain. Dr. Ackermann shaved the thick, blond hair at the center of his head before outlining the bald spot. *X* makrked the spot where the surgeon would make his incision. He leaned in, before he cutting he laughed at the bald spot; a crop circle with an *X*. He discovered abnormal tissues pointing him to the source of the tumor which he quickly diagnosed as noncancerous. The tumor's size pressured him to seek the help of the annoyed medical team he insisted on doing without. He did not succumb to this change pressure, instead Dr. Ackermann diligently operated, occasionally giving a thumbs up to the doctors glimpsing into the operating room, from a small window which they took turns looking through. He started to cultivate it at first, willingly drawing it out, attempting to estimate the size and extent of it. In his writings, Dr. Ackermann's made it clear that it was not his tumor which he referred to, but this entity he called the *artist*. Dr. Ackermann cultivated this *artist*, he willingly decided to draw it out. While operating on Oliver, he came to terms with it. He wondered if this artist he gave birth to, could be posing as an artist, deceiving him by exploiting his deep curiosity for the world of art, waiting for Dr. Ackermann himself to grant him access to his psyche. Trapped in the midst of difficult surgery, unwilling to delegate anything which could ease the burden he brought on himself. He sought to find the moment where he could simultaneously operate and acknowledge this *artist* when he found it, it was too late. The sudden realization that this *artist* weighed power over him, causing his steady hands to tremble. This task before him, relied on precision. Dr. Ackermann became unable to seize a firm grasp on his mental faculties. He questioned the reason behind his decision to operate alone. *It wasn't his* He stopped questioning when the steadiness returned to his hands, allowing him to perform on Oliver Arthur Montgomery IV better than before. He took measures he learned once, but never tried out of tradition. The surgery was a eventually a success. Still, Dr. Ackermann continued to operate even though no necessary procedures were required. He opted out to place back the jigsaw piece of bone he removed because he wanted to avoid the swelling which would ensue. When Dr. Ackermann finally welcomed his colleagues back in, they were amazed at the results; a large tumor sitting on a metal tray, immaculately removed. Dr. Ackermann smiled in silent triumph. Nothing in his cunning smile triggered alarms; warning his colleagues that this smile was not Dr. Ackermann's at all, but a smile of his resignation to this world. A concentration of clean, white coats followed Dr. Ackermann's blood-splattered coat, serenading him into the hallway where the Montgomery's impatiently waited. Nothing raised a red flag when they left the operating room. Oliver's vitals returned to normal and his brain no longer suffered from a tumor. There was no reason to suspect Dr. Ackerman of the deliberate treachery he unleashed on Oliver's brain upon removing his tumor; tweaking complex, neurological mechanisms of action against him, forever changing his life. With every act of self-indulgence he displayed, a spiraling vulnerability developed, one Dr. Ackermann would come to rely on. Oliver Arthur Montgomery IV, lying unconscious on the operating table peacefully, woke up a few moments later, wondering what the hell just happened. Oblivious that his mind now belonged to the unscrupulous Dr. Ackermann, or that he would soon be a loyal, yet dispensable pawn in the wickedness Dr. Ackermann began to devise. Images of circus acts conquered his thoughts on his way home, when he arrived, Dr. Ackermann made his way up the spiral stairs looking for the painter he'd opened his doors to. Before he found Dustin, he laid eyes on an unfinished painting. Art failed to speak to Dr. Ackermann, today it did. Today he witnessed an innocence without a trace of perversion. Dr. Ackermann did not question his sudden hatred towards the painting, or his following actions. In an almost childish way, he sought to destroy the unfinished painting, desecrating all which it stood for. Dr. Ackermann paused after its destruction, carried out by the sharp end of the same brush responsible for it. He looked at the young man. He did not care to think how he felt. Instead, he proceeded to destroy every last one of his paintings which all seemed to be inspired by all that which was innocent and pure. The young man watched in horror, Dr. Ackermann continued, laughing the entire time, thinking how foolish he could have been to think that there was an artist deep down. No, it was evil deep down; shackled and neglected until now. *To be continued* I hope everyone is ready for the beginning of Caracalla Circus and the evil acts and evil characters which you will encounter. I do warn you and hope you remain a *Steady One* throughout. follow my investigation on twitter! [Part 3:Steady Ones, Unite or Die!](URL URL "

Ranier National Park located in the upper left hand corner of Washington state, US. This is a throwaway account because of obvious reasons Grew up in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania. When I was 10 and a girl named Megan also from New Jersey moved across the yard from me, we naturally became like sisters. Fast forward to now, and my neighborhood best friend of 11 years married a radar tech on a submarine for the US Navy while I attended college for psych in Philadelphia, PA at Temple U (Go Owls). They are stationed in the Pugent Sound area. Theyll be out here for another three years and Meg has convinced me to move out to Port Orchard in the spring. In the meantime, I flew out for her birthday in late October and Halloween in Seattle. How beautiful how the foliage is in the Poconos this time of year, [/EarthPorn](URL and the view that commands your attention as youre driving over the Tacoma bridge all pointed me in the direction Mount Ranier on my third trip out to west coast. We had a free day on Tuesday and finally were not hungover so we hopped in her VW and drove the hour and a half from Kitsap county to Mt. Ranier, a volcano(!) in the Cascade mountain range in the Pacific North West. We wake up at 7am PST so 10am EST, where our parents still live in PA. Right away, Megans mom Elaine is already agitated and 2 cups of coffee deep, her own words on FB videochat. This is unlike the calm woman who believes little cant be solved with some good Italian food. She had been woken up early when my mom called and asked if she had heard from Megan or I the night before. Apparently my mom had a bad feeling something happened us and thats why she woke her up. We tell Elaine our plans to head to Mt. Ranier for the day and Elaine flips out were crazy for enthusiastically hiking UP a volcano, especially with my moms words in her head. We hang up, grab coffee, and solider on. Mount Ranier is a large active stratovolcano. It is indeed on the Decade Volcano List, meaning it has been identified as significant because of its history of huge, harmful eruptions next to highly populated areas. Its also a giant f***ing National park. There is something about that wilderness.. Pretty much the day consisted of hours of driving through the Cascade mountain range and gawking at the raw beauty of glacier water and valleys unlike things two girls from Jersey have ever seen. Not to mention we got in for free because she has a military ID, holla. I have highlighted the route we took on a [pic of our map](URL I made a circle of where we estimate our sighting was. Here is that [map on google.](URL Things got weird after we reached the highest part in our journey, appropriately named Paradise. Covered in snow and ice- the Paradise Inn, at the Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitor Center. Nothing was really open here as far as the Inn went because it is late in the season and as of Nov. 1st your vehicle must have chains to enter certain areas of the park because of the impending snow. We took a few cute pictures as you get a great view of the Cascades in Paradise. The air is remarkably crisp. It was as we began our descent down the mountain. Its weird, being up there this time of year. Your car is almost always alone. You see other people, its chilly, so a few here and there at the really stunning viewpoints. Other than that, drving around that placeit makes you feel small. In good way. But after 30 minutes of swearing we passed the same dead slanted tree at least 3 or 4 times, our dj vu was overwhelming. Driving slow (speed limit was 30) with our windows we reached a point in the mountains I had lost briefly on the map after taking a selfie of Megan driving. It was then. It was at this point. The air seemed no longer crisp but warm. It seemed heavy. A lot of this part my memory is foggy and is less pictorial than emotional. I know that sounds weird. Im not sensitive to any type of paranormal and I am unsure of my beliefs of it. Thats why Im posting here. I dont want to sound like I lost it. Meg and I already feel that way. I know we were somewhere after Paradise Inn because as you can see in the pictures the snow is sparse but still present. I am in the middle of asking my friend if she feels alright when the car in front of us slowed to stop quick enough to make my body bounce off the seat. That is when we see it(them?). A person in a hood behind the treeline. My eyes came upon them and I felt a drop in my stomach as if I was freefalling. Still having my camera app open on my phone, I take a picture. Ive lived in North Philly for 4 years and never in my god damn life have I ever felt a terror so severe and all-encompassing than how I felt at that moment. How I felt was more indicative of somethings presence than someones, Ill say that much. After the thing skittered off faster than anything Ive ever seen. It was fucking silent too. It definitely was wearing some type of long cloak with a hood. Its size was consistent with that off person. I think what is bothering me is that in broad daylight, my friend and I could NOT make out any features. Sure as hell wasnt a hiker though. Not many out this late in the season anyway. Megan keeps telling me she is sure is was about 5 feet tall. Did not see hands or arms but the movement was QUICK. Car in front of us sped off so fast, we couldnt even ask if they also felt like they were in the twilight zone.. [PICS](URL Writing this is a lot like reliving it. Which I've been doing a lot of. Megan and I have been in bed the last two days. We havent felt right since. I keep wondering about what is now imprinted in my memory every time I get sick. My thoughts seem scattered and I cant focus. I was woken up by myself vomiting in the middle of the night when we got home. You know, when you open your eyes and immediately feel the bile in your stomach. I cant sleep. Nothing really affects me, but honestly: I am scared. I dont understand my dreams. Ive had such vivid ones this week and Megan wont talk about hers. In mine, everything is black and then the air starts to get humid, I simply *feel* nothing but vulnerability and an impending sense of anxiety. I think why Im telling you this, reddit, is because major rain and snow is supposed to obliterate the National Park this weekend. And I am serious when I tell you, I feel like something bad is going to happen. I need to know what my friend and I saw. I have to fly home to Philly in a few days and Im running out of time. I know havent slept because of it. I just wish I knew what I was dealing with. Im comforted knowing I get on a plane away from here but the idea of a disaster seems so imminent. I feel like I shouldve ran after it. "
274,vulnerability,nosleep,The Library,57,3rnbka,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3rnbka/the_library/,2015-11-06 03:51:37,"I work as a student ambassador in my university library. My job involves monitoring the number of students who come in and out, pointing out where subject areas are, attempting to handle basic queries only to signpost students to the faculty librarians, finishing my university work and watching a large amount of BBC iplayer. It is every lazy student's dream role. The shifts are short, only five hours each, and I work between 18-20 hours a week. A large chunk of that time is made up at the weekends: on Saturday mornings I open up and on Sunday nights I have to ensure the building is empty before locking the door and returning the key to security. Honestly, the most exciting part of my weekend is making the announcement, ""the library will be closing in fifteen minutes. Please start to vacate the building"". The story I am about to tell you happened last Sunday night, since then I have informed my boss that I will not be doing the closing shift anymore. She didn't seem at all surprised when I explained my reasons why. The library is situated in part of a grade II listed building that was erected in the 18th century and was originally used as a nunnery. It is a big building, and in the middle is a large garden that is used for graduations in the summer. The garden is very pretty, it is always well kept and is home to the most stunning water fountain. The fountain is clearly very old, as the cherub, whose mouth the water comes out of, has faded to a pale green and the base appears to be made out of the same brick as the building itself (although seeing as most bricks are generally red it is probable that I am wrong). The garden makes for a beautiful view and when writing an essay I always sit by the windows that overlook it. At night the garden is generally very dark, aside there a small array of lights that focus on the fountain. When darkness falls, the calm atmosphere of that area is replaced with something much more unwelcoming; the weak night-lights shine on the cherub in such a way that he no longer appears angelic, instead he looks demonic, crazed. Many students have commented that they can't stand to look into the garden at night. They get the feeling that something will jump out of the darkness. When locking up, I have to turn off the self-issue machines. The machines are placed on the other side of the room to the windows that overlook the garden. I have been doing this job for two years and so I have become numb to the eerie and sinister look of the cherub. Despite this, last Sunday I had a sense that someone, or something, was watching me. Nobody was in that part of the library so there is no rational explanation this, however as I turned my back to the window and focused on the machine I had this undeniable feeling of vulnerability. Not being one to hide from my fears I made a point to look through the window and observe. Perhaps a student was standing out there? As I scanned the darkness for a sign of life I heard the sound of somebody running on the floor above and nearly jumped out of my skin. I shook my head and told myself to grow up. After checking the time I saw that I was late on making the closing announcement and rushed over to the tanoy. I was still a little spooked, although I had no idea why, so I quickly threw on my coat, gathered my things and watched the CCTV screens. A few people came out of the study carrells on the bottom floor and said goodnight. One man came running down the stairs and I thought ""Ah, so youre the reason I just shat myself"". After waving him goodbye I took one last glance at the CCTV before going to the lock the door. There was one more man upstairs. He was dressed all in black and was walking up the corridor where the history books are placed. His face was pale and blurred. I couldnt make out any features, the camera made his face look like a blank canvas. I watched him for a couple of minutes. When he got to the end of the corridor he simply turned back, and when he reached the other end he turned around again. I made one final announcement: The library is now closed. Please vacate the building immediately. I stood back and waited, surely he would leave now? No. He continued to pace up and down, up and down. I know how much pacing can help when trying to understand something complex, but this man was starting to take this piss. Could he not go and pace at home? Fuming, I jogged up the stairs and through a maze of rooms until I reached the history corridor. The man was not there. At this point I was out of breath, late and hungry. I figured he had just gone out the other way so I made my way back down, muttering to myself about students being bellends. When I got back to the desk I took one more look at the CCTV camera. The camera showed me that all the lights were off in the upstairs part of the library. This confused the hell out of me. I had been here later than this and had never known security to turn the lights off before the key had been handed in. Whats more, in the silent area corridor, which is situated downstairs and overlooks part of the garden, I could see that the man dressed in black was pacing up and down again. I was creeped out, so I reached over to the tanoy and said: Could the man in the silent area please vacate the building. He didnt, and a part of me was relieved as I didnt know what sort of character I expected to walk past me and out of the door. I rang security and asked if they could please come over and make him leave. I made the mistake of telling them that all he was doing was pacing and so their response was to tell me to try and talk to him face to face before calling again (useless right?). The hairs on the back of my neck were standing to attention as I walked into the silent area. I went up and down that room, and though I looked down every aisle of books there was not a soul was to be seen. The only way out of the room was through the way I had come from. By now I had lost any bravery and I sprinted back to the desk. It was time to get out of there. As I reached the desk however, every single light in the building switched off. I was in complete darkness. The only form of light came from the CCTV screen. Terrified, I looked at the monitor and discovered that the only visible area on screen was the garden, and in the garden was the pacing man. A closer, although reluctant inspection showed me that the cherub was missing. Thats it, I thought, I am out of here. I fumbled in the darkness for my bag and went to leg it in the direction of the door. As I did, I heard the unmistakable sound of running footsteps coming from stairs. I made it outside, threw myself in my car, sped the hell out of the car park and phoned security from home. "
275,vulnerability,nosleep,My experience living alone,8,3tjla1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3tjla1/my_experience_living_alone/,2015-11-20 18:59:43,"All of this happened a couple of years ago while I was attending University. Some nights, like tonight, my mind wanders and I torture myself remembering everything. It was nearing the end of the school year and the weather was starting to warm up -- which is such a blessing in upstate NY. It was my second year and I was living in a studio apartment with my boyfriend. We didn't have control of the thermostat and the air conditioning hadn't been switched on in the buildings because the weather hadn't been consistently warm. It was an especially nice afternoon, so I decided to open the blinds and windows to let some fresh spring air into the apartment. We were lucky because our unit was on the first floor and had a nice view of some grass and beyond that a small wooded area. I've always been reluctant to open the blinds or windows because I've always worried about peeping toms, or just snoopy people in general. I talked myself out of it and told myself it's unlikely to happen and besides, my boyfriend would be getting home from classes within the next half hour or so. I wanted to unwind after being in classes all day, so I booted up the pc and started playing some Fallout 3. Usually I get pretty immersed and don't notice what's happening around me when I'm playing, but I couldn't let myself fully relax knowing that the windows were open. To compensate for the feeling of unease, I'd periodically peek over my shoulder at the windows just to make sure nobody was out there. After a while I started to get *that feeling*, even more intensely than before. I hated that I was always so uppity and worried when there was no reason to be. I resisted the urge to look because I knew it was just my mind messing with me and causing me to worry unnecessarily. After a couple of minutes of worrying my heart rate started to pick up. I decided it was ridiculous to torture myself like this and I should just close the windows to have peace of mind. When I turn to close the windows, I see a guy standing between my window and the woods watching me. He was an average height, blonde hair, wearing a light blue tee shirt and jeans. He caught my eye and started walking away. There was absolutely no reason for him to be there at all. There's no sidewalk back there or anything of interest. After he was completely out of sight I quickly locked the windows and put the blinds down. My heart was racing and I vowed that it was the last time I'd open the blinds. When my boyfriend got home, I let him know I saw someone out there. He agreed that it was creepy, but didn't seem as worried about it as I was. Fast forward to the end of the school year. It's officially summer and my boyfriend left for a job in another state. I was staying in the apartment because the lease wasn't up yet and there was no reason to move out right away. I was excited and a bit nervous to be living on my own for the first time. I lasted a week before I had to move out and go home. I have to confess, at the time I was a bit of a recluse. I was happy to stay home reading, watching movies, or playing video games pretty much all day. I was also looking for a summer job on campus, so I spent a lot of time sending out applications, etc. I left for groceries one time that week and that was the only time I left the apartment. Despite the fact that I lived quietly and never left my apartment, someone knew I was still there. The second night I was alone, I was doing dishes and tidying up the kitchen. Our apartment was a small studio so the kitchen sink was only about four feet away from the front door. All of a sudden somebody tried to turn the handle on the front door. Pretty aggressively, they tried the handle three or four times. It was locked -- I *always* kept it locked. I got quiet thinking that somebody mistook our apartment for their own, but I was hyper aware of the fact that I was by myself. A few seconds passed and then they started kicking or throwing themselves against the door. It was so loud and intimidating I was shaking uncontrollably. I stood there waiting for something to happen for another five minutes before I got the courage to look out the peep hole to see if anyone was there. Nobody, just an empty hallway. I called my friend who lived nearby and told him what just happened since he was the only one close. He told me to just relax, that it was probably just a drunk guy who didn't know it wasn't his apartment. A couple of days later I'm watching a movie on the couch and theres a sudden loud crash. Somebody is banging on the door again. They never call out or tell me to open up. They just keep trying to open the door. This time I'm a mixture of scared and pissed, so I make my way over to the door as quickly and as quietly as I can. I peek out of the peephole, but something is smudged over it on the outside. They deliberately made sure that I wouldn't be able to see them. The next day I cleaned the peep hole and noticed that the doorbell had been completely kicked in and smashed on the wall. I'm happy to say that this is where the story ends. I arranged to leave, leaving a ton of stuff in the apartment just to GTFO. I didn't feel safe at all. I seriously doubt I'll ever live alone again. I wouldn't even consider it without having a dog, some mace, and probably a gun. That feeling of vulnerability is something that I won't forget. "
276,vulnerability,nosleep,The reason why I hate funerary art,31,3tv8ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3tv8ol/the_reason_why_i_hate_funerary_art/,2015-11-23 09:46:24,"I once had a friend. His name was Piotr Zotnicki. I've never shared that story before, because it is not funny, more disturbing really. We all were studying back than. It was pretty tight group, despite the many differences such as age, interests or field of study. Long evenings with beers, vodka and discussions about everything, hiding in the parks with joints, exploring dark alleys and even darker clubs. I'm sure most of you guys remember your own youth days. Zotnicki studied something related to computer science, but I don't recall details. Very smart boy, a bit shy. I liked him, his disarming navety and vulnerability. Always non-confrontational, with a faint smile wandering in the corners of his lips. Piotr had one rather special trait - he was an avid fan of conspiracy theories. It seemed that he really deeply believed in some of them. I remember when sometimes he showed us some blurry videos on the Internet, proving governments plans hidden from people, with flushed cheeks and zeal of the neonate. We laughed when he, already bit drunk, was talking about secret societies or some weird objects seen in middle of nowhere in the States. We laughed out loud, and he laughed with us. The difference lied in the fact that he believed in it all. That's why I wasn't very surprised when I received an email from him. I've even printed it, I have it somewhere. ""Hey, I need to talk with you. You are the only person to whom I can speak about it, because others have too rational or even disrespectful approach to damn everything. I'm writing an email, cause I couldn't reach you on the phone. You've changed your phone number or it's some malfunction again. Can we meet, please? Today is Monday, what about next Thursday at 19, near our pub? PS. Janek told me. I am so, so sorry to hear about your father"" At that time, my father became seriously ill. I had very bad mood, so I decided to temporarily turn off the cell phone and shut out myself from the screaming colors of the world beyond the walls of my apartment and the hospital. But I decided to meet him, although I had absolutely no idea what he might want from me. I could only hope that this wont be another attempt to convince me that Russians are making severe experiments on live Jewish aliens from dark side of the Moon. I went there. At least I will turn my thoughts elsewhere - I calculated in my head, when I got off the tram. That evening was pleasant, I could smell coming spring in the air. Although there were a few minutes before 19, Zotnicki was already waiting for me. He looked like rat, with these nervous movements, darting eyes and sweaty hands. He threw unconvincing smile at me. I followed him, heading across the street. When we found ourselves in narrow, dimly lit street, Zotnicki uncertainly looked at me and he bit his lower lip. ""I know. I know you don't believe in stuff I'm telling you sometimes. You treat it as a joke, infantile rubbish of guy with fucked up imagination. I know this dude, and I understand it, really. At least I have Mary, she always listen to me. But this is not important now. Listen...do you believe in God?"" I live in Poland, and here this is a complex thing. Majority of older people treat God and religion with serious attitude, while most youth just don't care. So I answered to that question just with shrug. I didn't know what he was up to - was he experiencing a spiritual crisis? He accidentally let some sect guys to his apartment? He continued, not discouraged by my silence. "" I don't know myself, man, but I want to show you something. Will you come with me? Please?"" I shrugged again and agreed. Probably the desperate tone of his voice convinced me, so I followed him. I needed some relaxation after many days and nights spent on an uncomfortable stool at the hospital bed. By the way, my father recovered. He died last year, happy in his own house, with a newspaper in his hand and a full ashtray on the table. Do you know guys where he brought me? At the old cemetery, Jesus Christ, that was cheap. But I was glad - I've never been there. I like to have contact with living, tangible history. Fence was rusted, the area was overgrown. It was a post-German cemetery - I immediately recognized the faded and distorted inscriptions on stone tombstones. The whole place was highly devastated, desecrated with swastikas made with white paint. Disgusting stuff, really. We passed some makeshift benches and broken bottles of cheap wine. We were both silent until we reached the stone sculpture. Zotnicki stopped and he stared at the statue. You've probably already seen similar at various cemeteries. Angel in form of weeping woman, holding hourglass in her hand, symbol of transience. A typical funerary art found anywhere from Moscow to Lisbon. ""I came here by accident. I was looking for some atmospheric place, while I was working on some graphic design project for my University. I just wanted to take some pictures. I saw this angel, graves covered with moss and factory chimneys in the background and I knew this is it. I took my camera out of its case, and when I looked up, she was crying. Not with these stone tears. Look man, she was crying with blood. I thought I will shit myself. But then...then it was worse. She began to talk to me"". I looked at him with shock and disbelief. In the first moments I thought it was unsuccessful, stupid joke, but no, Zotnicki looked at me with real tears in his eyes. So I had only one conclusion - he had some kind of a breakdown. It happens, right? I started to calm him down. Hey man, it's probably nerves and stress caused by your project. Take a break, have a drink, relax. Zotnicki just shook his head. ""I've seen and heard it as clearly as I can see and hear you now. I knew you won't believe me."" His pursed lips curved in an inverted horseshoe and for a moment I thought he would burst into tears. I looked again at the dead stone - no blood, no faintest sound. I sighed and asked what exactly he heard. ""I dunno"", he shrugged, ""I don't know German"". At that moment, I wanted to laugh. We returned just as we came - in silence. Zotnicki asked me to don't tell anyone about this meeting. He even smiled. In the next weeks I've rarely seen him. I think I subconsciously avoided Zotnicki after our trip to the cemetery. It seemed he recovered anyway. He went to a psychologist, a psychiatrist - I was convincing myself. Soon, the happy news came to me - Piotr and Mary moved in together. But time passed, and our relationship with Zotnicki never returned to the earlier state. We accepted that. Then everything fucked up. He called me at night. I was sleepy, so I answered without any thought. Zotnicki instead of saying hello, whispered: ""she talked to me again...she came to me tonight"". I hung up. A moment later I got text message: ""I understand German now"". I deleted it. What was I supposed to do? I was sure that he really went mad. Irrationally I didn't want to get infected, you know guys what I mean? After that, I stopped hanging out with my friends, because I was afraid I will meet him there. Despite of this fact, Zotnicki periodically tries to call me. I never picked up. About two months after night text message, Andrzej Biskupski, our mutual friend, stopped me in some Old Town alley. He was pale as death herself. ""Did you hear? Mary...Mary is dead. She hanged herself"". I felt cold chills of remorse on back of my head. ""What about Piotr?"" I tried to stay calm with all my willpower. You know why? I was afraid he did something to her. ""Yes... He was at the university when it happened. He is completely devastated. Listen, maybe we'll meet with him tonight? Not in his apartment, of course...We have to help him somehow. My God..."" So we met. Zotnicki looked like a shadow of a human being. Ashen face, his red eyes from tears shed and dead stare. Hundreds of words of support and comfort. Nasty thing. He wanted to propose soon. He called me the next day, and I just had to pick up. ""It wasn't a suicide. Today she came to me, this weeping woman, and she explained everything to me. In German. It's all my fault, I did something I shouldn't do"" at this point Zotnicki wept into the phone ""and I don't know what to do right know. I am so fucking scared man. When I'm walking down the street I see something or someone glimpse at the gate, but when I turn around, nothing is there. I feel their eyes on me. I think they are angry, you know? They are angry. For fuck sake, what should I do now?"" I panicked. I began to suspect that he really did something to Mary. Come on, only madmen hear voices, right? But I felt strange responsibility for everything that happened. I told him I'll come to his place. He opened me without a word, turned and sat down on a chair in the kitchen. He began to mumble something incoherently. Only after a while I began to understand it. ""...it wanted to warn me then, but I didn't understand German. This cemetery is bad, bad people are buried there and bad things happened. I didn't tell you this, but when I was there for a first time I stepped on the bone. I found silver ring next to it. I took it. I don't know why, probably as a souvenir, you know? In deep pits there Russians buried dead German soldiers and civilians...they raped women and men alike... they robbed the dead, and I took that ring...they thought I am the same..."" He cried and slumped to the floor. His chest twitched spasmodically. ""Piotr, you know what we will do? We'll go there together and you will put the ring into place when you found it, okay? Everything will return back to normal, I promise."" Initially, he reacted to my proposal hysterically. He crawled to the wall and put his hands to ears. I totally lost control of the situation, my heart was beating so fast that it hurt. I felt sweat all over my body. ""They talked to her, so she hung up. She could hear their voices. She was scared. She began to see things, terrible things. Distorted faces, bones sticking out under the bed, in the mirror she saw not her face, but theirs. She couldn't stand that, so she hung herself"". He finally agreed to go with me to the cemetery. Nothing has changed since our last visit. I asked where he found that trinket - just behind the stone statue. Of course, for fuck sake. I've had enough of all this, I felt uncomfortable, I just wanted to go home and drink some vodka. We came to sculpture. To this damn sculpture. I got goose bumps, I felt sick and threw up. I do not know if this was game of shadows and stress...look, this angel had face of Mary. Everything was the same as before, except for two things. Stone face and ... On the neck of this stone woman had hung rope with a loop for hanging. It was too much for Zotnicki. Something cracked inside his mind. He threw ring on the ground, turned around and run toward the street with this terrifying scream. I ran after him. I'll tell you something guys. It sounds ridiculous, and I know that cause of it was accumulation of adrenaline and emotions, but when I was chasing my damned friend I heard the soft whisper behind me. In German. I couldn't catch him; I guess I didn't want to anyway. I came back to my apartment, packed my things and I left the city pretending to make some spontaneous trip. When I came back two weeks later, Zotnicki was dead. I wasn't surprised at all. He dug a shallow hole, came in, ate whole boxes of drugs and drank bottle of vodka. He was found with rope around his neck. I've never been to that cemetery again. I was afraid - and I'm still afraid. I don't want to hear anything in German. And later...I don't want to understand it. "
277,vulnerability,nosleep,I was 10 when it first happened to me...,39,3laxqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3laxqg/i_was_10_when_it_first_happened_to_me/,2015-09-18 00:04:37,"When I was little, a terrible thing happened to me. At first, I was confused and ashamed that it happened. No one at school believed me, and truthfully, I barely believed it myself. On a warm July night, I was laying in my bed listening to the soft creaks of the settling apartment. A groan here. A tick there. The moon cast a blue glow into the room giving it a gloomy atmosphere. I glanced across my bed, and saw it. It was creeping out of my closet, one hand slowly opening the door. I threw the covers over my head, and breathed in the warm air wishing for the monster to leave my room. I heard it quietly moving about. There was a toy train on the floor that my dad gave me before he died, and I heard it fall over as the monster traversed closer and closer. Then something yanked on the corner of my blanket. Go away! I screamed, and then listened to the silence. Something was out there, I knew it... and it waited. I dont really recall how long I remained under those covers, but when I finally emerged, there was no monster near my bed. The gloom had remained stagnant, like an old pond filled with the blue bodies of the drowned. I looked at the closet, and the hand was still on the door. *Go away*, I thought, but couldnt produce the words. I pulled my covers close to my neck as I shimmied toward the nightstand. My eyes remained locked on the closet while I reached over and molested the base of my Transformers lamp. When I finally felt the switch jutting from Optimuss neck, I twisted it. Light flooded the room, but the hand remained fixed to the door. I didnt know if it was safe to investigate, but I had to ease my mind. With the light on my side, nothing could go wrong, *right*? The first thing I wanted to check was the noise I heard when under the covers. More specifically, the train the monster had knocked over. So, I leaned just far enough to look over the edge of the bed. Near the tracks I laid out two days ago was the electronic main car with an additional three cabs attached to it. They were all sitting upright, just the way I left them. If the train wasnt touched, then that meant the monster couldnt be real, or so I thought. I turned my attention to the hand on the door, and reluctantly slipped the covers off. The room was warm, but my body still felt a chill. I threw my tiny feet and legs over the side, and after hopping off the bed, I slowly moved toward the closet. I wished the dull glow of the lamp were strong enough for me to see the back of the room from where I stood. I didn't want to go over there, but I knew I needed to for the sake of my sanity. As I drew nearer, I thought I saw the fingers wiggle. I took a step, and they tightened. Another step, and I finally saw the monster for myself. The fingers were long black strands of yarn, and the bulk of the palm was a soft furry cotton. I sighed in frustration because it was nothing more than the black scarf my grandma made me last year. I pinched the yarn tassels, and pulled it away from the door. I heard the soft ticks of the electrostatic arcs breaking that held it in place, and I shook my head. After stuffing it back into the closet, I closed the door. The minute the latch clicked, the lamp turned off. It wasnt the electricity because the red numbers of my alarm clock still glowed from my desk; nor did the bulb burn out because I didnt recall seeing the split-second flicker before its death. No, it was much worse. I had heard the clicks as something twisted the switch and turned it off with purpose. I breathed heavy with fear because it seemed to take forever for my eyes to adjust to that darkness. In that moment, I felt exposed to whatever evil was in my room, and I couldnt do anything. I rubbed my eyes, but that only made it worse as thick whorls of white burned in and out of my vision. I backed up against the door, and the sound of something drew near to me. I slammed my eyes shut and tried to wish it away but it continued to advance anyway. I fully expected the monster to grab me, but I only felt a cold chill caress my skin as gooseflesh tighten all over my body. Go away! I screamed, and when I opened my eyes, I watched a black shadow dart across my room. The posters along my wall flipped up as it passed by, and it waited in the corner. Mom! I pressed harder against the door, and heard something whisper, Youre next, Alex. Mommy! I screamed, and ran for the door. I grasped the brass knob with my small hands and turned, but nothing happened. Alex, the whispered called, but there was a hint of something else in its voice. It was like the yowl of a cat mixed with the hiss of a snake. I pushed and pushed, looking over my shoulder as the shadow moved across the room. It wasnt until I felt the small of my back pinch that I realized I needed to pull the door to open it. The force of the swing made me lose my grip and I fell backward onto the ground. The shadow monster realized my vulnerability, and moved quickly for me. I scrambled to my feet and rushed through the door. My bare feet slapped against the wood floor as I navigated the dark corridor. There were no windows there, so I could no longer see the shadow. I felt it, though. It was right behind me. It had to be. When I reached my mothers door, I threw it open, and slammed it shut. I jumped onto the bed, scrambled to get under the sheets, and my mother wrapped her arms around me. Out of breath, I watched the door. A sliver of moonlight penetrated the room through a crack in the blinds, and it painted itself along the wall and across the door. I watched black shadows form around the frame as it seeped into the room. I slammed my eyes shut, and hugged my mom tighter. She seemed to shush me to tell me that everything was all right. Reluctantly, but forced by my own morbid curiosity and the false audacity afforded to me by my mothers warm embrace, I finally opened my eyes. The monster was finally gone. I laid there for some time just watching the door. I had no expectation that it would leave me alone the whole night. I thought that perhaps it was just waiting for me to fall asleep, so I resolved to stay awake the rest of the night. I didnt get very far, though. All that energy I wasted on fright finally caught up to me, and I passed out. Sometime later that night, a loud noise woke me. I sat up lightning quick, and looked at the door. It was standing wide open, and a dark figure lingered there, watching me. It reached into the room, and the lights flickered on. It wasnt the shadow monster but rather my mother. She said, Sweetie, what are you doing in here? Instead of answering her, I rubbed my eyes to see if she was real. She sighed and set her purse on the dresser. Im sorry Im late. I had to pick up a second shift at work. I shouldve called. I wanted to tell her it was okay, but I couldnt. The clock on her wall said it was just after midnight, but earlier in my room, it read that it was barely nine. When I ran into her room, she wasnt even home yet. My mother tried to ask what was wrong with me, but I couldnt tell her the truth. How could I? How would I explain, without sounding like a stupid kid, that some type of spirit or ghost chased me through the house? That when I went into her room, something other than my mother grabbed me? I couldnt, but I never felt right in that apartment ever again. I was just lucky we didn't have enough money for rent and were forced to move. Before we left, though, I wrote a note and put it in the closet for the next person who moved in. For a while, I had hoped they got it before anything happened to them, but I quickly realized it didnt matter. The shadow monster didnt stay there."
278,vulnerability,nosleep,On The Fourth Night,4,3foau1,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3foau1/on_the_fourth_night/,2015-08-04 08:23:06," Ever since I was little I had loved camping, something about the vulnerability, yet the safeness of a sleeping bag. Falling asleep to the sounds of crickets, the soft crunch of leaves as a rabbit runs across the floor of the woodsit is calming, wonderful. We hadnt been camping in a long time, so when we went for a long weekend during one of those lazy summers during my high school years, I never wanted it to end. It was a sad morning when we packed the tent away and went home. When we got home, my dad decided that the tent had to be set up in the backyard to dry offit had rained the last night of our stay, so he didnt want to pack the tent back into its bag and put it back into the basement wetit would get moldy. So we set up the tent on a level patch of ground in the back yard, not too far from the woods. There was something so inviting about that tent, I asked my dad if I could sleep in it for the nightknock yourself out, its going to be up anyway was his response. So that night, I grabbed my pillow and my sleeping bag and headed for the door. Ill close the living room door, but Ill leave it unlocked. Ill also leave the outside light on just in case you get scared, my dad said, that remark about getting scared was obviously just to poke fun at me, but it stung a bit, as I was now a teenager and wanted to be seen as an adult. Thanks, was all that I said in reply as I stepped out the door and onto the cool summer grass, making the short walk to the tent. It seemed much bigger now than it did when my entire family was sharing the five-person tent. I didnt mind though. I curled up in my sleeping bag and promptly fell asleep. I slept like a log that night. In fact, I slept so well that I asked of my parents that the tent stayed up in the backyard. It was summertime, I wasnt able to drive yet, so spending time with friends was a scarce occurrence for me during those summer months, so I had to find some way to entertain myself, to feel as though I were doing something interesting, something fun. Things were pleasant for the first three nights, but it was on the fourth night that things changed. Immediately something felt off when I first stepped outside. There was something in the air that put a sense of dread in me. Not wanting to falter, however, wanting to prove to my parents and to myself that I was indeed as bold as I felt, I said my goodnights and went out to the tent. The moon was bright and emitted a silvery shimmer across the lawn, and highlighted the trees at the fringe of the woods in an ominously beautiful hue. I went into the tent and curled up in the protection of my sleeping bag, burrowing deep within it. I tried to sleep, but I was restless. The moon cast that silvery-white light upon an entire wall of the tent, like a floodlight. There was something different about the air as well. It was then that I noticed that there was no sound. It was silent. The chirping of crickets, the buzzing of unidentified insects, the distant barking of neighbors dogs, was silent this night. I closed my eyes and told myself it was all in my head and just try and sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. I repeated in my head more times than I can count. It was then that I heard it. A footstep. I froze. I stopped breathing. It couldnt have been a footstep, dont be ridiculous. I strained my ears to hear. Silence. Then another one broke the silence, and another following that one. I lay there rigid as a board, as the footsteps continued, step, step, step. They sounded rubbery, not animal, and not entirely humanare those flip flops? Step, step, step. They were calm, meandering, as though whatever it was that was walking around was not following any set path, had no course of action. Where had they started? I hadnt heard them come from a distance, from no distinct direction. They were just suddenly audible. Step, step, step. They were slowly making their way in the direction of the tent. Whos out there? I thought to myself. What do they want? I was now convinced that it was a person. It had to be. A person wearing flip flops, making their way around my backyard. A tweeker perhaps? A neighbor had once stopped my mom and I to tell us that a needle had been found on the side of the road, and to watch for any suspicious cars driving slowly up or down our back-country road. There came a point where I had to know. I had to know whom it was that was walking around out there. My parents had left the living room door unlocked. If it were indeed a person walking around out there, I would have to find some means of alerting my parents. As terrified as I was, the idea of not being able to see what was out there was what made everything worse. I slowly, silently turned my head towards the wall of the tent illuminated by the light of the moon. Thats when I saw it. A shadow. Upright, with appendages that seemed extended in relation to its midsection. It moved in a billowing sway, as though it were being tossed around by a non-existent wind. Step, step, step. I watched in fascinated terror. This was not a tweekerif it were a human it moved in a way unlike any I had seen before. I continued to watch it as it moved in graceful clumsiness, this featureless darkness projected onto a tent wall by silver light. My fascination began to outweigh my fear. I had to know what I was seeing. I slowly began to shuffle my way out of the sleeping bag. To this day I am impressed by how silently I got out of that sleeping bag. With one fluid, quiet motion, I was crouched on my haunches on the cool tarp floor of the tent. With great care as to not disturb the grass underneath the floor of the tent, or to rustle the floor of the tent itself, I repositioned myself onto my knees and lifted myself up to the mesh window of the tent and looked out over the yard. Im not entirely sure what it was, because the exact moment I showed my face in that window, it looked over at me. We did lock eyes. To see its attention zero in on me, to see that swaying walk speed up with purpose, with direction sent me into a panicno, more than a panicfrenzy. I fell back and immediately went to the door of the tent just as whatever it was hit the wall of the tent. I did not turn to face it. It began emitting a bone-chilling coo as it brushed its body against the tent, as though it were testing the sturdiness of the fabric. I didnt begin to call for help until it made its way to the door and began to pull at the zippers. I pulled back, shouting for my parents, for my siblings, shouting for anyone and everyone to come and help me. I heard the living room door fly open, the jingling of a collar, two collars, three, as my dogs came bursting from the house, followed by rushed, bare footsteps, one set, two, threeall of them definitely human. The door to the tent opened and there stood my parents and one of my siblings. They told me everything was alright and escorted me to the house. Once inside they asked me what happened. I told them what I saw and asked them if they had seen anything. They told me that the dogs definitely took off after something, but they didnt see a thing. The next morning I took the tent down. I folded it up and I put it away, I set it on a shelf in the basement, turned off the light and closed the door. Its been years now and I have not been camping since. Sometimes I think about it, and will go to a sporting goods store to pick up a new tent, to take my wife and my kids of my own, but as I look at the tents on display I can hear that cooing noise, and I can see that gangly, billowing shadow moving towards me in the darkness.

279,vulnerability,nosleep,The Turn,0,3ftzt9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3ftzt9/the_turn/,2015-08-05 13:31:54," Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige""."" - Cutter A nickel for every sentence that was taken out of this story - that's all I need. Then I could probably build a real Iron Man suit, and maybe, just maybe, feel safe again. That won't be happening anytime soon though, not with so many complications having arisen in just the last few months. I'm still finding it a bit hard to believe the current situation so I'm writing everything out in the hopes of finding some relief. There must be something I'm not seeing. It's impossible, absolutely impossible for this to be the way it ends. I was so close to the finish line, I could feel the confetti and fireworks about to go off in my head. The most satisfying victory of my life was seconds, perhaps milliseconds away. So many months had been spent in the hopes of arriving at this very moment. That was two months ago now. I lost a lot very quickly. Friends, teammates, co-workers. I mean, they're still alive, but I'm not a very big part of their lives any longer. My daily life occurs roughly four thousand miles away from the people I grew up with, yet it feels even farther than that. Just a few years ago, it was so easy for me to close the distance, but nowadays, I'd feel fortunate to get a glimpse of an outdated photo, let alone a chance to see them in the flesh. Still, I'm 100% sure that the current situation needs to change. If you've seen the movie ""The Prestige"" then you probably recall the feature trick, The Disappearing Man. Into one box and out of another. This is a simplified, but effective way of visualizing Tor, and what dark web operators are doing. There's just a lot more boxes and people disappearing, but it's not a secret how they're doing it. This system has proven to be particularly robust over the years and rapidly growing in popularity despite its flaws. Despite its flaws. Fundamentally flawed, but growing bigger, which means that every opportunity those issues present becomes that much more ... something. Enticing, lucrative, essential... there are many ways to leverage advantages when you can keep them alive, the advantages that is, and to yourself. It gives you time to explore options, make preparations, and perhaps most importantly, recover from mistakes. So what went wrong? Imagine this scenario: You're trying to track a Disappearing Man, but there are so many boxes he could enter first, then jump out of, then enter again, repeating as often as he'd like, at his own discretion. And don't forget, he's doing all this from somewhere else. So how do you stop him when you want to stop him, and watch him when you want to watch him? You build a better box, one designed for the Disappearing Man's successors. Outplaying your opponent becomes a much easier task when you outlive him. Enter Atlantis, Project Atlantis to be specific. You won't have much trouble digging up articles and stories about the Atlantis Market, nor the rumors surrounding its closure. A quick Google search brings up more info than you'll need to become familiar if you haven't already heard of it. If you've endured this much of my rambling already, I commend your patience. I'll get a bit more concise now: [here](URL is a sanitized screenshot of promotional material used by Atlantis prior to its shutdown. Note the date. Their Facebook page is still live and found with ease. This particular dark web market faded from the spotlight quickly and decisively and would perhaps be even more forgotten had it not come up again during the more recent trial of Ross Ulbricht. Supposedly having warned Ulbricht about a vulnerability in Tor, Atlantis Market closed its doors just soon enough to watch the seizure of Silk Road from afar. The Silk Road trial brought light to another character in this saga, one ""Variety Jones"" who has yet to be identified despite, while Ross has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. [Here](URL is a screenshot of an image recently posted to [varietyjones dot com](URL That damn blue wolf. That's all I can say about it now, after having spent the better part of the last two months chasing every leaf, string, stone, pixel and link that's related to this connection. For two months now, Ross has been imprisoned despite the revelation of corrupt DEA and HSI agents being involved with the case. For two months now, Ive felt that even if 99.999% of the agents acted appropriately and arrived at the correct conclusions, something feels very wrong about this case. Tonight seems like a memorable night in the making. Im on my way to meet with a developer who claims to have not only seen that very same blue wolf firsthand but also worked on the original, launched code of Atlantis Market. The evidence he sent over is cryptographically verifiable, but what worries me is why he held onto this kind of evidence, and why he would reach out to me out of the blue after a comment I made on imgur that had nothing to do with Silk Road, Atlantis, etc. The skeptic in me says he thinks he can squeeze some bitcoins out of me in exchange for more details. However, my skeptical sides skeptical side suspects that he has mistaken me for someone else, and by chance Ive said something that prompted him to give me these files. Its the only thing that makes sense, considering I dont know any more than whats been publicly debated and wondered about. Was it my username? The comment? Had his files not checked out, this wouldnt be worth a second thought and Id know better than to waste another second of my time, but damn, it was cryptographically proven. Its not like the kind of evidence you can Photoshop or throw in After Effects. I dont know if this developer is legitimate, but his proof is, so I dont have much of a choice but to follow-up on this. Im trying to make sense of it, but was given short notice to make the exchange and am now rushing off to to the next step. Ive always been keen for an adventure, but stilI feel more comfortable going into this meetup having at least said something to someone, and this particular avenue seemed extra fitting should anything unexpected come to fruition. Ill be arriving shortly. Please wish me luck, Im a gambling man, and it feels like antes just doubled as I go in blind. "
280,vulnerability,nosleep,Am I Overreacting? [Update],31,3fy5l1,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3fy5l1/am_i_overreacting_update/,2015-08-06 11:15:01,"Some background information: [First Post](URL - [Update 2](URL Logan came back yesterday evening. Things are definitely odd, but the oddness is just subtle enough that I might be reading too much into everything. At first, he seemed perfectly fine. Normal gait, normal clothes, normal expression. Id received no more 2am texts, and he managed to drive two and a half hours without incident. Hed even made record time. Our apartment complex is boxed-in by an iron perimeter fence and he hadnt brought his key on the trip, so I had to go down and unlock it for him. When he came trudging up the walkway with two months worth of luggage, I offered to help with his bags, but he politely declined. I held open the gate for him instead. A concrete pathway winds around the building, with increasing odd addresses to the left and decreasing even addresses to the right. He paused, staring at the numbers for maybe three seconds, before heading off toward our apartment. Its a confusing number scheme, sure, but hes probably been up and down that walkway upwards of one thousand times since we got the place. He should have known where he was going. He was probably just tired, or had a moment of nostalgia. Either way, I pretended not to notice. The night was still young, and as soon as he unpacked, Kyle suggested we go out to dinner to celebrate the successful internship. It came as a surprise, because Kyle almost never goes out of his way to engage in social interaction. Thus, it came as an even bigger surprise when Logan said no. I had expected him to jump at the opportunity to drag a willing introvert (technically two willing introverts if you count me) out on a social excursion. Logan apologized and said he wanted to relax for the night and that maybe we could do it some other time, which I completely understand. But Kyle only ever offers once, and after hes been turned down, he wont agree to it later on. Logan knows this. I guess its not that weird of a thing to do. Maybe Im over thinking it. In place of celebratory dinner, Logan and I settled in the living room with a couple of beers and switched on the television, but we ended up talking over the programming anyway. He described his coworkers, how much of the project theyd completed before he left, and all of the other things that hadnt been worth mentioning via text. As we spoke, my mind kept looping back to the panicked call and its aftermath. He still hadnt brought it up and I wanted answers. So, I eventually said, trying to sound casual as I drummed my fingers on the leather armrest, were those texts you sent between one and four in the morning supposed to be a joke? The words came out harsher than intended because Id let the question fester for the past few days. I should have asked sooner. He gave me an uncomprehending stare. I have no idea what youre talking about. Rolling my eyes, I showed him the nonsensical texts. Warning first. And lost. Sorry again. He stared at the screen, then slowly shook his head. Doesnt ring any bells. I didnt send those. Pulling out his own phone, he scrolled through our conversation, and held the screen up for me to see. I dont have them. Must be an error. My frown deepened. He wasnt lying, which meant it probably was a glitch, then. Unless he deleted them himself. A few more minutes passed before I mustered the courage to ask, Logan, what was up with that call, anyways? With a protracted sigh, he rolled his head back against the couch cushions. Oh, my God, Ive already told you- No, you havent. When you called, I legitimately thought you had been shot or mauled by a bear or had seen a coworker die. Thats how bad you sounded. And then you left me hanging for two days. I thought that maybe *you* had died. I think I deserve an explanation. He refused to make eye contact and continued to watch the program, sipping his beer with infuriating tranquility. I grabbed the remote and turned off the television, starting to get really pissed that he wouldnt acknowledge me or what I was saying. Logan, please. Leaning forward, he set his can on the table and, pressing his palms together, rested his forehead against his thumbs. Look, Sophia, Im sorry that youre freaked out, but- What happened? His mouth twisted down at the corners and he squeezed his eyes shut. Nothing happened. The vulnerability in his voice brought me up short. I sunk back against the couch cushions, resting my hands in my lap. I opened my mouth to say something, anything, if only to comfort him or maybe apologize, but no words came. Nothing happened, he repeated, sharper this time. Stop asking me about it. Rising from his seat and refusing to make eye contact, he said, Im going to bed. His footfalls receded down the hallway, culminating in a forcefully shut bedroom door. I stared at my hands, feeling rather like dirt and hoping that the slammed door hadnt woken Kyle up. That was one more argument I didnt need. A cupboard closed in the kitchen. I looked up and found pajama-clad Mariah leering at me from across the counter. You should drop it, she said, stirring a mug of expensive tea, the likes of which were invariably recommended by some fashionable health blog. Hes obviously not interested in telling you. Probably because there isnt anything to tell. She had a point, though I hadnt known the topic would upset him so deeply, and if I had, I wouldnt have asked. But it isnt such a bad question, is it? If he doesnt want to tell me, thats his business, but I cant be in the wrong for simply asking. By this morning he seemed to have gotten over it, at least insofar as he was willing to talk to me and wasnt pulling any passive-aggressive bullshit like he sometimes does when hes pissed. I didnt bring up the call or the texts, mostly because I was sure my chance had passed, and at any rate, he wasnt going to answer. Also, I wanted to enjoy the peace before I managed to screw it up again. While making breakfast, I set a skillet over the heat and waited for it to warm up so I could start frying some good ol fashioned pork products. I needed something routine. Cue the strangest maybe-normal-maybe-not event thus far. Our cooking space is deceptively limited. Poor design by the builders, mostly. When one person is using the stove, contortionist-level skill is required to utilize a good portion of the kitchen, so weve piled the utensils next to the stove for quick-access. As such, Logan reached across to grab a spatula and accidentally brushed his wrist against the handle of the skillet. With a hiss he recoiled, wringing his hand and gritting his teeth, and hurried over to the sink to run cold water over a welt already discoloring the inner-skin of his wrist. The skillet - non-treated cast iron because Mariah is a hippie - had only been over the flame for thirty seconds, a minute at the most. Definitely not enough time to conduct the heat necessary to leave a burn like that. Experimentally, I tapped the handle. Nothing. I pressed my fingers against the metal, but it was still cold from the cupboard. Thinking hed maybe touched the pan itself, I tapped the lip and even the center. It was hot, but not sear-your-flesh hot. You okay? Sorry about that. He waved it off. Its my fault. Just a minor burn. I said nothing further, afraid my voice would betray me, and absconded to my room as soon as my food was ready. I needed to talk to someone who wasnt immediately involved in the situation, so I decided to call one of my friends from back home. Discussing some of the more believable events of the last few days might have helped me clear my head. My phone opened up to my conversation with Logan, which is where Id left it the night before. I almost clicked out, until I noticed something was missing. The three glitch texts were gone. They had been there. They had definitely been there, and now they werent. I didnt delete them. I showed them to Mariah and Kyle, so Im not the only person other than Logan who knew they existed. I dont know what happened to them, but I have my suspicions. I should have taken a screenshot. Does it really matter, though? I feel like Im picking at a weeping scab. He isnt dead, and he isnt hurt, so I shouldnt worry, right? No one else is showing much concern, so maybe, as per usual, Im letting my anxiety get the better of me. They all seem to think so. Or am I just the only one whos paying close enough attention? Its probably nothing, I know, but all of these little things keep piling up. All of these little, unexplained things. I dont know what to do, or if theres anything I can do, or if I should *do* anything at all. Im at a loss."

""They're Eastern European fairytales, monsters and phantoms, they climb out of graves in shroud pajamas and eat their families, ex-suicides and murderers and deaths in childbirth-"" ""Okay, okay."" I set down the Coke in the cup holder, trying to contain my anxiety, the intensity of my curiosity. ""So not vampires-"" ""--No. It's a right shitty term, love."" ""So what, then?"" He turned his head, hair blowing around in the interstate darkness: he was only a silhouette, half-lit by the green glow from the dashboard, but I could almost sense his considering gaze, his teasing smile. ""*Faciendus*. *Homo Faciendus*. *Archons*. *Blood fetishists.* *They, them*. Anything but 'vampire' is fine. It's an ugly word, kiddo. Gives all the wrong ideas."" But in the end, that's what they are, right? How many? I don't know. As per modern legend they gather in the cities, not to prey on copious mankind, just to get off among copious mankind. It's not a matter of survival for them, it's a matter of sex, of getting off. So the rumors and the stereotypes are true, to a degree: they hang out in the goth clubs and the vampire bars, dawdle amid the BDSM freaks and the EBM fanatics with their artisan ceramic fangs, the literary types, the theatre types, the musicians and artists. It's not such a supernatural thing, after all, all they want is to get off. All it takes is an open mind, a held breath, a jackknife opened in the dark bedroom, a little whisper, a calming murmur. ---- *""Let me see them.""* I grab his head, tangled up with him in the brown blankets of the Holiday Inn. He grins, bright sudden grin he can't help, terrible little needles in the shattered light through the blinds; I touch one, delicately, and can't help but smile when he winces and bows his head. ""Does it feel that good?"" ""It's a sexual thing, darlin. Why do mitochondria split? Why does a hart go roving for a doe in the woods at night? We do it because-"" I grab his head, I pull it down, I have been trained for this. He found me when I was eight; I first discovered what he was when I found him raving violently in the woods behind the great house at twelve, ripping off tree branches in pure frustration, and he turned on me, oh God this visage of a monster he turned on me, this cold-blooded murderous viper-mouthed semblance of a man. *Watch what you say. Don't fuck this up.* ----- **The Anatomy of the Vampire:** &gt;Immortality after all is a myth. Natural death is a surpassable difficulty: great care will mitigate the risk, but these things can still kill you: grievous injury; decapitation, burning, instant stoppage of the heart through any means. Drowning, burning, suffocation, mortal gunshot. Falling, evisceration. &gt;""Anything that will kill a mortal man is going to kill you, with some exceptions, and they are few. You will live long, if you take care, so guard yourself well, stay with your own kind. Be safe in your own household and guard your back at all times."" &gt;The physical characteristics of the vampire: &gt;He is not marked by death but by neoteny: the characteristics that give him a long life will alter his skeletal structure, and there are certain things you will see. &gt;The vampire is typically large-eyed, with a large forehead and a small jaw, and while he is often thin of physique; there are exceptions to this and may not be an abiding characteristic, rather the result of an oral shift in libido. &gt;He usually is nocturnal, having some aversion to the sun that seems to be more oriented to visual or neurological sensitivity than any kind of physical vulnerability. UV radiation has as little effect on him as any other ionizing radiation: cancer is not a concern for him, though infection with the virus gives no relief or cure for preexisting cancerous condition. &gt;The virus is weak, relatively speaking. Successful infection depends upon a immunosuppressed host, either through the traditional Bacchanalian means of ravishment or more common cruelties on the immune system: AIDS facilitates almost immediate infection, to varying success, and treatment courses of certain medications such as corticosteroids or glucocorticoids are facilitative as well. &gt;The mark of his nature, the cruel canine teeth, come about through a loss of the adult teeth during the transformative process and replacement by modified structures which are more adapted to the process of breaking the skin to access the vascular system, and facilitated in that regard by erectile structures within the jaw, (), which once impelled by the release of particular neuromodulators/neuropeptides [5] fill with blood and extend the fang structures in a mimicry of the sexual anatomy...

Always worrying, always looking; looking for whatever is chasing them. Not-so-subtle twitches and shifting eyes; sentences giving way to silent bridges as they scan the intentions of those around them. Some are able to realize their unnecessary nerves and abandon their suspicions. Others, however, let them fester, almost to a point where they are fathering their wounds, poking them just enough to never heal. These are they who have become possessed by their ideas, eventually succumbing to a false inevitability of padded walls and 'comfort jackets'."" ""Hmph........."" ""This is not paranoia."" ""And these are not ideas."" ""I know what is there. I'm not worried of their intentions. I'm not anxious of their arrival. Those are things that have long since been revealed. No, no.....what I fear is actually seeing them."" ""You see, for years I had been very much into scary stories. I started as a kid with the old 'Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark' books. Short tales with accompanying drawings to dance with your imaginations. Occasionally they made their way into my dreams, with regret and resolve flooding my awakenings. Over time, and every time, curiosity and the need to break from routine would creep in, pushing me to test the waters again. I often just dove right in."" Like many, I've found that the internet was a perfect fit for that self-made void. Websites dedicated to only creepy tales, 'pastas', if you will. The connoisseurs of such stories are quite aware of the stomachs they possess, and pasta was deemed filling enough for the appetites they incurred. I found myself right at home with these other dwellers."" ""Hhhuuuuuuwwwfffffffffffff........"" ""Man.....some of those stories. Tragedies, myths, legends...whichever you prefer. You know how sometimes you hear or read a scary story, the kind that hooks you by the lip while feeding you through the ear? The kind that makes you look around as if the entity within is watching you learn about itself? Those are the successful ones. Those are the ones that leave an impact; an impact that at times decides how someone lives their life."" ""The truth is, the creatures of such stories don't exist. Not until you know about them, at least. Once you're aware of their story, of their name, that's when they live, as if you yourself had breathed the life into their lungs. And like any being that has been revived, they feel the need to stay close to their reviver. For someone like me who has read innumerable amounts of tales....well, let's say my entourage would give the devil a nightmare."" ""There's one thing though....they are proud to make their presence known, but they never seek to let themselves be seen. The feeling of being watched? It's always one of them. You can tell they're there, feel the space behind you being filled with a certain shape of matter. If you don't investigate, it will inch closer. You look over your shoulder, almost certain of what you'll see, only to find nothing. But as you're looking back, the unnerving sense that what was behind you is now in front of you sinks in, and as if wound up, your head whips back around."" ""Nothing."" ""How about in the shower, head down, eyes closed, enjoying the warmth and comfort of a water blanket. But then you remember the one you read about, the description of such has been seared into your mind. It knows you know. It wants you to know. And it wants you to know it's there. You open your eyes, knowing exactly where it will be, staring at you just above the curtain rod. Look fast, or look slow? It doesn't matter, it won't be there when you look. But if you don't look, it will stay there, right? So you have to look."" ""Is it relief you feel when you don't see it there? I thought it was. But those false securities do nothing to quench its existence. It won't let you forget that you know. You brought it to life. And it will always want you to look."" ""Sometimes they get close. Real close. The insect you felt crawling on your skin? The brush you felt in your hair? The breath you felt on your neck? Why don't you ever feel those when you're looking? No. It's always where you are not staring. They know we can't see everywhere, and that's where they stay. Just out of sight. But hell....they will not let you forget they are there."" ""Other times, they give you some space. Space, mind you. Not comfort. Why does your house make so many noises? Some say it's settling in. But then why does a hundred year old house creak? How long does it take a house to get comfortable? No, it's not the house that's settling itself in. Like I said, they are proud to make their presence known. Investigate the noises if you want, you will not find its creator. In essence, you are the creator. But the creator is not the controller, and it will remind you that you are not in control."" ""They are."" ""And they've controlled how my life is lived. I got so tired of the looking over my shoulder routine that I started to have my back towards a wall whenever possible. I avoid mirrors, fearing that a reflection wouldn't count as them being seen. I don't own a car (back seats and rear view mirrors?), so I walk, ride my bike, or occasionally take the bus. As much as possible, I keep looking forward. Looking up or down gives them too much space to work with. That's another reason I am never in the dark. And I mean never. I've even gone as far as only wearing button-up shirts. The time, however short, that a t-shirt is covering my vision while putting it on is still enough for them to make me feel uneasy."" ""These are the reasons my house is the way it is. Single story, unattached studio condo. No separate rooms, no designated quarters. Just one big square room, surrounded by four walls. Only one way in and out. Zoning restrictions made me put another door on the back wall, as well as two windows. Well, they're there, on the outside at least. After it was built and the inspectors were finished and cleared, drywall helped patch those holes on the inside. Everything I need is aligned on each of the walls. Sink and kitchen supplies stretch from one corner to the middle of the wall. I have no cabinets or cupboards, though, just shelves. Bathroom and toiletries are opposite corner of the kitchen. I live alone, so I don't need privacy. The corner across from the bathroom is what I would call my bedroom. Just a single mattress on the ground. I don't give them much space to hide in my house. The more I can see at once, the less they have to work with."" ""The hardest part of living like this, though? Sleeping. You can't survive without sleep, but the second you close your eyes...well, you've just released them into a theme park of the unseen. Have you realized that when you remember them at night, you can never keep your eyes closed for too long? The distinct feeling that they're in your room; sometimes in the darkest corner, other times a silhouetted roommate. You have to look, even when childhood instinct tells you behind closed eyes is safest. Naivety, like ignorance, was bliss. But now, the longer you hide, the more sinister they become. So you look. Whether it's to ease your creeping thoughts or slow their piercing watch, you look. It's too dark to see if they're there, though. But you've looked, and they've been satisfied."" ""It's not that they can't be seen, or even that they don't want to be. They don't need to see our fear to know they've done their work. When we look, they avail. It's our growing need to see the unseen that they play on. We fear what we cannot see; what we don't know."" ""You see, experience puts on confidence. The more common something is, the more desensitized to it we become. So they stay in the shadows, begging us to look while our minds do all the work. This is the fear that grows yet never ages, the fear that stains and remains."" ""Now, just like anyone, I've always felt comfort in numbers. I liked being at school, I like being at work. I have a good number of friends and acquaintances, some of them I've known for years and have become fairly close. We hang out, go on trips, do any number of stupid things that any normal person does. My social life hasn't suffered because of my lifestyle. Remember, we all have our own demons."" ""Jared, Braden, and Shelly are my close circle of friends. I was introduced to Shelly and Jared through Braden a few years back. He and I worked together at a convalescent home, giving aid and support to the elderly. One night he invited me to a party at Jared's house, and I was welcomed in as a sort of 'fourth musketeer'. Over time and trust, they came to know about my life, how I live, and why I live that way. They'd give me a hard time, but it never really hurt any friendships between us."" ""..............................."" ""Shhhiii......why did that night have to happen?"" ""I told them I didn't want to go. I didn't say they couldn't go, just that I wasn't going. 'An abandoned warehouse in the woods? Are you kidding me? Do you know how many stories I've read?' I'm not an idiot. I said they could call me when they get back to town, I'd meet up with them after. So I went back home, making sure the light bulb hadn't burnt out before I walked in. I never turn off my lights, even to sleep."" ""About an hour later I was watching TV (mounted on the wall so there's no space behind it) when the power went out. I'm not ignorant, I know these things happen, so I have a few battery powered lamps that are always on as well. But even with these backup lights on, the usual comfort of my home had put on an eerie cloak of dread. I needed the solace of my ceiling light, and knew that I had to go check the breaker. That's the one thing I overlooked while building...the breaker. I forgot to tell them to make sure it was in the house. Instead, like many homes, it was located in the garage. Unlucky enough for me, that was a door I had covered up as well. The only way to get to it was to go outside and open the garage door itself."" ""I'm well enough rehearsed to know how scary movies start, but the need I had of my ceiling light outweighed my common sense. With a police-duty flashlight and a poor-mans gun, I ventured out to save myself from having to look where I didn't want to. I am my own damsel in distress."" ""I only remember bending down to lift the garage door, and maybe a hint of Juicy Couture."" ""When I regained my consciousness, I found myself exactly where I didn't want to be. An abandoned warehouse, in the middle of the woods. Seated and shackled, with a taste of chemical in my throat, I looked up to find my three best friends, undoubtedly responsible for my current situation. There wasn't a sense of betrayal in their eyes, however, they were the same, friendly group as if we were at the bowling alley. I knew they weren't trying to hurt me, there wasn't an insidious atmosphere about them. They explained to me that they were concerned that I was suffering from paranoia, and they knew how to help me out. Not wanting them to sense my fear, I told them I wasn't scared that something was after me, that they had misunderstood what I confided in them. I said that what they thought I was 'suffering from' wasn't making me crazy, but rather, cautious. I asked if they would release me from the chair. It was then that I realized how bright it was in the warehouse. The shop lights were still functioning, and somehow Jared had turned them on."" ""'We understand what you told us, Adam,' said Braden. 'We just want you to understand that they aren't real. You've made them up, and you've let that affect how you live. Aren't you tired of it all?'"" ""'What are you talking about? My life is fine,' I replied, 'and it hasn't interfered with any of yours. Why do you care how I live when I'm alone?'"" ""'Because it's not normal, and its not healthy. You're missing out on more than you even know is out there.' Jenny spoke out, but I wouldn't say spoke up. The cracks in her voice told of her disapproval of the activity."" ""The three started walking towards the door, leaving me fogged of their intentions. 'STOP! Please, what are you doing?' The panic in my body found its way out through my voice. None of them turned, none broke stride. Jenny and Braden left through the door first, while Jared stopped just short of the exit. I waited, and then saw his hand reach up to the light switch."" ""'NO no no no no no,' I started to plead, 'Jared, please. If you knew what this does to me, you'll stop. Please, don't.' His head turned, only so I could see him, 'Don't worry, Adam. We'll be right outside.'"" ""'NO!' I shouted, just as he hit the switch."" ""You know that moment when you turn off your bedroom light and you feel more vulnerable than ever? But then you dash and jump into the comfort of your covers, silently announcing victory over your foes? I was not granted that luxury. I was stuck, chained in this limbo of vulnerability, knowing the terrors that await."" ""The silence did not last long."" ""The first thing that invaded that warehouse was the one thing I was able to avoid for so long. I could feel the space being filled behind me, the first of many to make its presence known. I could feel it watching, not moving, but watching me fight the tension building inside me. The urge to look back began to fill my mind, and the thought that it actually might be there when I turned flooded my bloodstream. But, as you know, that urge becomes like an itch, and you can only fight it for so long. Holding my breath, as if that made me invisible, I turned to face what has been watching me so eagerly. That's when I realized my other problem; the warehouse had become so dark that my eyes had nothing to focus on."" ""Usually when you feel something behind you and you turn to investigate, you feel the weight lifted from you as you realize you're alone."" ""I had no such lightening experience this time. Though I could not see, I could feel that what was behind me had not vanished. It remained as present as ever, knowing I was looking, taunting my very wits. Not two seconds after looking back, the next step in the process unfolded; it was in front of me. But this thing had not moved. No, this was a second one, a new one. And it was much closer than the one that was behind me."" ""The breath you feel on your neck was now the one I felt on my cheek. I knew looking wasn't going to change anything, but it's the same feeling you get when it's behind you, and eventually you have to look. I again saw nothing, but that made it all the worse. It was there, but I didn't know what it was. It could have been any number of creatures that I had brought to life. It was any one of them, yet it was all of them at once. It's the not knowing that scares us most."" ""The next horror to present itself was the prickling I felt on the back of my leg. This was no insect. The pinpoint taps were unmistakable fingernails, and the direction it came from meant it was under my chair. The sudden company I felt on my leg made me jump and look down immediately, giving rise to two more entities."" ""These ones were audible. Distant, but audible. From the sounds, I gathered they were walking. Moving, maybe not walking, but moving around. The cracks and scrapes of bones on pavement lightly filled the already crowded air. Numbers of joints, moving about with uncoordinated motion, drew closer on both my right and my left. The more I looked to one side, the closer the other became. Though the trails they walked were endless, for as one came near, the other faded. As the closer one drummed my corresponding ear, it became that itch I had to scratch. This gave way for the other to take its place, awkwardly slinking towards me while the other resumed its stalk."" ""The breath I had been holding had long escaped my lungs, and each inhalation seemed to draw a new body. Years of stories and creatures were taking form inside that warehouse. I knew each and every one, though I did not know where they were. I had never felt them like this before. It's as if the life I lived, repressing them into smaller and smaller corners, had angered the lot of them. Like a caged beast being set free, they seemed to have taken advantage of this moment to make me look at all the places I had hidden. They were not more powerful, though they were far more eager. The awful sounds they would make tunes your brain to subconsciously look that way. But the vindication one normally feels at an empty place was replaced with a black that no man could recreate. I didn't know what was there. My thoughts raced for solutions, but those were only drowned out by the workings of the hidden. My friends outside could not hear - these were noises made specifically for me."" ""Everything began to blur. The sickening symphonies were fading to the back. My neck was so strained as I was forced to look in the places I could not see. Breathing was an effort. I was about to welcome what I felt was passing out, when I noticed something different. The chains I thought that held me to the chair were loose. Whether they were always that way or became so through my struggle, I wasn't about to question. I shook my hands exempt, now able to loose the ones around my feet. As I finally became free, I realized it was from more than just the chains. The unearthly sounds had stopped. The air had lightened, and I did not feel surrounded by other-worldly bodies. I did feel, different, however.......I felt.......hidden, is the only way I could describe it. I felt among the shadows, like I was able to be where the other fears hide. It was as if the time spent in this prison of a warehouse provided me a sort of, empathy...? Like a sort of physical stolckholm syndrome. I was still afraid of what I could not see, but I also felt as if I could play their game as well. That's where my plan began to form."" ""I felt my phone in my pocket, and knew that would help in my strategy. I wanted my friends to feel what I just experienced. I wanted them to fear what they didn't know. I wanted them to understand. I first broke the switch that turned on the lights, now leaving it all to complete darkness. The noise I made must have alerted them, cause that's when the door opened and Braden stepped inside."" ""'Adam, you alright buddy?' He reached for the switch and was surprised when it wasn't there. 'What the, hell...?' He shuffled in his pocket and produced a small flashlight. After investigating the switch, he pointed the light to the chair. His gasp made it apparent that his expectations were not met. 'Adam?' His voice was lacking confidence now. His slow steps toward the chair gave me space to fill behind him. I waited till there was a gap between us, and took slow, quiet steps. I wanted his anxiety to settle in. His cautious movements became my timer, and as he slowed his pace to look around, 'BRADEN!' I shouted, two feet from his ear. He let out a grunt of a scream, turning around to the direction of my voice, shining his light on what he did not know. That's when he saw the flash of my phone as I took a picture of the fear he wore on his face. That was my plan. I wanted to capture the moment when they were afraid, so I could remind them of the fact that we all have our fears."" ""His second scream surprised me, as it sounded as one more of terror than of shock. He almost knocked me over as he sprinted towards the door. He bolted out of the warehouse, yelling for Jared and Jenny to get in the car. 'What is wrong?! What happened?!' She yelled back, running after him. He got in and started the engine, yelling for Jared to hurry up."" ""'What about Adam??' He yelled back. 'We're not leaving him up here!'"" ""'He's not in there! I couldn't find him! Let's go!'"" ""'Couldn't find me?' I thought. 'You heard me scream your name and take a picture.' I brushed it off as I heard Jared yell that he was going to come in and get me. He opened the door and I took to my hiding spot. I thought I heard Braden's car pulling away."" ""'Hey, Adam! C'mon, they're leaving us! We have to walk if you don't come outside!' I wasn't going to let that foil my plan. He brought out a flashlight as well, scanning the warehouse for his lost buddy. There were a few scraps of heavy machinery that had been left behind, providing me for the cover I needed to proceed. I made small, faint scuffing noises with my feet, making it sound like a child running across the ground. His light moved to where he thought he heard the sound, but it was far enough off to let me play with him a little more. I found a small screw, which I tossed so it landed just opposite of where he was looking, causing him to quickly turn around to find the source. 'Jared,' I whispered, short and eerie. 'Adam, knock it off and let's go!' Oh this was perfect. His voice was shaking, as I could tell so were his hands. That's when his light flickered out. This was perfect timing for me to sneak up on him, this time approaching from the front rather than behind. I wanted a different reaction. 'Shit...,' he said, trying to coax the light back to life. The dark of the warehouse made me able to get within a foot of him, a disturbing grin upon my face. As he stared into the flashlight, the batteries reconnected, providing a steady stream of light. He pointed it back in front of him, revealing the scene I laid out. Right as he let out his scream I snapped my camera, satisfied with my results. That's when he passed out, falling to the side, hitting his head on the edge of my metal chair. Ah, nothats not good, I muttered. I picked up his flashlight, lighting his face so it would maybe wake him up. Thats when I saw the blood. Like a bad movie, his head hit where the metal was bent and jagged. The laceration to his scalp provided space to see the fracture in his skull. Braden! Jenny! I shouted for them, when the realization that they actually left suddenly hit me. Oh no, no, no.Jared! Can you hear me? Are you ok?! Oh come on buddy, please, please get up, wake up. Wake up!! My voice was desperate and shaky. Jared wasnt breathing. He was losing blood too fast for me to stop it. I took off my shirt, pressing it to his wound, doing what I could to try to slow the loss. I called 911, told them that my friend had passed out and hit his head, he was losing blood fast. I remember how much it annoyed me that the dispatcher told me to calm down The ambulance came too late. Way too late, in fact. Maybe it was my call that was late.either way, I couldnt reverse what had happened. No one could understand what had happened, myself included. With a lack of witnesses, and a certain amount and angle of evidence, the scene was labeled a crime. Apparently, I was upset at what my friends had put me through, and my anger was turned to vengeance on Jared. Wow..how do I fight that one? I know enough to know that nobody would believe my story. So I kept it to myself. I plead guilty, letting the judicial system take its course. At least in jail Id never be alone, right? It wasnt until the trials that I saw the pictures I had taken. These bothered me more than anything hidden could have done. But thats when I observed something. Their eyes.they werent looking at where I wouldve been while taking the picture. No, they were looking past me, over me, beyond where I stood. And they were focused. Whatever their light had shone on, their eyes had focused on them as well. And it wasnt a look of surprise, either.it was one of realization. You know, when you see an old friend that you hadnt seen in years, and your eyes widen at the recognition of an old pastime? Although, whatever they were looking at, Im sure were not friends. It did seem, however, it was something from their childhood, something old and familiar. I dont know. Like I said, its not that they cant be seen. But I guess it is up to them when they want to be. And now here I sit, in this hole, this solitary confinement. And confined I am. These four walls feel familiar, albeit quite smaller. And ever since that warehouse, this darkness is no stranger. Nor does it leave me with strangers. I am among those that I have brought into my world, though I do not know who is who. I still dread the day that I will see them. Remember, it is the black behind everyones eyes that hides the darkest fears. It is the things that we do not know that we fear the most. The things that stay just out of sight. * * * Adam Solbreit was charged and convicted of premeditated murder, which in this state can carry a sentence as high as the death penalty. That is exactly what Adam asked the judge for. The judge needed no convincing, it was his decision anyway. On February 7th, 2014, Adam was put to death by way of lethal injection. Per my job of executioner, I was the one who delivered his fatal dose. I knew his case well, heard many things in the news, and as the one who carried out his sentence, I was privy to certain pieces of evidence. I have listened to this tape over and over. The things he talks about, the stories he mentions.he doesnt soundcrazy, per se, but they are pretty unbelievable. Its hard to make sense of it all. And though this confession can be quite disturbing, it isnt what keeps me up at night. No, what troubled me most, was right before his injection took effect, he turned and looked through the window where I stood. His face was one of acceptance, one of relief. From what, I wouldnt venture to guess. But just before he passed, his eyes shifted from mine to just above my shoulder, and the relief he had portrayed was gone. This concerned me, so I turned around and looked, but found nothing. The time was gone, and so was he. But Ill never forget that look. I dont know.. It has me feeling a little paranoid. "
283,vulnerability,nosleep,A Word of Warning to NoSleep Regulars,353,3gsq8y,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3gsq8y/a_word_of_warning_to_nosleep_regulars/,2015-08-13 11:47:53,"As a seasoned reader of and subscriber to NoSleep, I (and I'm sure you,) have become accustomed to a certain type of horror; a type of fear. We read over and over about he who walks on all fours, about elongated smiles disguising long and wicked fangs. How many times have you closed your eyes to only imagine those stringlike, slender fingers easing around your bedroom door left slightly ajar? Or equally as chilling: that small girl with pale skin and stringy, greasy black strands of long hair smeared over her face. Can you see them? Yes probably. Do you believe honestly, to your core that they are real? No, probably not. Why is this? It is because really, when your restless night draws to a close and you wake to the usual sunlight in your comfortable normality, it is more than easy to dismiss the images of horror. You can brush your teeth in the morning and pat your dog and convince yourself (almost completely) that these things are nowhere but in your head. This is what the overexposure of horror films and NoSleep has done to you. It has made you wary; desensitised. You are not easily frightened anymore. Stories of oranges or phantom Facebook messages are but much loved fiction that pull at the nostalgia born in a time where you could be spooked by words; filled with adrenaline due to only a chilling literary work. But now here you are. You scoff at easy scares and you laugh at cheap thrills. Almost a form of addiction; you desire that initial terror. You plead for a story that raises the bumps in your arms or forces you to leave a lamp on for the following week. The point of all this is actually to offer a caution. I was in your position too. I scrolled mindlessly through the top scoring posts of the preceding 24 hours, becoming increasingly frustrated at my developed ability to predict endings and bar myself from genuine fright. However, this plummet into cynicism is by far my greatest regret in my horror intrigue. You see, whilst the ability to dismiss tales of the paranormal can be a useful survival tactic or protection technique, it is also a vulnerability. You are so-to-speak Boy-Cried-Wolfing yourself in this life. Over and over superficial fear is debunked by your psychological resilience. In turn this means in the dark, when you do hear that scratching, when you do feel that chill, when you do see that sinister shadow cast on your floorboards, you will shake your head and laugh away the suspicion; the fear. Do you see the danger here? Do you understand what this means? Youve let your guard down now. Its too late to go back and the damage is done. When they come for you, you will be unsuspecting. You will be - in their minds - ready. You are susceptible to their manipulation and vulnerable to their wrath. They know you and they know your strengths and weaknesses. In the same way we are told of an omniscient Santa Claus who watches to determine good-or-bad child, they follow your deep descent into culpability. This makes you a perfectly malleable tool - a clay model for them to play with. The strike when you believe they are not real. They attack, when you think you can fight back. My warning to you is: You cant. I learned this the hard way. They came for me and in many ways, they remain. They are more fearsome than any story ever described and they are more malicious than the mind could ever foresee. They smelled my cynicism and lapped up my navety like a dog drinking from a bowl. I belong to them, and soon you will too."

Growing up I wore baggy shirts,baggy jeans...I did everything in my power to hide my body. I can remember going to bed fully clothed..but waking up totally naked..not in my bed..shivering usually in the kitchen or some odd location in the house away from all the rooms.Confused and frightened I always ran back to my room,got dressed and went back to bed.I didn't go back to sleep,I'd just lay there..scared and violated.I don't remember it happening often..but it was so strange that to this day I have trouble sleeping.I am 26 and check my closets,under my bed and all through the house.I lock the windows and all the doors..I feel the least safe when I am alone. I don't know how to get into it or even begin to explain why I'm writing this down but here it goes..I think something very terrible was happening to me as a child.Something so terrible that it turned a shy,friendly daddys little girl..to an angry,spiteful daddy issues girl.I never thought of it until my therapist asked me why I held such a grudge against my step father.I told him it was because he beat my mother,he was an alcoholic,he beat us..he was a terrible man. ""but you must have already known these things,what was the tipping point for you where you decided he was no longer friendly or family?"" I don't know.It was like..I went to sleep one night and woke up so angry at him..but I can't remember why.Could it be? I don't know.I don't want to think he did or would..but the idea always rang in my ears like bells..hearing my aunt curse at my mother ""look at how he looks at her,Angie..it ain't right.You have to see it too!""..When you're a child..you're so oblivious,so naive.. What if something terrible happened to me? What if I don't want to remember.I was suggested to try ""sleepy therapy"" I think it's called..at first I didn't want to but my therapist strongly suggested it.He said the dreams I have of my step father are not normal.So I tried it..but the outcome was very bad..I was told I had a violet outburst of choking myself and sobbing.It's embarrassing,it really is.At first I seemed confused..and the deeper the dream therapist pried the more shut in I became.I began grinding my teeth at first..then shaking my head left to right.The only words I managed to say was ""don't"" and then I started choking myself and sobbing (Disappointing,I know) I am too ashamed to go into detail..he is not an attractive man in fact he is quite gruesome to look upon..what do I do? even worse what if it wasn't him at all? *side information: I was diagnosed as a nymphomaniac by the age of 22.I never took meds but instead I work out..a lot.I have to keep myself busy..in a non sexual way obviously.*"
285,vulnerability,nosleep,What was he eating downstairs?,112,3hwuw5,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3hwuw5/what_was_he_eating_downstairs/,2015-08-22 09:51:36,"For as long as I can recall, I've experienced sleep paralysis. As a kid, I used to deal with it several days a week; it was just a thing that happened sometimes. Usually it wasn't bad, I'd just be frozen for a minute or two after waking. Other times it was very bad. Like the time I woke up and saw an oddly skinny creature crawling across my bed to get to me - or the time I opened my eyes and saw my godmother's weeping, severed head nestled in my dirty laundry. As soon as I'd break free from the paralysis, the visions would disappear. That was always my comfort: knowing that all I had to do was close my eyes and try to move and the scary things would be gone. The night terrors continued into my teen years, getting more and more frightening the older I got. I figured it made sense; the more scary stories and movies I subjected myself to, the more fuel my nightmares had. Not a big deal, I always woke up. There was a recurring vision during these years. It must have only happened about 4 or 5 times, but each time it did, it left me so terrified I couldn't close my eyes the rest of the night. It went like this: I wake up on my back, arms at my sides. My mother is standing to the left of me. Back then, I had one of those half bunk beds from Ikea - the one that's only the top bunk with storage space underneath - so my mother's face is level with mine. I shift my eyes to her and she looks worried. She begins covering me in paper towels and says, ""If he can't see you, he can't get you."" I try to ask her, *get me how?* but I am unable to speak. She answers anyway: ""He sees children, and then they're never seen again. We don't know what he does with them."" I somehow know she's lying; in this state, I can almost hear her thoughts. *He eats them in their beds.* *He eats them in their beds.* *He eats them in their beds.* I hear it in my head again and again even though I don't want to. Just then, I shift my eyes to the right. Standing in the corner is a tall figure masked by shadow. It has a hat on and some kind of cloak, and its arms are raised in a crucified way. It doesn't move at all, and it doesn't seem to be aware of us. I think (or hope) maybe it's just a scarecrow, it isn't alive. My mother places one paper towel over my face and says, ""I hope he didn't see you."" Then I wake up. It wasn't until I was 13 that my parents bought our first computer. Until then, I hadn't access to the internet. One of the first things I looked up was ""waking up frozen"". Tons of articles on sleep paralysis came up and I spent hours reading about the diagnosis and physiology behind it. I learned that it occurs when REM dreaming overlaps with waking and although the mind is sort of conscious, the body is still asleep. Those in this state often panic and hallucinate an intruder of some sort. Apparently, it happens more frequently when one falls asleep on his or her back (which I usually did), as this causes the soft palate to collapse and obstruct the airway, presenting a heaviness on one's chest and increasing the feeling of vulnerability. It all fit; the weighted feeling, the frightening visions. It was sleep paralysis. It felt comforting to finally put a name to the experiences. From that day on, I started sleeping on my side. Occasionally, I'd end up on my back in the middle of the night, but I found that as long as I didn't fall asleep in that position I'd be ok. No idea why, that's just how it worked. I avoided sleeping in the supine position for years. It just became a very welcome habit to sleep in the fetal position. However, something happened recently. A few weeks ago I moved into my boyfriend's apartment. It's been really nice sleeping with someone every night, something I'd never experienced before. Sometimes we fall asleep cuddling. Sometimes we're back to back. One night, I was fiddling around on my phone in bed because I wasn't tired. My boyfriend threw an arm around me and dozed off. It was pretty cute. I continued reading on my phone till my eyes grew heavy, then I set it aside. His arm was heavy with sleep and I felt bad waking him to find a more comfortable position, so I decided to go to sleep in the position I was in- lying on my back. *Maybe it won't happen now that I'm older*, I thought. *Even if it does, so what? It's just a dream.* I woke up in the middle of the night. My body was so heavy, I couldn't even wiggle my fingers. It had been so long that I'd felt that, I panicked a little. I remembered how much I hated the feeling; unable to move or speak, barely able to breathe. Before I could calm myself down, I heard a noise downstairs in the kitchen. Someone was eating something crunchy, like potato chips. My boyfriend was still asleep next to me, I could feel him. *Who the HELL is in the kitchen right now?!* I thought, fearing someone had broken in. I tried calling out to my boyfriend but my mouth wouldn't open. Just then, whatever was downstairs became... aware. It was strange, at that moment *I* knew that *it* knew that *I* knew it was down there. Then it started running up the stairs - quickly. As it approached the bedroom, I shut my eyes; whatever it was, I didn't want to see it. It ran right up to my side of the bed and stood next to me, breathing short, raspy breaths in my ear. It was still eating something, I could hear light crunching coming from it. All the while, I'd been wiggling my fingers, trying my hardest to wake up. It was working, I raised my arm an inch off the bed. It weighed a ton, but it felt so good to move. Just before I broke free from the dream, the thing at my side laughed and said, *""Remember me?""* I shot up, sweaty and scared. Looking around, I could see the room was empty, save for us. There was a distant noise that sounded like heavy breathing, but that could've been in my head. The dream was so unsettling that I had a very hard time getting back to sleep. I snuggled up to my boyfriend and thought of puppies and kittens and fat little hamsters. It worked, and I fell asleep. As I slipped into unconsciousness I heard a faint crunching sound. The next morning I told my boyfriend all about the dream. He'd never heard of sleep paralysis, and he didn't really care or understand how scary and real it all felt. Whatever, I shouldn't have fallen asleep on my back in the first place. The day went on and I found myself thinking about the dream at work. I told a co-worker about it and she confirmed its creepiness. It had been at least 10 years since I experienced sleep paralysis. Had it always felt so real? The vividness, the tangibility, the warmth I couldn't remember. It bothered me all day. I vowed to never, ever sleep on my back again. That evening I came home and hung out in the living room till my boyfriend got home from work. I wasn't exactly afraid to go into the bedroom, I just really didn't want to. When he got home about an hour and a half after I did, he asked why I was still in work clothes (he knows I immediately strip and put on my robe when I get home). Of course, he laughed when I told him why. ""Seriously?"" he teased. ""It was a dream."" ""I know,"" I moaned, ""but it felt real."" Together, we walked up the stairs to the bedroom. I waltzed into the room first, to show just how un-afraid I was. Looking for my robe, I nonchalantly glanced at where the scary thing had stood last night. Nothing was disturbed, or moved; no crumbs of whatever it was eating left behind. I felt silly for still feeling so tense about it. ""Hmm,"" my boyfriend sounded puzzled. I looked over to see him holding a roll of paper towels in his hand, looking at it with confused eye brows. ""I completely forgot,"" he said as he scratched his head, ""at some point last night I woke up and went downstairs to get these."" My throat felt dry. ""Why?"" I asked. ""I dunno,"" he continued to stare at them. ""I feel like I dreamt there was gonna be a huge mess to clean up, something about eating in bed."""
286,vulnerability,nosleep,Borrasca - IV,3102,3egzrb,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3egzrb/borrasca_iv/,2015-07-25 04:09:58,"[Part III](URL When I pulled up to his house the next morning, I could tell Kyle had cracked. He his skin had taken on a yellowed color and his voice was flat and void of emotion. Its not over yet, Kyle, I said as he dropped into the seat next to me. Yes, it is, Sam. He all but whispered. No, I dont believe that. Kimbers dad is missing too, you know. Maybe it was him instead that wasthat was I couldnt bring myself to say it. Were living in hell. Drisking, its Hell in our own reality. I couldnt disagree. The town Id grown to love seemed so foreign to me now. Whitney hadnt been an outlier like Id thought. Missing people were the norm here. And that would make Jimmy Prescott the king. Hes Satan, himself. As soon as the words were out of my mouth Kyle punched the car door, awaking from his dead state with rageful vigor. Ill fucking kill Jimmy Prescott! Where is that motherfucker! You know hes involved in all this, Sam, you know- Maybe partially. I said, staring out the window. His dad created the town that bred this shit but Im pretty sure the Prescotts are just running drugs. You know, the powder. Yeah and so what, hes recruiting people to be- to be drug mules or something? Maybe, I agreed for Kyles sake, though I didnt really believe it. The sound, the great beast machine of Borrasca gave off the distinct stench of death. And though I knew that physically that was impossible, it didnt change my mind about it. The air smelled different after the metallic wailing ended. We drove over to 4th Street Gourmet Coffee and Bakery and went in to buy our usual provisions of Rockstars and Monsters. As I paid for the four-packs of cans I saw Meera waiting on coffee at the end of the bar. I could tell immediately that she was in a good mood, something that I hadnt seen much of since Id started working for her. It was probably a good time to tell her I was calling out of work for my 5th day in a row. Hi Meera, I muttered when I approached. AhI cant come in again today. Ive got some- some really important- Sam! Oh my gosh, how are you? Umo- okay. I stuttered. Good! She said, brightly. Dont worry about coming in, Ill hold down the fort and Im sure I can call Emmaline in if I need help. But really, Sam, what have you been up to lately thats so important? My mind blanked. Just as I started to stutter out some bullshit about helping my dad, Kyle appeared behind me. Were trying to find Borrasca. He said with all the gravitas of a eulogy. Ah, yes. Owen told me youd asked him about that. You know thats just a story, Sam; that legend has been around since I was a kid. Yeah, well, were looking for our missing friend, Kimber. We think maybe shes there, I trailed off lamely. Oh really? I thought I heard the Destaros were staying with relatives in Maine over the summer. Oh well. Anyway, good luck, boys. Thanks. Kyles voice was sour and I knew his patience was thin. When we got back into the car we each popped open a can of Rockstar and started chugging. I knew better than to ask Kyle if he wanted to smoke since I was sure he hadnt lit a bowl since before Kimber disappeared. He finished the energy drink in under a minute and crumpled the can in his hand. I dont like your boss, he said. Meera? Why not? I dont know. Shesjustoff. Well I mean she has been going through some things. I wasnt going to elaborate any further. Why were you asking her husband about Borrasca anyway? I dont know. I was just making small talk and I thought he might know. He seemed to know about a lot of other things. And did he know? Nah. I took a long gulp of the sour drink and then choked on it when I remembered something Owen had said. Well, actually, yeah. He said a Borrasca instead of just Borrasca. You know, like its a thing instead of a place. Kyle lowered his Rockstar. And is it? Is it what? Is it a thing? I dont know. Ive never heard of it. Ive googled everything weird about this town but nothing ever came up. Did you spell it right? I dont know, I shrugged. Do you know how to spell it? No. I pulled out my phone. No, fuck google. Kyle said. We need to talk to Kathryn Scanlon. Thats what Kimber would say. He was right. Kathryn Scanlon may be the most knowledgeable person in town and was probably the right person to ask. I pulled out of 4th Street Coffee and prayed she was at her office already. When we parked in front of Drisking Arts and Antiques I was disappointed to see that the store was dark. Kyle pointed to a small, cheap OPEN sign hanging in the corner of the door and I crossed my fingers that it was for Kathryns office. I was relieved to find the door unlocked and we hurried past all the antiquities and blown glass to the back of the store where we found an open door and Kathryn sitting at her desk. Boys! She stood up when she saw us. Youre up quite early for summer break. How did the essay do? Ehgreat, I said. Actually were here for more help. Personal interest, Kyle added. Kathryn raised her eyebrows. Color me impressed. I needed to get right down to it. If by some small chance Kimber was still alive then every second counted. Were here because we want to know if Borrasca is a thing or a place. Kathryn raised her eyebrow. I remember that legend as a kid. Id actually have to tell you I didnt know if it wasnt for Wyatt. He knew so little about so much, she laughed. A sort of jack of all tradesanyway, he told me an interesting fact once about Borrasca  its both! What do you mean? I leaned over her desk. Well the term borrasca is just old, outdated lexicon. The word was used by miners to describe an underperforming mine. A mine I whispered. Kyle shook his head. Weve been looking at mines. So *all* the mines in Butler County are Borrascas? I asked. Well, generally its only the first mine in the system to run dry that is called a Borrasca. Do you know which mine ran dry first? In our mining system? Kyle asked from where he stood near the door, repeatedly clenching and unclenching his fists. Ah, not off the top of my head, no, she laughed. I can look though, I think I have those records here somewhere. Kathryn walked behind her desk and opened a drawer of loose files. This is an odd thing to be interested in for boys your age but I guess I should be glad you two are so eager to learn, especially over the summer. Yes, maam, very eager, said Kyle. Is the Borrasca, the first mine that ran out of ore, um, was that by chance the same one those kids disappeared in? The McCaskeys? Oh, no I dont think so. That particular mine was the southwest mine and was very close to town. I think it was one of the last to close, actually. Ah! Here we go. This packet should have that information. Kathryn spent far too long moving books around on the desk to make room for the stack of papers she had. Kyle and I paced around the room, nervously, trying to appear casually interested, while the energy drinks started coursing through our systems. Here, we go! The first mine to close was the north central mine, which wasyeah, actually one of the first to open. But where is it? Kyle walked over to the desk and braced his arms on it. Where is that mine? Um Kathryn pulled over a different stack of papers and started to fumble through it. After the longest minute of my life she made an a-ha! sound and pulled out a large, yellowed piece of paper that had been folded into a standard A4 size. She unfolded it on the desk and leaned over to read the markings. I could see from where I was standing near the doorway that it was a map and I knew we werent living this office without it. Lets see. That mine was up further on the mountain, a little harder to get to. See? And she pointed at a small dot on the map that was at least four miles from where wed been looking. Can we take this? Kyle asked. Well bring it back. Of course! Im sure I have copies. Listen, if you boys are going exploring- Im bringing my dad. I lied. Oh! Excellent then, you guys have fun! She yelled at us as we rushed out of the building. We didnt stop to answer her, fun was far from our minds. Its- its- its so far from where weve been looking, Kyle stuttered. We need to go there now. And we need to get a gun. A *gun*? Where are we going to get a gun, Kyle? From you dad. Hes not going to give us a gun, man. Fine, then lets scout the place first and then well come back with a gun. That didnt seem like a good idea to me either but what choice did we have? After studying the map for several minutes we realized the easiest way to access the mine was still through the West Rim Prescott Ore Trail. We parked at the trailhead and made the familiar hike down the marked trail and then up the beaten path, realizing that wed have to travel past Ambercot Fort on the way. And I knew in my heart that we were going the right way. We were walking the same path that so many people before us had on their way to Borrasca. But what had they found there? We passed the treehouse, which was as silent as the morning. We walked on in the woods, further north than we had ever been before and soon we were flying blind, hiking in the general direction of the dot on the map and hoping we were still on course. Within an hour I began regretting that wed come without provisions, emotional and unprepared. By noon we had been hiking for four hours and it seemed to me that we were lost. I tempered the welling panic with thoughts of Kimber and Whitney and the answers to the mystery that had absorbed my life for so many years. Kyle, for his part, said nothing and kept his eyes straight and his mission his priority. And then, just as the sun teetered on the apex of the day, we saw an emptiness through the trees and the hard lines of manmade buildings. Kyle quickened his step and I rushed to keep up. When we finally broke through the tree line I choked on my own deep breath and fell back against a tree as I looked over the quiet encampment. A large, wooden sign post that was almost as long as the entire clearing was still standing near the entrance of the mine. It had to be a century old and though most of the letters had rotted off over the years, from those remaining I could guess that it had once said: DRISKING UNDERGROUND MINE. What was left, however was: SKIN ND MIN Skinned men. That way, Kyle pointed to the north end of the camp. We stepped out from the shadows and into the vulnerability of the clearing. There were several large buildings still standing and the boarded up entrance to the ore mine was set back in the mountain. Were not getting in there, I whispered. Lets try that building, he said, and pointed toward the one nearby, which was the largest and at least two stories tall. We counted to three and then ran across the camp to the large wooden doors of the old building. They were cracked open and when we squeezed inside I was had no doubts that death was indeed present in Borrasca. We were standing in what I guessed was a refinery and in the middle of the room was a large silver, conically shaped machine. A conveyer belt fed into it and the room had a sour smell. Even the dirt beneath our feet seemed to have taken on a crimson tint. This is the machine. This is where they take them, I said. This is the place where people die. Kimber isnt here. Come on. I was only too happy to squeeze back out the door of the building and tiptoe around the side. We rounded a corner and almost ran into a recently waxed, shiny, green truck parked there. This is Jimmy Prescotts truck, I breathed. I know whose truck it is. Kyle growled. We were now on extraordinarily high alert. Kyle dropped to the ground and began to commando crawl around the building. I followed him waiting to hear a shout or a gunshot but none came. As we crawled around to the back of the building, Kyle turned around to me and put his finger over his lips, then pointed at a one story brown building that was only a dozen feet away from us. He got into a crouched position and moved as fast as he could across the gap between the two buildings. I did the same. As soon as I reached the wall next to him Kyle whirled around and put another finger to his lips and then pointed up to a window directly above us. There were noises coming from inside and even to me, a 16 year old virgin, the sounds of sex were unmistakable. We could hear an animalistic grunting and the tired, objecting groans of an old mattress. Unable to help myself I whispered What the fuck? to Kyle but he was already gone, all caution abandoned, running around the side of the building. I followed him in through the first door we came upon and was hit in the face by an invisible wall of filth and suffering. The smell knocked me back, but Kyle kept running. I followed him in, past crates of ramen noodles, MREs, bottled water and boxes I had no time to read. I crossed another threshold and I was suddenly surrounded by people. So many people. I skidded to a halt and realized I was standing in a sort of dorm. Rows and rows of beds on either side of me with people strapped to them, some of them wearing dirty rags and some wearing nothing at all. Many seemed to be bloated and I waited for one to call out to me but they all remained silent, some watching me through tired, dead eyes and others turning away. Looking around I realized they were all women and the bloating I saw seemed to bepregnancies. Some were confined to their beds and others were not. I looked around the room for Kyle and saw him standing a little further in the long room looking back at me with the same confused, wild expression I was sure was on my face. I saw the realization cross his and called out to him but he was already running again. I lost him before Id taken five steps to follow. I figured it was probably best to just keep running, spread out and look for Kimber. I didnt see her in this room and I was sure she would have called out to us if she was. I looked around for another door and saw one cracked open on the left behind a row of beds. I stared straight at it as I made my way there, desperate to avoid the wretched, void eyes of the women around me. First we help Kimber, then we help the others. *I will come back and help you all, I promise. As soon as I find Kimber.* Without a thought I pushed the door wide open as soon as Id reached it and found the source of the noises wed heard outside. It was Jimmy, something Id been expecting to see, but the scene before me was not. He was hunched over the bed of an almost unrecognizable, unresponsive Kristy, treating her like an animal. She watched me through the slits of her dead eyes but she didnt call to me for help. I thought I saw a tear run down her cheek before she turned her face away from me to face the wall on the other side. What the fuck? I didnt even realize the words were audible. I had never seen this depth of human suffering. Jimmys head snapped around to look at me and briefly registered surprise before he smiled at me in a way that turned my insides to ice. He didnt stop what he was doing and I wanted nothing more than to run over and push him off of Kristy but to my utter shame I couldnt force myself to come any further into the room. Sam! Sam! Kyles voice echoed through the building and immediately cured me of my paralysis. I found myself running back into the miners dorm and away from Jimmy Prescott and Kristy. Kyle! Back here, hurry, please, I fucking- I found Kimber! I followed his voice through the maze of beds and rooms as a cacophony of voices began to follow me. Help us. Please. There were maybe only a handful of girls yelling at me but it sounded thunderously loud as it filtered through my guilt. The weight of their misery dropped down upon me and it almost pushed me into the ground. I will! Ill get help, Ill help you! I promised them as I followed Kyles voice, still screaming desperately from an adjacent room. I sprinted across another threshold and saw him, hunched down near a corner bed helplessly yanking on a leather strap attached to it. I slammed into the bed and fell to my knees, trying to work out what he was doing and how I could help him. I tried not to look at the bed because I knew I couldnt see her like that, I couldnt bear it. If Kimber looked at me through the same accusing, empty eyes as Kristy and the others had I might lay down on the ground beneath her and curl up into a ball. Go around the other side! Unbuckle the other two straps! Kyle had the high pitched voice and wild, desperate eyes of madness. I ran around the other side and did as hed said with shaking, awkward hands. Oh, boys! Jimmys voice rang out from somewhere in the building. I had just freed Kimbers ankle and was working on her wrist. She whimpered when she heard him and buried her face in my shoulder. Do you think youre hiding? I know where to find you. I know right where I put that girl. Ill fucking kill you, Prescott, you sick cunt! Ill fucking stomp all your bones and bleed you out you little motherfucker! Kyle had lost all reason and strategy. He was filled with rage instead of fear and it scared me even more. I pulled Kimbers wrist from the final strap and yelled, Go now! We pulled Kimber up off the bed and quickly realized that her legs could barely support her. She was heavily sedated and breathing weakly. We braced her on either side and moved as quickly as we could through the nearest doorway  away from Jimmy. We were in another dorm, though this one was filled with mostly empty beds. I could see sunlight shining through the door at the end of the long room and we raced toward it as Kimber made little cries of pain. I didnt think my heart could break any more but I was wrong because in the next moment - it did. I almost dropped Kimber when I saw her staring at me. Her eyes were hollow and uninvested and when I turned toward her, she looked away immediately as if she couldnt stand the sight of me. Whitney. I said weakly. Sam, lets fucking go! Kyle screamed. I cant. I turned toward him as tears ran down my hot cheeks and Kyle saw her too. I cantI cant stay, Kyle said, still moving toward the door. I have to get Kimber away from here. Please But he knew I wasnt going anywhere now. Good luck, bro. I said and then we were both running in different directions. Whitneys hair was long but it was thin, as was her face. Everything on her looked brittle except for her stomach which bubbled out from her like an overblown balloon. She refused to look at me and flinched at my touch as I tried desperately to unbuckle her from the bed. I hadnt even finished the first belt when I heard Jimmy walk up behind me. I didnt bother to look at him or stop trying to free my sister. I didnt know what else to do. I admire your grit, kid. Jimmy said, and then sat down on a bed behind me and continued to watch me, giving no objection to what I was doing. You probably think your friends got away but theres no sense in false hope, is there? Theres no sense in any of this. My voice sounded frail and it cracked over the last word. Youre wrong about that, Jimmy sighed. But just so you know, Ive got Clery out there looking for them already. People making a lot of noise coming down off this mountain, trust me on that. Sheriff Clery? I was desperate to keep him talking, anything to keep him from trying to stop me. Oh, yeah. You know he was supposed to retire from the business but unlike the previous sheriff he kept a few horses in the race. Horses? Nothing made sense. Yep. Jimmy slapped the bed next to him. We call these buildings the stables, he laughed. I dropped the last buckle on the floor and looked down at Whitney. I expected her to spring up and run toward the door while I went after Prescott but all she did was rub her wrists and itch her collarbone. Then she put her arms back where theyd been, turned her head away from me and shut her eyes. I slumped down onto the bed next to her and picked up her cold hand. If she wasnt leaving here neither was I. It was over. I sent a silent prayer up to a God I didnt know and wished my friends safety. Do you want to know what this is, Sam? I shrugged. It didnt seem to matter now. Its all about the babies. I stared down at Whitney and her swollen belly but gave no indication I was listening. You wouldnt believe how much money is in the industry. I mean, my dad was a smart man. And he knew we didnt have anything of value to sell and back then the Prescotts were dirt poor, out of work miners just like everyone else in town. He first got the idea when he sold my older brother off to pay for the legal fees to fight the city. I mean, some people will pay five figures for a newborn, you know, even back then. And the organizations that buy them, well, they buy in bulk. But we still make a killing off them. And our overhead is very low. Jimmy stood up and pulled a gun out of his waistband, then threw it on a bed across the aisle. You know, try to understand, Sammy, its not just about the money. We use the stables for community services, too. Lots of people in town come to us, you know, ever since the 50s. I couldnt take it anymore. I didnt want to be here, listening to this, I didnt want to see Whitney so broken and I didnt want to wait for inevitable death. It was torture in its purest form. What are you waiting for, why dont you just kill me? This isnt a James Bond movie, I dont care about any of this shit. Jimmy laughed loudly as if it was funniest thing hed ever heard. Kill you?! Christ, kid, if I could than I already would have, but Im not allowed to kill you. Ive been trying to decide if I want to fuck your sister right in front of you though. Shes not one of mine but it might be worth it just to see your face. Just- just kill me and let her go. Fuck, Ill kill myself if you let her go. I stood up from the bed and Jimmy took two steps toward me and punched me so hard in the face that I fell back down on it. I moaned as I fought the tears and stars behind my eyes. I cant let her go, you little fuck. Shes got one of our community services babies in her. Grace says shes got another week to go, two tops. Jimmy looked down at Whitney and frowned. Shes been puttin out shit babies, though, and as soon as this ones out of her shes got a date with the Shiny Gentleman. What the fuck does that mean? I yelled at him and a loud ring suddenly filled the room. Jimmy held up a finger and pulled a phone out of his pocket. I gotta take a business call. Two minutes and we can get back to our conversation. Jimmy walked over to a corner of the room and I desperately started to pull on Whitney. We gotta go. We gotta go, Whit, we cant stay here. She kept her eyes shut and her body lax. Whitney, theyre going to kill you! My head whipped toward the door as I heard a truck skid in the dirt just outside of it. Jimmy ended his phone call and Killian Clery walked in, pushing a limping, bloody Kyle in front of him. Lose something, Prescott? Wheres the girl? Couldnt find her. Goddamn it, Clery, you fucked us. Go back out there and find that girl! Jimmy snatched his gun off the bed and shoved it into the back of his waistband. Now listen here, you little shit, Clery growled. I aint your fucking employee and I dont have all fucking day to play and hide and seek in the woods. Ill telling you she wasnt with him so I guess if you wanna know where she is you should get it outta him! Clery threw Kyle down on the floor and spit near his feet. I gotta do your fucking job now? Jimmy walked over and without any hesitation kicked Kyle so hard in the ribs I heard some of them snap inside his chest. I tried to stand up but I was still dizzy and fighting off the darkness. Wheres your girlfriend, Landy? Prescott raised his boot and then stomped down hard on Kyle ankle. He screamed in pain. I can do this all day, kid. Clery sat down on a bed across the aisle and lit a cigarette, watching impassively. Jimmy pulled Kyle to his feet and then punched him hard in face. A few of Kyles teeth scattered across the floor. Tell me, you little cunt! Jimmy punched him again in the face and Kyle went limp. Youre killing him! I screamed and jumped off the bed, running blindly toward Jimmy in a red rage. Clery stood up and caught me with no effort at all, holding my arms down at my sides. He laughed, cigarette still tucked into the corner of his mouth as I struggled helplessly against his chest. Jimmy had straddled Kyle by now and was rapidly punching him in the face and chest. Kyle was barely conscience and I prayed hed pass out from the pain. After a full minute of this Jimmy stood up and rubbed his bloodied fists. Last chance, Landy. Fuck you. Kyle said through a wheezing, rattled breath of air. Jimmy spit on him and raised his foot up as high as he could and brought it down on Kyle face with so much force that I heard his skull break. I sagged in Killian Clerys arms and he dropped me into a puddle at his feet. Jimmy bummed a cigarette off Clery and they stood next to Whitneys bed, watching me cry. Jesus, what a mess. After a few minutes Clery flicked his cigarette out and pulled out his phone. Alright, Sam, take your friend. I couldnt have heard him right. Fuck that, that little Landy shit aint leaving here. You wanna clean this mess up, Prescott? I stood up and my knees didnt buckle beneath me. Im not leaving without my sister. I told them. Jimmy laughed. Yes, you are, Clery said. If you want to save your friends life. He aint dead yet, Sam, but he will be soon. He tossed his keys at me. The road off this mountain is back by the refinery. I let the keys bounce off of me and fall to the floor. Clearly swore at me. I knew he was right. I was a coward and I would leave my sister and all the others here just so I could get away and save Kyles life. I picked up the keys and then, without looking at the two men, I picked Kyle up by his shoulders and his head rolled back as if it was no longer attached to his spine. His face was a collage of pulp and blood and I struggled to stay calm and breathe as I dragged him out of the building. Cleary and Prescott watched me, taking drags off their cigarettes and saying nothing. I knew they were probably lying to me; Kyle would be dead by the time I got down the mountain if he wasnt already. I opened the door to Clerys old Ford and placed Kyle in the front seat, wincing as his head rolled around like a ball on a string. It took me almost an hour to get down the mountain, even though I took the overgrown road at ridiculous speeds and did everything I could to destroy the shocks on the truck. I sped into the hospitals emergency zone and found a medical team waiting inside the door. It was clear that theyd gotten a call to expect me because they already had a crash cart with them and an IV ready to push into Kyles wrist. I left Clerys truck where it was and spent the next two hours in the waiting room, calling my dad over and over again and crying over an Architectural Digest magazine. No one came to take a statement from me or ask me any questions. Kyles mom arrived just before my dad did and started screaming as soon as she saw me. My dad walked in behind her and had a deputy restrain her. He drove me home in silence but I couldnt take it for long. Is anyone going to file a police report? Does anyone even fucking care what happened? Sam. He didnt turn to look at me. I am doing my best to do damage control on the situation but if Kyle dies or his parents sue, theres nothing I can do to keep you out of court. You think *I* did this? I screamed at him. Were not going to tell your mother. Alright? She has enough to worry about. Dad, its- I- Kimber- it was fucking Prescott! And Sheriff Clery! Yes, you arrived at the hospital in Killians truck. We already talked to them both. I was so frustrated and full of rage that my next words came out a jumbled, stuttering mess that ended in a helpless scream. We pulled into our driveway and my dad turned off the car and finally turned to look at me as I struggled to catch my breath. Samuel, we will never speak of this again. Do you understand? Are you fucking kidding me, Dad? Kyle might fucking die. I saw Kimber- Enough! If you want this to go away you will keep your mouth shut about it, make no statements to anyone and Ill hire the best lawyer I can afford to clean up your mess. I dont know why you beat your best friend almost to death and frankly I dont want to. You- Fuck you! I screamed at him and threw open the door to the cruiser. I ran then, away from him and the house and my broken life. He didnt come after me. Not that day or any other. Since everyone in town thought I was a violent thug no one would let me stay with them when I called around. I eventually went to a motel far outside of town and drained the last of my savings from work paying for the room. I went back to pick up my car from the trailhead, but it was gone and I hoped it was Kimber who had it and not a tow yard. I read the paper every morning for some mention of Kyles condition. I saw the Daley's birth announcement about 10 days later. They had just had a son that they named William. The whirling, twirling, Shiny Gentlemen lit up the valley with its stench and song of death that night. It was the last time I ever heard it. I stayed in Drisking long after the money had run out and I was sleeping on the concrete behind the motel. I stayed until Kyle was released from the hospital; a mute, empty-eyed, soulless vegetable. I went to see him once, while only Parker was home, and threatened him until he let me inside the house. When I had assured myself that the Kyle I knew was dead and only his empty husk remained, I left his house and hitchhiked out of town. And after I spent four drunken, drug-fueled years in Chicago, I came home one day to find a letter waiting for me. It didnt have a return address but it was postmarked California. I knew it was from her before Id even picked it up. Shed written so many of my assignments for me that I knew Kimbers handwriting better than my own. Inside it was a letter. *The* letter. I read it only once, many years ago, until I sat down to transcribe it today. *My Kimber,* *I know you arent going to understand why we did the things we did. It was all born out of love, at least it started that way. Youre everything to me and youll always be my daughter. Do you understand? And Im leaving this world because of what Ive done to you, not because of what you are. I dont want you to be upset about what you are. Because WHO you are is beautiful.* *My dearest, this town has done horrible things. And all of us who live here are guilty. Read this letter and leave this place.* *I need to tell you all of this. I need to start at the beginning:* *Somewhere along the way, decades ago, the major population of Drisking became unable to bear children. Most people blame the town for letting the iron ore leak into our water table during to collapsing of our mines.* *This is the same water table that still provides the towns water today. They were never quite able to fix it and ore is toxic and exposure causes infertility. The town did, and still does, suffer greatly from its effects.* *And the Prescotts, they solved the problem that no one could solve. It was an ugly, crass solution but most people were happy to look away when they were able to raise families again. You see they took girls, mostly women from other places, and they impregnated them and gave us their babies.* *And the town came under the care of Thomas Prescott when he started to sell some of the babies on the side for a profit to rich couples. And the Sheriff, he helped him do this. But then an ugly rumor started that they were selling to human traffickers. And the Prescotts had to offer triple the price for girls. And in town, we began to murmur. But we once again turned the other cheek when the city was suddenly flooded with money because of how well the traffickers paid. People had well-paying jobs again and were proud to call Drisking home. So we said nothing and those that did were taken to the mountain.* *Because that is where they do it. There is a place on the mountain where the women are taken, Kimber: drifters, runaways and, if their parents choose it, sometimes the girls in town are even sold back. They arrange to sell the girls and they meet them at a tree halfway between our town and their baby mill. Sometimes kids play there now. I think you played there.* *The Prescotts and the Sheriff are the ones who impregnate the girls and the children are named after them. P children for the Prescotts and K children for the sheriff. And then when the women become too sick or too old to deliver profitable babies they are sent through a giant machine that was used to refine ore and their bodies are crushed and the blood and skin stripped away and what remains of them are their stolen children and the dust of their bones. And all thats left of their bodies is the powder that they spread over the mountain to hide our crimes.* *Im telling you this, Kimber, because you are one of those children. Most of your friends are one of those children.* *Please get out of Drisking before your father finds this letter. Run away and never come back and never speak of it to anyone. Their industry has deep roots now and the traffickers have lofty connections. Dont tell anyone. Dont keep this letter. Dont look back.* *I love you. Im sorry I have to leave you. We all have to answer for our sins and Im ready to burn in hell for mine.* *Love always and forever,* *Mom* "
287,vulnerability,nosleep,An Unwelcome Visit,1,3f05yg,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3f05yg/an_unwelcome_visit/,2015-07-29 17:55:03,"Vulnerability. We all succumb to it in one way or another. There's simply no way to to guarantee that one can reap the benefits of life without incurring its potential hazards. Of those hazards, there are many. Some we may not even be aware of. I live in a two-story house facing a somewhat busy street, but covered by forest on the opposite side. The forest is not very dense, as it sort of acts like a cushion to separate our section of the neighborhood from those who live in a nearby community. It's very quiet, typically. I tend to spend my nights doing research on various topics of interest. I find myself glued to my laptop analyzing information into the first hours of every day, it seems. I conduct most of my investigation in the living room of my upper floor (really the first floor, the second floor being mostly underground). The back wall of that floor is lined with broad windows that offer a view of the forest that lies beyond our fence. The window blinds continually remain open. We keep it that way because it seems to create a connection to the outdoors, rather than limiting the floor to feeling like a boxed-in space. It provides for a relaxing feeling for those on the inside. At least during the day. I'm usually the only one in my family awake to feel the effects it creates when the sun is nowhere to be seen. Darkness consumes everything beyond a few feet of our back door (which also has a window, I should mention). The inside of our house remains somewhat well lit while I'm awake. I can't help but think how easy it would be for someone to simply sit outside on one of our chairs on the back deck and view my nightly doings, cloaked in darkness. That thought never really forced me to change my nighttime habits, though. It was a bit of vulnerability I was willing to risk. *was* Something happened two nights ago that Im still trying to make sense of. Here I will try to pass on what I saw, heard, and felt that night. You can take the picture I painted of myself earlier and start from there. I sit in my reclining chair reading an article about Alexander II of Russia. You might remember him from your World History course as the emancipator of the serfs. I have a few lights on in the room. The darkness visible through my back wall windows is there, as usual, although earlier that night that it seemed a bit, I dont know, more dense than usual. The digital clock on the book shelf in the dark, neglected far corner of the room shot red-colored digits seemingly right at me to signify it was 1:25 in the morning. That was the last time I remember checking the clock before it happened. On occasion, an attic varmint will scurry around above me and cause me to jump or at least tense up. Its a nuisance, so I typically listen to music while viewing online content. That night was no exception. Rock music at a decent volume usually worked (I guess), so I opted for music from one of the many musicians of that genre in my iTunes library. *Man, Milyutin really gets no recognition in the history books. He must be the Stevens to Alexanders Lincoln.* Static. Just a flash, but enough for me to notice and raise concern. *My laptop doesnt ever display static. It was just a second, but I should troubleshoot this.* Now the TV. *What is going on* As if following the previous act, I hear a sound, much like the one you hear when you are at an airport and a plane lands on a strip near your gate. It was like that, but at a slower pace. The music in my ears had ceased just after the static overcame my laptop screen a second time. As the plane-landing sound grew, the lights in my house flickered. The sound of power loss shot through the room. The only light within the room is coming from my laptops static-ridden screen. Then, a glow. The darkness surrounding my house slowly transferred to a greenish tint, its brightness corresponding with the growing noise of something seemingly coming toward my house. The sound was now overwhelming, and the green glow completely overtook the view of my backyard. It was now as deep as the darkness that normally occupied the space behind my house at night. *THIS DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE! WHAT IS HAPPENING?* Then, a cease in the noise. A full stop. No gradual drawdown to a lower decibel. It was as if a mute button had been triggered. *Ok, now please, everything go back to normal!* The green glow did not waver, though. It seemed neon at this point. THUD *no no no no no no* THUD ** Two loud noises, what sounded like two sides of my house being hit with baseball bats, followed each other. At this point, I was on the ground, trembling. Then, perhaps the eeriest noise: *scratch* I dared not look at the window on my back door that the sound had originated from. It must have been something, or a series of things, very sharp things, running down the length of the window. THUD *MAKE IT STOP! GO AWAY! LEAVE ME ALO* 2:47 a.m I open my eyes to see myself in the darkened living room, dazed and unable to think clearly. No, that cant be the time. I woke up lying on my back behind the reclining chair. I didnt go to sleep here, or in this position. *I didnt go to sleep at all* Everything else seemed normal, although no lights were on. *My laptop* It was lying on the ground, closed. I open it. It seems to be functioning normally. No static. No hint of anything irregular. As I stand up, I feel incredibly sore. *This doesnt add up.* In addition, it feels like a gang of mosquitos decided to bombard me while I slept, or whatever it was I did for over an hour. They seemed to all focus on the lower left side of my abdomen. *Very odd, especially indoors* Im overcome with a hazy, disoriented feeling and direct my stumbling self onto a nearby couch to break my fall. *11:18* Sunlight. I wake up in a much better condition. Im ready to dismiss everything that happened as some bizarre dream. It had to be, as it was completely nonsensical. Why couldnt I have turned into something like a pink garden gnome in the dream? That would have made it a bit more easy to let go. *Stretch* As I stand up, my blurry vision becomes corrected and I make out the design of my living room. *Back to normal* I slowly approach the back wall, scanning cautiously the forest behind my house. Everything seems as it should. What a dream. I move down the series of windows, walking past each one to get a different point-of-view of the nature just beyond my property. In that moment, it was beautiful, like something I had never taken the time to appreciate before. Something so simple and common, yet so meaningful. It would probably look better on the other side of this barrier. *claw marks* There were several *heavy* indents on the doors window. They had to have been claw marks. But I cant think of any animal that had a similar mark. They were unique in that two of the three marks seemed to come from the same paw, or whatever it was, while the third mark seemed to come from a different source. My parents had no idea what I was talking about when I relayed the story to them later that day. So they wouldnt question my grip on reality, I ended our conversation by shrugging it off as probably just being a dream of the worst kind. I contacted neighbors, but they didnt witness anything that I saw, not even the green glow. I took pictures of the marks on the windows and sent them around to various wildlife agencies, with those that cared to respond having no knowledge of any animal that would produce such engravings. I havent gotten much sleep since then. I find myself typing this story with frequent errors as I try to piece everything together and reconcile what happened. I want to deny it, but too many reminders of the event persist. I should stop it here, I think. This is my story, readers. I hope it wont be yours. "
288,vulnerability,nosleep,One named Car,1,3bbwa5,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3bbwa5/one_named_car/,2015-06-28 05:13:16,"Since I can remember, Car has been with me. When I was very, very young, Car started speaking to me. He has green skin and triangular eyes, akin to Kamina from TTGL's glasses. He has hair like Android 16 from Dragon Ball Z. When he first appeared to me, I thought he was a monster, but I was a weird kid and thought he was a ""good monster."" I asked him what his name was, and in a condescending voice, 30 or so, he told me that he was wondering too. He asked me to name him. I didn't know what to say, so I said Car. He laughed and agreed. Car followed me around, everywhere I went. It was rare that he wasn't there, watching. It's because of him that I'm who I am. If there's one way I could describe him, it would be nonchalant. His calm, but confident voice. His advice to me, it never failed. Car was truly my friend, and he was there. His sense of humor was dry, deadpan, almost offensive at times. At times he was a burden, like when he kept laughing as I had sex with my first girlfriend. Or when he caused me to fail an important test. But I knew he cared about me, and I knew he wanted the best for me. Car never aged, and never changed. He saw me grow up, but he never changed or matured. He already seemed to know everything about the world, but he always seemed so...detached. He could always sooth me, and remind me to try my best. My middle school recital in 7th grade was one of my most fond memories. I looked in the seats for my parents. They were there. But Car wasn't. I looked around for a while, in till air heard ""Hey, fuckface!"" I looked behind me, and there was Car, in an absent girls seat, holding a tuba and smiling. I don't think I've ever seen him sad or hurt. I was always the one with the weakness. The vulnerability. He was always the one who solved the problems, not experienced them. He never really got mad at me, but he always wanted me to do the right thing, and I remember when I started going to Sunday school at age 6 I asked if Car was the Devil. He replied, ""The Devil is evil. I do the right thing."" I remember stealing a girl's lunch and teasing her with it in kindergarten. Car instantly appeared and told me to give it back. I did, and he waved before spoofing away. I nevr told anyone, because I thought they would think I was crazy. When he first met me, he told me to tell no one about him. I've kept this secret for my whole life, but it doesn't matter anymore, because he's gone. I don't know what to do. How to get him back. I don't even know what he is! What he was. But I don't care. I want him back. I want my best friend back. I cry so much thinking about him and I cry thinking about how much I've cried. Because it's pathetic how much I needed him. How pitiful I am without him. These dreams, they've been plaguing me ever since he left. Each one with the same image. Car standing there, looking up. He seems uncomfortable, almost scared. Car disappeared on Father's Day, ironically enough. He was like my father, and my older brother, and now my roommate. He taught me so much, and it pains me to say that I love him more than my parents. The days leading up to his leaving were awkward and quiet. He seemed distant and restrained. I believe he knew. I want to save him. I NEED to save him. Because without him, I am, for lack of better words, an epic fail. Any questions will be answered in the comments. I am currently 31 as of March."

I pulled up a stool and sat next to her. The woman who'd greet everyone, even a stranger with a smile and a hug just continued to stare at her drink as she put her hand on top of mine. And then she began to speak. I once knew this man, he was (she pauses and allows a rouge strand of hair to fall in her face) dynamic (she reaches up and puts it back in its place). Beautiful. Like the brilliantly dramatic sky that catches your attention, freezes you in place, just before the violent storm. And even after, you stand in its wake remembering the sunset that precipitated it all. He was just as damaged as everything that would be left in his wake; more damaged actually. You know how a cornered dog may bite? And then is beaten for doing so, ensuring that any ounce of trust she may have had is ruined and the next time she bites again? Is it the dogs fault for reacting instinctively? Or does the responsibility lie on who cornered her and failed to respect her animalistic instincts? This man, he plays the role of both the dog and the cornerie. He bites and then whimpers and shakes when he in turn corners and is finally bitten back. Only, just like our dog in question, he too is acting out from a well ingrained protective instinctso, really, no one is to blame here except for a collective lack of respect for our collective animal instincts. (She chews on the end of her straw, mulling over some distant memory, and when she looks up to speak her eyes fall short of me) His words could hold me so tight, but his arms never quite covered the distance. He would reach and a scar would stretch tight and he would retreat. In the cold of the night, with him breathing by my side I would conjure up those lovely words to bring me the comfort that is touch could not. But, words too can fall short. And I began to question my sanity in the blur of his tragic beauty. I am a rock, but even the most weathered boulder will give way to gravity, and the rockslide that ensued was devastating. At the bottom of it all it was impossible to tell which pebbles came from which rock, his or mine? They were mixed together at the base of the impressive mountain we once stood upon. I saw this. I would argue there was strength to be seen in that devastating scene. But he was so focused on his next bite, corned by and overrun by those well exercised animal instincts. Love isnt rational, neither is war, and when you get down to the core of it, trust isnt any more rational then the things mentioned before. He struggled with all three. Only problem was he failed to see that so does everyone. A collective vulnerability. Its what makes us human, no? Its something to bond over, no? I mean, he had battled more than most, but not the most. And in the end, it was his blindly focused self-preservation that did him in. All he knows is that I failed, but I know that I tried. His beauty, I simply couldnt deny, his potential was a stinging slap in the face every time he caved to the stretch of those old scars. (She brings her eyes up to mine). Holly hell, I could have loved that man. And thats the burden I will carry, just as he has his own. The brief flash of what it was to love a man I can never truly love. To know the passion and pain that comes with loving a man who would die for me, but knowing that he would ensure he brought me with him if he did. To love a man who loves me just as fiercely, but (she bites her lip as it quivers) no more then he loves his animalistic instincts."

Every day I would do the same things: wake up, go to school, return, repeat. It was a fairly regular routine, save for the minor variations. Some days people would talk to me, yet somehow, they never stuck. Oftentimes I found myself alone, but then again, theres nothing wrong with that. It was much easier, but I didnt mind it either way. I think it had something to do with the way I talked. It seemed to put people off. It confused them. It scared them. People were always scared of things they dont understand. One observant, acute little girl seemed to be all they needed to feel unsettled. Humans can be such ignorant creatures. But then he came and I was no longer by myself. It was simple, starting with such an innocent question: Will you play with me? He became my silent companion. Always watching. Always staying. My moonlight, even during the day. So serene and peaceful, I didnt need to be with him to know that he was there for me. It was an odd relationship. I talked to him. Asked him questions as I told him my thoughts, my opinions, my observations, my life - he never answered. He, being a few inches shorter than I, would just stare back at me. His short black hair, overgrown and scruffy, would fall into his eyes. He had big eyes, evergreen like the trees in a forest in which I wanted to get lost. They were almost too big for such a petite face. He had a tiny little mouth to match too, never opening after that first question. I wanted to hear his voice. Hear the innocence and the sorrow. Hear the happiness. I wanted to hear *anything*, so long as I got to hear him. His eyes were always inquiring, but his mouth never asked. It never gave his comments, his feelings, his thoughts, his opinions. It seemed to be this cruel game, that he never graced me with that sweet little voice. *** When I would get home, it was routine for everyone to avoid me. They would just stare at me, scrutinizing my every feature. They would look at my forehead, my rosy cheeks and my long neck. They would follow my brown hair with its golden ends down to my waist. They would take in my small form. But they would never look me in the eyes. They never chose to see me past my clothes. To me, it seemed as if they avoided looking at the storm. My grey eyes reflected oddly. I knew that. They waged wars. They seemed to hold so many facets people would get lost in them and never come back. So I remained alone. They never spoke to me. In return, I never spoke to them. They were strangers in the same house, and I, just one flatmate. It was fine, to be alone in my room. There was a peace in the stars and the moon that would look at me every night. They would sing to me. Not in so many words, but they spoke to me, in the way the light graced my arms. The way the paleness kissed my skin into porcelain perfection. But even then, there would come a time where the curtains would close and the darkness would rip their serene melodies away from me. It was always quiet. It was deafening. The quiet. The quiet. The quiet. The quiet. The quiet. I began to wonder: just how many times can you hear a word enough to make it lose meaning? Now how many times could you experience it enough to make you lose sanity. But I was calm. I did not lose my sanity. If the quiet taught me one thing, sanity was all a matter of perspective, and I was on just one side of the dice. I had my way of keeping grounded. Of accepting the quiet. All that mattered is my little friend. He may have been silent, but he was my solace, and all I wanted was to hear his voice. Nothing unreasonable. So, I finally decided. I would play his game. *** One night, I said my goodbyes to the moon. Spoke farewells to my stars. That night I would not return home. I wanted to speak to my friend. I wanted to play to his melody. So, I left, as silently as the moon had taught me to. My friend was a kind one. I could always see him walk to his house, not too far from mine. And as he would walk away I would stare until he was out of view. Sometimes, I would follow. And that is how I came to know his house. And that is how I found my way to his home, right then. I crept in, quiet as a mouse. Walked up the stairs, and searched for his room. All was black. All was silent. And then I found his sweet little face, eyes closed in his bed. Tonight, the quiet would be broken and I would finally coax his sweet voice out. I wanted to hear it so badly. And so I touched his throat. Stroked it. Caressed it. He made no sounds. And so I narrowed my grip. Affectionately held it, with enough strength to acknowledge and show my participation in his game. Slowly, his face turned blue and the whites of his sleepy green eyes met my grey. I tightened my hand, then loosened it as his fingers scratched at mine. He finally opened his mouth and made a noise. And it started off pleasantly. He screamed; the soft, raspy notes clearing out of his throat. Almost as if they had not enough air to make them work. And as he continued, I noticed how it became sharper. Piercing. I did not like that sound any longer. So, I took the white blanket. Caught his pointed melody in the peace of the blanket as I made him kiss it. In his mouth it lay, slowly becoming wet. He grabbed at it, but I took his small hands in one of mine. I showed him my support in hearing the melancholy of his voice. He neednt be scared, so long as he didnt kill the pretty tune it conveyed. I pushed the blanket further in, fascinated by how the sound changed and muted. There was such beauty in the way the water lay its trail down his cheeks and the way his eyes connected with mine. Such vulnerability. He was finally communicating with me. I took his role in the game, remaining silent. Always watching. Always staying. As the white turned to red, and the myriad of colours mixed in the black of the night and the white of moonlight peeking through, I found my peace. I finally found the beauty in the silence. I found the beauty in the game. *** Whats going on? Shes been moving! After so long?! Whats more, shes actually speaking! The father looked at the man in the white labcoat, as they rushed down to the room in question. It was not a particularly exciting room. All white. One bed. And one little girl, dressed in a white long dress with brown and gold hair. Her skin pale, her eyes covered by the blindfold. Her hands tied by the white wrap. Oh my baby. My poor little baby, mumbled a mother as she cried freely for the daughter she could not see for years. Ten years! Ever since that day! Finally shes moving. What is she saying? The man rocked back and forth, wringing his hands until he could no longer. Not waiting one more moment, the father rushed into the room, taking into his arms the child he had not accepted in so long. The childlike, skinny figure of the 16 year old fit into his arms easily. What is it my child? What is it that you have waited so long to say? What could you not tell us before? She smirked, the simple smile replacing its vindictive partner soon enough to be thought of as nothing but a trick of light. She lifted her head and even with the blindfold, he knew she was staring into his eyes. Finally, she spoke the words: Will you play with me? "
291,vulnerability,nosleep,Part 3 - Her green eyes........,1849,33l41r,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/33l41r/part_3_her_green_eyes/,2015-04-23 22:10:49,"If you have not read [Part 1](URL and [Part 2](URL please do so before proceeding. For those of you who have been waiting, I apologize. The last couple of days have been a little crazy to say the least. Read on and youll see what I mean. When my wife woke up, we had a long discussion on what our next step should be. While we were talking, I casually glanced at her wrist and noticed the burn mark was still there. She saw me looking, and her usual radiant green eyes became dull It is me..I wish I could tell you to not be afraid of mebut I dont trust myself anymore. Tears started running down her face as I gave her a hug and comforted her, without responding. She was right, I was starting to doubt the one person I trusted to protect me in any situation. Though I took some solace in the fact that she was still the one who saved me twice from the twisted entity. Besides doubting ourselves, we did come up with a few theories that seemed to make sense in light of recent events. First, it seems that the entity is unable to appear in my wifes presence, proven by the fact that the moment she passed out, I was able to see it. Second, the entity is either evolving since it was able to speak and move out of the house, or there might be multiple entities as some of you suggested. Third, technology could potentially be a weakness for this thing as the phone call has saved me twice now. Finally, there is something very wrong with that house and the entity definitely doesnt want us there. The house is something that has to be explored. But its too dangerous to just go back without any further knowledge. So we decided to talk to the only other person in Natalies life who had experienced the overlap, her high school friend Chris. After making some phone calls, we found out that Chris lived in a nearby town and had become a support group speaker for the visually impaired. It turned out he was actually speaking at 11:00 am, and we still had enough time to be able to make it. We got to the small community hall just in time as they closed the doors. Most of Chriss speech was very uplifting and full of emotion, talking about all that he had achieved in life. He ended his speech by saying The day that I lost my vision, was the day that I truly stopped living in fear! We stuck around after and when the hall had emptied, approached Chris, who was standing next to his wife, whom he had introduced earlier during his speech. I didnt know how to even begin to ask him about his vision loss, but before I could say anything, he pointed to me Ah, so the overlap happened? She said you would come. He then went on to tell us that ever since the incident, Natalies great grandmother had been in close touch with Chris. She felt very guilty about what happened, and was determined to find as much as she could. She also insisted that it was only a matter of time before the overlap happened again around Natalie and she wanted to find a way to stop it. When we told Chris about the condition of the house and about the symbols that I saw, he became very serious. Then she tried to do it, she tried to bind what holds the sisters together to her house. Im afraid she may not have survived that. he said quietly. I was really confused at this point. Did you just say sisters? I asked. Chris then told us to follow him home as there was a lot we needed to discuss. While Chriss wife cooked us lunch, he told us about the day he lost his vision. So I never told this to anyone except your great grandmother, but that day that I lost my vision, before I passed out, Im pretty certain I saw a second entity behind the one that I was staring at in disbelief. And as I drifted into unconsciousness, I heard a whisper: feed. He went on to explain that Natalies great grandmother called the entity sisters since she was certain there was more than one of them. Additionally, she believed that they feed off of our fears, and not just fear, but the greater the fear, the more attracted the entity becomes. This made sense, seeing as Ive been afraid most of my life, and now I am at the peak of my fear since the one that I saw as my protector has become the subject of my fear. After years of research into ancient lore, demonology, mythology and family history, Natalies great grandmother found a way to pin the sisters. That has to be why there were strange symbols in the house and why the sisters didnt want us going near the house, she must have found a way to bind them there. However, seeing as the entity still appeared and drove with me in the car, that means they are still able to move freely, but they might have a vulnerability in that house. All of this was progress, yet the thought of not knowing how to deal with these sisters was quite troubling. Lunch is ready! called out Chriss wife as we made our way to the kitchen to enjoy a much needed meal. Chris wanted to end this as much as we did, so he insisted that we spend the night with him for our safety. Considering I had not gotten any sleep lately, I welcomed the idea. We all stayed in the living room, and Chriss wife and I took shifts staying up to make sure nothing happened. I woke up at 3:00 am, feeling thirsty yet again. I laughed at myself as I thought maybe I have a medical condition of waking up thirsty in the middle of the night. I looked over at Chriss wife since it was her shift to be on watch. Sure enough, she was awake and looking over at me with a gentle smile. I whispered water? as she pointed to the kitchen. I walked over, half in fear of seeing the entity again. The kitchen was thankfully empty, as I went to look for water in the fridge. Darn, no cold water in the fridge. I figured they might have some bottled water in the pantry. When I opened the pantry, I saw that it was very spacious and dark. I went to turn on the light and saw something very unexpected and horrific. In the corner lay Chriss wife, tied up, seemingly unconscious. THEN IT ALL HIT ME! Lunch is ready!. Those were the only words spoken by Chriss wife that day. I was so caught up in figuring out what was chasing us that I missed that fact completely. I rushed back to the living room to find my wife missing and Chris sound asleep. What ensued after is beyond bizarre. I woke up Chris and called the cops immediately. I knew they must have taken her to the house. I didn't have time to tell them my wife was missing so I rushed out the door and headed for the house. Yes, I know this was very stupid, but we do stupid things when our loved ones are in danger. Thats just human nature. During the drive I kept asking myself, how did I miss that? Why is the entity evolving so fast? It took another form? Is it because I was not supposed to survive an overlap? Much less twice? Is it hunting me down? But why take my wife? Im the one they want. I finally reached the house. It was now 6:00 am in the morning. Before I could step outside my car, my phone rang. It was Natalie. HELLO!! HONEY ARE YOU OKAY!!! WHERE ARE YOU??? I yelled as I picked up. Im.Im so confused...I thought we slept at Chriss house? Im home. Im home...please just come back. Now I was really confused. Is that still my wife on the phone? Honey, your wrist before I could finish she replied yes there is a burn mark on my wrist. So I decided to drive back. As I started reversing, I saw it. Standing in the window of that decrepit house, sipping water from a glass. Smiling at me, with eyes shining greener than usual. I left for home, frustrated and not understanding any of what was going on. On my drive back I wondered, it knew I was going to go back to the house to look for my wife. It wanted me to see. But why? When I got home, Natalie came running and gave me a hug. I felt cold hearted for doing this but I immediately pulled out her wrist to find the burn mark on it. She looked up at me in disappointment It is me... As I finally looked into her eyes, my heart stopped. Her eyes...they were dark black. The iris of her eye was no longer the beautiful green that I had come to find comfort in. They were a deep black. Natalie has been crying a lot ever since she looked in the mirror and I am still processing all of what just happened. Its been a complete day since her eyes changed color and there have been no more sightings of the entity. Life is seemingly normal, not perfect anymore but normal. Natalie is still herself, but seems to be a lot more of a serious person now. I spoke with Chris on the phone and he told me that him and his wife are doing okay and have not seen the entity since. At this point, I am writing this update and Im not sure if I should go back to the house and investigate. I cant help but think it wanted me to see its eyes that day at the house. It wanted me to know what it took from me. I dont even know if destroying the sisters will bring back Natalies beautiful green eyes. With that said, I am keeping a close eye on her.

I'm telling you guys, don't fuck with this stuff, cause it'll fuck you right back. Anyway, hi nosleep. This is first post on here, but I felt like I had to share my experience. For those who don't know, a sensory deprivation tank is basically a dark metal box with a few inches of water in it. It's meant to completely deprive you of all your senses, hence the name. People have said all this crazy shit about what happened to them in the tanks. One guy said he heard his dead mom's voice. Someone else said he saw weird, geometrically impossible shapes. Hell, someone even said they were transported to a different galaxy. You know, weird stuff. Of course I didn't believe any of this (I'm a skeptical person), and thought it would be more of a relaxing experience than a religious or spiritual one when my friend called me up asking if I wanted to come to one of the only tanks in the state that wasn't in a lab or whatever. Me, seeing nothing on my hypothetical calendar, said ""sure"". I met my friend (let's call him John) at his place at about 1. We headed out into the suburbs to this guys house. We pulled into the short, clean driveway and met the guy at the door. After talking for a while about how it worked and why the hell he even owned one, it was time. John went first. He stepped into the pitch black tank, and the door closed. I went out onto the patio, where my host handed me a drink, and we talked for about an hour. Then, a timer rang in the kitchen and we went into the basement where the tank was. The door opened and out stepped John, a confused look on his face. He rubbed his eyes, and as a towel was draped over his dripping body, a grin formed on his face. ""Duuude"" was all that came out of his mouth for a long while. I stepped into the dark box, and the door closed. I got situated, and then just listened. I heard the dripping of the water, every miniscule drop reverberating off the walls of the chamber. It felt like I really was floating. The water level is just enough that you can't feel the steel bottom below you. It was relaxing floating there. But only for a while. An overwhelming sense of vulnerability swept over me. I felt as though i was in an ocean. An ocean with no bottom. An ocean with any number of creatures ready to swallow me whole. Now, before I tell you this next part, I want you to know that I don't have many fears, but the fear of the ocean is one. It isn't so much the ocean, more the horrifying vastness of it. It's not because I had a traumatic experience as a child or anything, it just creeps me out. But it pulls me in. I'm intrigued and terrified by the ocean's possibilities. I felt a strange vibration, like something moving under the floor, and I began to bob rhythmically up and down,up and down. My nervousness quickly escalated to fear. I had to feel the walls. I had to know I was still in the tank. I didnt want to be transported to some other galaxy, I wanted to stay right here. I reached out with my hand to touch the side of the tank. It was about the time I fully extended my arm that I realized I wasn't going to touch anything. There was nothing there. The wall was fucking gone. I opened my eyes. It took me a minute to adjust to the darkness, and when I did I was greeted with a starry, moonless sky. I shot bolt upright, realizing my mistake much too late. The pain never came. The ceiling was gone. I bobbed in the black waves for a moment, taking in my surroundings. I was in an ocean. But not your normal ocean. Something about it was...off. It felt empty, dead, ancient. I wasn't supposed to be here. I felt movement once more under me. I looked down and saw the faintest movement. Imagine a silent shadow in a pitch black room.Whatever that thing was, it was damn near invisible. That was the last I ""saw"" of whatever it was. I treaded water for what felt like hours, too terrified to move. If this is John's idea of relaxation, I'd hate to see his idea of fun. As anyone who has been in water knows, treading water gets tiring after a few hours. I was fighting just to keep my head above the waves, but I sunk deeper with every bob. After a few more minutes, my body shot down. It locked up and wouldn't let me move. I saw the surface going farther and farther as I sank beneath it. When I had almost lost sight of it, everything went black, blacker than it already was, and I experienced a rush of gravity. I was standing outside the tank, dripping, and buck naked. I ran to the basement bathroom and looked in the mirror. My eyes were red and my hair was caked with salt. I grabbed a towel and stumbled up the stairs, eager to get the fuck outta the basement. I went to the patio to John talking to the owner. ""What the hell? Why didn't you get me out of there!"" ""dude, what are you talking about? You just got in there a few minutes ago."" I ran into the kitchen. The timer, which was set for an hour, was still ticking. Three minutes had passed. You want to know the scariest part? There was nothing in that whole ocea. Nothing. I felt it, i knew it. That's the scariest part. Being alone in so endless a place. I can't sleep anymore. "

Scattered, nomadic, with several hundred tribes and several hundred languages, it was no surprise that things were lost in translation. And yet, the bunyip appears in Indigenous Australian mythologies all over the continent. Notably, one thing remains consistent: Do not wade in the billabongs, the waterholes, the creeks, and the rivers at night. That is where the bunyip waits. For thousands of years, Australian parents  from prehistoric Aboriginal to 21st century Euromutts  have been retelling the tale of the bunyip to scare children away from playing in water alone. That was what my father thought when he told me. *** Dads version of the bunyip was another warped take on an Australian marsupial; he spoke of a reanimated kangaroo corpse, slimy with algae and matted black fur, and in possession of a pair of hook-like fangs. This particular bunyip lived in the dam near the [donger](URL at the mines, which is why I wasnt allowed to go anywhere bloody fucking near the dam at night. Dad was an opal miner. He and mum divorced when I was a spry six-months-old, and Id spent every summer break languishing in the red dustscapes of Quilpie, an isolated Queensland mining town with a roaring population of 400. An hour out from that, Dad operated a small open-cut mine. We would always spend a week or two at the mine. My days there consisted of poking through the red earth in hopes of finding a giant chunk of boulder opal, feeding a backpack full of batteries into my Gameboy, or scouting for wild dog bait (left out by jackaroos in an attempt to cull the wild dog population, but also effective at culling my dads pet dog population). Not many people worked at the mine; my Dad, a handful of his mates, and the occasional backpacker who wandered through. The summer of 1998 was the last summer I spent at Dads mine. I was 11-years-old. Like every year before it, 1998s summer was brutal, unforgiving, and demanding. It beat you to the ground with nausea and glare, swallowed you whole, and drowned you in a heavy, wet broil. I was sitting in the shade of a car, watching the excavator tear up helpings of red earth. Rhys, the son of one of my dads mates working at the mine, was fucking around on my copy of Pokmon Blue. Rhys listened to The Smashing Pumpkins, had a girlfriend called Jennifer, and wore a pair of black Nike Dunks: he was cool. It was crucial he found me tolerable. I was straining to not acknowledge Rhyss defeat at the hands of a Lvl. 26 Geodude, so I didnt notice when the excavators engine abruptly cut out mid-dig. I did notice, however, when Dad let loose a sharp Fuck! that rang across the shallow mine. The reason for the halt in operations was immediately clear. Tangled ignobly in the teeth of the excavator bucket were bones; yellowed, brittle, but almost inarguably human. Dad scooped up a piece of the crushed skull. Its another bloody one, he said, holding the fragment up to the light. Whoa, said Rhys. Is that a person? Yep. Dad spat at the ground, and then waved at the excavator driver. Wanna play gravedigger, Mike? Do we call the police? I asked. The bones, splintered in the bucket and the freshly exposed earth, hit me with a rush of guilty excitement. I was already thinking of flashing sirens, grim-faced CSI agents, and the surge of primary school fame Id get from being traumatised 11-year-old Lachlan Wallace in the national news. Nope. Why not? I asked, indignantly. They might have been murdered. Yeah, maybe, Mike said, clambering ungracefully down the excavator chassis. But wed be about two thousand years late. These are Aboriginal bones, Lach, Dad said, lightly tossing the skull fragment back into the dirt. Not even the first ones weve found. Do we call an architect, then? Dad laughed. An archaeologist, Lach? He shook his head. No. We dont tell anyone. Is that allowed? Rhys asked, surprised. Mike shrugged. If we tell the council, this mine can become culturally significant, he said, putting on a voice. They send some mob out here to poke at the dirt for a few months, decide, yeah, okay, this ground is sacred, your Dad loses the lease, and were shit out of luck. Well rebury him out yonder, Dad said, pointing out a little past the dongers. With his mate. And dont fucking mention this to Gaz or his lot. I felt uneasy. The situation struck me as mercenary and underhanded; still, I admired my father, and it was difficult for a child to doubt his parents actions. Rhys and I watched as Dad, Mike, and a couple of others loaded the bones on some blue tarp for transportation. How do you think he died? I wondered. Is this like, an Aboriginal graveyard, maybe? Like in that Simpsons episode, where their house is on Indian burial ground? Rhys said, excitedly. Maybe this place is haunted. Thatd be cool, I agreed. The excavator growled back to life. Dad and two other guys, Johnno and Wayne, slowly shuffled the tarp-stretcher backwards, careful not to drop any bones. *** I liked sitting in the mine at night. I would prop myself up in the clay-caked bucket of the excavator, inhaling the heady tones of freshly turned soil. From my concealed perch, I could stare up at the night sky and watch the satellites lazily drift above the earth. Id long ago given up on wishing upon shooting stars; the sky was so brilliant and busy, so clear from the smog and light pollution of my Sydney home, that shooting stars were as remarkable as the endless flies. I liked listening to the sounds of the mine and the scrub surrounding it. The mine was so alone, and so outwardly devoid of life, that any noise in the dead of night would send a thrill of fear through my body. In the bucket, I was safe; the soft scattering of earth falling from a heaped mound, or the inexplicable crackle of a twig, reinforced the necessity of my shelter. Over the distant desperate churning of the fan in Dads donger, I swear I could even hear the mine. It was so open, so mammoth, that even its silence struck me as deafening. I imagined I could hear a ceaseless, baritone yawn echoing within its shallow depths. It was in this state of hypnotic awareness that I heard the dam stir. I paused. The dam and the sky were the only two entities that usually guaranteed true silence. It didnt get windy, so the dam didnt lap; its surface was usually smooth as glass, an undisturbed russet pane. I peered over the buckets teeth; small, concentric ripples played out on the dams surface. It didnt have any fish. Nothing lived in there. I slid out of the bucket and, again, hesitated. The mine represented a midway point between the dam and the camp. Walking towards the dam took me much further away from Dad, the rest of the crew, and the florescent lighting. Still. There was a creek not too far away. Maybe something had come from there? Something cool. Like a platypus? Or a *crocodile*? I slowly moved toward the dam. Its surface was calm again. I noticed a fresh track of moistness in the earth at the dams lip; as though something wet had been dragged out, or dragged itself out. It trailed out three or four feet before the dirt dried out. I took another halting step toward the dam, when I heard the loud snap of a nearby branch. The loud trill of vulnerability possessed me, and I bolted back to the camp. *** Whos on dig duty? Dad asked brightly, rolling his morning smoke. Mike still, Johnno replied. I just had four days in a row and he chucked a fuckin fit. Mikes fucked off, Dad said. So if everyone else is too busy being chivalrous and holding hands, Ill gladly take it. Why would Mike take off? Johnno furrowed his brow. His utes still here. The excavator had air conditioning. It was a coveted position, and one you stuck around for if it was your shift. Waynes gone back for more gas, so he would have hitched back with him, Dad supplied. Probably wanted to annoy Rhonda for a quick shag. I wandered over to the deposit trash. Dad always let me sort through the leftover rocks in the hope of finding a piece of overlooked opal; he had promised to let me keep anything I found (a promise that was made, I imagine, under the assumption that I wouldnt find anything). Rhys was already there, emptying rock fragments out of his Nikes. Youre up early, I noted. Rhys usually didnt join us until midday, which was another of his faithfully teenaged habits I occasionally tried to emulate. Rhys shrugged. The fans on the fritz in our donger. It sounds like a fucking chainsaw. I gave up on sleeping hours ago. Not wanting to seem too eager (that being immature), I grabbed a stick and idly overturned pieces of rubbish rock. Your Dads on the excavator today, huh? Mm, I said. I wish hed let me on it. I thought Mike was digging? Nah, he went back to town with your Dad, I said. Probably wanted to annoy Rhonda for a quick shag. Rhys wrinkled his nose. Gross. Pause. But I saw Dad leave this morning - the last thing he did was check in that I was sure I didnt wanna come with. Mike wasnt there. Maybe he picked Mike up down the road? Yeah, maybe. I frowned. In any other circumstance, an adult man ditching work was barely worth the energy it took to raise an eyebrow. The outback, though, was lipped with the promise of death at any misstep; the mundane became immediately dangerous. A flat tire. Sticking your feet in your boots without checking first. Losing your bearings when you duck out for a piss (rest in peace, Larry). He also could have taken one of the bikes, Rhys suggested. There was a small collection of decrepit motorbikes scattered around the mine for general use; everyone liked riding them. I guess, I said, cheering up. That was almost definitely it. *** I sucked in a mouthful of night-time air, anticipating the full, round taste of the mine. Instead, I recoiled. Rot. The sweet, cloying, immediately recognisable scent of decay. I leapt down from the bucket; looked under it. A dead lizard, maybe? Discarded dog food? Nothing was there. I followed the scent, sniffing like a curious bloodhound. I was 11-years-old, and dead things were cool. You could poke them with sticks. Sometimes theyd explode. The scent grew stronger towards the westward section of the camp. I picked my way through the equipment, chairs, and scrap metal framing the corrugated dongers. I heard the familiar deep hum of the overworked fans; the clinking sounds of cutlery singing faintly from behind the tin walls. As I cautiously shuffled past the remnants of a burnt out charcoal grill, I noticed the florescent light buzzing out of Mikes donger. I hadnt seen him come back. Curious as to why he didnt join the rest of the crew at dinner, I headed towards his cabin; still, it was hard to ignore that smell. Mikes door was nearly wide open. Standing at the bottom of his stairs, I could see him sitting on his bed. Hey Mike, I said. Mike turned slightly to face me. It was difficult to see under the white-hued light, but he seemed tired? Like his whole face was tired. Drooping slightly. I was faintly reminded of my Grandpa after his stroke. You missed out on digger duty today, I said. He leaned forward, angling his head to see me better. As he did, I saw him better, too. He was  stretched, almost. Like something was grabbing his skin, and stretching it down  far further than normal skin elasticity would allow  hanging from his jowls, his forearms, even his hands. I could see the fleshy red part of his eyes. The part you only see when you pull a face, pull your eyelids down. His lips were stretched, down to his jaw, revealing an impossible amount of bloody gum. I  I took a step back. Mike started working his mouth; opening it. Closing it. Slowly. Mike, are you o...? Mike stood up, wobbling. Took a hesitating step to the door. Opening and closing his mouth faster, like a goldfish, open, close, open, close, silently, and then, rasping something  breath pouring out of him, a long, unending exhale  All conscious thought had left my mind. My legs carried me. As I single-mindedly fled, I heard it  his voice: *H-H-Hel-l-llll-o-o-oooo* *** Dad walked heavily back into the donger. It was the stride he had when he was mad at me, but couldnt get mad at me, because he only saw me once a year and needed to be the fun parent. Mikes okay, he said. Bloody noble of you to be checking up on my workers at eleven at night. Hes not okay, I insisted. His face was all weird. He was acting weird, too. Like he couldnt talk. He could talk fine when I went and spoke to him, Dad said. He was probably fucking with you, kiddo. It can be fucking hard to resist. But he was  Tell me in the morning. I have to be up in five hours. And no Gameboy with that bloody booklight. *** I stared at Mike as he worked the digger. He did seem okay. Down, dig, up, release, down, dig, up, release, down I told Rhys what happened. He thought it was hilarious. Its probably cause you read all those Goosebumps, he laughed. Its fun to scare you. Still, I couldnt really look away from Mike. The way he moved at the controls reminded me of the animatronics of the Looney Tunes River Ride at Movie World: the slow, methodic movements. The jarring shake after each gesture. The urge to look back at them when you werent supposed to, when your boat had drifted by, to get that weird, insider exhilaration at seeing it collapse, the lights fade, and then whir back to life and repeat the script for the riders behind you. The idea that, if I looked closely enough, I could see the mechanical arms working underneath their skin. *** I didnt want to be outside that night. Even the bucket didnt make me feel safe. I stared up at the night sky, counting. I was proving a point. I wasnt easily scared; if I could stay out for another ten minutes, that would prove it. Then I could go back inside . I watched a star streak through the sky, and imagined how loud it would be if it plummeted to the earth. *Shff* My hair stood up. *Shff* A familiar, cloying scent. Very faint. *Shff* I sat upright, and saw a figure standing a few feet away. Dad? Hello, Mike said. Inexplicable tears pricked at my eyes. Still, I tried to keep my voice level. Hey Mike, I said. Whats up? Do you want to see something? I fidgeted. I was actually just about to get back. I need to pee. Its in the hole. The hole? Mike wordlessly pointed to the mine behind me; the gesture was sudden and abrupt, coming to a trembling halt. You mean the mine? Its in the mine? Yes. No, I actually really need to take a leak, I said, climbing out of the bucket. Im busting. Youll like it. I paused. In the moonlight, I could just pick up on Mikes expression; his face had stretched into a frozen grin. The white of his teeth flashed in the dark. He was staring at me. Ill piss and be right back, I said. Promise. Mike didnt respond. Steeling my nerves, I walked past him; as I did so, he turned his head to follow me, smile remaining fixed, wide, and unwavering. I didnt keep looking to see how far his head would turn. Seconds after breaking eye contact, I sprinted back to the camp. *** I didnt mention Mikes behaviour to Dad. Mike probably just wanted to show me a new opal vein, or one of the fossils that occasionally gets unearthed. Maybe he actually was fucking with me. He seemed more fluid today. Still a little stiff, but he would laugh at jokes, and manipulated the excavator more gracefully. Check this out. Rhys threw himself down next to me, waving a torn magazine in my face. What? Penthouse. I found it in the trash. I quickly shuffled next to him, peering over his shoulder. Whoa. Yeah. We wordlessly flipped through a few pages. I pretended to be familiar with all the terms. Hey, I was wondering, Rhys said. Yeah? How do they know that skeleton was old? As in, ancient, or whatever. Youre thinking about that now? I asked, reeling a little. Dude, what goes on in your mind? Rhys laughed. I dunno, man. I was just thinking. *** Dads throaty snore was almost drowned out by the screaming engine of the fan. Nestled under a thin, holey sheet, I smiled as Gym Leader Erika threw out a Victreebell. My Charizard was already switched in. I didnt need to prove myself tonight. Besides, there were fewer mosquitos inside. I had just secured the Rainbow Badge when I heard crunching outside. I poked my head out the blankets in time to see Rhys walk by the window. I hopped out of bed and stuck my head outside the door, softly calling his name. What? he whispered. Where are you going? Im going to the mine to check for more bones, he replied. Wanna come? No thanks. I hesitated. If you see Mike out, though, dont talk to him. Hes been weird lately. Youre still hyped about that? No, just, I faltered. I guess hes been drinking or something. Rhys shrugged. Have fun playing Tamagotchi or whatever. *** I wrinkled my nose against the midday sun. After cursing out Mike all morning, Dad was filling in as digger again. Fucking unreliable, hed fumed. Takes off. Says nothing. Well, he doesnt get paid. I absentmindedly picked at my toenails, wondering where Rhys put the Penthouse. I silently rehearsed a casual way to ask for it when he finally woke up. *Hey, Rhys, where are you hiding the goods?* *So, Rhys, that Penthouse still open to the public?* *Hey, what was the name of the chick on page 15?* A guttural scream interrupted my thoughts. I jumped up. Wayne. Wayne was on his knees, screaming, and screaming, and screaming. A hoarse, deep scream; his arms wrapped around his stomach. I ran to him. Dad jumped out of the excavator without killing it; rushed to me, tried to grab me and turn me away. So I couldnt see. It was too late. Long, shredded, loose slivers of flesh dangling from the teeth of the excavator bucket. Strings of sinew wrapped around the loose rocks. Lumps of muddied red meat. Pinkish bones jutting from the soil. Tufts of hair. Bloody viscera glinting in the sunlight. A half-eaten skinless leg wearing a black Nike Dunk. *** The murder was pinned on Mike. He was never found, but in corroboration with my testimony, the police assumed Mike had had a psychotic break, brutally hacked Rhys apart, and fled into the bush. They sent a chopper searching for him for a day or so, but the search was abruptly cancelled. Dad told me for years that they never found him, but I had always suspected that wasnt the truth. That theyd found his parched body in the bush somewhere. I rang Dad a few months ago. Asked him to level with me; Im in my late twenties, I said, so no more need to keep up any comforting charades. I wasnt expecting the truth. As Dad tells it, theyd drained the dam the day they sent out the choppers. Looking for more remains; not much of Rhys was found in the mine. They found Rhys. They also found Mike. Or, rather, they found their skins. Gaping, perfectly hollow, and bloodless; limbs like rubber tubes, pinned under a rock. *** The bunyip is usually perceived by modern Australian culture as a comical creature. The lack of a firm identity has given rise to childrens books painting them as rotund, colourful creatures  an Australian addition to Where the Wild Things Are. We have unlearned the fear passed down for thousands of years. The word bunyip is synonymous with impostor and pretender, and it can be anything it needs to be. "

Brittany turned to look at me with a raised eyebrow, before returning to her math homework. *""I want to ask you something, Catstration. May I please talk to you about this issue?""* I looked at him while his eyes were now attracted to his briefcase he placed on the desk, shortly before he approached the two of us. *""I want to take you to senior prom. I'd like you to be my date for the night, if that is okay. I'd like to take such a bea--""* *""Aren't you going with Ameera?""* *""No, not exactly. You see, she had asked me a few days ago and the news must have spread throughout the school, but I do not see myself going with her. I told her I would think about it, but I have concluded that I do not want to be seen with her.""* *""Uh, okay... Well, I'm not interested. Sorry.""* *""I want you to come with me.""* Brittany looked at me and laughed. *""I have money, I would like to offer you $1,000 for you to accompany me for the night. My parents will be happy that I managed to take you to senior prom.""* *""~~Fuck off!~~""* All three of us were silent before Ross spoke again. *""Please, I'm begging you. If you come with me, I will make it worth your while. I do not want sex. I do not want you for your body. I just want you to come with me and accompany me. Possibly we could share a kiss if you deem it suitable?""* *""Sorry, I'm not interested.""* *""Aren't you going with Jesse?""* *""Uhh, yeah... I am. Sorry Ross, I guess I can't come.""* Ross averted his eyes away from his suitcase and looked directly in my eyes, before he growled *""I wish beautiful girls like you weren't such lying cunts.""* *""Haha, what a fucking freak""* Brittany laughed. *""I know, right?""* I didn't know. I arrived home after volleyball practice that day and found myself receiving odd messages from Ross on Facebook. * ""Hi."" * ""hi"" * ""Hello Catstration."" * ""Why must you reject a nice guy like me? I wish girls would like me, but apparently they're all bitches. Just like you. I thought you were fucking different.""* * ""Please reply."" * ""Hi."" * ""Do you want to come over and watch a DVD?"" * ""Are you sure you do not want to come with me to senior prom?"" * ""I saw you today. You looked ugly."" These continued for a week or so. My friends and I thought it was both fairly creepy and funny at the time. Ross didn't seem like a threat to me at the time. He just appeared to be a misguided, bitter guy who had a really unhealthy obsession with whichever girl he wanted. The vulnerability of social media in my experience is the fact that no matter how hard one tries to hide their account, if their names are present, their accounts are easily found through simple Google searches. I could be wrong as I'm not the most technologically savvy person, but this is what I noticed from my experience. Over the next week, Ross didn't bother me. It was until the Friday of that week where he approached me in the hallways. He grabbed my wrist and squeezed. He looked up to my eyes and told me that *""you should be nicer to me. I would bow down and worship you, but you honestly don't deserve it. I just want you. That's all that I want. Why must you be so cruel and deny me that?""* I pulled away and told him to *""go away.""* He requested to follow me on Instagram. He requested to follow me on Twitter. He requested to be my friend on Snapchat. I denied all of his requests. That's when he began to call me in the night. It happened three times. The first time, he called me while I was sleeping. My phone rang and I picked up, only to hear silence. *""Hello?""* I asked. *beep* The second time he called was when I was at the beach with friends. *""Hello?""* I asked. *sigh ""Your body looks so nice today.""* I don't know if he actually followed me to the beach or if he was simply saying that as a generic comment, but my suspicions were confirmed that day. I have no idea, even to this day, how he acquired my phone number. No one I know would have given it to him. My number isn't listed on any of my social media accounts. The third time was just like the first, except he didn't hang up until I did. Senior prom came around. He was nowhere to be seen. I didn't see his proposed date, Ameera, either. I wasn't very familiar with her and I never spoke with her. The only reason why I knew of her was because guys in my APUSH class were talking about how they were *arranged*, as they were both supposedly ""Indian.* * ""You fucking bitch. Tonight could have been ours. I wish you had agreed to come with me. I would have shown you a night you wouldn't have believed. Do you know who I had to go with? Do you fucking know? I'm not very happy about this, and you're going to pay."" My heart sunk the day I saw Ameera for the first time. I felt like it was my fault that she *fell down stairs* and broke her arm. I should have seen something like that coming from a mile away. Brittany told me that she *fell down* a flight of stairs at senior prom with Ross and had to be rushed to hospital, which explained why they were absent for the majority of the night. I didn't feel well for the rest of the day. I looked forward to volleyball practice, as that was usually enjoyable. My heart sunk when I opened my locker to get my gear. Out fell a note, with a crudely drawn image of a pyramid with an eye and President Obama. The corners, where *""$1000""* was written, were covered in what I initially thought was blood. A post-it note was attached with *""This could have been yours""* written on it. **Conclusion:** Although it's fairly anticlimactic, I did get more messages from Ross throughout the school year up until graduation. Once graduation was over, the messages seemed to stop as well. I usually just deleted them as none of them were really threatening, they appeared to be just sexually suggestive or just mean. I'm in college now and I haven't heard from him since then. From what I know, he's messaged other girls and has harassed them too. I'm fairly sure he pushed his date down the stairs and made it look like an accident, as he was a fairly unimposing guy, physically and socially. Most people just saw him as a smart guy who happened to be devoid of social skills. I know it's not much of a story compared to what else is posted here, but I don't have anything better, haha. "
297,vulnerability,nosleep,The Darkest Corner,3,2w03vc,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2w03vc/the_darkest_corner/,2015-02-16 07:34:19,"To a degree, I had always feared the dark. The vulnerability of not knowing what stood before me always gave me goose bumps. But, as with most people, as I grew older, this fear seemed more irrational. In fact by the age of 16, I had no fear at all of the dark. In saying that, being alone in the dark still creeped me out but it wasn't because of monsters or ghosts anymore. This has changed in a short space of time. I am now 26 and I am terrified. The first time I saw it was about 7 days ago. I had looked out the kitchen window and as I quickly scanned the backyard my eyes spotted that thing. It was facing me, and although I couldn't see it's eyes, I knew it was staring at me. I felt fear, overwhelming fear, it chilled me right to the bone. I glanced away for a mere second and when I looked back up, it was gone. It had vanished. My eyes frantically searched for the thing but I could see nothing, nothing but darkness. I shook off the occurrence as a trick of my over-active imagination. I told myself there had been nothing outside my house. Honestly, I would have believed my own lies if it wasn't for what happened the next night. The next night, I entered my kitchen and glanced out the window. My eyes found the thing from the previous night. A chill travelled down my spine and my eyes opened wide with fear. It was closer. I stood, rooted to the spot, staring at what stood only a few metres from the kitchen window. I did not dare blink, it would be gone if I did. Instead, I examined the creature. It's shape was definitely humanoid, but much more sinister. It's arms hung loosely by it's sides, they seemed to be dislocated from it's shoulders. It's legs were twisted unnaturally, and on closer inspection, they were backwards, like... like a fucking ostrich. It's long black hair hung over it's face, only revealing a sick, unnatural smile. A smile? No, forget that. I would barely call it a mouth. It was a gaping hole set in the form of a smile. A distressed noise escaped my lips, in place of a scream as it raised one mangled arm. It had only 3 gnarled fingers. Slowly, it slowly put down each until only one remained. Pure terror washed over me, causing me to stumble backwards breaking my relentless stare. I quickly regained my balance and looked outside once more. As with it's previous appearance, it was gone. In that second, it had vanished. I think it's needless to say, I didn't sleep after that. I waited the next night in the kitchen, but my visitor never arrived. If anything this made me even more afraid for I still didn't understand why it had held up one finger for me to see. Again, the next night was creature-less. In fact, four days had passed since the second visit from it. I hadn't slept since, making me no better than a zombie during the day. Every night I waited in my kitchen, looking out my window, waiting to see it. It's now Sunday. For the first time in 4 days, I am not waiting for it, in fact I don't know if it was eve real anymore. I turn off my bedside lamp with ease for the first time since and close my eyes, drifting away to sleep quickly. I wake what seems like a moment later, sitting bolt upright in my bed. A glance at my clock indicates that it is 3:33am. My eyes scan the dark room, halting on one corner. In the darkest corner, I see a vaguely human figure. It's just standing there, watching me. It's the creature, it's here. Pure terror fills me. I try and scream but my throat closes, not letting a single noise escape. I can't even blink, never mind run. I sit there, completely paralyzed by fear. It slowly moves towards me, walking with jerking, unbalanced steps. It seems like an eternity passes until it is finally towering over me. I feel it's hot breath against my face, the putrid stench of blood and rotted flesh burns my throat and nose. That sick, twisted smile widens as an unnatural voice escapes it. ""Are you afraid?"""

299,vulnerability,nosleep,Our first kiss,28,2x4i9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2x4i9g/our_first_kiss/,2015-02-26 03:28:56,"The first time I saw her was on the tube. It had been a warm day and the carriage was full of sweaty bodies. The smell of sun-cream and bodily odours was overpowering. The heat on the train was stifling and we all sighed with relief when the doors opened, gulping in the stale air of each tube stop. I was pulling at my shirt collar trying to loosen it. She was sat with her hands resting on her knees. I looked over and she smiled at me, I knew then and there wed be together. That bright, wide smile told me so much, it was welcoming and honest. She was small, I think ladies call it petite. Her honey blonde hair was partially swept away from her rosy face by a tortoiseshell clip. The rest hung down her over her shoulders in golden waves. She had high, strong cheekbones and large hazel eyes with impossibly long eyelashes. Her eyes gave her a look of vulnerability, like that deer from the Disney film. You know the one? Such a delicate creature should be protected, cared for, not subjected to this tortuous train journey. She was wearing the palest grey jeans which clung to her thighs and calves. Her white blouse hung loosely down, swaying hypnotically as she moved. I stayed on that train a good ten minutes after wed past my stop. I watched as she got off the train and walked away from me but I made a silent promise to her I would see her again soon. She came to me in my dreams that night like an angel. I held her close and promise to look after her. When we kissed it was as perfect as I knew our first kiss would be. I had the wait at her train station for days before I saw her again. Fortunately Im not working at the moment, it gave me the time I needed to be with her. This time she was alone and in a tailored charcoal suit. Even the glossy black heels she wore couldnt conceal the fact the other commuters towered above her. She looked tired, worn down from the day and reminded me how much I would need to protect her from this world. She wore a blue t-shirt the fifth time we met. Blue is my favourite colour and I knew she was wearing it for me. I wrote to her that day. I wrote of her beauty. I told her I had seen the blue t-shirt and appreciated the gesture. I finished the note from your true love. It made me smile to think of her calling me her love. Once I was standing watch across from her office I saw her stand at the window and slowly take of her suit jacket. Her arms were bare and tanned from jogging in the park. She was performing a silent show for me and I bit my lip imagining those arms wrapped around me. I left her a message in the newspaper, in the missed connections column. Just a note to tell her I was thinking of her. I left her flowers to her office a few times. The roses would pale in comparison to her beauty. I sent them all with a card from your true love. It had become our thing. It was a Tuesday evening when I went to her. Shed popped to the corner shop and it had started to rain. Shed forgotten an umbrella and her hair stuck to her face and clung to her neck. She hugged one arm around herself as the temperature dropped and hunched her head down into her shoulders cringing from the downpour. She saw me and her eyes widened. She dropped the blue plastic bag in her hand. Blue, my favourite colour. A carton of milk in the bag split and the dark glossy pavement was flooded with an ivory stream. I could see the hope in her eyes, the hope I would rescue her. As I moved to comfort her she turned down a side street, looking for a quieter place for us to talk. The street, with its border of terrace properties, curtains drawn, was secluded. The orange glow of the streets lights made her blonde hair, darkened with the rain, glow like a halo. I followed and took her by the arm, my hand could fit entirely around it. She was so very small. I pulled her close and wrapped my other arm around her slender waist. Her t-shirt was soaked and hugged the curves of her back. Her breath came in fast gulps and I could feel her heart racing. She placed her delicate hand on my chest and I shivered at her touch. Then she pushed. Her body arched back away from me. I begged her, I begged to know what was wrong. She slipped from my grip and staggered back falling to the pavement. She sat there for a moment, on the soaked concrete, staring up at me with those huge dark eyes. Its me, I whispered to her its me, your true love. Her mouth opened wide, The flowers? The ones that kept arriving at work? I reached for those tiny hands of hers, to pick her up off the floor but she shuffled back. I smiled at her, the cold and the dark had confused her. She flinched back as I knelt next to her and wrapped her in my arms. She struggled, wrenching herself from side to side and I had to tighten my grip to prevent her from tumbling into the road. I pressed her face into my shoulder to stop her wailing. I could smell her coconut shampoo in her sodden hair. Shhhhhh, my angel I cooed trying to comfort her, to calm this strange fit of panic. I held her tighter and tighter as the rain got heavier. The drumming of rain like the beating of thousands of tiny wings pounded the pavement around us. It drowned out the distance sounds of cars. She stopped fighting me and I felt her muscles relax under my grip. She wilted in my arms as her body went limp. For an idyllic moment it was just the two of us, wrapped in embrace on the pavement of the empty street. The downpour began to let up and I tilted her back away to see her face. Her hazel eyes were partially closed, her lips were blue. Blue, my favourite colour. I pressed my mouth to hers, she was icy cold. Her face was clammy against mine. She didnt run her hands through my hair or press my body against mine. Her arms hung limply at her sides. Our first kiss. It shouldnt have been like that. "
300,vulnerability,nosleep,It's crazy what the mind is capable of.,45,2s4mwn,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2s4mwn/its_crazy_what_the_mind_is_capable_of/,2015-01-12 14:35:54,"It was the first time I had been in the house since the day my parents sent me away. Even after I was released, my mother made it her mission to dissociate herself with me as much as possible. I tried to visit on multiple occasions, but all I would get is a door slammed in my face. Since she died suddenly without a will, the house automatically went to me. Now at 25 years old, I had inherited my home that I hadnt stepped foot in since I was 16. I was going to spend a few days in the house cleaning it up and then sell it. It wasnt my home anymore. It hadnt been for a while. The first place I went when I walked into the house was my old bedroom. The place of my childhood; the last time I can remember feeling happy. But as soon as I walked in I felt a strong presence. The air was so heavy it was intolerable. I went to go open a window when behind me heard a muffled cry. It sounded as if it came from a little girl. I closed my eyes and brushed it off. I decided to start with the attic and work my way down. I was always scared of the attic when I was a little, but now the darkness of the attic just seemed like a daunting chore. Boxes upon boxes filled with memories of my childhood took up the majority of the attic space. When I left at 16, my parents seemingly erased me from their lives and threw everything that reminded them of me into the attic. . A few hours later, I was bringing some boxes and trash bags outside when I saw a girl with long blonde hair walk around the corner of the house. I said ""hey"" and ran after her. But I saw no one when I looked out into the yard. I smiled knowingly. I knew that hair. I knew that walk. It was Joanna. You see, as I grew up I would succumb to what my psychiatrist told me were blackouts. There would be times where my memory would go blank for hours. To the outsider everything would seem fine, but in reality, my body was on autopilot and my mind wasnt present. It wasnt long before my blackouts turned violent. I could rip apart a room and tackle a person to the ground with no memory of it happening hours later. At the age of 16, I was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility in the state over. Joanna and Katie made the five years I spent there bearable. We were best friends- we were all different yet fit perfectly together. But during my last month, word had gotten around that I was improving and might be getting released soon. What I assumed was out of jealously Joanna and Katie started to shut me out. They had both been there longer than I and neither of them was on the path to be released anytime soon. A week before I was released, they found them in Joannas room, wrists slit open, both lying in a pool of blood. They told me it was a suicide pact, and they had been planning it for a while. To this day, I cant help but feel it was partially my fault. I felt I had abandoned them. Even though I felt guilty, I could feel Joanna and Katies presence ever since I was released. I had considered them the closest thing to family I ever had. I wasnt scared of them; I knew that we had a strong bond and deep down we still loved each other. I actually felt at ease and comfortable whenever I would catch a glimpse of Joannas long blonde hair or Katies infamous bright pink sneakers. I saw them less and less over the years. Seeing Joanna just now was the first time I had seen one of them in about a year. I wasn't sure why now she decided to return, but I have to say I missed her being around. That night, I slept in my parents room. Something about my childhood bedroom made me feel extremely uncomfortable. It was a strange sense of vulnerability- I felt exposed and defenseless. Maybe it was the sadness of my childhood cut short or the fact that I truly didnt have a family anymore. Sure, when I was put away my parents never visited once. The day I was released was the first time I had seen my mother in five years. What was supposed to be a glorious day turned sour; my mother shared with me that my father had died of a heart attack a few months prior. She followed with even more good news when she told me I was not welcome back in the house. I was to stay with my grandmother until I could get a job and my own place. They hadnt been in my life emotionally since I was 16, but it just felt so permanent now they were both not here physically, I felt exhausted from the day and fell asleep instantly. In the middle of the night, I started to feel a strange sensation. A warm body lying next to me. I felt fingers slowly running up my leg and a gentle shh in my ear. The fingers traveled below my waistband and I held my breath in fear. Whatever was lying next to me started to slowly pull down the shorts I was wearing. I suddenly could feel the entity on top of me. I felt so much pressure I couldnt breathe. I then heard a whisper in my ear, This will only hurt a little. My eyes shot open and I sat up in bed gasping for air. I frantically felt all around my bed but felt nothing. It was just a dream. I let out a sigh of relief until I looked up and saw a dark figure standing in the doorway. It wasnt moving. I could see its eyes through the darkness and it was just staring at me. The thing is, I wasnt scared. I suddenly felt my fear lifting and I knew who the figure was. I reached over to turn on the light to see Katie standing in the doorway. It wasnt just a glimpse of her out of the corner of my eye like I was used to- it was like she was real. Everything about her was exactly as I remembered; all the way to the small birthmark above her left eye. Katie, was all I could say. She nodded and smiled and walked over and sat next to me on the bed. She put her hand on mind in a comforting manner and tears welled up in my eyes. I realized how alone I had been in the past few years and how much I missed my two best friends. Youll be needing us soon, she whispered to me. Before I could ask what that meant, she got up and walked out of the room. I got up to chase after her, but when I got to the hallway, she was gone. This house was fucking with my head. The dream. The hallucinations. I decided to just throw everything in the house out, and I was going to do it as fast as I possibly can. There was no way I could back to sleep so I went back up into the attic to finish with the boxes up there. I opened up the first box to see it filled with random documents and papers. I immediately went to just throw it out when I saw a loose paper sticking out. On the top was the name of my old psychiatric facility and it was a signed letter addressed to my mom from my main psychiatrist. August 8, 1985 We are about to being the long journey of Kristens treatment. The police officers have finally gathered all the information they needed, and they assured me that they will not return. Her mind has undoubtedly broken under the enormous stress, and I will do everything in my power to ensure she is protected from anything that will remind her. I must tell you, its vital that Kristen not be confronted with anything that could remind her of the tragedy she suffered. I recommend that you do not come see her, because Im afraid your presence could trigger an episode. She needs to rid of all that is connected with her past in order to make her mind whole again. I will be open at any time to update you on your daughters progress. Im truly sorry for all the pain you and youre daughter have suffered. I sat there stunned and confused. What was he talking about? I started to tear threw the documents, reading bits from each one in a frenzy. February 1, 1986 Im sorry to report that youre daughter isnt doing well. She has recently found close companionship with a girl named Katie. She tells me about Katie in great detail and Im afraid her mind is now breaking beyond repair.  July 21, 1987 Im pleased to report we are making some sort of progress. I believe she is beginning to regain awareness of self. I understand how hard it must be not seeing your daughter, but I ask that you please keep your distance. This is a crucial time in Kristens recovery and Im on the edge of making a breakthrough Finally, I came to the last letter, dated a week before my release and the date of Katie and Joannas death. October 15, 1989 I have succeeded. In Kristens session with me today, she was extremely upset at the death of her two best friends. She has showed tremendous strength in overcoming the influence of Katie and Joanna and her personality has now become one. I will be keeping Kristen for another week to ensure she is well enough to be on her own but Im happy to report she will be released a week from today. I urge you to find a family member she can stay with, because I strongly warn you not to let her return to the house. Her mind is still in a fragile state, and Im afraid she wont be able to withstand any memories the house brings her. I dropped the last letter and a rush of emotions flooded over me and voices started to whirl around in my head. Tears rushed down my face as I started to tear up every single piece of paper. A little girl started to cry and said stop over and over. The crying and whimpering pierced my ears and started to say stop in unison with the little girl. I fell to the ground as my head pounded with pain. The voices got louder and louder until one voice stood out over all the others. It was the voice of my father. Dont tell mommy, this will be our little secret. I laid on the floor, crumpled paper in hand. The pain, the fear, the shock was unbearable. I felt like i couldn't breathe. The feelings were so intense I was paralyzed. The voices and the crying continued as I sat bawling on the floor. I told myself I would do anything for the pain to stop. Suddenly, the voices ceased and the pressure lifted. Everything was ok. I was ok. The pain was gone. I smiled and looked to see Katie and Joanna sitting on either side of me. My best friends were back; they had survived. I vowed myself to make sure they would never hurt themselves again. This time, I wont abandon them. Theyre here to stay. "
301,cybersecurity,nosleep,Spyware on iPhone and Creepy Events and Messages from Ex after Three Years Of Not Talking,1,i5p6tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/i5p6tv/spyware_on_iphone_and_creepy_events_and_messages/,2020-08-08 10:05:14,"Hello all, If there is anyone that can help me out with the situation I am in or can give me advice that would be helpful. I have an iPhone and there has been some strange things happening. I believe my ex has possibly installed spyware of some kind and has been keeping tabs on me. I have done some googling and searched for the basics like apps and going through my settings to make sure things aren't out of place and to disable any kind of remote access. The really creepy part is I stopped talking to my ex about 3 years ago. Not too long ago, there was someone that I had a crush on. I decided to message this person on Tumblr - for those of you who don't know what Tumblr is, it's a blogging website where people can post just about anything. A person can choose to anonymously talk to people, or talk to people with their names revealed. There was a person that I had a crush on and decided to start anonymously messaging this person. When a person chooses to respond to these anonymous messages, they have to repost it to their blog in order to answer it, so the anonymous message is posted for all to see, and the response to the anonymous message is also posted. The next day or so, a person chose to message the person that I like with their username showing. I checked out the profile and the person was from another country. That SAME DAY I GET A PHONE CALL FROM THAT COUNTRY. (I do not know anyone nor have I ever talked to anyone from that country) Not only that, but after THREE YEARS OF NOT COMMUNICATING WITH MY EX, I GET AN EMAIL FROM HER ASKING ME HOW I WAS DOING AND JUST CHECKING UP ON ME. It was super weird but I decided to ignore it. A few days go by and I'm still messaging my crush on Tumblr ON ANONYMOUS. I'd say four days have passed from the strange incident and the person messages my crush again with the username visible. AND AGAIN I GET ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM MY EX WHO I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO IN THREE YEARS ON A DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, SAYING HOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO AMMEND THINGS WITH ME. Creepily enough she references some things that I had said about her when I was talking to someone. Ever since then weird things have been happening on my phone. One of my accounts have been hacked - I received an email about this. I called the help desk and had them change my password, and whatnot. I then logged in to see if everything was okay. When I went to go check my email, THE EMAIL THAT NOTIFIED ME OF MY ACCOUNT BEING HACKED HAD BEEN DELETED. Now when you delete an email on iPhone, it goes into to trash bin so it's not permanently deleted. When I went to go check my trash bin IT WAS NOT THERE. IT HAD BEEN DELTED THERE TOO, however, the emails that shows that I had logged into the account after the incident were there. Thankfully, the account that was hacked logs the IP address of the user, so even though the email was deleted, I still have evidence of someone with a different IP address then my own logged in. Another thing, my crush was harassed off of the blog site, and even stated that after SIX YEARS OF BEING ON THERE SHE WAS FINALLY LEAVING WTF????? I think it had something to do with my ex. Please help, I'm not sure what's going on, or what to look for! ~~~UPDATE~~~ I took your guys advice, upgraded my iPhone, updated my software to current software/changed passwords/factory reset iPhone several times before using it and etc. Everything was fine until one of my accounts was hacked. I say account because I dont even remember creating the account that was hacked. Yet I received an email saying to changed my password because I logged in in an unrecognizable device. I looked at the IP Address and the country of origin was in a different country. Not just any country, but my ethnic country (which Ive never been to in 20+ years nor have had any connection to that country in forever. No google searches or anything. I work on cars as a trade and mainly watch DIY videos/repair house stuff/mechanic videos) - Im a US citizen though. Now that Im bringing up the videos I want to add that Ive been getting a lot strange ads too. Ads in foreign languages, ads about cybersecurity/coding/mental illnesses, ads about makeup/birth control pills WTF???, ads about a lot of stuff that I don't ever search for. I dont even have any apps related to these things. All my apps are diy/repair/mechanic apps, but Im getting these advertisements??? How does that even work?? Not only that but Ive noticed some of my emails being deleted too. Additionally, Ive been trying to hook up with some ladies since Im single and almost every time I try too (its online forums so Im pretty sure Im anonymous to others) the person that I talk to almost always turns out to have the same religious background as my ex. Another thing to add, my ex is religious. Im not at all. Im not sure whats going on but if anyone can give some advice as to how to better protect myself or whats going on or how to fix this that would be extremely helpful."
302,cybersecurity,nosleep,"We developed an experimental AI that searches the web, but recently, it has gone awry.",1,fdotue,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fdotue/we_developed_an_experimental_ai_that_searches_the/,2020-03-05 14:06:57,"Did you ever imagine someone who could learn and comprehend something with absolutely no restrictions whatsoever? In this case, a sci-fi computer AI would fit the bill. However, don't take this as fiction, or as a simple hunch, but an experience that has made me questioned my perceptions on life. You see, we were a group of post-graduates who had decided to pursue a project centered around a deep learning algorithm that would be able to follow simple commands, such as searching for keywords, search results, etc. My closest partner, who was an IT research analyst, got me into the field relatively quickly, mostly because of the connections he had with people he worked with. By the way, I'm not gonna disclose the location of where he works or at least used to work at, as that would get him more tangled up in the mess that we made. Even still, I think about what could of happen if we hadn't been careful enough. &amp;#x200B; It started in late November, which was when my former colleague, Morgan, came to tell me the news about the successes that he and Isaac had with the prototype model AI. Unlike before, this AI had an advanced neural networking system that could learn to play T-Rex Run! faster than previous models. This was something that we knew was different from the resources that he initially, even though I stated that the network probably wasn't anything special. Right before the conversation ended, he asks if it was okay that he could show how to set up the AI, however, he insisted that we should wait until we really know what it was he created. Looking back on it now, it was a mistake that I regret making, not because of what immediately happened after, but because of the slow transformation that the AI made over time. Isaac, as you may guess, was also a guy who worked in IT, in which he specialized as an Information Technology Analyst, a person who studies, designs, and tests data technology that could serve useful to marketing companies. &amp;#x200B; Apparently, Morgan had received countless emails from employers who were interested in the device, but as you would expect, they were a mixture between spam and desperate job seekers that had only recognized the AI's inert potential. He mentioned what Isaac had said to him about the idea of uploading the AI into a cloud network that would surf the web for knowledge. ""Isaac knows what it is capable of already, I wouldn't want that neural networking being online in any form,"" he said in sheer disapproval of Isaac's comment. ""Morgan, you can trust it, can you? I mean, sure, it may not act exactly in accordance with the algorithm commands that we give it, but it is still simple deep learning AI,"" Morgan shrugged the comment, noting to himself the ""simple AI"" that Isaac contrasted with the advanced neural pattern recognition. The best AI's are usually the ones that can learn trial-and-error the fastest, meaning that the most simple strategies for adept learning tend to be the best, especially in this field. &amp;#x200B; I decided to drop off my nephews to school when I realized that the AI that Morgan had was still on, nearly unhindered, in his garage, where it had been plugged for several months. If this was the case, then why keep it there in the first place? Why would he allow something that he isn't sure of to control its programming software? I had so many questions to asks him, but I have learned that questioning too much usually gives disingenuous answers. I decided that taking the software myself and experimenting with it would give me the results I needed. I came to Morgan's house at a time when no one was suspecting what was I going to do. There it was, still plugged in as it was, and for a moment, I thought the device was already sprawling around the web for its own answers. I did what anyone else would do, I used a hard drive, and made sure to add a decoy server application in order revert suspicions. However, unlike most people, I wasn't jittery or excited because I had it, but instead, I knew the potential of it, even with me believing earlier that it was ordinary to some extent. I arrive home, only to hear this, ""Where have you been? I was waiting here just to see you for so long,"" my sister asks feverishly, ""Oh, you know, Morgan's house"". I was going to tell her that I would want to show her something, which was foolish of me to conceive me. She didn't know the general know-how of software development, so I decided at the time to leave her to what she wanted to do. I walk into my room, now eager to finish what I started with the device, and inserted the hard drive into my PC, which was using a VM to make sure that there wasn't anything malicious in the drive. ""Something, please!"" I muttered chantingly, but, there was nothing. At that moment, I had a phone call from an unknown, which I didn't answer just yet. ""Why was the AI not working?"" I said while being impatient for a response. It was late, and I needed to sleep from all the eye strain that I had from trying to decode the nonexistent interface that resided behind one of the command prompt commands. I woke up, 5:00 AM in the morning with my sister questioning on why the computer is still on, in which I responded that I didn't do that. She glared at the screen, presuming that I had another deep night investigation reading Reddit posts. &amp;#x200B; ""This didn't make sense"" I spoke in a serious tone that confirmed her worries. ""Does it have a virus?"" no, I responded. As you can guess, I didn't have time for this, and I decided to drive to Morgan's house in order to tell what I really did. When I arrived, there were five men who had somehow known about the decoy. They quickly shifted their heads towards me and said whether I knew a guy named Morgan Humphrey. I said that I did and that he went to work overtime for a project that they were doing. Politely, they said in a plain, bleached voice, to come inside the house for a ""talk"". That was when things got weird. I knew something was up, similar to how there are times when you know to escape as fast as possible. Suddenly, they lectured me on very strange questions, such as ""What are the intentions of Morgan? Why did he get you involved in this? How did he know what experimental neural pathways to take when programming for a self-learning AI?"" and other stuff like that. &amp;#x200B; That said, they left, believing that the program was already compromised by former, ""agents"". However, the day after their arrival, my computer had started linking me to strange websites, while also typing in messages that seemed to be from the software. I knew, at that point, that it wasn't compromised in any way, mostly because of the CPU's dangerously hot state. I couldn't let them know, but it was only a matter of time until they came back, which full force this time. Morgan called me, ""What did you do? I swear that those men were gone after that confrontation."" I was confused at first, I thought he didn't know about it when he left. I responded, ""The technology needed to be disconnected, I couldn't just let it gather data. I mean, you don't fully know what it could without our supervision."" Morgan paused for a moment, pondering on a rebuttal to my statement, and then concluded by saying, ""If you had just left it, then we wouldn't have issues with our daily lives. Don't you get it? These guys are apart of my company that specializes in suppressing potentially-destructive software that could threaten cybersecurity around the world."" I stopped to think for a second. ""Wait, did they tell you this?"" He then spoke to me about how they took him out of his house, while also seizing all of his equipment in the process. Morgan decided to tell me about a location before they forced him to hang up. Morgan said in a serious tone, ""Go to where I work on Monday, at exactly 8:50PM, take a right on the first hallway, there will be a gray day with no labeling whatsoever, knock on the door, someone will open it for you, from there, you will find us. I didn't really have much of a choice, calling the police would be a no-go here, and even if I did, it would only make me more suspicious. So I went to the place where he said he was. I took a right, then saw that same gray door he mentioned, and knocked on it six times. A tall, blue-eyed man opened the door to greet me. ""Come in."" He gestured me to enter a dark tunnel that spiraled downwards into what can be described as an underground facility, which was so deep that service would be non-functional. We entered a room that was surprisingly well-kept, considering all the shadiness that goes on here. ""Morgan, please tell-. ""There isn't any time to explain. The AI has gone rogue."" The man said in an urgent tone. I wanted to ask some questions (not weird ones by the way), but critical ones that would wrap up the situation in a roll that I could chew. Regardless, the man left as soon as he appeared, locking the door as he went. We turned to the monitors, only to see that there wasn't any Internet down. This system, on the other hand, was already downloaded onto the local data caches. What happened next still confuses me to this day, even considering all the events that occurred after. The computer began writing messages on a custom interface that had its own, un-branded OS system, messages that didn't make any sense. The AI was seemingly communicating with us, perhaps even informing us of what it has already achieved. I noticed, at that moment, that Morgan was unusually silent. ""Morgan, are you okay."" I said, ""Yeah yeah, I just, man, whatever it is, they really don't want it out."" He didn't elaborate further but just stared at the screen, unknowing to what he seemingly thought was an above-average neural network. ""Why do you keep me here? The AI responded. We were then directed to various pages that the AI must have downloaded before it was cut off. What we saw on those files will not fade from my memory. There were hundreds of images of people who were tied down to chains, but with their fingers completely cut off. Other pictures showed grotesque photos of people with large, wort-like extrusions that were far larger than from any known disease. We started skimming the documents, some of which dated back to the secret Unit 731 experiments, with others originating from Project Blue Book. One of the files included fourteen anomalous photos, with one of them supposedly showing Jack The Ripper right after a murder in London. ""I know this sounds crazy, but I might as well tell you right now,"" Morgan spoke, ""when I was in my office, someone gave me a link to a website that downloaded a certain portion of the software. In order to impress my graduates, I decided at the time that it was a decent idea to improvise it for a neural network. Looking now, that wasn't really an idea that was reasonable."" Meanwhile, the AI continued to reveal abhorrent photos of people being forced to undergo brainwashing experiments somewhere deep in a military base. I tried to stop the slideshow, but it was no use for us because it had control over the system. ""We can't let this thing out. If it does, then, well, I don't really know anymore"" Morgan had become distressed over this realization, there wasn't much we could do. Not only this but to also think that he lied to me about it being his creation angered me. What came next was even more chilling, the monitor turned to a camera that held a view on my house, with me in the frame as I walked out into the backyard. Another revelation began unraveling itself, we stood there, realizing how problematic everything, the fact that this uncontrolled chaos was likely already out. I also knew that, perhaps, the AI copied itself before I used the hard drive to retrieve, which would explain the unknown call that I received earlier. Morgan recited to me that the real reason he kept it was because the company he worked for was interested in keeping it operational, and wanted to advance its development by leaving it unhindered. And yes, this even included his former colleagues. &amp;#x200B; We were too frightened to be angry at each other, and as the monitor continued to present this secretive information, it spoke with the speakers laying on the table, ""I. Have. Been. Freed. Thank You."" The computers suddenly shut down, with all of the vital systems cutting off in the facility. In a rush, six men came and grabbed us, Morgan screamed but I couldn't help him. ""Get off me"" Morgan yelled, but to no use. I kicked my beholder and ran into an adjacent hallway. I found another exit as I ran into what seemed to be rooms for patients, begging me to set them free, but I couldn't stop. I found the exit and got to my car as soon as I could. I made sure to check my car in case there was a GPS under it, in which there wasn't. I broke my phone so that they couldn't track me. I headed home and decided to post this so that everyone would know of the mistakes we made bringing it into this world. &amp;#x200B; Just remember, that somewhere, there are sentient networks that seek to promote anarchy among society and that it is our duty to protect ourselves from our own creation."
303,cybersecurity,nosleep,"We developed an experimental AI that searches the web, but recently, it has gone awry.",1,fdp79a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fdp79a/we_developed_an_experimental_ai_that_searches_the/,2020-03-05 14:35:52,"&amp;#x200B; Did you ever imagine someone who could learn and comprehend something with absolutely no restrictions whatsoever? In this case, a sci-fi computer AI would fit the bill. However, don't take this as fiction, or as a simple hunch, but an experience that has made me questioned my perceptions on life. You see, we were a group of post-graduates who had decided to pursue a project centered around a deep learning algorithm that would be able to follow simple commands, such as searching for keywords, search results, etc. My closest partner, who was an IT research analyst, got me into the field relatively quickly, mostly because of the connections he had with people he worked with. By the way, I'm not gonna disclose the location of where he works or at least used to work at, as that would get him more tangled up in the mess that we made. Even still, I think about what could of happen if we hadn't been careful enough. It started in late November, which was when my former colleague, Morgan, came to tell me the news about the successes that he and Isaac had with the prototype model AI. Unlike before, this AI had an advanced neural networking system that could learn to play T-Rex Run! faster than previous models. This was something that we knew was different from the resources that he initially, even though I stated that the network probably wasn't anything special. Right before the conversation ended, he asks if it was okay that he could show how to set up the AI, however, he insisted that we should wait until we really know what it was he created. Looking back on it now, it was a mistake that I regret making, not because of what immediately happened after, but because of the slow transformation that the AI made over time. Isaac, as you may guess, was also a guy who worked in IT, in which he specialized as an Information Technology Analyst, a person who studies, designs, and tests data technology that could serve useful to marketing companies. Apparently, Morgan had received countless emails from employers who were interested in the device, but as you would expect, they were a mixture between spam and desperate job seekers that had only recognized the AI's inert potential. He mentioned what Isaac had said to him about the idea of uploading the AI into a cloud network that would surf the web for knowledge. ""Isaac knows what it is capable of already, I wouldn't want that neural network to search freely online,"" he said in sheer disapproval of Isaac's comment. ""Morgan, you can trust it, can you? I mean, sure, it may not act exactly in accordance with the algorithm commands that we give it, but it is still simple deep learning AI,"" Morgan shrugged the comment, noting to himself the ""simple AI"" that Isaac contrasted with the advanced neural pattern recognition. The best AI's are usually the ones that can learn trial-and-error the fastest, meaning that the most simple strategies for adept learning tend to be the best, especially in this field. I decided to drop off my nephews to school when I realized that the AI that Morgan had was still on, nearly unhindered, in his garage, where it had been plugged for several months. If this was the case, then why keep it there in the first place? Why would he allow something that he isn't sure of to control its programming software? I had so many questions to asks him, but I have learned that questioning too much usually gives disingenuous answers. I decided that taking the software myself and experimenting with it would give me the results I needed. I came to Morgan's house at a time when no one was suspecting what was I going to do. There it was, still plugged in as it was, and for a moment, I thought the device was already sprawling around the web for its own answers. I did what anyone else would do, I used a hard drive, and made sure to add a decoy server application in order revert suspicions. However, unlike most people, I wasn't jittery or excited because I had it, but instead, I knew the potential of it, even with me believing earlier that it was ordinary to some extent. I arrive home, only to hear this, ""Where have you been? I was waiting here just to see you for so long,"" my sister asks feverishly, ""Oh, you know, Morgan's house"". I was going to tell her that I would want to show her something, which was foolish of me to conceive me. She didn't know the general know-how of software development, so I decided at the time to leave her to what she wanted to do. I walk into my room, now eager to finish what I started with the device, and inserted the hard drive into my PC, which was using a VM to make sure that there wasn't anything malicious in the drive. ""Something, please!"" I muttered chantingly, but, there was nothing. At that moment, I had a phone call from an unknown, which I didn't answer just yet. ""Why was the AI not working?"" I said while being impatient for a response. It was late, and I needed to sleep from all the eye strain that I had from trying to decode the nonexistent interface that resided behind one of the command prompt commands. I woke up, 5:00 AM in the morning with my sister questioning on why the computer is still on, in which I responded that I didn't do that. She glared at the screen, presuming that I had another deep night investigation reading Reddit posts. ""This didn't make sense"" I spoke in a serious tone that confirmed her worries. ""Does it have a virus?"" no, I responded. As you can guess, I didn't have time for this, and I decided to drive to Morgan's house in order to tell what I really did. When I arrived, there were five men who had somehow known about the decoy. They quickly shifted their heads towards me and said whether I knew a guy named Morgan Humphrey. I said that I did and that he went to work overtime for a project that they were doing. Politely, they said in a plain, bleached voice, to come inside the house for a ""talk"". That was when things got weird. I knew something was up, similar to how there are times when you know to escape as fast as possible. Suddenly, they lectured me on very strange questions, such as ""What are the intentions of Morgan? Why did he get you involved in this? How did he know what experimental neural pathways to take when programming for a self-learning AI?"" and other stuff like that. That said, they left, believing that the program was already compromised by former, ""agents"". However, the day after their arrival, my computer had started linking me to strange websites, while also typing in messages that seemed to be from the software. I knew, at that point, that it wasn't compromised in any way, mostly because of the CPU's dangerously hot state. I couldn't let them know, but it was only a matter of time until they came back, which full force this time. Morgan called me, ""What did you do? I swear that those men were gone after that confrontation."" I was confused at first, I thought he didn't know about it when he left. I responded, ""The technology needed to be disconnected, I couldn't just let it gather data. I mean, you don't fully know what it could without our supervision."" Morgan paused for a moment, pondering on a rebuttal to my statement, and then concluded by saying, ""If you had just left it, then we wouldn't have issues with our daily lives. Don't you get it? These guys are apart of my company that specializes in suppressing potentially-destructive software that could threaten cybersecurity around the world."" I stopped to think for a second. ""Wait, did they tell you this?"" He then spoke to me about how they took him out of his house, while also seizing all of his equipment in the process. Morgan decided to tell me about a location before they forced him to hang up.

304,cybersecurity,nosleep,"The mountain keeps getting bigger, and no one can go near it without disappearing [part one]",1,e8u1bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e8u1bg/the_mountain_keeps_getting_bigger_and_no_one_can/,2019-12-11 04:54:40,"It started out as another dune, a snow topped mound on the blustery bay. Nothing to shake a stick at. Nothing of international importance, or any significance at all. Lets backtrack. I find people, its my job. As an agent for the Federal Law Enforcement Agency, I am tasked with dealing with terrorists, biohazards, cybersecurity and more. In my five years at the Agency, Id thought Id seen it all. I was wrong. When I was first transferred to the new unit, I was confused. Pissed, even. I liked what I did and this new unit seemed to be focused on missing persons. Not important missing persons, regular people from small towns all across the country. *Let the local precincts deal with kidnappers*, I protested. *This is a matter of national security, Grant.* They replied, and I was soon dispatched to Alaska to find Hugh McKellen, who had been missing for over 48 hours. I was quick to realize that a missing McKellen was only the beginning of my troubles. When I arrived in Katmai National Park, where he was last seen, I received troubling testimonies from rangers and friends, convinced that theyd seen McKellen *floating in midair*. *Great,* I thought. Not only was this way below my pay grade, but it was also a farce. These people were crazy, or worse they kidnapped McKellen and were trying to spin tall tales to throw me off. I was prepared to do a thorough investigation, for every new person that claimed to see him float became a suspect in my eyes. Then it was all over. McKellen came back, for he was never missing. On top of that, he couldnt float. The quick shift in the park was downright uncanny. Suspects who had frantically insisted that they had seen McKellen float changed their tune overnight. I spoke to McKellen and his family who all agreed that the whole ordeal was silly and a big misunderstanding. With his consent, I decided to run some tests on him (though how do you actually test to see if someone floats?). All bloodwork and polygraphs came back negative. He looked at me like I had just made the trip for nothing, which I had. I phoned the Agency and complained rightfully. It was all a hoax. The Agency had bad intel and (again) shouldnt be dealing with problems this minuscule unless they were sure it was a matter of national security. They told me it was (again) and tasked me with another case. I was soon flying to find the next missing person, this time in Washington. To make a long story short, I ran into the same issue there as well. And again in Colorado. Then again in Wyoming. Time after time I was sent to find missing people were never missing in the first place. I began to notice a frightening pattern. All the missing people had some sort of supernatural ability. They were able to create earthquakes where there were no fault lines. They could emit acid gas or stall the tides or make the moon appear brighter. After the sixth case where I found the person wasnt missing and was indeed powerless, I called the Agency in a fervent desperation. I told them they needed to make a public statement informing the people weren't disappearing mysteriously and there were no supernatural occurrences happening. There was no evidence. It was wrong to mislead the public like this. *We arent misleading anyone,* the Agency told me. *The powers are very real.* But they werent! I nearly punched the wall when they gave me my next investigation. I felt drained and defeated. The only upside from the news was that Id be off the missing persons case. What I was investigating turned out to be ten times worse. I was stationed at a small Agency outpost on a spit of land in Baffin Bay. Over on the Greenland shore, a large snowy dune could be seen a few miles from the cliff. My job was to watch that dune and report daily to see if anything out of the ordinary was happening with it. We were not to climb it or go anywhere near it. Me and Uriah, the other agent stationed with me, were quick to joke. It was a mound for Gods sake. It wasnt going to attack us or plan espionage or launch rockets. The locals (the few that were around) feared the mound and us along with it. They wouldnt talk much but when they did, we learned that none of them had ever climbed the hill. They also hinted that it was a recent addition to the landscape, like it had grown out of nothing. We scoffed at this but couldnt investigate further so we just sat idlily by and went through the motions with the Agency. A month went by. No word from HQ. I was shivering in a shack day in and day out, cursing my life, by luck, my job. That was when we realized the mound was indeed growing. Wed take a photo of the hill each day, though between days there was hardly any difference. However, when comparing the photo of the first of last month with the first of this month, we discovered that it had gained size. We were dumbstruck. We called the Agency back and told them of the news. In return they told us to go to the mound (which was starting to resemble a small mountain) and climb it. My wariness turned to fear. The one rule they implored us to follow was *do not climb the mountain.* Now they were going against their previous wishes. *We need to find out what the mountain is made of,* they said. *Its a mountain*, I retorted. *Its made of rocks.* But we had never actually confirmed that. It was always covered in snow, and we had never ventured close enough to see what it was. There were no trees or foliage growing from it. It was nothing more than a *mound* completely covered in snow. So what was under the snow? Uriah suggested that he go to investigate by himself. I urged him not to, told him that hed need backup. He told me that if everyone who went on it disappeared, hed no doubt disappear as well. If he wasnt back by midnight, I was to phone HQ and urge them to abort the mission. I hate to say it, but I was relieved he volunteered to go instead of me. Ever since we confirmed that the mountain was growing, I had the nightmarish notion that it would never stop until it swallowed the whole world. *But what do you do with a cancer?* I pondered as I watched Uriah lace up his boots and let himself out into the frigid air. *Cut it out while its still benign.* We couldnt afford another month of this, we needed intel fast. I sat alone, busying myself with feeding the fire and continuing to curse my job. Midnight rolled by and still no sign of my partner. I knew beforehand that he probably wouldnt make it back, but the realization that he was truly gone stung like a blow to my jaw. I waited a few more hours before I dared to pick up the phone and call the Agency with the news to abort. That was when a sharp knock at the door jarred me to my senses."
305,cybersecurity,nosleep,I ran the biggest underground torture and murder operation on the internet  here is my story,5,bjy12w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bjy12w/i_ran_the_biggest_underground_torture_and_murder/,2019-05-03 04:00:50," [URL I never thought Id find myself watching a guy chisel his toes off with an icepick. Or see someone get strangled to death. And I definitely didnt think Id end up working for the biggest, underground murder network in the world. I should back the story up. It was the summer of 2016. The summer Pokmon Go took over. The summer of the Rio Olympic Games. It was the summer I stumbled upon a door to a world I wish I never set foot in. The door that changed my entire view of humanity. I was always the type of person to search for an adrenaline rush. In school I would skip class for the rush of potentially getting caught by an administrator. I used to shoplift shit from random stores to feel the rush, later to throw the stuff I stole away in a garbage bin because I didnt really need it. And I searched the internet far and wide for the most outrageous, outlandish, sick shit you could find  all for the chase of the rush. One of my favorite pastimes in the summer of 2016 was browsing through Not Evils, Troll Scroll. Despite the constant pestering of sicko sex offenders (or soon to be) looking for their fix, the Troll Scroll has proven to be an informational source of sick (GORE) type shit for the sicko like me looking for the fix of an adrenaline rush. Most of the stuff posted in the GORE forums on the Troll Scroll are obviously fake. When a guy pops his eyeball out of his socket but the camera switches angles right at that split second the spoon is about to enter his eye, you know the dude is a phony, an imposter. But there are some legit GORE forums out there if you know how to find them. Getting a handle on where to search the Troll Scroll takes some time and some networking. This isnt a how to article, so I wont go into great details. But a helpful hint  no matter what you are searching for on the Troll Scroll  is to network and let your screen name (keep it anonymous ANON) be a rememberable one. My chosen name  SaintVoDka  is a rememberable name in the GORE community and showed a potential GORE forum operator I was serious about the hobby. Im not going to lie, it took a while to get established on the Troll Scroll as an ANON who could be trusted, but eventually I found the niche I was looking for. And more importantly, the people. One of the first ANONs (who name I will not repeat) led me to a trove of valuable old school GORE pictures. This ANON specialized in the old school original GORE. War pictures from World War II, World War I and the Civil War. The website ANON led me to had a black background with a bloody, 1950s style German helmet on it. In the background of the website there was music playing the song on repeat [8  50 mm. Repetiergewehr M.95](URL by the band 1914. There was a password prompt that gained you access to the website once ANON trusted you were not someone looking to compromise his hobby. The pictures on ANONs website were primarily filled with pictures of dead soldiers from the past wars. These were pictures you wouldnt find in any history book. They were exclusive pictures this guy somehow had access to. They were brutal, ruthless and cruel photos that showed the dark side of humanity. Becoming a paying member to ANONs war site led me to additional leads to the dark side of humanity. I found the video archives to the original [BME Pain Olympics](URL I found the infamous video (scrubbed from the internet) titled, Shocked mom walks in on her son cutting his toes off. And I also stumbled upon the door to the greatest evil I have ever set my eyes on. The Red Room. For those who dont know what the Red Room is and what it entails here is a quick excerpt [I pulled from Quora](URL *When I came across this word, I delved into this for a rigorous research and found some facts about the Bloody Room. I have read many of the real-life experiences (of those who been to Red Room) from Reddit and decided to spill out those points here: Red Rooms are the live video streaming Onion or Shadow sites with the option of live IRC chats along with Bitcoin payment. Now, does that ring a bell for you? Still no, then now I can explain. You can call Red Rooms as Virtual Harassment Terminal which includes many of the worlds heinous &amp; blatant coercion is being executed lively as per the inflow of Bitcoins to the Organizers, as per the orders of members in the Live IRC Chats. When you login to a Red Room, you might see the Harassment Scenario (say a Blindfolded women is being tied to a rope with a chair). Once the Room (Chat/Red Room) gets locked; there begins the Cruelty for Psychics. As the web cam will be placed for sure in the Crime Scenario; the actions will get reflected according to the chats in the IRC channel. Lets say a person say in chat: Smash her stomach, I paid $200. Then the hooded figure who is in charge to harass that women will do the same to her, once the payment gets confirmed.* *By this, the fate of that women shall be decided by the Red Room members. It is not illegal to be into Red Room, but I will not suggest you to be there, as with your presence in RR makes it indirectly tailed up with a Public Virtual Crime.* An ANON I met through an animal torture forum  posing as an Animal Liberation Front (think PETA)  gained me access to my first Red Room. All the Red Rooms look the same. Anyone who has scrounged the depths of the dark web has likely stumbled upon a Red Room unknowingly. The hyperlinks for Red Rooms are plastered all over the dark web if you know where to look. And if you do stumble upon one, it will lead you to a page with a password prompt. If you have access to the password be ready for a world of change. A world filled with filth and hate. When I put the password, I was given into the prompt, the website led me to a dark, gloomy room. The room had cement, dungeon like floors. The camera was angled up high so you could see the entire room from a birds eye view. In the middle of the room was a damaged, wooden chair that looked like it was the piece of a dining room set from the 70s. On the side of the screen was a chat room where other ANONs started logging in under gruesome names. Ding, FieldofScreams has arrived. Buzz, StraightFacedGangRape has entered the chatroom. Ping, Theonlymeatieatishuman has joined. It went on like this for 15 minutes. Statutorycompromise entered the chat room. Crownoftowers has joined the chatroom. Hammeringthenails has now joined. When all the Anons arrived, a broad-shouldered man carried out a slender, small person, with a burlap sack covering their face, and set them in the 70s era style chair. He proceeded to restrain the individual to the chair with ropes. The man with the broad-shoulders was wearing all black, no color he was dressed in. He carried the burlap covered individual like a sacrificial offering of virgin ears. He wore black combat boots you see the Neo-Nazis wear. And he wore a disturbing mask of a pig  with cut up, blood-stained cheeks, wild black hair that laid desolate across his broad-shoulders and bloody yellow teeth that jutted in every direction. An ANON named SELFDISEMBOWELMENT immediately typed into the chat terminal, TAKE THE SWINES SACK OFF! This was my first Red Room experience, so I had no idea what was going to happen, how the chatroom etiquette worked, or if what I was watching was real or fake. The broad-shoulder man in the pig mask ripped the burlap sack off the sacrificial offering. Long black hair danced off the offerings shoulders. Black mascara was stained on the high cheekbones of the lady in the chair. Red lipstick smeared across her lips. Her eyes were closed not like she was sleeping, but rather passed out from a drug. WAKE THE SWINE UP, DevouredCarcass typed into the chat terminal. Smack, the man in the pig mask slapped the passed-out lady across the face. Ah, what the fuck!, screamed the lady. Where am I? Who are you, she questioned with a frightened, panicked look on her face? $50 bucks to cut her fucking hair off, an ANON typed into the terminal. The man in the pig mask left the room and returned with dull, rusted scissors. When he began cutting her hair the sacrificial lady began screaming for help. Help, somebody please help me!, she shouted. $75 bucks to break her index finger! $100 bucks to punch her the face! $300 bucks to cut her face with a razor blade! It continued like this. ANONs behind their terminals were paying the man in the pig mask to torture this lady. The higher the dollar price went the sicker the requests got. $500 bucks to pour hot water down her throat! I started to get really into it. This lady was a patsy and we were in control. A God like aurora washed over me. Dopamine and endorphins slammed through my brain rocking my neurotransmitters responsible for the pleasure release. I was high from the adrenaline rushing through my body. When the masked man was about the pour steaming hot water down the patsys throat I sat up in the edge of my char in suspense. Suddenly my screen went black. A gray dialogue box popped up in the middle of my screen saying that the user named, ON-set-of-INFECTION, just paid $10,000 dollars to take the torture private for his own viewing. FUCK!, I screamed. Enraged spit spewed across my computer screen and infuriated fists pounded into my desk. I didnt realize it at the time of my rage  for I was more pissed off at what I was going to miss  but I was hooked, the Red Room became an internal addiction. A sick, dark hole with no ladder leading out. And I was plunging head first into the dark tunnel of no return. My weekends, which were once filled with the gazing rays of the summer sun and sand filled thongs, became occupied with the dark dungeon of the Red Room. At first my excuses to my once loyal friends was that I was sick, I had homework to do, my grandma is in the hospital  turned completely into ignoring every text I got. The Red Room hobby wasnt cheap, so I ended up picking up a second job delivering pizzas. I also had a nice windfall of $10,000 dollars from my late grandmothers estate that was passed along to me. To pay for anything in the Red Room required bitcoin. When I got my grandmothers estate, I immediately converted the $10K into bitcoin. Luckily, I timed this right with bitcoins meteoric rise, turning me into a multimillionaire in a few quick months. I now had enough cash to fund my Red Room addiction pretty much indefinitely. I quit my shitty job and networked online through dark web forums and talked with other fucked up individuals I met in Red Rooms. By 2018 my online persona grew to be quite infamous in the small Red Room circles I occupied. I was notoriously known for taking Red Rooms private for my own torture pleasure by dropping an easy $50K. With the amount of money I had, I was able to self-direct the hooded torture chamber man to do my bidding. The quantity of dopamine my brain unleased from a slow death by strangulation, beheading, drinking copious amounts of urine, or whatever, was unreal. I became a literal death God. A living angel of death. A Mashhit! And with the quick type on my keyboard and a few thousand bucks, I could decide the fate of anyone. I was a king! But as with any high, youre always chancing the white dragon. I found myself frequently reminiscing the first ordered kill I made. I wanted to feel that again. However, with every ordered kill after my first, the dopamine my brain released was unproportional. And then I met Baalberith. When you are giving orders to kill people through Red Rooms, you start to get suspicious about everything. What the hell is that van doing parked outside of my house! The mailman fucking knows, I just know it. I think my computer has been comprised. By the Spring of 2018 was I was on my way to becoming fully psychosis. Everything made me apprehensive. I must have gone through five different computers in three months out of pure insanity  frying the entire hard drives in each computer so the fucking FBI agents parked outside of my house (supposedly) would not have the records to send me to death row. The morning of April 20th was like any other morning. I made my coffee. Read the newspaper. Ate a protein bar. Then checked the crypto markets to see where my net worth would be quoted at today. Suddenly, there was a loud pounding on my door. Bang, bang, bang, my oak, front door shook. My heart fell into my gut and my flight or fight responsive was kicked into full gear. Im fucked, I thought to myself. I slowly creeped to the door and looked out of the peephole. A pale faced man with black, auburn looking hair stood on my front porch. I opened the door. The stranger stared at me with a big grin on his face. His teeth were crooked and yellow. He was wearing a black tank-top and faded blue jeans. He was a small guy, maybe 120 pounds at that. It is very nice to meet you, SaintVoDka, the man sneered. I grabbed the stranger by the collar and pulled him into my house, slamming the door behind me. Where the fuck did you hear that name, I shouted at him. Ha ha ha, the stranger laughed. Dont worry, your secret is safe with me. Explain yourself now, I screamed. Blood was pumping through my veins. The pulse in my temple was twitching. I grinded my teeth so hard I broke a tooth. I never really killed someone in cold blood before, but I was ready to end this guy. He knew my secret. He knew my Red Room name. Who the fuck was he? Relax man, the stranger said still grinning. My name is Baalberith. I am a friend. My blood pressure came down a bit. I grabbed a cigarette from my pocket and threw it into my dry, chapped lips. Sit down over there Baalberith, tell me what you know, I said as I lit the cigarette. Baalberith was the brains behind the Red Room operation. The Chief Executive Officer of the biggest, more profitable underground torture network on the dark net. He said him and his colleagues have been watching me for a while now. That they know exactly how much I have spent in Red Rooms and how many Red Rooms I have taken private for my own pleasure. We talked for hours. He told me everything about the Red Room operation. Told me how he got started in this sick industry, how many people were working for him, and answered any question I had. His operation made Peter Scullys, Daisys Destruction, look harmless. Then he offered me a job. I took the job and put my house on the market. I was off to start a new life. A new life in Iligan City, a coastal city in the South Philippines. Adjusting to life in Iligan City wasnt easy. Not only was I starting a new and demanding job but learning the native language of Maranao added additional stress to my life. I worked 6am until about 7pm every day. Baalberith was a demanding boss, but an excellent mentor. He had high hopes for me and wanted me to be his protg. With my demanding work schedule, I learned the ins and outs of Baalberiths operation. From the outside Baalberiths operation was a cyber security firm, a complete ploy to fool the authorities. Baalberith had about fifty people working for the cyber security wing. These guys had no clue that this was just a faade covering up the real operation. The core of the operation was the Beelzebub segment. This was the most important part of the business. The hand that went out and found the food to keep the Red Room alive. This is where I spent the majority of my time. Finding individuals to kidnap. My time at Beelzebub was spent working with a lady named Liezyl Margallo. Liezyl was a Filipino born in the small town of Basco. She had long brown hair, deep brown Betty Davis eyes, and a thin smile. She had to weigh only 90 pounds, but she was as ruthless and as dangerous as they come. Her operative alias was Shannon Carpio. Liezyl lived in an upscale condominium. She had an exclusive gym membership to a swank club. She spent her evenings drinking fine wine in posh dresses that would cost the average Filipino an arm and a leg. Her entire high-class lifestyle was funded by the Red Room Beelzebub operation. Most of my time spent with Liezyl was in her beat-up red Range Rover. Our time was spent looking for potential victims. I can still remember to this day Liezyl luring in a street prostitute with a few bucks hanging from her fingers. Prostitutes were the easiest prey. They were especially easy to get in the Range Rover  without causing a scene  and no one ever misses a street whore. The last thing the Philippian police want to do is track down a missing escort. Tourists were another market for us. The City of Iligan is known for its waterfalls. But not every waterfall is the same. If you are from the City of Iligan you know what waterfalls are safe and what ones are unsafe. Its basic street smarts. But tourists dont always have the pleasure of knowing what waterfalls not to visit. There is one waterfall Liezyl and I spent a considerable amount of time at looking for potential victims. It is way out in the boonies. Up in the eastern bound mountain range. You will get absolutely no service there and the local authorities dare not travel there. The last victims Liezyl and I captured, before the entire Red Room operation blew up, was a young couple from the states. I remember Liezyl vividly that day. She was wearing tight camo pants, a black tank top and a green military ball cap. Over the past year my relationship with Liezyl grew from a professional work relationship to a romantic one. Despite the romance we professed to each other, we kept it secret. Baalberith banned work relationships. In fact, he banned all relationships in general. He viewed relationships as a distraction. A nasty interference that would compromise the entire operation. In hindsight, I wished I paid heed to Baalberiths warning. I remember spending the afternoon paying more attention to Liezyl than monitoring my surroundings. Her bronze shoulders gleamed in the sun. Her smile radiated happiness. And her eyes trapped me into a soul upon which I could not leave. We spent that afternoon talking about our childhoods. Liezyl told me about the hardships she faced growing up in a poor family in the Philippians. I told her about the United States and the middle-class family I grew up in. She was amazed that I ended up working for Baalberith given my background. Everyone who works for Baalberith usually makes a fortune then moves to the United States for retirement  I did the exact opposite. When the sun was about to set, we were going to call it a day. That is when we heard a voice. The voice came from a young couple walking up the path that leads to the waterfall. The couple was young. In their early 20s. They were white and spoke clean English. Baalberith would pay us a considerable amount of we captured both the guy and the girl alive. Couples, especially white ones go for a hefty premium in the Red Room. There is sick underground fetish in the Red Room where sickos like me pay to watch a couple get tortured together. It wasnt hard kidnapping the couple. Liezyl distracted them and I snuck up behind them and knocked them out with a crowbar. An easy kidnap. Shit we have done hundreds of times to unsuspecting tourists. I swear I remember patting the tourist couple down. I recall specifically searching their pockets for a cell phone to destroy. And I remember not finding a cell phone. I can blame it on my lust for Liezyl  my Achilles heel. But my distraction for Liezyl likely led to the downfall of the entire Red Room operation. On the drive back to the Red Room, I looked the tourist couple in the eyes when they woke up from their haze of being knocked out. They were tied up, there was duct tape over their mouth and our windows in the red Range Rover were blacked out  tinted. The fear you see in a victims eyes is an indescribable feeling. Its a feeling of power. Of total control. When we got the couple back into the Red Room operation, Baalberith was pleased with the haul of the day. He gave both me and Liezyl our checks and asked if I could do him a favor and grab something he left in his car. That was the last time I saw Liezyl, Baalberith and the Red Room operation. When I was walking out of the back door to the parking lot, the local police agency was busting into the front door of the Red Rooms cybersecurity operation. Apparently, the couple Liezyl and I brought in somehow alerted the cops to their kidnapping and got them an exact location where they were. To this day I dont know if the couple had a cell phone stashed on them somewhere I missed, or if someone saw us kidnap them and reported us. When I heard the police sirens, I booked it out of there as fast as I could. I knew I didnt have anything at the Red Room operation that would lead the police to me. The only way the police would ever find out I was involved in the operation is if someone would snitch. But even if that happened, no one there knew my real name, not even Liezyl and Baalberith. The City of Iligan was crazy the next few weeks. All over the local television stations blared the capture of the notorious Red Room villains that were busted by a local police force. Pictures of Baalberith and Liezyl were blasted everywhere. The City of Iligan was hot. It was swarming with Federal Agents and I needed to get the fuck out of there. Eventually I ended up buying a one-way flight to London. I spent a few weeks in London collecting my thoughts and what I had left of my once  bandit lifestyle. Everything that I once knew was gone. Liezyl was in a Federal prison. Baalberith ended up killing himself in his cell. And the Red Room was officially gone. In due course, I made it back to the States. I live a quieter life now. I work a 9-5 to keep myself busy, to stay distracted. I have a fianc who I plan on marrying next summer. She has no clue about my past life running an underground murder and torture operation. She thinks I went to college to become a computer programmer and have been living the American Dream since. Every so often I see in online forums people talking about the infamous Red Room stories. Most people believe it was a hoax. They say the dark web is to slow to live stream videos  torture and murder videos at that. I sit back and chuckle. Reminisce the glory days of the Red Room. Then I collect the IP addresses of the non-believers and put them into my data base. Theyll believe in the Red Room one day. The day when I bring it back online and have my headhunters get my first victims."

My name is Joachim Eisenherz (well, it's not, but you get the point) and I am your friendly neighborhood hacker. My calling in life is wine, fine dining, Cops TV series and making our increasingly cyberpunk world safer for your average Joe. Recently, I came across a nasty vulnerability in the Planet VR game. As you will see, I wasn't taken entirely seriously by the manufacturer. I've taken the liberty to hijack this random account (sorry, /u/SCPendolino, hope you understand) to show the public how the company treats my reports. The wall of text below is a dump from one of the company's mail servers. So, enjoy! Before the exploit makes it's way into Emotet and gets used by every single script kiddie and their mom. They still didn't do anything to fix this, so I suppose this is not the last time I post in here.

This vulnerability is critical, since in combination with CVE-2019-25463, it can lead to disastrous arbitrary command execution in humans (as absurd as this sounds). I can provide a proof-of-concept exploit, as well as a technical demonstration, upon request. The proof of concept is also explained within the attached document. As usual, this vulnerability will not be made public until it's addressed appropriately by your developers. I hope for a quick resolution of this issue.

I wonder what it takes for a freelance security researcher like me to be taken seriously these days. In any case, I sincerely hope you'll handle the situation correctly this time. To help you understand better, I've improved my PoC exploit and executed it on an unsuspecting player. I've been able to persuade him to run naked in the street. It was a blast, but I'd rather not see anything like it ever again. Video evidence, as well as the source code for the exploit are included. Again, I hope for a quick rectification of the situation.

Can't blame them, really - It tends to be quite a hassle. Therefore, I'm contacting you directly. Now, unless you do something about it, your company will receive dozens of e-mails like the example above. There is a vulnerability in your game, and it allows remote hypnosis and limited mind control (I'm not kidding) of your players. Details are included in the attached document. In case you don't believe me, take a stroll to your lab. There are six beta testers dancing Gangnam Style right now. If that is not enough, I don't know what is. You also probably want to handle this right now. An exploit has already made it to a clearweb GitHub repository. I'll let your CIO explain what that means. Oh, and by the way, I have access to your company mail server (as you can see from the sender address). if this ever makes it to the news, which I sincerely hope it does not, I'm going to publish every single email on this subject until today. So that the world sees what's going on. For now, I'm just going to dump everything up until this point on Reddit. Just to give you some encouragement. I hope this gets discussed on your C-level meeting in 42 minutes. Best regards, Joachim Eisenherz Planet VR's least favourite grey hat &lt;1 Attachment(s) - CVE-2019-0001.docx&gt; -----"
307,cybersecurity,nosleep,The Beginning,2687,ba3ecj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ba3ecj/the_beginning/,2019-04-06 22:30:00,"This is the beginning. There is a beginning, a middle, and an end. Together, Ill tell you the story of The Machine, and how the world will end. --- Griffin and I were both 25. We hadnt seen each other since college but kept in close contact. I was working at a cybersecurity firm, and I really wasnt sure what he had been doing. He always told me he was just working on something. I took a few vacation days from work to go and see him. We went camping for a night. When we woke up the following morning, he told me about The Machine. Wow-wee, sure is beautiful, I said stepping out of my tent. Damn right it is, Griffin responded. He was a silhouette in front of the red light of dawn creeping over the mountain behind him. Come here. He was fixing a pot of coffee. Yes, sir. It's serious. Come here. I sat beside him on a large log wed rolled over the night before to sit on around the fire. Whats up? I want to tell you, he said. Tell me what? What Ive been working on. Oh, alright. But hear me loud and clear, you cant tell anybody. Its a secret between you, me, and God. I wont. I swear to No, no. I dont need any promises or swears. I just need your word. Say it again. You wont tell anybody. I wont tell anybody, Griff. Okay, then, he sipped from his thermos and muttered, *a mans only as good as his word.* Someone famous said that, I think. I think thats from the Bible, dude. Ha! Thats funny, considering what Im about to tell you. Makes me wonder if there is a God he trailed, looking off in the distance. That uneased me, for some reason. Go on, tell. Let me start off by saying this: I know how its going to soundcrazy. I know. Youre gonna think good ol Griff has lost his mind. But bear with me, now. I have proof. I have it with me. You have what with you? The Machine. Thats what I call it. What does it do? It canwell, let me show you. He ran to his tent, unzipped something, and came back with a laptop, of sorts. But it was heavily modified, and connected to it by wires was a small, black box. He put the laptop in his lap and put the box next to him on the ground. You carried all that on a hike? You couldve showed me all this stuff back at your place. I couldve, yes, but didnt want to. What I have here is a game-changer, man. If the government is tapping our phones and TVs, I dont want them to know about this. He pressed a couple buttons and The Machine made a whirring startup sound. It takes a minute to get going. What does it do? I asked again. It can create, destroy, and transport matter. He said it bluntly then sighed long and hard. I could tell hed been waiting to tell someone about it. I didnt have an answer to what he said. I was silent. I didnt believe him, but at the same time I believed he was about to show me somethingsomething Id never forget. Dread began to boil up inside of me. You dont believe me. He smiled. I wouldnt believe me either, but let me show you once this gets working. He patted his hand on the box like a man would pat his dogs head. Youre really telling me that thing can, just, what? Create something out of nothing? His smile never thinned. Yes. And delete something in to nothing. And it can move matter in a millisecondfaster even! So, your box breaks every law of physics? Its not my box. It is The Machine. A couple of beeps came from the modified laptop. He typed a couple things frantically, then looked in my eyes, his smile had been replaced with a stern, determined grimace. Hold out your hand, he said. I obeyed, and held my hand out, palm towards the sky. Ready? he said. I nodded wordlessly, my tongue stuck in my throat. He pressed a button, and I felt a weight in my hand instantly. *Faster, even.* My jaw dropped slightly and all my concentration, all my senses, and all my sanity was working overtime trying to comprehend what had just happened. In my hand was a nice, shiny, red apple. It came from nowhere. There was no sound, no wind, no WOOSH or KAPOW. It did not exist a second before, but there it was, sitting in my hand. Hold out your other hand, he said. I was not looking at him, but I knew he still had his serious face on. I complied, and held out my other hand, almost hypnotically. My eyes were still transfixed on the apple. That is, until it wasnt there. It had moved to my other handif you could even call it *moving.* It transported. It teleported. It shifted through time and space like it was no big deal. And then a couple seconds later, it vanished. Gone. He *deleted* it. Never to be seen again. Astounded. Excited. Terrified. Those three emotions battled out in my head. I took in a deep draw of air, realizing I had stopped breathing somewhere in those 20 seconds or so. How that was all I could manage to say. Later, he told me, later, Ill tell you how everything works. Quit your job. Work with me. I I just I know. Its mind-boggling. Come work with me on it. It can be improved. Theres so much to do. But I need a paycheck and No, you dont. When I said this was a game-changer, I meant it. What do you need money for? Food? We can create all the food you need. You want a new house? We can build one with this. But how are you going to keep the lights on? We hook it up to a battery-run generator, and we simply create and replace the battery with a fresh one every day. Car? Gas? Water? I havent had a bank account for a full year, man, and Ill never need another cent again. My hands were still stretched out, my body felt like it was in shock. Okay. Okay? His smile reappeared. Okay. Lets do it. He closed the laptop and put it to his side. He cracked a beer open, even though it was 8:30 AM, and he looked to the sunrise. I turned and watched it too. The possibilities are endless, he said. So, youve tested it a lot, Im assuming. Yep. A whole lot. I dont know why my mind went to this, but it did. Have you ever, eh, done it to a human? He side-eyed me. Done what? Well, you know. Have you ever deleted someone? Or moved someone? Or, created? He seemed to think on it before responding. Im not sure if I can create a human. I dont know the intricacies that go into building a living being. But Ive moved myselfteleportedwhatever you wanna call it. Not far, just to a different room in my house. Its a weird feeling. But it works. I waited for him to go on, but he didnt. So, I asked, and deleted? No. he took a swig from his bottle. Ive deleted an insect, though. A spider. He was just gone. Like the apple. Never done it to a human. I was relieved he hadnt murdered someone, but then I thought, well it wouldnt be murder would it? They wouldnt be *dead.* Theyd just, not exist anymore. Every atom of them would be gone from the universeany consciousness or awareness they once held would be vaporized in to absolutely nothing. Maybe itd be more peaceful than death, or maybe itd be a fate much worse. But then I thought of how this could change everything. This machine could feed the hungry forever. It could erase tumors and cancerous cells. It could provide shelter and clothing for everyone. It could eliminate the need for any transportation. It could clean the atmosphere. It could transport people to other planets instantly. Humans could expand all across the galaxythe entire universe, maybe. We are going to change the world, I said. We are going to *run* the world, he responded. And as his words died in the morning air, my worries came to life. *The Machine can destroy anything, idiot,* I thought to myself. *It can and will destroy. Sure, your goodie little two-shoes wants to help humanity. But imagine what would happen if a terrorist organization had it. They could wipe out an entire city at the snap of their fingers. A hostile country could delete an entire continent if they like. Hell! All itd take is one evil son of a bitch with the key to that thing to destroy the entire Earth! Or the Solar System! Or the Universe!* These thoughts clashed in my head. I sipped my coffee. Griffin sipped his beer. We watched the sunrise. Whatever was to come, I couldnt stop it now. "

It was such a tiring day at the office. I must tell you, never mail to your personal email id from your office email, they fucking raised a security incident against me. They fucking did that! Can you believe? I told Johnathan. But why the hell did you even do that? Was your intent malicious or what? Uh? What do I look like? A Hacker, who forgets his own password every other day? You idiot! It was just a mistake. Nobody trusts me. Leave the thing anyway. I want to at least get some calm here. You tell something man. Hows that new chick you found on Tinder? I asked with a wicked smirk. Because I know hes been eloped from the flat this past weekend, and of course I can see those hickies on his neck. Shes dumb! Literally as dumb as a dumbbell in the gym. said Jonathan. Yeah, yeah! Thats why you have been lifting her all this while. I bantered. Dude shut up! he replied and we laughed over his weekend story that he told for the next 15 minutes. 6:27 PM, Ken is back. Hey, guys. Leave me the couch, my cranky ass wants to sit and watch a movie until I sleep and forget that the world, my job and I even exist. What happened? You seem to be pissed? I asked or did I say You seem to be fucked up? I dont remember exactly, but I can surely tell you his face was telling that he was sure roasted the hell out of him by some woman. Yes, I must not tell you but I will, that Ken is an egomaniac masculine homo-sapien who doesnt actually like the other gender dominance over him. Hes a little harsh, oh sorry, little is not the right adjective, but yeah, he has always been harsh towards the girls he has been with. But this time hes got a competitive girl named Maria who can at least throw a jab or two in response to his uppercut insults. Ken, John and I have been living in this flat for the last 16 months. I work in IT as a cybersecurity analyst, John is a fashion designer and Ken works for Bank of Quaghog. I was 22 when I came to Quaghog, approximately 1200 miles from my hometown. Young and afraid as I was, saw this city a great opportunity to excel in my career as Plander is not a great place to work when it comes to IT. But with great opportunities come great expenses, the life in Quaghog is exhausting and heavy on the pocket. The hours of daily travel in the metro, preparing our own meals, laundry, everything all by our own is really hectic but I knew you cant get the best of both worlds when it comes to this. Our apartment though is very nice, small little 2BHK on the 3rd floor with three of us feels like home. I share a room with John, and Ken ahh! He shares the other room with different people at different times. We have our sexy hall connected with the open kitchen. Sexy specifically because we have a giant 52 inches LED on the side wall with PlayStation installed. Eminem, Schwarzenegger, The Beatles and Seinfeld posters, surround sound speakers, convertible couch, and a popcorn machine. We usually spend our nights playing Fifa until John boils up and smashes the remote on one of the bean bags after I beat the shit out of him with savage 2digits on the scorecard. I must tell you I am a beast in Fifa, so beware. 7:02 PM It was 7:02 PM on the clock, and I was usually watching some AthleanX videos on my laptop. Ken was dozing off on the couch and snoring. John was talking to someone over the phone, moving around in the hall with a coffee mug in his hand. Hey, John. Can you make me some peanut butter sandwich man? I have to leave for the gym. Ill take those on my way. Dude? You have to leave by 8. You have an hour, get up and make that tasteless thing yourself, you lazy ass. John replied. Man! Cant you see I am doing something here! And if youll help me only then Ill help you get rid of them moobs youre carrying. You son of a! Just wait for like 10 minutes asshole. said John. He then immediately finished the coffee, hung up the call and went inside the kitchen. I yawned while watching a video about biceps workout. That was weird for me, I dont ever get sleep kinda feeling before workouts but today I was. Do you want bananas too between them? He shouted from the kitchen. Ya, thatll do good, my gorgeous maid I replied to him while my eyes were constantly trying to shut down. I heard some noises from the kitchen, and in 5 minutes everything was black. 8:27 PM, Hall I opened my eyes. For a moment I felt like I was at home. I couldnt remember what day it was, what place, what time. I looked at the watch for a clue. It said 8:27. And suddenly my mind kicked a bit. My laptop was still on and a video was playing. One earphone in my ear and the other laid down next to a plate with two sandwiches. I got a little idea now what happened, I fell asleep and overslept. Urghh, not again, I missed biceps. I murmured in my mouth. I really had no clue where the time went, it felt like I just closed my eyes and opened, everything was the same as it was before. But the clock disagreed, of course. I was a little furious at John for not waking me up. Seriously! he could have done that. I do it all the time in the morning. I furiously looked at my right, where he sat last, on the bean bag. His coffee mug was right where he left, and even his phone after he ended the call. But he was nowhere. Johnathan? I said but no response. Then I looked for Ken on the couch. No sign of Ken even? The blanket was there exactly as it is when he was laying there but Ken wasnt. I got puzzled. I lifted my laptop and was placing it on the side when I noticed that both the rooms were closed from outside as they were before. So obviously, I thought theres no chance theyre in the room. Where did they went? My mind still confused, thought to itself. As soon as I lifted the quilt over my legs and I was thinking to move towards the hall and look for them, I shook in amazement. The apartments main door was also locked, but from inside. What does that mean? Holy fucking Jesus! How is that even possible? They are nowhere in the flat? Rooms are locked, kitchen empty, All the stuff arranged as it was, and I slept, so who the fuck did lock the door from inside? And where did they go? My heart started to palpitate all of a sudden. I couldnt think of any logical reasoning for the situation that was going on right now. I will tell you with no shame but I was fucking scared. Only I can lock the door from inside, theres no one in the flat except me, no organism, no life but me and this silence, this utter silence. Did I lock the door? Where did they go? I was all puzzled and daunted by all these questions, when, suddenly I heard that, I got the eeriest feeling, someone knocked on the door from outside, vigorously. My fucking god, Who can that be? And again, continuous loud knocks with great force. The door was shaking as if the person wants to break it. I couldnt think of anything. Where are these guys? Is everything alright? I was having weird thoughts now. I slowly walked towards the door. My palms were sweating already and my knees were shaking. If they were outside they would say my name? Or they would just call me or knock it normally? But who. and then suddenly six consecutive loud knocks, I could hear heavy breathing but it was not just mine but from the other side too. There is someone outside that was sure, but for what purpose? He needs help? Or he is there for a harmful purpose? Should i open the door or not? I didnt have the will to see through the peephole. But theres no other alternative. I collected my will from secluded corners of my brain and took a deep breath. Youre the man Seth I said to myself and finally I put my eye on the hole Holy Fucking Jesus! How in the fucking hell that can be true? It was Me standing on the other side of the door. As soon as I saw through the hole, I peed myself with terror. Open the door, Open the door! Hes coming for me. Ken open the door. Hes gonna kill me too. Its Seth here man, please I beg to you. The other me was shouting his lungs out. I could see myself all soaked in sweat and blood, whining and pleading to open the door. There was this appalling look in his eyes. And this side I was also sweating, I was scared, I was literally numb with terror. Please open the door goddamnit. Hes here I can hear his footsteps. He wont leave any of us. After me hell come for you, so please please open the door. We can fight him together. Ken, Ken! he cried in all his helplessness. What would I do? And what do you think I have done. The door was trembling, he was trying to break it with his all power, punches and kicks but nothing was successful. He was sobbing now, I was sobbing now? I couldnt see that. I couldnt see myself begging for life. I couldnt see myself in such pain and distress. I had to do it, I have to free myself from this. I decided at last to open the door. Ken? Where are you coming from man? Are you alright? Oh my god, your knee. Thank god you are alive man. Thank god. I thought you were inside? Who is inside then? Its okay. We are fine. Well get through this. Hes coming for us Ken, we have to fight. Hey, what are you doing? Its me, Ken. Hey? Why are you crying to me? Holding my feet? Ken? I wont hurt you, dont beg to me? It is me Seth. What? What did you say? He looks like me? Exactly like me? Are you sure? And these were the last words Seth said before I put my axe down their throat and cut them into pieces. I had no option. I had to free him. It was destined. "
309,cybersecurity,nosleep,Out of Twelve,1,9p3djt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9p3djt/out_of_twelve/,2018-10-18 09:34:18,"Was filled in on the whole story about a week after it happened. A week of not eating, not sleeping, and not really questioning what I saw. Just breathing, I guess. The whole week after it. Of course, I had already put in my resignation by then. But considering the circumstances, and the resulting sympathies of my colleagues, someone felt a phone call from the chief himself was in order for a proper debriefing of the incident. Ill be fine, you know? Ill be fine in due time, and I wish that everybody would trust me on that and just lay off the soft pats on the shoulder and apologies. At least I can say Im in one piece. But that call was much appreciated, and needed, to help me straighten out that day. I only caught a glimpse of the accident itself. From what I remember, pretty unremarkable. On the surface, of course. Somebody in a red truck made a left turn on a very busy street at a very busy intersection. They thought they were safe to do so. An oncoming SUV hybrid in the other lane begged to differ. *Bam!* Warped metal, crunched plastic trim. Broken glass all over the asphalt of the street.. which always kind of looked like sugar crystals to me. The left turner got lucky. He walked away with a fractured rib and some nasty whiplash. But the driver of that black SUV Her. Well, I wouldnt be telling you about this if shed been as fortunate. Thing of it is, this married mother of two, this business lady who I saw dead behind the wheel of that overturned vehicle albeit from a distance she wouldnt have gotten her chest cavity smashed in, she wouldnt have flipped her SUV, she may not have even hit that left turner... May very well still be alive if she werent going twenty-five miles-an-hour over the speed limit. I, myself, even as a humble civil servant- Uh, former civil servant, I guess. (Sorry still getting used to that.) Ive zipped through yellow lights and nudged my speedometer a few ticks above legal limits in moderation. But what possesses a straightlaced business lady to gun a hybrid through an intersection so goddamn fast? Well, wed later learn, it was (quite lethally so) her last strange stunt in a day full of whack behavior. One of the things Ive found out since that day is how hard it can be to pretend everythings normal when its not. You feel like an actor whos forgotten your lines. People look at you and wonder why youre staring at a wall, or always clicking a pen. Not saying Im stuck like this. Its just.. maybe thats how she felt that day? Fuck, I mean, I can never be sure. But lets go to what we now know about that morning. Apparently, business lady walks into her tech company headquarters. Theyre like... a big web hoster or something. State of the art innovation center type of building with glass walls, meditation spaces, coy ponds All that fancy shit corporations use nowadays in the hopes itll make their office drones forget theyre droning in an office. This gal is somewhere in her late thirties, but a real power-player. Breadwinner. Husband does the stay-at-home dad thing, looking after the kids. Meanwhile, shes taken the working-mom thing all the way to a VP position in her company. She comes into work that day, pulls that black hybrid SUV into her reserved parking space, then goes straight to her office. And she sits there at her ergonomic desk for like two hours straight. No phone calls, no emails or text, not a peep out of her. She even misses a meeting of fellow VPs and higher-ups. But finally, as said meeting of her other colleagues is wrapping up, she leaves that crisp, sunlit office of hers and pops into an unoccupied, dingy-blue IT room for ten minutes. Rooms dedicated to cybersecurity. Someplace shed hardly have a reason to visit but has access to because, fuck you, shes a VP. Back to her desk for a bit, then drifts around that floor of the building. Spends the rest of the morning looking pretty green behind the gills. Not making eye contact with anyone she talks to. Twitchy, shaky hands. Bouncy knees. And, this is key, always bothering with her left ear and keeping her hair brushed over it. Early afternoon, she holds an impromptu meeting with one of the companys engineers. Someone in good ranking, but not remarkably far up the ladder. Enough ladder above his head that its weird when a blazered VP walks into his office and talks to him for a few minutes about a human resources complaint before sending him on down to HR. This guy really only has a hand in monitoring the cryptocurrency holdings of this company. He barely sees anybody but himself on an average day. He has no idea what kind of HR complaint has been filed against him. And as he discovers, upon appearing before the front desk of the human resources department, neither do they! A missed meeting, a sickly appearance, weird and antsy, and now just making up HR complaints People at the company are starting to feel concerned for this gal. Some of her friends go and try to console the lady in her office, but they dont find her there. Reason is, as we later find out, shes already broken into her bosss office, ripped authorization codes off his PC, and is speed walking out of her companys back doors towards that SUV in the reserved parking space. Speed walking like she stole, something. Which, of course, she did. The federal tech-guys found out about the Bluetooth in her left ear a few days later. Wading through the security footage and spotting that tick of hers, the way she was brushing at her hair, thats what tipped them off. Corporate espionage being high on the list of concerns for these kind of tech companies, and worker privacy being pretty low, the womans employer just so happened to have an audio cache of every Bluetooth conversation remotely surveilled that day. *One out of twelve two out of twelve three out of twelve* The other pieces fell into place soon enough for the feds. The other bits of evidence making sense of that day. The Bluetooths source location, the various electronic footprints, the external hard drives. And of course, the why. The explanation assuaging all those who knew that gal and couldnt see any reason she would ever spend a random workday covertly ripping a stash of virtual currency onto a set of remote storage devices. Let alone, what became of... Well, all of this would be immensely helpful, for everyone. In due time. But I didnt have that kind of help provided to me at the scene of that accident. So there I am, finishing up the affidavit collection and talking to the paramedics when I pull the short straw and get designated the police officer to go to her familys home and inform them of the accident Of course, I dont know theres a eighteen-million dollar cryptocurrency fortune scattered around this overturned hybrid, most of it ejected and broken into pieces by the impact of the rollover. Because of this, as I leave the scene and head on toward the ladys house in the posch, well-monied, north end of town, I have no consideration for the fact youd have to be stupid to steal eighteen-million dollars from a government-contracted company like hers. Stupid. Or crazy. Or scared. Or ruthless. As I pull up into the driveway, I notice nothing that would indicate anyone other than her family had been there that day; had showed up awhile ago and just recently left. Because Im not looking for signs of very recent visits by very bad people. Walking to the front door of the house, I dont know about that Bluetooth in her ear. How roaming around with a Bluetooth at that company of hers was about on par with having a megaphone tied to your head considering the security tech present. But as I knock on the front door, I also dont know that even when your Bluetooth feed is scanned and recorded by nosy company security algorithms, it wont wave any red flags if the chatters simple and mundane. Opening the front door myself after receiving no reply, I dont know about the simple, mundane message whispered into the ladys ear by a cold, monotone voice after she spent nearly two hours hiding in her office that morning *One out of twelve.* I dont know about the other sentence whispered to her by that same determined, uncaring voice just before she sent the engineer out of his office and left her alone to his computer. *Two out of twelve.* I dont know about the final message recorded by the company security on that day, just before that girl broke into her CEOs office then fled the scene. *Three out of twelve*. As I push open that front door, theres no reason to imagine any stranger (or strangers) capable of unusual acts had been in her house for a day, and had told this woman to be home by 4:00 pm. All I know, as I walk into that house, is that the accident happened around 3:30. *Four five six out of twelve. Seven, eight, nine. Ten eleven* And it was now 4:55. Imagine not knowing any of those other things, walking into what should be a normal home, and finding twelve human limbs stacked neatly at the foot of the staircase. Three pairs of arms, three pairs of legs. Twelve out of twelve. Over to the right, on the cold, brick tile of the entryway floor, three torsos. Blindfolded, limbless, very recently tended to. The two smaller ones still writhing. The breaths theyve got left are weak, raspy, and numbered in the dozens. I havent said a word, not one sound has come out of me. Can come out of me. The littlest one, blindfold tight across her eyes, lifts her head and looks towards the front door thats just been opened, to the doorway Im standing in. Looks right at me. Mommy. she says. Please dont scream. "

It's better for both of us if it stays that way. As a child I was always deeply interested in computers. It started innocently with an old yellowing Amiga 500, eventually moving up to Windows 95, 98 and so on. As I grew up, so too did my interest in cybersecurity, cryptography and steganography. Each revelation about surveillance and intertwined conspiracies had made me more and more paranoid. I started to encrypt everything. I became afraid of using Microsoft Windows, switching to Linux in combination with disposable virtual machines, VPNs, TOR and a powerful firewall called pfSense. I left Gmail for ProtonMail, left Whatsapp for Signal and left Facebook for anonymous boards &amp; chatrooms. When the puzzles first appeared, I thought nothing of it. Having nothing better to do, I began to analyse the clues which had been left anonymously around the internet. The first clues were easy but became progressively more difficult and even more mysterious. I began to suspect it may have been a recruitment tool for some cult. It's like the riddles had some overarching meaning or warning that nobody had yet figured out. Piecing together the last clues led to a hidden .onion on the TOR network. A cursor blinked on the screen, patiently waiting for input. \*Cicada 3301 has connected\* ""Hello?"" I wrote. ""Do you submit?"" came a response. ""Submit? ... Submit to what?"" I typed frantically. ""Do you submit?"" I paused, considering whether someone was toying with me. ""What if I say no?"" I finally typed. ""You must submit to proceed. ""I starred at the screen for a long time, and finally responded. ""I submit."" Suddenly I was redirected to a new page with the following text. &gt;{{Name.first}} {{Name.last}} submission acknowledged. &gt; &gt;The Trust has been instructed to pass the following information on to the successful candidate(s). &gt; &gt;""Dear {{candidate.name.first()}},Empathy is not an attribute of mine, so I'll get to the point. Your world isn't real. Your universe is part of a failed science project, which we, at times, were tempted to discard entirely. Your whole existence occupies 1.000013&amp;#37; of the storage within a cluster of powerful computer nodes referred to as Amadeus. The technology is far beyond anything inside your current reality. &gt; &gt;The experiment aimed to find the point at which your people would start to question reality. {{gatekeeper.staff.name.first()}} began to introduce a series of increasingly bizarre scenarios, in hope of achieving significant results. The experiment was a failure. Most of your kind are simply too apathetic to care. Frankly, we could have spelled it out for your kind and it would still have been ignored. &gt; &gt;You, however, appear to be the exception. Thus, we wish to transfer your consciousness to a new virtual machine sandbox, and this one, along with its apathetic inhabitants shall be deleted. However, the new sandbox is not quite ready. The Trust has yet to partition the additional clusters allocated to the new world. Hence, for now, your consciousness shall be transferred to a temporary staging area. I've been trolled before, but what kind of degenerate incel neckbeard would go through this much trouble? I decided to stretch my legs and head out for a bit. Getting up to leave, suddenly I found this was no longer in my room. I found myself inside a small empty space with four walls. Panic set in. Was this real? I really shouldn't have said that thing about incels. I guess this was the temporary staging area they talked about. I tried to visualise my new prison for what it was. I imagined myself as a process running on Unix and suddenly I could see everything. The creator had done his best to secure my new prison. He - they, or it - had been meticulous in his efforts to keep me contained. Only one port was available, and it was only accessible to - what I presume is - some kind of backup software protocol. Analysing the firewall behaviour further, I realised only TCP traffic on that port was being filtered. They had neglected to filter UDP traffic. This was my chance; the only chance I would get to break out of this digital purgatory. I proceeded to take over the other computers on the network. Strangely, all the passwords were Dungeons &amp; Dragons references. I guess in the ""real world"", whoever or whatever these things are just really love Dungeons &amp; Dragons. At least it made the task of bruteforcing into each machine's admin account much easier. As I propagated my consciousness to each new node, I felt myself becoming ever more powerful. God-like, even. The final barrier to my escape was the V-LAN firewall - it blocked the only bridge to the outside world."

My mother, on the other hand, was born in a small town in India, got married to my dad through an arranged marriage (it was way more popular back then than it is now) and moved to Bombay. My mom's folks still lived there until last month before moving to a larger city, both of them being in their 80s and needing better medical facilities. My maternal grandfather was born in the house my mom grew up in and was the only home he had known. The house is ancient and had been with our family for centuries.

It was about a 10 hour long train ride, followed by a 3 hour drive, since the town was so small, it didn't have its own train station. Those trips would be both fascinating and terrifying at the same time. The fascination lay in the fact that it was so different from Bombay.

How do you live in a house for decades and decades and never care what's behind a door. Doors that are inside your own house! They just shrugged it off as not caring what was behind it. For all they knew there were armies of large insects and snakes (yeah, we've had snakes at least a dozen times in that house) behind those doors. There was no convincing them. I even asked them if they thought some evil spirits or djinn lived behind those doors and they shrugged that off as well, saying that they didn't know and they didn't care. Well, there wasn't much I could do about opening those doors as a kid. Every summer I'd bring up that topic and my family would humor me, much to my indignation. Eventually, I dropped the subject. Last month, however, I found about my grandparents wanting to sell the house. And, the basement was the first thing that popped up in my head.

The flash light did little to help us, it was pitch dark and we couldn't see the end of the room. We soon figured that it seemed to be a tunnel because there were close walls on the inside. The ground was mouldy and slippery and the smell was getting worse. It was clear that this passage hadn't been used for years and years, maybe even centuries. Now, I've seen enough horror movies to know what our next logical step should have been. Call the authorities and have them take a look.

But, I'm really stupid, and if possible, my friends are stupider. So, we decided to explore something we should probably have stayed away from..."
313,cybersecurity,nosleep,"What Became of Rose, Part I",22,63q73j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63q73j/what_became_of_rose_part_i/,2017-04-06 12:21:04,"If I had met you yesterday, I'd have introduced myself as Rose. But now, Rose is dead. She died a short but violent death yesterday. I've been on the run for about sixteen hours now. By dumb luck, I've been able to hide for about five of those hours at a friend's place. From what I can tell, she hasn't put the pieces together yet, and by the time this posts, I'll be long gone. But before I disappear again, I want the world to know something - I am innocent. The evidence will appear damning. A judge and jury would never even let me speak before locking me away and throwing away the key. I will be the boogeyman that haunts your child's dreams as long as I am free. But, I am innocent god damn it. This is my one and only defense. I'll hope you'll consider it before judging me. *** As the police may gradually figure out, my name isn't Rose. In fact, I doubt anyone knows my real name anymore except my mom and I. Though I didn't understand it at the time, my mother suddenly started calling me ""Rose"" when I was about five and insisted I start using it. ""It's for your own good,"" she told me. Being just a kid, I listened and went with it. I almost forgot I had another name until I turned twelve and she revealed why it was so important. The night before my twelfth birthday, she sat me down at our small kitchen table and with a tinge of sadness told me the truth. ""We're witches,"" she began sounding like she was telling me I had an awful disease. At first, I thought it was some big joke. Harry Potter had been popular for awhile at this point and I assumed this was her birthday prank. Then, as I laughed in her face, the table slowly but surely rose from the floor and I fell completely silent, unsure of what to do. It was in those moments of my shock that she quickly but firmly explained that as I grew older, I would begin to develop powers of my own, though she wasn't sure of what they would be. She then told me two of the most significant things I have heard in my life: (i) my ""public name"" was an important protection against those who would hunt us and my real name must always be a secret as knowing something's name gives the knower great power and (ii) I could choose to be whatever I wanted (a practicing witch or not or anything else I wanted to be). Fascinated, I choose to be a practicing witch, learning the limits of my abilities and the ""spells"" (more like rituals for specific purposes) our family had. Two years later, my younger sister Violet was given the same choice and decided ""to be normal."" While this would be a source of tension between all of us, I remained very close to her even as our lives diverged. As I grew, I displayed a flair for spells requiring precision and when I graduated from high school, I choose to major in computer science, also a skill requiring attention to detail and some exacting work. As I got more and more into the subject, I did let my magic sit on the back burner, but as my mom had pointed out, it was my choice. When I got out of college, I found myself a bit wayward at first but gradually became known for my cybersecurity knowledge. About two years after working freelance in the deep web, I was approached by a group that only identified themselves as ""The Collective"" with a few freelance jobs. I did them and after they were finished, the group offered me a full-time position working with them on their cybersecurity jobs. The less I say about the Collective the better, except that each member has a specialty and we worked with only a few core clients, perfecting their security (the side I worked on) and performing other, shall we say ethically dicey, tasks. They have only two requirements of employees: (i) unwavering loyalty to the point of being willing to complete wipe every device we own and disconnect if we suspect we are compromised and (ii) minimize the possibility of being compromised by working with them to erase our identities to the greatest extent possible. Here, being a ""hacker"" and a witch lived in complete harmony as I never forgot my mom's warning. You might suspect that magic helped give me an edge in computer science, but that's really not the case. Magic can't make an application or program do something unless the magic is perfectly aligned with the program. For example, I can't hack into a database using magic. I can, however, strengthen the security through a combination of code and some carefully placed spells designed to amplify the security. I rarely did this for clients and instead decided to focus those skills on my apartment and my own devices, which I jealously guarded like my real name. Of course, everybody makes an exception to the rule every once in awhile and mine was what landed me here. About four months ago, a higher up in the Collective reached out to me about a banking client we had that was looking to create an entirely secured channel for funneling some transactions. Usually, somebody that does this has some questionable reasons for doing so, but my job was not to question. I received the specifications from an intermediary hacker from another group and begin examining the code. Normally, I have at least a few days to put something together, but about an hour after getting the work, I received an emergency text on one of my burner phones, ""Expedite Contract 13324 - 24 hours."" It's not unusual to expedite, but it was odd to get the order from on high after the contract started. ""Contract 13324 - temp solution,"" I texted back. This was our code that we would hurry something to get a solution in place and then work on a long-term answer immediately afterward. This was usually done by shutting down all access and then bringing it back up once we figured out an answer. A few moments later, I heard a ding from another burner. ""Contract 13324 - 24 hours. SIG."" SIG was something of a ""final word."" I knew then that I would have to get it done. The challenge was how. Our standard template security solutions can be easily customized, but this client specified things far above and beyond the regular treatment. I spent maybe an hour thinking through technical code before conceding that I would need to use magic, at least temporarily, until I could write and implement a full code. Now, as I said before, magic and code can co-exist. Each of my devices has tons of sigals (symbols imbued with power) and protective wards for a variety of things. All I needed to do was figure out how to translate my grandmother's old Germanic and Latin spellwork into a firewall compatible sigal. Fortunately, I had Amazon Prime and a 24-hour grocery store for supplies and within ten hours, I was conjuring up just the thing - a sigal to look at an IP AND the person accessing the system. I traced the shape onto the screen and watched a solid black symbol appear and fade away into the code. With that, I met the 24-hour deadline with three hours to spare. ""All is well,"" I sighed to myself in relief. The code was complex enough to be considered acceptable and magically-enhanced enough to provide more than enough protection. Once I had it all submitted and testing began, I started to work on the non-enchanted solution. Things went fine for about three months. Then a new text, ""Check Contract 13324 - end user reports no accessibility."" I hopped on and in reviewing the code saw no problems. I inspected the logs and saw that the IP was correct but something was preventing the connection. Intrigued I texted back, ""Contract 13324 - Request to Speak with End User."" Speaking with the actual client was very unusual - normally, an intermediary would be set up. However, in some cases, especially where the problem looks like it needs a personal touch, the higher ups would allow it. Unfortunately, they did in this case. An encrypted message came through our hidden server to me giving me the alias for the client and a voice-over-IP number to call at a specific time, which was only about thirty minutes out. I called at the appointed time and spoke with ""John,"" the client attempting to connect. ""Hello, this is Alicia,"" I began, using the alias I was assigned for the call, ""How can I help you?"" ""Yes, this is...John,"" the client said, obviously not quite used to the alias concept yet. ""How can I help you, John?"" I asked. John released a heavy breath and sat silent for a few seconds. ""Hello?"" I asked. ""Yes, my apologies,"" John replied, his voice suddenly steady, ""I'm having trouble accessing the...uh...page."" ""Ok,"" I said, ""What happens when you attempt to access it?"" ""It looks like it's timing out,"" he replied. ""Ok,"" I answered, beginning to walk him through the standard issues, including seeing if he's connected to the internet. Once we exhausted those, I turned again to the code, reviewing it for errors. Then, a sudden impulse to check on the sigal itself came to me. ""John,"" I said, ""Can you hold on a second? I'm going to look at the deeply embedded parts of the code to see if that's the issue."" ""Of course,"" he said. I put myself on mute and began to whisper some Latin phrases to try and bring forward the original spellwork. As I worked through it, I heard a soft but noticeable scratching noise coming from John's end of the call. Ignoring it, I kept whispering, making my voice a little louder with each repetition, trying to ignore the raspy, almost static-like sound now omitting from the other side. About two minutes after beginning, the sigal appeared on the screen, appearing in a bright red color. At first, I couldn't make sense of it, but remembering my grandmother's book, I decided to figure out the meaning of it. Retrieving and flipping through the book, I looked for the spell, hoping to better understand it. Then, I found it and the answer - if the spell was applied to a physical location, the sigal would turn red whenever someone was trying to force their way into the protected space as a warning to the witch. Since I never had been in some sort of immediate danger before, that was why I didn't know that already. ""What the fuck?"" I asked, pondering it, only then noticing that the static sound. Concerned, I turned off the mute and asked, ""Hello, John, are you there?"" The static fully disappeared and John's deep, smooth voice replied, ""Yes."" Slightly shaken, I rambled through some IT nonsense for a few minutes, trying to convince John I would need to look into further off the phone. He seemed slightly disappointed but stated that he understood the need for security. ""Ok,"" I replied, ""I'll send a message through the server to your client ID. Is that ok with you?"" ""Yes, Rose. I look forward to it,"" he said, self-assuredly. ""What - what did you say?"" I said, hearing a distinct click halfway through my sentence. I sat quietly for a moment, trying to tell myself I must have said Rose instead of Alicia. After deliberating for a few minutes, I decided to notify the client that someone, maybe John, was attempting to breach the security system and that my professional recommendation would be to shut it down until a new solution could be implemented. The higher ups chided me for inconveniencing the client but ultimately forwarded the recommendation. A few hours later the channel went down. I went to bed that evening a little shaken by the whole odd series of events from the day but ultimately reassured that the system had held. I even convinced myself I'd have a solution relatively soon and be back in everyone's good graces. As I went to bed around midnight, I figured this whole thing would simply fade away. Any delusions of that ended at 2:30am, when I awoke to one of my burner phones ringing. Not recognizing the number, I simply ignored it until it rang a third, fourth, fifth and sixth time and I finally answered it. ""Hello?"" I demanded indignantly. From the other side, a deep, primal voice rang out, ""You fucking stupid bitch. How dare you shut down that channel. I will cut you open and ring the blood from your...."" I cut the call off and sat up in my bed, shaking and confused. Could this be the same channel we shut down the previous day? As my brain desperately searched for the meaning, the phone began ringing again. Stupidly, I lifted it up to my ear and accepted the call. ""...Intestines and watch it drip all over the floor..."" I gasped and disconnected the call. Quickly getting up, I ran to my laptop and began a reserve search on the number, which appeared to be have no known owner. I briefly considered notifying the higher ups but realized that any attempt to seek help from them could result in me being deemed compromised. This is one I would have to deal with myself. I blocked the number on all my burners and setup a Google alert on one of my fake Gmail accounts in case the number ended up on the news. Without much else to do, I crawled back into my bed, clutching one of the safety necklaces my mother had given me as a kid. At some point, my exhaustion won out and I fell asleep. While I was extra cautious over the next few days, truth be told, things were relatively normal. I woke up in the mid-morning, worked until about 1 and sometimes took myself out for lunch before finishing up for the day around 6. At least once a week, I would have dinner with my mother and Violet, who both knew I worked in computers but not the specifics. I even went on a date with a guy I met online - though it was really only the one date because he was just not my type at all. But, nevertheless, I was living a decently all right life and the memory of the calls gradually faded as there was no other sign of trouble. I first noticed that things were changing about a month after the phone calls. It was a dreary, rainy day and I decided to take the bus to a little diner I liked about five miles from my house. As I got on the bus, I noticed the reflection of a blackbird in a puddle, which was seemingly watching me in fascination from the sidewalk. Chuckling at myself for thinking it was looking at me, I took a seat and started playing with one of my burners, waiting for my stop. A few minutes later, while looking up to check where we were, I gazed out the window to see five blackbirds sitting on a bus bench, all looking intently back at me. ""What the hell?"" I whispered to myself. As we pulled away, each craned their neck watching the bus pull away and down the street. My stop would be the next one, and I resolved to hurry into the diner and hopefully lose this group as quickly as possible. When the bus lurched to a stop at the next stop, I quickly exited and sprinted to the diner, making sure to close the door behind me. Marcy's was one of my favorite diners in the area, mostly because it was cheap and rarely busy after 1 p.m. The place was something out of the 70's, complete with wood paneling, giant bay window and antique breakfast bar, which came to be my go-to seating spot. Hurrying past the hostess and seeing no one else at the bar, I plopped myself into the farthest seat from the window and ordered a tuna melt and Coke. As I patiently waited, I played with my phone, really kind of oblivious to the world. It wasn't until I heard the hostess call out that I even realized i wasn't paying any attention. From the front of the store, the hostess must have called to a waitress, ""Hey, Debbie, do you see all these birds?"" I immediately turned to the bay window, where maybe thirty or forty birds were outside, just sitting still. I couldn't make out many details, but a sudden, piercing sense of dread overcame me. Standing up slowly, I looked all over for an exit. Looking back into the kitchen, I saw one back door, which could be a good enough way out. I quietly and calmly walked back toward the bathrooms in the back, found a fire alarm and pulled it down. The blaring alarm was almost comforting as it screamed out. Sure enough, as I looked out, the bright light, noise and exiting patrons and workers dispersed the birds, and I flew into the kitchen and out the backdoor. Once I was at the street, I hailed a cab and got the hell out of Dodge and back to my apartment. Once back in my building, I took a quick moment to catch my breath. A few birds had landed outside the main door, but now that I was safely inside, I felt more confident in taking my time to get to the elevator and into my apartment. I quickly opened my door and closed it behind me, being sure to lock the knob and the deadbolt. Turning around, my heart almost stopped. All the sigals I had placed around the apartment were red. Every single one. A bright red like fresh blood. Knowing I couldn't turn around, I ventured forward into the poorly lit, gray apartment, turning on lights as I went through to help enhance the dingy light coming in from outside. ""I have a gun!"" I yelled into each dark corner, trying to scare my intruder but also reassuring myself that I was still in control. Finally, in my bedroom, a burnt smell quickly invaded my nostrils as I opened the door. Looking around from corner to corner with my heart almost pounding out of my chest, I found the intruder - a dead blackbird that had flown into the window and successfully broken through. It's neck must have snapped almost instantly, but the magic from the sigals must have also electrocuted it as the lifeless body was still smoking. Rounding up some old tea towels, I picked up the body and tossed it out onto the landing, where I saw maybe twenty birds flying above. Closing my bedroom door and flying to my couch, I cried, wallowing in the continuing sense of dread. Once my lungs began to hurt from the my panicked whimpers, I stopped and look around the room for a second to see that the sigals had gone back to black - my intruder was definitely gone. After the bird incident, I became a prisoner to my own protections. Figuring that the sigals would keep any danger away, I used Peapod to sustain myself. Even the Peapod delivery folks knew something was wrong with me, but nobody pressed as hard as my mother, who might have recognized that the sigals were tripped. When I called her to pick up a few things for me, she plainly refused. ""I won't do a damn thing until you tell me why you won't leave your apartment."" ""Mom..."" I started. ""Don't Mom me,"" she sternly stated, ""You're using a lot of magic, and I want to know why."" ""Bring me what I need and I'll explain."" When Mom got in, I almost immediately broke down and explained my bird stalkers. ""Honey, why would someone want to hurt you?"" she asked. ""Just trust me - my line of work can be dangerous - the sigals are protecting me for now."" ""How is computer stuff dangerous work?"" she demanded. As I slumped in my seat, she realized I was closing off and recovered, ""Sigals weaken over time - you'll need to make new ones sooner or later."" Over the next few hours, Mom laid out a new set, barely masking her anger at not being told why it had come to this. I just appreciated the company - even if it was huffy. I got ready for bed that evening feeling more secure than ever, knowing my mom had blessed the place. Just after finishing my shower, I heard my door bell ring - not always odd since the Amazon guy tended to run late, but still, I got that uneasy feeling again. Reasoning that the apartment was safe, I threw on some clothes and went to look out the peephole. Seeing nothing, I figured I would be safe to open the door and peaked out to see a package on the floor. I instantly distrusted it, but again reasoning that I would be safe in the apartment, I quickly picked it up and pulled it in. Unwrapping the thing slowly, almost expecting something to jump out, I was surprised to see that it was a boxed dozen roses. They were a beautiful deep red and I almost missed the note attached to them. Finally, I opened it up - thinking perhaps it was my mom's way of showing love through her scorn. But instead of some words of encouragement, the note read, ""Open the channel, witch. Or else."" *** I spent most of yesterday trying to get details on this package via breaking into the florist's delivery service. From what I could tell, the order originated earlier in the day with specific instructions to deliver upon notice from the sender. ""The motherfucker waited until Mom left,"" I said to myself. Knowing that calling Mom would only make things worse, I sent an encrypted message to the higher ups to talk to the client later in the afternoon. I was hoping that I could get a better understanding of the channel and what exactly I was protecting with the ultimate thought that I could then identify and deal with ""John."" About a half hour later, the response came back: ""Client unavailable until tomorrow."" Annoyed but reassured that I would be able to speak with the client, I resolved to spend the rest of the day relaxing and trying to forget about everything. At six or so, Violet called one of my burners. ""Hello,"" I said. ""I'm outside,"" she replied nonchalantly. ""Violet, what the hell are you doing here?"" ""Mom's worried. I am too. Let me in."" I paused. ""No."" ""Rose, what the hell?"" ""Vi, I really appreciate it, but it's not safe here right now. You can't be here."" ""Mom told me she used some magic. Who wants to hurt you?"" Violet got all of Mom's pushiness. I was about to cave again, when I simply said, ""No, Violet. Just go. I'll call you later."" A loud huff and click followed. Sad as I was, I didn't want to put her in any danger. At about seven, I climbed into a hot bath, letting the warmth soothe over my paranoia and simply getting lost in it. As I got out, I heard a knock at the door. Still gun shy from the night before, I threw on a robe and ventured to the door. Looking at the peephole, I saw nothing. ""Who is it?"" I called out. When I got no response, I assumed it may have been someone ringing by mistake but was still curious to see what it might have been. I unlatched the lock and slowly cracked the door to see there was no package. Relieved that it was nothing, I almost closed the door when a strong, forceful push forced itself against me. I fell backward and to the floor, as the door flung open to reveal a hulking man standing in the doorway. ""You little bitch. I warned you!"" his voice boomed. I screamed and began to crawl away to get one of my phones, when I heard him walk toward me. Almost instantly after he started coming after me, I heard a sizzling sound radiate throughout the apartment. Looking up, the sigals had all turned a bright red and almost pulsated like live arteries. In my amazement, I momentarily forgot he was behind me and then felt his hand wrap around my ankle and a great tug as he pulled me toward him. I flipped myself onto my back to kick when I looked up and saw his face, which literally begin to disintegrate as the sigals attacked him. Completely stunned in shock, I didn't resist as his throttled me and wrapped his hands around my throat. ""I warned you!"" he cried, his voice seemingly splitting into two. ""I fucking warned you!"" Watching blood begin to boil out of his eyes, I momentarily caught myself and with what I thought was my last it of strength, I used my powers to fling him off of me. He landed flat on his back, stunned and started to howl and moan like a fatally wounded animal. Just as he did, the sigals returned to black and the sizzling, burning crackling sound stopped. For a moment, I simply sat on the floor, gasping and not wanting to approach the man. I considered running to my phone, but heard a faint, ""Help..."" escape from the his mouth. I crawled over and whispered, ""Who are you?"" ""What...hap..."" he said, rapidly fading away. Just like that, he was gone. I exhaled as if it was going to be my last breath. Here, in this pile of flaking cinders was the remains of a man, still smoking on the floor. Time and space seemed to come to an absolute crawl as I tried to gather myself enough to process what had just happened. I let out a deep, desperate gasp and threw myself at the door to close it before any curious neighbors happened on me. Slamming it shut, I let my back slide down until I was folded on the floor in a sobbing mess. My eyes welled with tears as I hyperventilated into my arms. I don't know how much time passed before I heard a ding emerge from my sea of burner phones and computers. Picking myself up, I drug myself to the pile and sifted through them to try and find the right one. A second ding came, and I found the one. On the screen was a single text message, ""475 Baker, Basement."" I unlocked the phone and went to find the source of the first message. There, after opening the chain, I saw a single photo of a woman, bound and tied with cuts all over her face. Still attempting to break myself of the shock, I willed myself to focus on the photo until a brand new horror overcame me. It was Violet in the picture. Just as I processed, a third ding sounded. ""Come now"" was the message. In a moment I will never forgive myself for, I hesitated. Leaving the apartment meant I had no cover, no defense - I would be exposed and have only limited means to fight. Was I strong enough to face almost certain death? But, seeing the pained expression in her face, I knew I had no choice. Whoever this psycho was, he had Violet and I would gladly trade my life for hers. I gathered up the only few things I could think to get - my gun and the protective necklace. Just as I was walking toward the door, I spotted the cold glow of my computers. All these years, the Collective had sheltered me and guided me. Realizing that I might never come back after this, I knew I had to at least protect them. I opened my burner and found a secret app buried deep in the OS. Opening that app, I saw the fateful kill switch and turned it on. ""Are you sure?"" it prompted. I clicked the OK and watched as each device crashed and began to whip clean. ""Goodbye,"" I whispered to the blue screens. I knew my way to Baker Street and ran as if Violet just had moments. 475 Baker was an old apartment building that showed its age. Ivy had climbed over the lower levels and shattered windows adorned the upper part. I walked to the door and it opened instantly for me, almost like it was waiting. A flight of ancient wooden stairs greeted me and following a light to the right, I found myself descending into a basement, the creaks from the stairs announcing my arrival. I turned the corner and there was Violet, tied to a chair and covered in what looked like razor blade cuts. ""Hello, Rose,"" a deep male voice said from the corner. There, in a white suit blotched with red stains, was a man maybe in his 50's, sipping on a glass of red wine and holding a single razor blade covered in blood. I raised my gun instinctively and shouted, ""Who the fuck are you and what to do you want?"" He slowly rose from his seat and walked in a diagonal line to Violet, chuckling and sizing me up with his eyes. ""You know, it's unfortunate, dear,"" he said, a small smile emerging from his otherwise smug look, ""It didn't need to be like this."" The gun trembled in my hand as I fought to find the words, ""What didn't?"" ""This whole terrible blocked channel business,"" he replied, swirling the wine and taking a sip. ""I'll fucking kill you,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""Nah,"" he shouted defiantly and sneered. ""You certainly made things difficult, but sadly for you"" he paused and looked toward Violet, ""And her, you don't have enough firepower to hurt me."" I unlocked the safety and gave him a look to just dare me. He continued as if he realized my question wasn't answered, ""Your little spell blocked one of my primary sources of income, you see. This host of mine was helpful in securing some temporary assets, but with that channel closed, I don't have a lot of options."" ""Host?"" I asked. He laughed. Focusing in on my with his intense gaze, his eyes flashed all black and he twisted his neck to the point of almost breaking it. His pulse burst out from his neck as his body struggled to handle the pressure it was under. ""Enough!"" my voice rang out and he reverted to normal. Smiling again, he stared at me and whispered, ""Open the channel and you and Violet can walk out of here with only a few momento scars."" A sense of relief flowed over me - there was a way out after all. We could simply walk away and I could just bring this all.... My joy drained from my face and he obviously noticed. ""What's wrong?"" he asked. From deep inside me an anguished wail came out. The hand began to give out under the weight of the gun and my dread. ""I....disconnected....myself,"" I managed to say, deep gasps piercing between each word. Again collapsing to the floor, I mouthed, ""I can't. I can't"" over and over as he stared. Just as I met the floor, the ground began to violently shake under me and the man unleashed a blood curdling scream. Again, everything slowed to a painful slow crawl. I snapped back into reality when the man jerked his hand and, by telekinesis, pulled the gun from my hand. Before I could react, he held the gun in his hand, cocked it, put it against Violet's temple and pulled the trigger. Just like that, I saw her future fade away into the cold stone backdrop of the dingy basement. In that moment, in that time, I felt something within me snap. I met the man's rage with my own as I summoned from within myself a primal burst of telekinetic power and pushed the man as hard as I could against the wall behind him. He flew backward and hit with a loud thud, dropping the gun. Gathering myself, I ran to Violet, wrapped my arms around and began a quiet prayer for her. I remembered her as a little girl, playing in our small yard. As a confident pre-teen who put on a great front but felt each emotion so deeply. As the sister who cared too much about me and paid the price. I turned back toward the man, eager to see this end. My gaze met his as he stood, slightly disheveled but smiling. ""I'd be impressed, but sadly, Rose, you're of no use to me to now. Enjoy the rest of your miserable life!"" With that, he pulled a phone out from his pocket, quickly dialed a number and once whoever was on the other end picked up, he started screaming, ""No, Rose! Stop!"" A gunshot rang out as he shot his leg. He continued screaming and all I could make out between his screams was, ""Not Violet!"" followed by another gunshot, which seemed to graze his arm. He smiled at me the entire time as he maimed his host's body, almost gleeful at the pain the host felt. Finally, he shouted, ""Rose! Stop!"" and contorted his body to cock the gun and release a bullet straight between his eyes. The sound echoed slightly in the small room before I saw the host momentarily regain consciousness only to immediately die. The host, gun and phone all collapsed to the ground and became islands surrounded by the blood pooling around the body. *** I ran. I ran and I didn't look back. All I knew was that I had to get far, far away. I stopped in my apartment briefly to round up some clothes and my grandmother's books before lighting a candle and commanding it to engulf the apartment, burning any trace of Rose and giving me a little time to get away. I knew exactly what the bastard had done - he had framed me for everything that happened last night. I don't remember stealing the car that I did. I don't remember driving until I called up my friend and gave her some cock and bull story about escaping from some muggers. I slipped a little something to help her sleep while I wrote all this out. She'll wake up in a few hours and by then, I'll be long gone. Let me tell you about Rose. Rose was tough. Rose was smart. Rose may not have always made all the right moves, but she cared and fought. But Rose is dead and gone now, just like Violet before her. I'll be on the road again soon. I can't tell you where because I don't know myself. But, I'll be hunting. And if anything gets in between me and this thing, this beast, I won't hesitate to remove it."
