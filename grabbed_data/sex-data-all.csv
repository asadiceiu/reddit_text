0,vulnerability,sex,How important is sex in a long term relationship? Should I loose my virginity to my boyfriend? Not sure if ready?,1,i3ikio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/i3ikio/how_important_is_sex_in_a_long_term_relationship/,2020-08-04 22:38:54,"I am a 19yr old female virgin dating for 10 months a 22yr old male who is well experienced. Him and I get on great, we met on bumble and were like best friends have so much in common (both type 1 diabetics) and hes a very sweet caring guy with a big heart, very sympathetic and a good listener to my complaints. But recently hes brought up that he wants to be having sex as he sees it as an important aspect to a relationship, even though Ive said Im not ready and wont be for a while. (Weve has our fair share of make outs, grinding n feel ups, he likes to suck my nipples and I always feel him get a boner when were making out. Now ok there is one part of me that wants to be careful n responsible about sex. In that I definitely dont want to in the slightest get pregnant. I dont like how I might be judged by friends n (religious) family. But also for my own religious up brining, my own guilt and how I would be going against a relationship n faith tradition that I so important to me. I also want to make sure Im being valued for who I am n dont want to get hurt. We havent said even I love you yet, and hes not as affectionate n romantic as I would like him to be(I feel like I have settled a lot in this relationship) and hes also slightly hinted that he would break up with me if he has to wait more than another 6 months. So most people would say I should just breakup with him for kinda pressuring me alone. We also only see eachother one a week if that, he lives 30 mins away and we both have jobs. Id be scared for my own emotional vulnerability of being away from him (not a very good texter) But on the other hand I also kinda really want to have sex, Im a quite horny type of person. I am familiar and confident in my body, and how it finds pleasure. And I think Itd be fun enjoyable time! And from what weve done so far i think hed be pretty good! I also see how it would benefit the relationship adding in a further field of intimacy. A lot of posts on here just say go for it! And like yeah I agree I can understand sex to be such a fun adventure with your body. But I just cant get over the seriousness of the con list. And Im scared that one day Ill get caught up in my hornyness and just say fuck me! And wed do it and I have horrible regrets. How important is sex in a relationship? How would our relationship change?! Would it be a bad idea to tell him Im not having sex with you until you give me a serious commitment or say I love you? Is it bad or a turn off if I say that if he wants to have sex he has to step up more ie. flowers, romantic date ideas?! I really like him and having him in my life I thought I even loved him but his recent attitude got me questioning how I really feel. And now I just have conflicting sex ideas?!? HELLLPPPP!!"
1,vulnerability,sex,"After 22 years of trying, I hate sex",1,i4w4ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/i4w4ko/after_22_years_of_trying_i_hate_sex/,2020-08-07 03:30:30,"No, im not asexual. But lately ive been wanting to be celibate. Its not like ive ever been raped. Ive never really been assaulted besides a few slaps on the ass. One time a man even recorded me in public but I dont feel traumatized. I was chubby from a young (still am). &amp; on the internet from a young age. not a good combo. I remember the first time I took off my shirt on omegle. I was not of age. It felt wrong, but the attention felt good. I began to seek out older and older guys, because in my head, nobody my age could possibly be attracted to my body. Only dirty old men could find me attractive. Then i met a 25 year old. We exchanged skypes. He seemed nice. He was nice. In fact, had I not gotten older and realized he was probably a p*dophile I wouldnt have changed this opinion. but because he was a p*dophile I know now he didnt find me attractive, but found grooming me enticing. A guy from my highschool my age reached out to me. Ive later learned he had a fat fetish, revoking any pride I had of his attraction to me. We sent nudes and it was fun. It ended, because he got a girlfriend. 5 years later in my early twenties he tells me he still had them and will post them if I dont sleep with him. He saved my ugliest photos. I didnt feel attractive anymore. I got a boyfriend at 16. I was excited. but he rushed me, so many times. I dont think he was mean. But he slapped me on the face once after kissing me, something hed seen from porn. I had cried 30 min earlier. I felt degraded. When i lost my virginity to him, he was angry at the fact I couldnt get wet. All of my clothes were on. He left right after he came and made fun of me the rest of the day. We never had sex again. I had another hookup. Ghosted a week later. I had another boyfriend. It seemed like I could finally have a chance. It started out good, but he rushed me too. very much. Then he tried to eat me out when I begged him not to. Then he told me it grossed him out. He tried to put his dick in me once without me asking. The pain is indescribable. He tried to apologize but I still feel violated. I dont want to be angry at him but I dont know how to feel. I trembled when he took my clothes off. the first time he made me feel good. Then he told me he thought I was fat. told me how much more attractive porn stars amd girls he knew were. I know i was too big to him. He liked really skinny girls, &amp; im a curvier hourglass shape. I just wanted to feel cherished and small. He also got mad when we couldnt have sex. My vagina wont open. Its sharp pain. I cant have sex. We broke up and he told me how sexually unsatisfying I was. I tried my best. I tried really really hard. I got him off as much as i could, where he wanted me to get myself off for him so he could watch. Im single. I avoid intimate relationships now. every time i go on r/sex I cry. Lately i get panic attacks every night. Im too ugly to refuse sex if its offered, i should be grateful. But I cant do it. I cant. I sit in my bed alone and cry, mouthing to myself I cant do it. Im too ugly to cry though, i dont deserve to be upset. I was never raped. I was just insecure. Sex to me is abandonment, shame, pain. Failed vulnerability. I try to look for good guys. I fail. But I dont think its them anymore, i dont think im worthy. I cant have sex. I cant do it. The patience that would be required of a partner of mine would never be worth what ever little else I have to offer. I would cry so many times. Id be such a burden. I flinch at being touched. I would fail. In my normal life im not actually ugly. many people tell me im pretty. I get plenty of matches on dating apps when I bring myself to use them. Im curvier than I am fat. Im bubbly and intelligent and nice and busy. I dress femininely but stylish. I seem confident. Ive even been told I seem like I have a lot of sex. But im just leading people on. Nobody looks for a seemingly happy girl to be met with this mess. So i avoid dating to avoid sex. I cant do it. I dont know if ever will. I just wanted intimacy. After crying and trying for so many years I think i finally give up."
2,vulnerability,sex,"Disability &amp; Sexuality Part II: Sex, Dating, &amp; Partnerships",1,i5ve0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/i5ve0i/disability_sexuality_part_ii_sex_dating/,2020-08-08 17:53:21,"So my last post on the intersection of disability and sexuality had a ton of interaction, Im going take that as its a really well received topic, and needs expansion, so here I am again, and Id like to open the discussion on how it impacts our dating and sex lives. I find it to be a mixed bag. I have written another post on how there is limited support for disabled women in particular to find satisfaction in their sex lives. On the other hand, it has perhaps had a part in how adventurous I am. You should see my drawer: I am truly the woman who has everything. However, Ive found many spaces in my community literally inaccessible. From navigating the impossibility tightly packed throngs of pride goers, to a local kink group found via fetlife, where I had attempted to sign up for an introductory rope bondage class only to be met with multiple flights of stairs, even after verifying with the event organizers, as with life in general, I face barriers within my own sexuality. I believe this is a byproduct of a society that views disabled people as largely asexual. With regard to dating, I find it a bit more dismal. I think the sentiment is echoed by 20 something women everywhere, but I do think that disability definitely amplifies the experience. Im treated as something of a novelty: Ive had first dates ask me (in the middle of a coffeehouse no less) if I could have sex. Ive also unintentionally met fetishists who say things like Ive always wanted to fuck a girl in a wheelchair. When I ask about that, it seems the interest is generally underscored with ideas of my perceived vulnerability and/or helplessness. As a side note if thats your jam, I dont mean to discount it. Do you. I find it a bit uncomfortable personally, that other people may be turned on by how easily they suppose they could harm me, to the point that theyd publicly voice it to a near-stranger. Aside from that, I already feel as though people often dont recognize me as a person separate of my wheelchair, Id rather not deal with that from a partner. Ive also encountered the other end of things, where its treated as something that devalues and dehumanizes me. Too often Ive dated men (especially) who do the bare minimum, and should I address it, Im met with the attitude that I should take what I can get. Theres this attitude that I am damaged, and therefore disposable. Its toxic. Ive also been told that they cant handle me. Im a woman, not a zoo animal. Im a bit perplexed by this. There is nothing to handle. Im educated, Im a woman in STEM, I have no debt, Im independent, I have my own apartment, my own friends, my own life. Aside from a permanent condition, Im in good health, I work out, I take care of myself. At risk of sounding somewhere between I am woman, hear me roar &amp; having my head up my own ass: the life Ive built for myself is impressive for any 22 year old, and look at what Ive accomplished with major roadblocks. Id love to hear from other disabled women on how you navigate these aspects of your life."
3,vulnerability,sex,My partner &amp; I have polar opposite sexual expectations and it upsets him,1,i63nay,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/i63nay/my_partner_i_have_polar_opposite_sexual/,2020-08-09 04:03:20,"There's a lot to unpack here, and it's getting to a point where I just need to hear from a 3rd party. I (25F) have been dating my partner (26M) for 10 months now. For me in the past, it didn't matter who I was with, I always varied who I thought about during masturbation. Be that a past partner, someone I know but haven't had sex with (but want to), or even just a faceless partner (usually if I'm reading erotica and can't get a good visionary). I rarely, if ever, think about current partners when touching myself. That's how it's always been for me. A couple of months ago, I made the mistake of bringing it up to my current partner, wondering who he thinks of when he masturbates. We're in a relationship, not dead, and I always figured my thinking was normal (especially since others do it too). But for him, he thinks about me when he masturbates, consistently. With his past partners, he'd masturbate to the partner at the time. That's just how he is. So for him, he's hurt that I rarely think of him whenever I try to get off. We've already been struggling in our sex lives due to a number of reasons, the biggest ones being because we still live with our parents and the anxiety kills the mood for me, I don't physically lust over him, and our relationship had a rocky start. I am the kind of person that believes in communicating everything, and he is too. If there's a problem, it's brought up and talked out. But one of us always ends up getting hurt from this, especially if it's sexually related. My partner was the first to notice that my drive wasn't as high as I said it was when we first started talking. I told him it's hard to be turned on when my dad is in the next room - anxiety. But he kept egging at it. He felt insecure, that I wasn't physically attracted to him &amp; that I was making up lies as to why my drive is lower than advertised, thinking it's that I'm turned off by him. I'm not turned off by him in the slightest, though. It's that his physical features aren't why I want to have sex with him. I don't see him naked and think ""fuck me daddy"" I think ""this is the man I love."" It's the man he is, his personality and our relationship, that turns me on. For once in my life, my heart leads the sex, not my vagina. I've tried to explain this in the past, but he's really upset that his body isn't the reason I want to have sex with him. He's told me that he wants me to lust over his body as a reason why I want to have sex with him, and he feels insecure that it's not. It's a huge point of vulnerability for him that he's turned on by my body and thinks of me while he masturbates, but I'm not/don't. And I really don't know what to do to help soothe his insecurities, without him fretting that I'm putting on an act to make him feel better. I'd love to encourage for the both of us to see a couple's/sex therapist, but he's very much anti-therapist... Is there something I'm not seeing here? All I see is ""different strokes for different folks,"" but he's seeing that I don't want him. What can I do better to meet him in the middle?"

This is the year, 22! Fuck, 23. Im so scared to have sex that Im scared to date. I dont date. And if the chance comes up, I push it away immediately. I literally have dreams where I keep making excuses for having sex. Its not sex specifically, but all the other stuff. Someone knowing you, vulnerability and whatever. Ive spoken to mental health professionals but they never seem to take it seriously. Whats most frustrating it doesnt match with who I am, if that makes sense. Im knowledgeable, feminist and sex positive, except that in front of friends Im embarrassed because I dont want to have the whole, yeah I havent had sex conversation. Having sex isnt the top of my priority list and Im not obsessing about it. My life is full in other ways, but Im worried its not that I dont care about it but its that Im terrified. Looking for advice and anyone with a similar experience?"
5,vulnerability,sex,I love eating pussy,1,i6rt2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/i6rt2j/i_love_eating_pussy/,2020-08-10 07:41:57,"First I have to admit that I may be pretty thirsty right now, as Im currently single and havent had sex since last November. However, I was inspired by the I love giving head post and wanted to express myself here. I LOVE eating pussy. I love the whole process, from slowly working my way down my partners body, lightly teasing her thighs with my tongue. I love the smell. I love the vulnerability and intimacy of having my lips and tongue playing with and exploring all the folds, tastes, and textures. I love finding a steady rhythm, sucking or licking her clit, feeling and hearing her pleasure slowly build. I feel like a lot of guys might look at going down on a woman as a chore or mere foreplay. But I feel like it can be the main event. I have found it to be an incredibly intimate and rewarding experience. I have the confidence now to say I am good at eating pussy. I dont always last long with PIV sex but I know I can always rely on oral sex to give my partner an orgasm. Sometimes it feels like a superpower. Anyway, to all the apprehensive pussy-eaters out there, I encourage you to eat more pussy, take your time, find enjoyment in giving your partner pleasure, and pro tip: if its working, do NOT stop doing it."
6,vulnerability,sex,"Post-sex thoughts and reflections ! Best sex ever, but still a sense of emptiness that comes along with hooking up",1,ibds38,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ibds38/postsex_thoughts_and_reflections_best_sex_ever/,2020-08-17 23:05:53,"Family, we have to convene and I would love to hear everyones thoughts in my situation. I [23M] just had the best sex of my life. The best head of myself. Some sexy shit that I loved. He [29M] sucked my dick with so much passion and with a gentleness that I hadnt experience. He took his time. He has the softest of lips. The way his lips fit around my dick made me feel like it was made exactly for him. We exchanged the wettest of kisses. I started to eat his ass (yes, in the middle of a pandemic), he was so sensitive to everything. Every part of his body was so sensitive, including his nipples. We changed positions, allowing me to eat his ass while sucking my dick. He began to ride my face with his juicy asshole. He went back to sucking dick that led to him tasting a bit of my balls and my asshole. That was so sexy to me. Little did he know that I was verse and wanted his dick so badly inside of me too. We took a little break from the foreplay and decided to move into the penetration part of things. We mostly did different iterations doggy style I wanted to do more positions, but he said I was going to blow his back out The sexiest part to me was when he put on my fucking sandals to get a better grip to the floor, that shit was just so hot. I really want a boyfriend  we can fuck and wear each others sandals. Things with guy started off a bit shaky because I wanted to take it slow with a guy. But taking it slow didnt really translate well on our first date because I didnt speak about my intentions, but our first date was a hangout at his place, watching a movie. As per my therapists advice, nothing was sensual or sexual on that first night. My therapist wanted me to take things slow with a guy, but it just turned into me not being intimate with a person that I so desperately wanted to be intimate with. He said that he enjoyed the first date. So we texted the following days but fell out of contact. I was considered to be ghosted, but I chose to reach out and find out what happened. He said that he was waiting on me to initiate something. He thought that maybe I didnt like him because we didnt do anything intimate. PI told him that I was on best behavior. Which led to a string of messages basically intiating us fucking last night. It was so hot to hear him call my name and call me daddy even though there was an age difference. He is taller than me. He is older than me. He has larger hands than me. I feel like the ball is always in his court in terms of the moves. I think I have to take a more active role in the relationship. He has the apartment too. I just dont see a need for me in his life. Sometimes I feel inadequate when he takes a bit long to reply. Although I am verse, I chose to top him because I wanted to see him the submissive role. Its hot to me. I wanted him to scream my name for every unanswered text message. I wanted him to top me, but mentally it would destroy me because I dont want him to have a monopoly over my vulnerability and bottoming is when I feel most vulnerable. But I love a FLIP FUCK. Moral of the story: 1. CLOSED MOUTHS DO NOT GET FED. If I had not texted him, I would have never known how he felt about our original date. I wouldve simply felt like he ghosted me because I saw him hanging out with his friends (without inviting menot like I wanted to come but it would be nice to have the invitation) Maybe I need to work on incorporating the intimacy of a first date but without it incorporating sex? Im sure its possible in the gay community. Lack of sex doesnt equal lack of interest. Right now, I just want to relish in the great sex that I just experienced. I dont feel an emptiness, but I feel like I am growing feelings for this particular individual. How can this be happening and I just met Theo ? His social media has a CADRE of gay men liking and commenting on his photos. Its making me sad and a bit jealous. I just feel so disposable to him. I want to be his one and only fuck buddy. I have trust issues. What should I do ?!? Hes a good guy. Im not asking him to be completely emotionally available, but just give me a little bit more softness. Im finding that I have to be one to extend the olive branch and kind of reach out and chase him and gather his attention. I have never been in this position before and it stresses me out a bit."
7,vulnerability,sex,Need advice on getting basic experience as an older guy (23m),1,icc2xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/icc2xm/need_advice_on_getting_basic_experience_as_an/,2020-08-19 09:15:21,"Hey everyone, Im a 23 year old guy who has pretty limited experience with girls. I was popular throughout high school but rejected any advances as I wanted to wait until i was with a girl i liked and trusted. i realise now that is probably because of intimacy issues and i struggle with being vulnerable in front of others. When I was 16 i decided to kiss a girl at a party and felt extremely guilty afterwards, mainly because i felt like I had embarrassed myself and was just kinda ashamed. I decided that id go back to waiting until I was with a girl I liked. This is about the extent of my romantic experience. A few months later after this incident, and completely unrelated, I got hit with crazy mental health struggles and withdrew into myself, i had mad social anxiety and isolated myself for several years. I lost contact with all my friends and became a bit of a loner. I missed so many important milestones which has left me at 23 with no real romantic/sexual experience. I am now in a better position than I have been mentally, but still kinda fragile with vulnerability issues. Im still kinda socially anxious but not particularly awkward, i always had good social skills but im just out of practise and a bit quieter. Im quite a decent looking guy and can carry myself well so people would never really assume this about me unless you knew me really well, which makes things a little more difficult. I pretty much have no clue on how to go about getting experience at this age. I think waiting is no longer an option and even if I did meet someone, my lack of experience could ruin things anyway which is completely understandable from their point of view. Ive got a bit of a baby face so thought about going away for a weekend clubbing and pretending I was younger than I am for a one night stand, just so the girl wouldn't expect much in bed. I thought about trying tinder, but coming from a small town, its likely that any girl id meet up with would have a mutual friend/acquaintance and id be devastated if people found out im a virgin. I just know that it seems near impossible for me to be THAT vulnerable with another person, but i guess it will keep getting more and more difficult the longer i wait. I have made contact with 1 or 2 old friends so Im just trying to get out a bit more to build my confidence, but im struggling to meet new people as it is. Any advice would be amazing, thanks "
8,vulnerability,sex,University hook-up culture has encouraged guys to refuse/not want to wear condoms,1,ig4wd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ig4wd8/university_hookup_culture_has_encouraged_guys_to/,2020-08-25 14:00:18,"Hello, Im 20F and going into my final year of university. I had the vast majority of my encounters in my first six months in first year. Ive noticed recently more and more guys dont want to wear condoms, or have stated issues with wearing them in general. Ive been thinking about why this is the case and have a few theories. I feel as though the more sexually active a guy becomes at university, the more cocky and confident he gets about pushing the boundaries, as he knows at this stage he can get girls without too much difficulty. Unfortunately a lot of guys I have gotten with have this mentality as the guys Im attracted to know theyre attractive, and usually have several girls attention when they go out. Everyone knows it feels better without a condom (I dont notice the difference, but guys do), but we have all been taught in school that condoms protect against pregnancy and STDs etc. Id say most girls I know who are sexually active at university take some form of contraception, whether that be the pill, the implant, injection etc. Ive noticed if guys say that they have been tested recently, they think its okay to have unprotected sex if the girl is on contraception. Of course if both parties have recently been tested and havent had sex since this is usually okay, however when you have just met someone and are bringing them back its difficult to know whether to believe them. A guy I had sex with actually lied about being a virgin to me (he told me he was experienced, which usually implies hes had sex) and told me he didnt want to use a condom because it feels a lot better without. I have anxiety, and I always worry about people lashing out or getting angry/upset with me, so we had sex without a condom. I later found out he was actually a virgin, which angered me as he just assumed a condom wouldnt feel good. This assumption also plays into some experiences Ive had wear when I try and put a condom on a guy, he immediately goes soft. Of course, this could be cuz we have been drinking and whisky dick has played a part, but i believe this happens as psychologically they convince themselves it wont feel as good, so they go soft. I feel this is something that really needs to be talked about and addressed more, it has happened far too often for me to consider it a non-issue in society. Of course, I cant always use anxiety as an excuse, a by agreeing to not use a condom I am contributing to this culture. Fortunately I get tested regularly and have never had an std, and I do know a lot of guys who genuinely get tested regularly, but I know of many people who have gotten STDs from one night stands and unprotected sex. One nighters are exciting, especially after the adrenaline from clubbing, and so for us girls we want to feel safe and not worry about guys lashing out on us, and so we often agree to not using a condom to avoid this. I just wanted to talk about this and spark a discussion. Ive been taught my whole life to use a condom, even with my first bf we always used a condom even though I was on contraception and we were monogamous, but Ive noticed this has gone out the window for a lot of guys. A lot of them know if one girl refuses to have sex without a condom, they can find one who will. For me and a lot of other girls, a lot of guys take advantage of our vulnerability by trying to convince us to not use a condom. It is a vicious cycle and it needs to be talked about more, thank you for reading :)"
9,vulnerability,sex,Healing from sexual trauma while single,1,iidldh,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/iidldh/healing_from_sexual_trauma_while_single/,2020-08-29 05:22:16,"I feel like I'm stuck in an awful catch-22: That if I'm single and not having sex, how can I learn to trust my sexual partners to not violate my consent? But also, if I start dating and having sex, what person would want to do all the emotional work of helping me work through my trauma after just meeting me? So I either have to learn how to trust other people alone (which seems impossible), or wait until I find someone I like who also has enormous emotional capacity and incredible patience (which sounds stressful and also impossible)? Or worse, both? I have a ton of trouble relying on people for support. I have a really hard time knowing how much support is appropriate to ask for. In a situation where you're only just starting to date someone, is it too much to let them know you're dealing with trauma and that you need a lot of reassurance, patience, and consent check ins? Even if that's okay to ask for, that much vulnerability takes away all of the excitement for me. I end up just feeling scared and weak and incapable and feeling scared and weak and incapable is not sexy. But how can I get past this without pushing my limits, at least bit by bit? Anytime I stop a sexual scenario, even if things have barely started, I get huge waves of guilt and shame about not doing what my partner wants. This almost always leads to tears and sometimes panic attacks. And then I feel awful about that emotional response, and it doesn't make me want to try again. In the past my partners have tried to initiate again after I have panic attacks, or tell me later on they wished we could have had sex, even though they ""don't blame me."" These responses have not helped me. It seems like the obvious solution is to do the whole, ""let's take things slow"" thing with new partners, but I have no idea what that even means. Because it seems like people expect that to mean, ""let's date for a long time before having sex,"" but then when the sex eventually happens I'll still have the same insecurities and fears than if we had sex right away. Plus, people are often different in bed than they are elsewhere. Getting to know someone sexually is completely different than getting to know them intellectually, emotionally, etc. I have dated several people in the past that are incredibly kind, supportive, patient and all the other good stuff in the ""real world"", but when it comes to sex they are selfish, whiney, manipulative, and totally unsupportive. And often they don't even realize they're so different. I try to tell them what they're doing isn't okay and they have such a strong vision of themselves as ""a good person"" they can't even comprehend how what they are doing is bad. Because when not in the bedroom they exemplify goodness. Telling someone you've just met that you need to only take things one step at a time is so vague, but if you lay it out like, ""on this date we'll kiss, on the next one we'll make out, then next is feeling up, then the clothes come off, but no sexual touching until date #7, etc"" is CRAZY. Where's the middle ground? Does anyone have experience or advice on overcoming trauma while single and dating? tl;dr I'm scared and don't feel like it's possible to date new people because of my sexual trauma and fears"
10,vulnerability,sex,Urethral Play / Sounding,0,hko6ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hko6ky/urethral_play_sounding/,2020-07-04 04:23:57,"Regardless of what equipment you're working with, I'm curious to hear others' experiences with urethral play, if anyone can relate to what I'm saying, tips, advice. I've recently gotten into it with my SO and we're working with opposing equipment, so to speak. The pleasure I get from it is from the initial insertion, but also the actual penetration of the urethral sphincter. The urethral sound we use most is 100% entering / exiting my bladder. And it feels **insane**. It's what I imagine getting penetrated as a female-bodied person to be. It's a particular headspace, too. I have to be very still, and my SO has to be dominant, yet gentle/delicate and very in tune with the process. It's *nothing* like being penetrated anally (which we both do) there's this edge of submission/pleasure/pain/vulnerability that is unmatched, and I'm 100% sure I could come hands-free from this if we took our time with it. We're supremely sanitary about it, we sterilize all toys, wash in hot water and then pour rubbing alcohol on them (and do a quick wipe of our respective openings with rubbing alcohol) and use sterile lube - and try to limit it to 1-2x a week, but I'm on my 3rd UTI (in a year of doing this, which I don't think is that often) which my doctor says ""shouldn't happen to (male bodied) people"" I've told him about our new kink and his advice is, don't do it. What I've told him (and he doesn't get) is the orgasms are 100x more powerful this way. Like - this elicits sounds from me I've never made before, the orgasms last for minutes rather than seconds. Most of the time it just hurts to pee for a few times after, but NBD - no blood, never any issue with incontinence, which I've heard is sometimes a potential complication. We've also seen porn where both women and men take small dildos into their urethra and we REALLY want to get to that point, that's the hottest shi I've ever seen. Basically: \- how often is too often / how fast does the urethra heal \- how often could we/ should we 'size up' to stretch our urethras \- the urethra stretches over time to accommodate larger things so I assume? that the urethral sphincter will as well? \- I know UTIs often clear on their own, I'm wondering if there's any long-term risk to that besides the risk of it moving up to your kidneys \- Any other tips and tricks &lt;3"
11,vulnerability,sex,Tantric Massage - A Participatory Essay,1,hpe7o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hpe7o1/tantric_massage_a_participatory_essay/,2020-07-12 03:43:11,"I have a collection of published writings spread across the webisphere. I thought I would start to bring some of that information to reddit. A few months ago I sought out the opportunity to experience tantric massage. I had some knowledge of the practice and was aware that sexual fulfilment is not an intended outcome. The massage is an opportunity to open yourself to receive the offerings of touch, attention and sexual stimulation. The traditional goal of orgasm is replaced by a relaxed presence to receive the massage which in my understanding would have many beneficial outcomes. For some, the tantric massage experience may include practicing and becoming comfortable with receiving. Being open to receive is not a prevalent behaviour that is actively developed. Examples of this include being unable to receive compliments, or, being unable to receive assistance or help, even in the most simplistic of tasks. Even though the highest form of interpersonal relationships requires the free and unencumbered ability to give and receive. It is a necessary human behaviour that may require practicing through active and open encouragement and guidance. For individuals that struggle with trust or vulnerability due to past harms or trauma, tantric massage offers an opportunity for healing, and, safe and guided exposure. Again, this also includes practice in being open to receiving as previously presented. Another beneficial outcome is challenging the mind and the body to look at sexual gratification differently. Instead of a possibly rushed and overly concentrated focus on one or two erogenous zones. Tantric massage focuses on a whole body experience of fulfillment. You utilize and learn patience, exploration, and experimentation in gratification. The process becomes longer and offers space for communication, acknowledgement and understanding. A final benefit which I have very little experience in but is often discussed as being a part of tantric massage is unblocking or working energy channels. I am not formally trained in Reiki or energy work so my understanding is vague. In my personal experience though I have had an undeniably feeling of personal acceptance, togetherness, and, wellness. For many years I have unknowingly incorporated some elements of tantric massage into my own relationships. Patient and explorative sexual interactions, freely offering my time and attention, and open and honest communication are all fundamental to me. Through this experience I also uncovered that trust, being fully vulnerable, and graciously receiving, are areas that I need to work on. I knew that tantra focused on interpersonal growth and connection. What I didnt expect is the extent that it has enforced my personal growth and connection with myself."
12,vulnerability,sex,Threesome gone rogue: need some help navigating boundaries,1,hqkv2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hqkv2e/threesome_gone_rogue_need_some_help_navigating/,2020-07-14 04:31:37,"I'm reaching out about a threesome situation that I just went through with my partner, and need some help navigating certain boundaries that were crossed. I'll provide some context about the relationship: we are two people in our mid/late twenties, we've been in a relationship for three years and have, from the beginning, understood it to be 'open', if not polyamorous. I (28F) am a little older and had more experienced when I met him, which meant that for the first two years of our relationship we defined openness as me going on dates with girls and him going on dates with both genders. This was meant to give him time to mature and learn to handle feelings of jealousy. After two years, this unbalance was beginning to grate on me, and I communicated that with him. Eventually we went through a crisis because at our housewarming party, I went to bed early and woke up the next morning finding him in his room, in bed with a girl we had recently met. This was absolutely not ok with me, because the previous week he had expressly shared that he was not comfortable with me sleeping in the same bad as another man. When I found them, they were cuddling and looking to be naked for the most part. Obviously my assumption was that they had slept together, which turned out not to be the case. But, from what I gather, they were certainly leading to it. This was a breaking point for me - I felt incredibly disrespected and taken for granted. I also experience jealousy and had made ample space for him and respected his boundaries. In turn, I am not even given the same level of respect and consideration. Furthermore, I also fancied this girl but felt so uncomfortable as a result of his decision to just 'go for it' without asking or including me. It was unnecessary, he could have stopped himself, talked to me about it, and included me or at least given me a headsup that he was interested in doing something alone with her. This was also in our house, which we share with two other roommates - at that point I was absolutely not ok with both my partner doing anything with someone else in our private space, nor was i comfortable disclosing information to the flatmates. Moving on form that - we adapted our boundaries. We were now fully open, I've gone on a few dates that lead to nothing. I had to put in a fair bit of work to break the negative associations I had with this girl and him and things have returned to semi-normal, maybe even better than before because this was a fairer arrangement to me. He has been putting in the work he should have put in throughout the two years that I accommodated his jealousy and things were really good! So good in fact, that things with this same girl escalated and last week we decided we would go on a date. The first thing that was a bit of a yellow flag is that I'd talked to her about just us two going on a date. I genuinely wanted to hook up with her but also, I retrospectively realise that it was also because I wanted to feel truly comfortable with her, and not to stir up any past emotions of jealousy or whatever. Well, my partner had assumed that we were all agreeing to going on a date. I went with it because I'm an idiot, but also genuinely because I didn't really think through the emotions I was feeling. The boundaries we have negotiated for all situations involving other people, at least coming from me, is ""don't do anything you wouldn't be comfortable with me doing"". Considering the fact that he is a far more jealous person than me, I always assumed that this would protect me and keep things within boundaries, and at least force him to communicate with me and look inside himself with this. So, on to the threesome. It was absolutely amazing. Aside from confirming to me that I am 100% into girls as much as boys, it was fun, pleasurable and just great. At 7 am without having slept we decided to pack up the airbnb. We went back home, and were all sleeping in my partners' room - where I'd originally found them months ago. We were starting to sleep but then he pipes up and says he's still horny. I say I'm out. She's happy to give him a blowjob. I lie in the bed completely immobile and at one point think ""I either have to leave or do something"", was starting to feel awkward and uncomfortable. So i turn around and just kiss him a little. He then says he wants to fuck. At that point I start to feel a little strange. Why is he escalating this, when she's the only one doing anything and I have expressed through both body and language that I'm not horny? It's not a threesome anymore if your partner is saying they don't want to fuck. However, I am also not piping up and think 'it's fine', which honestly was my mistake. I didn't feel comfortable saying I was uncomfortable because to a certain degree, this was an admission of vulnerability. I am also the kind of person that has been educated in very traditional ways, which have engrained me with a deep sense of obligation to others, especially in social situations. He knows this aspect of my personality very well. He also was not concerned with ensuring that this kind of situation was REALLY ok with me - although he was to a degree aware that it was a little strange as he kept asking me 'are you ok?' but continued to escalate the situation. I wish he had stopped and asked me if I was ok with it, without her there, and giving me time to really think through with it. Instead, he asked me to acquiesce to the situation while doing exactly what he wanted, in a way that made it hard for me to express that I was not ok with it. So anyway. After asking if she wants to fuck, he puts her in his favourite position and starts fucking her, while she kisses me and I just lie there like an idiot. The things that bothered me where: this was bringing back all the emotions I felt that day, when I found them cuddling in his room. He is fucking her in his favourite position. He is very vocal and I can see his contorted face of pleasure. This room already has negative associations for me. He has already shown a lack of either concern or ability to check in with me about things. Meanwhile, I'm an afterthought in this interaction. It brought up all the insecurity and jealousy. He finished, and I left to sleep in my room. This is what is bothering me: he knows this history. He knows the boundary: 'don't do anything you wouldn't want to be done unto you, don't put me in situations where you're taking liberties I would never take with you'. I know him well - and let me tell you, this man would not be ok with me coming on another man's dick and him orgasming in me, in a position that is very intimate, after he'd tapped out of the threesome. I also think it was so unnecessary, we had had a great time so far - why push it? He put me in a position where I did not feel there was space to say, 'i'm not comfortable'. He escalated the situation again on the basis of his desires without actually engaging me fairly as to whether I was OK with it. The threesome was over for me, and I'd expressed as much on my side. He basically did not keep to the etiquette of a threesome: it's not a threesome anymore when the third person taps out. ALSO, he's in a relationship with ME, not with her. If your romantic partner taps out, the coherent choice is to keep going? What the fuck man. I'd never do that to him, out of respect to him, to the fact that this is the first threesome, and to the fact that it is hard to communicate in highly charged situations and you don't want to do something you regret or have trouble dealing with afterwards. Unfortunately this has stirred up a lot of things for me. I feel jealous, but angry at him that he takes liberties with my feelings like this. This feeling is permeating the memory of a great evening. And now I find myself having to put in the work again, recovering from the jealousy, normalising my relationship to her. It was selfish and inconsiderate, and I am honestly so disappointed in him. I don't know. He has put me in this kind of situation time and time again, and I'm tired. I guess I'm writing for some consolation on your part, or to ask how you deal with these situations."
13,vulnerability,sex,I [19M] feel horrible after watching kinky videos and it's affecting me personally,1,hxje09,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hxje09/i_19m_feel_horrible_after_watching_kinky_videos/,2020-07-25 18:28:07,"**TW: References to self-harm** Hello! I'm a 19M demisexual who has gotten into SPH recently. I have no prior sexual experience (micropenis, introversion, ugliness etc. are contributing factors to that) so my only ""scenes"" are pre-recorded videos/clips on the internet I often feel extremely terrible after finishing and there seems to be a lack of ""aftercare"" content that I can look at for reassurance and during some light reading, it appears that some professionals apparently even take pride in making their subs cry during scenes or started offering SPH because of a genuine dislike and enjoyment of mockery of tiny genitalia with the idea that she feels that he is truly worthless outside the scene too. For me the appeal is in vulnerability and the reassurance at the end that everything is fine and that I'm valued but I find that I cannot separate the remarks outside the scene and within the scene as I feel it is genuine hatred towards me. It also doesn't help that a history of self harm mean that often repeating lines from the videos in my head often make me want to cut deeper, (and more recently) injure my genitals/scrotum/base or attempt to physically castrate myself because the fact that I'll ""never being good enough"" for any woman feel way too real. There was one video which had a slower and more reassuring pace that didn't make me feel this way but I don't have it anymore nor can I find it so I go for the garden variety ""extreme"" videos which then kick-starts the above problem. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I will actually experience sexual relations in real life and I feel that SPH sort of shows me what my partner would really think about me if she saw me, that I really will be alone forever. I would say I'm sort of a switch but I would never try and make my partner cry as a goal but the SPH videos I've seen which encourages crying and remind me of my worthlessness as a man make me feel terrible mid-video and I lose my mood entirely and just keep crying and occasionally start cutting. I'm sorry if this is rambly or graphic but I don't know what to do EDIT: I'm adding some comments I posted on r/bdsmcommunity .......... Have been in therapy for a year with a really good therapist. I know those videos aren't talking to me personally but then when the same insults are echoed outside of those persona or bragging about making their subs cry and feel terrible (like on their Twitter), it starts feeling too real. I've tried switching to only vanilla or going porn-free but those phrases are almost memorized and thinking about it makes me sometimes physically start shivering. .......... I was hoping to compartmentalize my kinks away from my self-image, a lot of my kinks have root in real life harassment (I was verbally abused in public around adults who joined in, was forcefully stripped by a drunk man, molested etc.), for that I was hoping for some help. Often after a video I want to really want to cuddle and the lack being able to do that makes it really painful afterwards."

It really doesnt feel like being vulnerable has made a difference in my (lack of a) sex life or romantic life like people suggest it will. I feel like Im more often reject before I even have the chance to open up. I keep getting told I have trouble being vulnerable and I feel I dont grasp what aspect of that Im missing. Im afraid to be the one to ask for things like sex because I cant ask without being awkwardly blunt and no one has ever understood I need and want them to initiate. Thats just in the rare circumstances I actually get past a second date... like usually it doesnt even get that far and Ive never had someone be vulnerable to me about their needs and wants in a relationship around sex so I dont have a framework to talk about it... I bring this up because I was told that my problem is vulnerability by my therapist year ago, and more recently by a sex coach Im contemplating seeing... I dont understand, am I not meeting some threshold that qualifies me for sex? What do I need to say about myself that qualifies as vulnerable enough to be intimate? Is there something I have to achieve after thisbecause it feels like everyone keeps raising the bar for sex? What do I do to help my partner be vulnerable with me? What about vulnerability vs boundariesI have my past that I dont want to talk about and it has nothing to do with anyone but me, am I supposed to expose stuff like that too? If so, what I do about the things that mortify me to talk about (painful secrets)? How do I practice being vulnerable in a way that wont make others uncomfortable? Im normally not open to people until after a few dates, but by then most people move on, do I need to spill my heart that early when I meet them if Im at all going to have an intimate relationship? Is vulnerability helpful with casual sex, or is just a longterm relationship kind of thing?"
15,vulnerability,sex,ELI5: What is the appeal of humiliation?,1,gxj6ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gxj6ee/eli5_what_is_the_appeal_of_humiliation/,2020-06-06 13:08:26,"Basically the title. Reddit is full of subs dedicated to some sort of submission fetish such as mysogyny, BDSM, dommes, pegging, etc. I can understand the sexual aspect of it: being submissive often makes people feel vulnerable at their very core, and vulnerability is hot and intimate. But what about the degrading part? I've just found a sub where people (mostly girls) post pictures and expect to be humiliated. And by humiliated I'm talking insults, slurs, and just low effort roasts. The ""you belong in the kitchen where I can fuck you while you make me a sandwich"" kind of stuff. There's also a lot more shaming but I wouldn't be able to describe it here since I think it's against the subs rules. Anyway, it's basically a bunch of sexist stuff thrown around, and I just don't understand how a girl can enjoy being called a useless cum s**t and stuff like that. &amp;nbsp; And then there's the other side of it too. Men not just wanting to be dominated by women (which again, I totally understand, since submissions is hot) but also enjoying being called worthless while they get fucked in the ass by a dominatrix. I can understand the physical aspect (the prostate is the ultimate source of pleasure) but the degradation that these people willingly undergo is just beyond my comprehension. I can understand wanting to experience a different form of physical pleasure and I think pegging is really hot but being pegged while also being called useless, worthless, stupid or inferior is just something I will never understand. Again, I understand the concept of submission. But I personally draw the line between 1.being vulnerable/submissive to your partner and 2.willingly allowing strangers on the internet to insult you and your self worth. I know that, to some people, I might be overreacting but I genuinely wish I could understand this whole thing. Any thoughts?"

Im a 30 year old straight (probably 1 on the Kinsey scale tbh, who isnt?) cis female who has never been physically intimate with anyone else or myself. Im talking no kissing, snogging, macking, nada.

A few times Ive felt like I could get there but I stop and force myself to calm down. Ive said a thousand times, okay, okay, later, tomorrow, this weekend, next week will be the perfect time, Ill do it then. Spoiler alert: I dont do a damn thing the next week either. Im fairly confident that Im not asexual because I am sexually attracted to guys and I have been turned on before by media. But maybe Im missing something? Id love if there was a definition for whats up with me but I think its just plain ol anxiety. I know Ive got vulnerability issues. Ive never drank enough to get drunk and the only time I did edibles, I just ate one to make sure I didnt get too loopy. All of this is 100% conscious because I dont want to lose control. Ive gone on dates but I spend the whole time spiraling in my head about anything physical. Do I fess up and tell them? If I dont tell them they are clearly going to be able to tell when I drool all over their face. However, if I do tell them, they arent going to let me drool all over their face. Do I want to just hook up with a dude? Do I want to try to get into a relationship first? Do I hire an escort? Do I find a fuck buddy? What if it sucks!? What if I suck!? What if I end up blubbering and sobbing like the sexually repressed mess I am? The worst part is I feel like an orgasm would seriously help me unwind. So now Ive placed my mental well-being on this fruit Ive put on a forbidden pedestal. I feel like Ive been edging myself for 15 years and Im so far into my head now that Im stuck. And daaaaamn, Im psychoanalyzing myself right now but I wonder if Im so into it all right now because I cant do much about it, at least the partnered aspect. Theres not a whole lot of risk for rejection because I cant exactly go out and bar crawl ~in these unprecedented times.~ Anyway, I really dont know what response Im looking for here.

Something that really freaks me out is that I feel sexually attracted to people displaying strong emotions, especially anxiety or sadness. Its definitely always been a thing for me, whered Id have a strong emotional response - and more recently, a sexual response - to someone I was into crying or having some sort of emotional difficulty. Its especially a thing when I can act as a helper in some way, like if I can help or kinda save the person whos having that reaction. I would always find myself fantasizing about someone I know crying or in some sort of pain and me being able to help them. I also never experience any sort of attraction towards people when its not connected to that type of situation. Its really freaking me out - I would never, ever harm anyone ever in real life obviously, and Im super scared something about me is messed up or that Im a bad person. Am I some kind of sadist or something??!? What's wrong with me, is this normal? Im also really, really worried about it getting in the way of my being able to have a real/healthy relationship with someone, because a lot of my feelings of emotional connection to people are also based on that emotional vulnerability.

Ive experienced some sexual traumas throughout my adolescence and young adulthood including being assaulted in my high school workplace and a handful of experiences in my late teens and early 20s that were varying degrees of nonconsensual and/or scary. (It has been 3-4 years since anything like that happened) Most of my experiences with sex have been rather casual, with the exception of two exclusive relationships, each lasting ~1.5 years. Im starting to think that for the longest time I have subconsciously tried to cut out the emotional part of sex and its landed me with a lot of emotionally unavailable partners and unsatisfying sexual encounters. Im learning I need to have a strong emotional bond with someone in order to really enjoy the sex and especially to orgasm. I now have a new-ish partner that seems very capable of this type of emotional bond and told me to just tell ask for what I want and need but Im still finding myself putting up walls or restricting what I feel comfortable sharing or asking for and I feel like a lot of it has to do with past experiences. I am wondering when is too soon to talk about this, or how to start the conversation, because I can tell that he can tell that Im a little guarded but Im not sure how to break down my own walls. I want to do this for my own personal growth and development and Im hoping this post might reach someone who has gone through a similar experience of not being able to relinquish control (i.e. orgasm) in front of a partner due to a deep fear of vulnerability. Any suggestions of things to try, books to read, methods to improve this issue, or even a better subreddit for this post are much appreciated. TIA. Edited for clarity"
19,vulnerability,sex,How do I ask for sexual activity in a strictly long distance relationship?,1,hk3xz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hk3xz9/how_do_i_ask_for_sexual_activity_in_a_strictly/,2020-07-03 05:46:41,"Hi there. To make a long story short, Im in a long distance relationship (of sorts? Its quite confusing...) with a girl I met online. Anyway, were comfortable enough that we have sex, or at least as much sex as you can have over video, messaging, and audio calls. Things were fine for a while and we actually seemed quite matched sexually (we both had high sex drives it seemed like). But recently shes been more distant any time I try to make any moves? Shes stopped initiating sex completely, so gradually I backed off too just to not feel like I was pushing for something only I wanted. But sometimes I still tease or try to initiate, yet now she becomes a bit awkward? For example, the other day I was teasing a bit and asked her to send me a photo in a dress that she knows I really like. Thats all I asked about, nothing revealing or anything like that just because I was already slightly nervous about approaching the subject. I expressed that I found that specific dress really good looking on her, told her it fit really well, and I told her it looked hot. Her reply was a simple was exactly as follows: I mean... I dont know, not right now? I told her haha of course not right now, but when you can? Id like to see you in it... Maybe later she replies I asked, When is later? Maybe tomorrow? At least? I didnt get a chance to reply before she sent a second message immediately following that one that changed the topic (the message was her asking me about a dish she wanted me to make). Normally I wouldnt mind her obviously not being into it and changing subjects, but this has been going on for quite some time now. I still have a high drive, but she seems to not really acknowledge it whenever I try to make advances. So at this point in the conversation I switched topics with her and replied to her comment about that dish she wanted me to make, but after I did I apologized because at this point I just felt really bad about myself. This had been going on for a while and it finally hurt a bit. I said Im sorry, I feel bad. Should I back off of saying stuff like that to you...? She replied What? I said Im worried Im making you uncomfortable or feel awkward. Im sorry, was all she replied. Then she replied again I dont know what to say. I was feeling a bit hurt and admit my next comment was sort of dumb, but i said I think maybe I should just... back off or something? And then I sent another message saying its getting pretty late over here anyway, I think I should try to get some sleep. She replied again What do I say... I said I think my brain is just a bit of a cruddy place maybe. I should sleep though. Ill send you a picture of that dress tomorrow? I dont know. I replied again, but this time in a different tone. I told her, No no, no. Please dont do anything you YOURSELF dont want to do, ok? Please dont do it unless YOU want to. Like absolutely. Her next reply was her saying she was going to the restroom quickly, to which I said go ahead. By the time she came back, Id been asleep, and the discussion ended there. We didnt speak about it the next morning and nothing ever came of it. This is particularly hard for me. As dumb as it sounds and even though Im technically a virgin, sex with her makes me feel loved and makes me feel like she wants me. Honestly if I could achieve the specific feelings without sex, I wouldnt mind that just so I wouldnt have keep pestering and getting shut down. But sex is an entirely new level of closeness and vulnerability for me. So my question is, how can I explicitly ask for sex (assuming shes interested), over message or phone call without it being really awkward? I cant imagine the statement Hey, do you think when you get into bed tonight we could... do stuff together? would exactly be a turn on for her (yes, she would understand that, we speak like that constantly, both her and I). I care about her and dont want to pressure her. Hell, if shes not interested in photos or videos, Id 100% be ok with just text messages or audio calls. I just want to feel close to her again without pressuring her, but also without teasing and making advancements just to get shut down and end up feeling bad about myself. Im not sure if my question is clear, and I know this post is a bit long. But I need help... Can anyone tell me what to do?"

Inevitably, that will involve sex and that leads me to two problems: First, I have PTSD as a result of being sexually assaulted in a violent manner. I am in therapy to address this and I've made good progress, but there are still certain moves in the bedroom that will trigger an intense wave of fear. Through mindfulness exercises I can calm myself down again, but it's not exactly a sexy experience. The other issue is that I have a very difficult time coming to orgasm. I can get myself there just fine using sex toys, but not so much with my hands. I've actually had a few lovers since my assault, and I've faked a response so they wouldn't feel bad. I don't intend to do that anymore, so this poor guy's self esteem is going to take a hit. It doesn't help that letting a partner bring me to orgasm feels like an extreme vulnerability, and it will take time to work through that fear. I am still learning how my new body and sexuality works. We already had a discussion about taking things slow, so I figure I have at least another date or two before I need to have this talk (not counting all the IMs and phone calls between). So far he has put zero pressure on me which I am extremely grateful for. However, I just don't know how or when to start the talk. Part of me thinks I have no business dating when I still have healing to do, but I'm also really tired of keeping my life on hold. I'm afraid he will see me as carrying a ton of baggage--which I am, I suppose, but I have no intention of dumping it on him. As you can imagine, it's a awful conversation to have with anyone (the typical response is victim blaming), but it feels extra difficult here. How do I do this? I don't want to freak him out :("

The macho confident amazingly calm and supportive partner of mine told me after a particularly intense session that he just wasn't simply telling me I was by far the best he had. He had a string of LL partners that almost messed up his psyche and what he thought of sex. My spontaneous and regular blowjobs, our long sessions of sex, and more put him back at ease and made him realize he wasn't a pervert for wanting sex so much or that he wasn't rude asking for a BJ when sex was off the table, or a number of other things.

Whether its my face or body that serves me, Ive ever had a problem finding someone who would want me. However, I grew up in a very strict orthodox muslim and arab household which isnt very sex positive. Dating is considered forbidden and my family always assumes the worst when it comes to any person of the opposite sex in my life unless they have the same religious background and ethnicity. Ive never been allowed to have guy friends outside of school or work, so its always been quite hard to indulge in a love interest or even just a hookup. Growing up, whenever I was into someone or wanted to mess around I snuck and hid around a lot. Because a lot of people here in the US, especially in my area, havent been raised by newly immigrated people with strong cultural and religiousties, its always been very hard for any partner Ive ever had to fully understand. They tell me to just leave. Its toxic! But I always say no. if youve grown up in a minority household like mine, you know the struggle, otherwise please do not invalidate the reasons I reject to leave my family. As a result of this lack of understanding within most people, no one really sticks around. This has very greatly affected my sex life. Well, I have none. Im a Virgin and Im horrified of intimacy. Ive never had a problem with vulnerability in an emotional context when it comes to someone like a partner, but physical vulnerability is a struggle. It even affects my ability to climax with someone on the other end. Exhibit A: ive had a lot of phone sex with a lot of different people and have faked every single orgasm, even though when Im on my own I can climax within 3 minutes if I felt like it. I dont know whats wrong with me. I feel so malformed internally. I feel disconnected from my peers and all the fun and experiences theyve had. I hate that seemingly no one understands, but at the same time I know that my relationship with the opposite sex as a result as how I was raised is completely fucked. Please give me any insight."
23,vulnerability,sex,Who takes responsibility for sexual disfunction in a relationship?,1,gtx53o,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gtx53o/who_takes_responsibility_for_sexual_disfunction/,2020-05-31 21:00:23,"Hi everyone. I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post, so forgive me if in some way I'm not following the usual protocols or ways of posting. I've just come out of a short (6 months) but nevertheless very intense relationship with a therapist. Right from the start we seemed to be interacting in a way that was constantly processing...our feelings, our vulnerabilities, our insecurities, our needs. This all seemed very healthy, and quite different from any relationship I've had before. I've always valued emotional depth and intelligence in a relationship, and I felt that finally I'd found it. But we had a big problem with our sex lives. Whilst we were OK with foreplay, we were rarely able to have penetrative sex. We would stop because he would lose his erection, or couldn't even really get inside me. When we tried the first few times, I was told by him that I felt 'dead inside.' From there followed a series of upsetting moments and interactions where I began to recognise that I was indeed experiencing some sort of sexual trauma related to previous relationships, that was showing up between us. Something had closed up inside of me and was somehow not letting him in. I started to work on this, to really take care of myself and explore the previous hurt that had led me to be this way. Luckily, it is not anything serious like sexual violence or rape. It feels more related to the grief I felt after my mother died unexpectedly three years ago and my search afterwards for some sort of emotional support through a series of damaging and unhealthy relationships, one of which led to an unwanted pregancy and miscarriage. This man and I also had sex therapy together. But I noticed when we did this, he was really uncomfortable with looking at any of his own 'stuff' that might be leading to us having these problems together. In fact, the narrative that has developed over the last few months is that he feels rejected by me, because of my 'closedness' or disassociation, and that causes him to lose desire (and his erection). Ultimately, I was being made to feel wholly responsible for this problem....but I now doubt whether this was fair or accurate. Surely what happens between two people in bed (or out of it) is a relational space where there is equal responsibility? In spite of us both saying how much we valued vulnerability from the start of our relationship, I actually feel it was me doing the vulnerability work for a lot of the time. When I suggested that maybe he wants to look at what makes him feel rejection i.e. his own emotions and history around that, he would get angry and bat it back to me. I should reiterate here that he was a therapist. He's used to looking at other people's problems, and playing the carer role. He told me that this was his pattern in most of his relationships too - as it has been in mine (i.e. that I have played the carer). His desire to make me another project that needs his healing, along with his refusal to address his own vulnerabilities, signalled the end of the relationship for me. But I am still left with my own doubts and confusion around what this sexual issue is that I am dealing with. It is the first time it has shown up so explicitly in a relationshp; I knew in the last couple of years that something wasn't right because I was disassociating during sex with other partners. Now I'm willing to explore that more, and what I find is a lot of pain and grief that has probably been held for some time, but is now fully revealing itself. I guess I want to be able to heal this without feeling like I'm broken or 'dead inside'....or that I will never be able to find a guy who can put up with this, which was one of the last hurtful remarks thrown at as I split up with the therapist. Would really value hearing similar experiences of this sort of sexual disfunction or trauma, and any words of reassurance and support. Thank you."

Im not completely flat chested but ive always wished they were a little bigger. My bf (m24), ill call him Mike from here on out, and I have been in a relationship for the past 4 years. We were each others first sexual partners and have had lots of firsts together. About a year into our relationship, Mike was away for a weekend and decided to ask an old girlfriend for nudes (they dated for a bit about 3 years prior to us meeting). During their conversation, he specifically asked her if she would let him suck her tits if they were together in person. There was also a part where he implied that she lost weight but her boobs got even bigger since theyd been together. I found out about 6 months later and was absolutely crushed. This girl had huge boobs and was just overall more petite than I was and this really hurt my overall confidence and made me really question Mikes feelings for me. It took a lot of vulnerability from me to trust Mike and get comfortable in exploring my sexuality with him so this whole thing really messed with my head. I was super disappointed that he asked her about sucking her tits because that was something we did together and it felt like such an intimate detail of our relationship. Since then Mike has definitely worked extremely hard to regain my trust and and weve worked on a lot of the issues surrounding that time in our relationship. Overall, id say were in a much happier and healthier relationship now. But My issue now is, at times, I still feel inadequate and lack confidence about my chest. Sometimes in bed, especially when Mike is touching my chest or sucking on my nipples, all of my insecurities come back and it often makes it impossible for me to orgasm. Weve talked about it plenty of times and Mike has expressed that he loves my chest and that im enough for him but its just hard for me to feel confident again. He's great at making sure he's not the only one getting off and I can tell he still gets so disappointed in himself when I start to lose confidence and pull away. How can I let go of these insecurities and feel excited during sex again? Does anyone have tips for regaining confidence after mistrust? I love physical touch and weve always had a really fun and exploratory sexual relationship and I really want to go back to enjoying sex with no inhibitions &amp;#x200B; TL/DR: bf asked another girl for nudes during our relationship and this reignited my insecurities regarding my small chest size. Looking for advice on how to move on, regain confidence, and enjoy all physical touch with him again"

We have really great sexual chemistry and always have a good time together. Even though weve stopped seeing each other for now due to the pandemic, weve continued to exchange sexual texts. That has still been lots of fun. He usually initiates it, but I also do sometimes. About a week ago, he suddenly stopped responding to my messages mid-conversation (this was super out of character for him). Today, I finally sent another text just check in to make sure everything is alright. He responded about twelve hours later saying that hes been having some depressive swings to the point that hes been barely awake all day. This really struck me. Weve always been careful to separate our personal lives from our strictly sexual relationship and hes never showed this kind of vulnerability in the past. Im not quite sure how to respond. As someone whos also experienced significant struggles with depression, I want to convey my empathy and let him know Im here for him. However, I also dont want to overstep the boundaries of our friends with benefits arrangement... I dont have any romantic feelings for him, but I do truly care about his well-being. Im unsure how communicate this to him in a sympathetic, yet effective way given the situation."
26,vulnerability,sex,Why doesn't he[M28] just leave me[F25] alone?,1,g0aa0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/g0aa0h/why_doesnt_hem28_just_leave_mef25_alone/,2020-04-13 12:45:18,"Throwaway because I know he uses Reddit. It's also a long story so I added TL;DR at the bottom. I met this guy while we were both in a relationship. He has a reputation among his family and friends as being a player that cheats on all his girlfriends, so initially I never really considered him attractive. Anyway, one day while we were at the same social gathering, I was talking to my bf and I noticed him starring at me. As we made eye contact, he gave me this devilish smirk that honestly made my heart sink into my stomach. I know it sounds silly but from that point on, I felt sexual tension whenever we were around each other. And as time passed, both of our long term relationships went down hill so we became FWB. The first year or so with him was honestly the best sex of my life. We couldn't get enough of each other and I'd be glowing for weeks after I saw him. He knows exactly what I like and how to touch me, he knows all my kinks, fantasies, everything. But nothing that good ever lasts long does it? He started treating me different and becoming the person that everyone warned me about. I knew better, but as cliche as it sounds.. he was different to me. I've never met someone so confident, outspoken, and fearless. He intrigued me and was almost inspiring, since I'm a very shy person and much of a push over. Sometimes though, I saw glimpses of vulnerability in him that made me want to see more. He could be so heartless and ruthless but also so sweet, protective, and loving at the same time. But he's hurt me a million times in a million different ways and I'm so ashamed that I keep forgiving him. He's very dominant in bed and his kinks are rape and abuse, which I enjoy because I'm submissive myself, but I think its rolled over into real life and outside of the bedroom. He manipulates me and lies to me and takes advantage of me when I say no. He doesn't even give me after care anymore, and it's seriously affecting my mental and physical health. I get anxiety when he tries talking to me and I hate myself and feel so guilty and dirty after I see him I can't even eat. When he kicks me out right after sex, I ball my eyes out so much that I get panic attacks on the drive home from seeing him. After a couple years of fooling around, I also found out he's had a new gf. I kinda sensed it because we went from seeing each other once every other week, to about once every couple months. So I've told him it's over and that I don't want to have sex with someone that's in a relationship. I've also tried ghosting him many times but he doesn't leave me alone. When he asks me why I want to move on, I'll tell him because the way he treats me hurts and I don't want to see him anymore, ect. Then he'll tell me he's sorry and that he'll be better for me blah blah blah, but he never is so I just get fed up and block him. He will then proceed to text me every so often from different numbers apologizing and wanting to work things out. And sometimes I'll stand firm, but other times I do give in and forgive him, then the cycle repeats. Now I'm well aware of how horrible it is to be the other girl, and I have to deal with that guilt for the rest of my life.. but I didn't think it was that serious considering his reputation. I never initiate contact with him and I've gotten better at ignoring him now, but I clearly do suffer from low self esteem and no confidence. I should also note that I haven't had social media (other than reddit) until recently when I've had to use it for a project I've taken up. So of course I grew curious and looked up him and his gf. He has no pictures of her or an indication that he's in a relationship. She however, has a ton of pictures of them together. I didn't know they were that happy and in love. It kind of broke my heart. Not because I want to be with him, but because I felt so stupid and betrayed. But I know I don't deserve to feel that way. She does. She's the one that's been cheated on this whole time. Now here's where my question comes in if you're still reading. I want to know, why doesn't he just leave me alone? He's made it clear he doesn't respect or care about me anymore. So why go through all this trouble still? He clearly seems happy with her, so why does he keep running back to me. Why doesnt he just accept that I want to move on with my life and be left alone? He tells me he's never going to let 'this' end, but why not? Especially if he doesn't even like me. TL;DR: FWB that I've been trying to ghost (for many reasons) wont let me move on, even though he has a new gf. Why doesn't he just leave me alone?"

If anything in this post is strange, it's probably my lack of prflofifciency in social stuff showing.) I know a girl from university, with whom we often have good chitchats, but nothing too deep. We meet, chat for an hour or too, havea good time, but it's not a ""pour my heart out no cieiling on the vulnerability i allow myself"" kind of friendship. She is pretty and kind... And if i got her hints right, might even be attracted to me a bit. Which is why i dont want to lead her on. It's not that I don't want to put effort in to the friendship, but if she is attracted to me, i dont want to send her misunderstandable signals that could mean i want a romantic relationship. She is too nice for me to even accidetally break her heart. So basically, i am stuck between three options: 1: Straightout ask her ""you wanna have the sexs?"" for which, by conventional standards, we are possibly not close enough. 2: Work on deepening the relationship, which i am not against, but wary of. I have burnt myself before, trying to make new friends, and maybe a pleasent but ignorant acquittance-ship would be better than risking another bad experience. *also*, if we do become friends, and I bring up casual sex, and it ruins the friendship somehow,... I dont want that heartbreak. I dunno if she'd be weirded out due to some social norm i dont understand. 3: I deepen the relationship, AND drop hints about sex, which for one, feels kinda manipulative, but also might make her expect more than i am ready for. So yeah, the gist of it is: i dont wanna lose a pleasent acquittance, or cause harm. Or even worse, get consent by manipulation. Sorry if this is not the best subreddit for this. This case deals with casual sex and consent and emotional safety of participants, which is why i post this here."
28,vulnerability,sex,Erotic Insight from Esther Perel,1,fe1fgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fe1fgi/erotic_insight_from_esther_perel/,2020-03-06 07:24:27,"At a time in the western world, when we often have premarital sex as a given, contraception in hand, and the permission for sexual connection and pleasure at home, desire seems to be flatlining. We dont know why it is so difficult to sustain desire, and we want to want. Many of us, when it comes to sexuality, tend to do what we think we should do rather than what wed like to be doing (and this is not just a statement about women). We get stuck in ruts and disconnect from our imaginations. We would love to experience new things with our partners but we can be afraid to invite ourselves or them. A minor annoyance or a major impasse can both be catalysts for shutting down sexually. Sometimes were not in the mood; other times we wonder if weve lost what once made us desirable to our partners. We tend to think of these as sexual issues. Really, its an erotic dilemma. Contrary to what we are taught, eroticism isnt purely sexual; it is sexuality transformed and socialized by the human imagination. The imagination creates the plot. Flirtation, longing, and anticipation all play within our minds eye. This is where our erotic faculties live. And eroticism is a time machine. Its activated by the pains and pleasures of our complicated pasts. It breeds hope and possibilities for the future. It makes us feel utterly present. Dont know what I mean? Think about a favorite activity. Lets say, you love to play soccer, tennis, or ping-pong. Last time, you won your game. Thinking about that win gets you excited about the next time youll play. At home, you wash your gear. You text your teammates to schedule practice. You check the weather. Theres a whole ritual that builds anticipation. So why, when it comes to sex, do people seem to think that just saying do you want to have sex after doing the dishes is a sufficient warm up? Play ball, people! Engaging in eroticism enables us to maintain a sense of aliveness, vibrancy, and vitality. As Octavio Paz has implied, eroticism is the poetry of the body the way that poetry is the eroticism of language. Dont let a difficult phase be a death sentence for your sex life or your relationship. Together, you can come through it. Consider the following five ways to create meaningful connections with your partner. Expand your definition of eroticism. The erotic landscape is vastly larger, richer, and more intricate than the physiology of sex, or any repertoire of sexual techniques. Its worth repeating: the central agent of eroticism is our imaginations. The most overlooked erotic organ is our mind. We can anticipate, dream, and give meaning. If sex is a collection of urges and acts, the erotic is a receptacle for our hopes, fears, expectations, and struggles. Its about the quality of the experience, not frequency and performance. If you want to feel transported, you have to take risks. Im not talking about danger; Im talking about vulnerability of exposure and exploration that heightens trust. Deep eroticism is intimate; deep intimacy is erotic. Cultivate pleasure for its own sake. Playing it safe gets it done, but if you want a sense of renewal and excitement, step outside of your comfort zone. Creating meaningful connection often requires adjusting the context in which intimacy is taking place. Try to: Create the right ambiance. Think again of the soccer game. Nobody expects to play on a littered field. We pay attention to the space, light, and mood. Upkeep of our space ensures were ready to play at any time. Switch up your routines. No matter how effective our rituals are, if we dont change it up a bit, they inevitably become boring. Take out separate email addresses just for love notes to each other, take a class, go on walks together at night. Create meaningful connection through play Couples who are plagued by sexual boredom would be well to explore the hidden fantasies and desires that turn them on. A great way to do this is to engage in sexual play. Here are some ways to initiate: Make lists of sexual turn-ons, such as grooming, good foreplay, emotional sensitivity. Put the list in an envelope, seal it, and put it under the pillow. Pick objects that represent experiences when you each felt intense pleasure and excitement. Then pick other ones that represent when you each felt numb, shut down, closed off, and fearful. Let those objects tell your stories. I assure you: you will say and hear things you havent before. If you had to direct an erotic scene, what would that scene be like? Encourage each other to be detailed. Highly granular. Every detail matters in the realm of pleasure. Get Away From Performance-Driven Sex. At this moment, getting it done, being efficient, and our obsession with optimatization creates an anti-erotic culture. Sex is not about the orgasm nor does it end with the orgasm. Stop focusing on the physicality of it. Linger. Take your time. Savor. Let things unfold and not be so goal-orientated. And, by the way, foreplay starts at the end of the previous orgasm. Explore your Erotic Blueprints. Tell me how you were loved; I will tell you how you make love. The psychology of our desires often lies buried in the details of our childhood and in our relationships with our caregivers. It didnt start when we found our partners. What gives us intense pleasure sometimes comes from very dimly-lit places inside of ourselves, and from experiences that were actually quite painful. Our imagination compensates for what was missing, and for what may be missing now. Sexual fantasies reveal our deepest emotional needs. Provided you are in a healthy enough relationship to go there, explore the roots of your sexuality with my free Intimacy Inventory. Within it, youll find a series of questions and conversation topics that will give you deeper insights into yourself and each other. Exploring our physical, mental, and emotional depths enables us to deepen our intimacy. Feeling busy, tired, or stressed notwithstanding, its this kind of understanding of ourselves and our partners that will help us overcome the obstacles to our desires and bring home the erotic. Have fun. "

It feels alright, but its not worth all the leg work. Having sex with someone im not intimate with just feels empty and not fulfilling. I dont like someone having a piece of my vulnerability in exchange for what I see as hedonistic pleasure. Personally, I think its an ego driven pursuit and its not for me. I honestly would rather not have sex for the rest of my life then to have casual sex again."

But there was chemistry between us that just wouldnt die. So now, over a month after we ended it, we have decided to try being friends with benefits. Neither of us have had an fwb before, and to add an extra layer of challenge, a lot of sex stuff is off the table. Here are the boundaries: - we cant have piv sex (its an emotional trigger for him, long story) - he doesnt like blowjobs because hes afraid of being accidentally bitten - I am very hesitant to receive oral because of the vulnerability. This might be in the realm of possibility eventually, but I dont trust him enough just yet. - Anal is a hard limit for me. Not gonna happen. So Im not entirely sure what were actually going to be doing next time we see each other in person. So far weve been sexting, which is kinda fun I guess but will probably get old pretty soon. The only other things I can think of are cuddling, making out, and fingering. Do you have any ideas for what else we can do together? I want to make this interesting and spicy and fun :)"

(anyway there's a ""Tl;DR"" at the end) I'm (18M) confused about this. My gf (18) has a different way to see sex than I, sex is a topic we didn't touch until we started our relationship, not even in jokes and that's because I was always fearing about her reaction. She was clear when we talked about it, she isn't interested in sex, she takes like a form of disrespect any form of psysical contact with a sexual intention, she sees sex but only from a ""reproductive function"" perspective, also, she doesn't like the idea to have sex, then break, meet other guy, have a relationship with him, then have sex, break... And so on, and so on. She would like to wait to be married to the man she would like to be all the rest her life with, for, finally, have sex with him. I respect (because I believe she has some points) and I'm trying to learn to love the way of think she has about this, wich is pretty different to mine, because I don't only see sex from a reproductive perspective, I see it like a form (not the definitive) of intimacy, give love, moment of vulnerability and connection, etc. And not only for me or one party, but for both. She's also a bit ""cold"" when it comes to psysical contact and I'm someone who likes and craves it, not in a needy way, but, you know.. I like to be touched like every human being. Sometimes I just feel like my body turns numb or it hurts because of this lack of psychical contact, also, we don't see us often, only twice every month in the best case escenario; I know it hurts her too, I'm not trying to play a victim here, I'm just confused about what should I do, because I love her and I respect her way of see that topic, but I also feel bad, I feel pain because I need to hide a part of myself. And I want to be clear with something, I didn't ask or demand her to have sex, we just talked about the topic and that's all. This is my first relationship that is going well (because the previous ones always ended with me being treated like an object of distraction and psychological support lol) and I don't want to screw it up. I didn't know if this was the correct sub to post this, so... If I need to do it in other sub, I will. TL;DR: My gf sees sex from a reproductive perspective, she doesn't want to have sex or any way of psysical/sexual contact/touch. Not because I asked/demanded her to have sex, but because we talked about the topic. I like and crave psysichal contact, and, even if I'm trying to respect her position, it hurts me that I need to hide a part of myself from her. I don't know what should I do."
32,vulnerability,sex,Quickly bored with sex?,1,fjauvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fjauvz/quickly_bored_with_sex/,2020-03-16 10:30:02,"Hi all, First time poster here! A little bit about me before I get into it. I'm a 28 year old male leading a super fun, healthy lifestyle. I'm a yoga teacher, I practice jiu jitsu and dance, I eat well, sleep well, have a great support network, and am so grateful for the life I've been gifted. I've just moved to a big city after 5 years of traveling/international tour guiding and am in the process of a huge life transition as I plant roots for the first time and change careers. So, here we go! I've had dozens of sexual partners over the past 5 years, including two separate year long relationships, and have never had an issue forming connections with women. It always starts off strong. Things go really well, and I'm genuinely interested. But after a few weeks getting to know each other and having sex, my interest often times starts to wear off. It's almost like a switch gets flipped, and one night, I'll be really into it, then the following night I will be totally uninterested. Once I lose interest, it's near impossible to get turned on again. Sometimes, it's because I'm genuinely bored with that persons company, but other times, I really don't understand why I don't stay sexually aroused. I'll be enjoying their company, the experience, even the physical sensations, but I can't stay hard and feel like it's just a chore to be having sex. For example, I've recently started seeing someone who is fun, curious, mature, beautiful, playful and grounded (to name a few attributes) and I love spending time with her. We get along soooo well, have such deep, connected conversations, and really enjoy each others presence. With all that said, I'm already starting to get bored with our physical interactions. It's confusing, because I'm having fun with her and am thoroughly enjoying the connection we share, but my body isn't aroused. I start thinking of past partners as a fantasy to keep me stimulated, despite knowing that it's pulling me away from being as present as possible and isn't working on the root of the issue. I recognize that people can lose interest or get bored after being in a relationship for quite some time, or maybe get bored every once in a while with a new partner, but my quick loss of interest happens frequently, despite everything looking good on paper and my actual desire to be interested. I used to be in a place where I didn't want a relationship. I'm sure the boredom was in part a mask to avoid getting connected, knowing that I'd be leaving for travel shortly after. It was easier to find disinterest than vulnerability. Now, however, I cherish meaningful relationships and am unsure how to handle this seemingly inevitable loss of interest, even as I work on changing my mindset and am practicing presence whenever possible. I've had many friends suggest I try out polyamory seeing as I like to have variety, but there's no part of me that wants to spread my energy so thin and have several partners. I really would love to just be with one person whom I can devote my energy to and not quickly lose erotic interest in. Have any of you ever experienced this? And if so, how did you go about managing it? I really want to be sexually engaged whenever I'm with a partner, but it's like my body stops caring after we've already had a few nights of fun. Tips, advice, anything welcome. Thank you for hearing me out!"

Sometimes I'm rocking him gently. It's not an AB thing or anything(nothing wrong with it but not for me), I just like that intimacy/vulnerability."

Our relationship is heterosexual and monogamous. Even though we are in our mid-twenties, he has been the only person I have had sex with. Which is fine, but I feel like I always have so many questions: - Even though we dont have sex as much as we did in the beginning, which is fine, he doesnt cum nearly as often as he used to. Dont get me wrong, its nice to have him last as long as he does at times now, but I guess it makes me feel bad that Im not good enough or my performance wasnt good enough for him to cum? Is that accurate? - In reference to my first question.. does masterbating have a role in that? If he masterbates a lot, does it affect him not being able to cum? - I read erotica sometimes, and even watch porn. I recently found out that he follows a number of pages on Instagram that post pictures of colleges girls in bikinis. Should I be worried about this? Or is this childish? Is following pages like that harmless? And does this affect when we go to have sex together? I had already planned on speaking with him the next time we are together about my top question, but the other two popped up for me this morning and threw me for a little loop. My fear is that he has a super unfulfilled sex life being with me and is willing to sacrifice that by seeking out this fulfillment in those other things that I may be only seeing a piece of. I dont know where to turn to get another point of view on this... I appreciate anybody that took the time to read this and be with me in my vulnerability about all of it."

I lost my virginity about two years ago. I guess I was a late bloomer, I thought I might be asexual until around 16 or 17 when I finally started thinking sex sounded appealing. I've always been shy, I have social anxiety and even when I am comfortable I'm just not the life of the party, I'm naturally more soft-spoken. Anyway in the past couple years as I've gotten some sexual experience I've really struggled with expressing myself in a sexual way. I don't moan at all during sex, I've sort of tried to force one out but I couldn't, as if there was a mental block there and I physically couldn't. Personally I don't feel the need to make noise during sex and I'd be fine just not making any, but I worry about my partner thinking I'm not into it or losing interest in me because the sex isn't wild enough or something. If a guy wanted to sext I don't think I could do it, I would just feel ridiculous and like it doesn't seem right coming from me. I have trouble expressing my sexuality even when just talking with friends, I am completely fine with in-depth conversations about other people's sex lives or desires but am too shy to say anything that makes me seem like a sexual person. I've been with a few guys in the past couple years and my friends have said that I always seem kind of lukewarm about them, which I think is because even when I'm really into it I won't express that. I'm similar when it comes to romantic attraction, I tend to mask my feelings because I feel that if I admit them even to my friends and then am rejected I will be embarrassed and my friends will pity me, which I hate. I feel like my problems with sexual and romantic vulnerability are really ingrained and I don't know if I can ever get over them and have a healthy romantic/sexual life and relationship to my sexuality. Part of it is definitely that I have really bad self-esteem, I may have something like body dysmorphia although I've never gotten an official diagnosis of that, but essentially I'm just convinced that I'm ugly which bothers me to the point that I cry over it often, and I have a really hard time imagining someone being attracted to me, even though it has apparently happened. So I'm sure that doesn't help. I am in therapy already for depression and anxiety and although my self esteem issues have definitely come up, I have a hard time talking about it, and I know that trying to bring up my sexual confidence will be way harder. I guess I'm just looking for any advice or anyone who has felt the same. Sorry for the long post."

But with her I am reaching a new level of vulnerability where Im finding myself cumming faster or needing more time to reboot after we fuck.

What he has trouble with is vulnerability, so I let him take control. I let him explore me however he wanted, and it worked! Right before penetration, I could sense his internal conflict. Turns out, he loves it when I claw into his back with my nails. Apparently, that was the last push he needed to get over that emotional wall. He growled into my ear ""take off your panties"" and oh boy, I never expected him to be commanding like that. He turned out to be rather dominant, and I loved it. Afterward, he told me it was still a little difficult for him to get past that mental block, but once he did everything came naturally (just like I did ba dum tss).

How do you find out what turns you on? Ive been watching porn for years and I typically watch the same kind as its the only thing that gets me there. However, I wouldnt never want to do any of it in real life. I otherwise have no idea what I like. I havent tried much but Ive done a bunch of different positions and oral/hand stuff and I dont find any of it that exciting, and am uncomfortable with some of it. 2. How can I learn to be more okay with vulnerability? I realize sex is supposed to be an extremely vulnerable activity but Ive had a fear of being vulnerable for a long time. I was raised to see failure as something terrible and not a learning experience, and opening up in the past has lead to negative consequences. As such a lot of activities make me feel extremely uncomfortable. I believe this fear is sort of preventing me from knowing myself as a sexual person. 3. What is the line between confidence and arrogance? How do you be confident? I always hear that confidence is the sexiest quality you can have and I have none of it. For some reason I seem to associate it with arrogance/self obsession and so now I have no clue how to be confident. 4. Am I supposed to have sexual instincts? Sex always feels very unnatural on my part because I dont know what Im supposed to be doing. I have to think about every little thing: how Im breathing, what my hands are doing, should my eyes be open or closed? Naturally I dont have an instinct to do anything but I know I cant just lay there. However its tiring to have to think about everything Im doing."

The happiness it fills me with is similar to a really nice tight hug when you badly needed one after an emotionally exhausting day. I can't cum during sex, but it doesn't bother me because I am already so beyond satisfied with the emotional aspect and the idea of sex. It's the same reason I can't imagine hooking up with someone.

I don't fear vulnerability at all. I am a very emotionally open and vulnerable person to the point of naivety. I only fear being made fun of at times because I've experienced it very open. People just think they can say whatever they like to me because I'm so receptive. I am confident in my body and just want to let loose and just... do it and feel good, but I worry so much the other person will make fun of me for getting into it. I also feel the need to keep the conversation going and make sure I giggle and stuff just because I get worried the other person will have something to say and just not say it if I don't. I'm not even nervous during sex, I think my partners nervousness affects me though and I'm a super nurturing person and empathic too so I kinda take on their nervousness. I've tried the 'take the lead and be really confident and get into it yourself so they follow' approach, but then they just get insecure or feel like I'm being too much for them. I dream all the time not about sex itself perse, but about having a really vulnerable, intimate and pleasurable time with someone where there are no expectations, I can be my true self and be seen as nothing but beautiful. Like pure pleasure. I haven't had that experience with anyone. My first experience was assault, so I mean... duh. But all the other ones sure I felt little spikes of pleasure but I was so held back by the anxiety I felt coming off from them, or the awareness that they will probably make fun of me. Eek. Is their any kinda secret to just relaxing and focusing on your own pleasure? I'm so empathetic it is so frustrating, I just wanna be fucked or pleasured sometimes but I'm busy worrying about my partners needs to enjoy it or even feel good myself."

Ive struggled for a while finding someone who fits all the things that make me comfortable outside of the bedroom. Ive recently had partners who I have had a strong emotional connection with, are kind and open communicators, and now fit the bill of someone Im interested being with sexually (recently discovered gayness aside). Now Im at a point where I am confident with delivering a fulfilling experience for my partner, but Im still at a loss for how to be there for myself. I can admit I still struggle with body issues (vulnerability of being butt naked is a big step from owning how I look fully clothed) and due to the tumultuous nature of previous partners, Ive never been with someone consistently to find out what I like from another person. I have made small steps in being vocal for what I want, but at a certain time limit Im embarrassed that its taking so long for me to reach an orgasm. This is previously accompanied by gently directing my partner, and then quietly waiting to see if I enjoy whats happening. And often, acts that should be sexually satisfying have no spark for me whatsoever, aka I should be getting some pleasure but instead it just feels like a sensation-less act. So I cut myself off when I feel its becoming a pointless endeavour, and switch to pleasuring my partner. If I had to guess, my nerves are largely coming into play, as well as the hopeful expectation that I will finally reach an orgasm. What hovers over my head is that this is something Ive never had with another person, though by myself reach one no trouble. My question is, what is the mental Xanax that lets somewhat sexually inexperienced people for themselves just enjoy the experience? I realize not every encounter ends in an orgasm, but is it something I really want to get out of a partnership, and share with someone else. As well as just enjoying whatever happens long enough to get some satisfaction from the fun of sexual acts. Maybe its a big ask, but I doubt Im the only 26 year old who just wants to enjoy sex as every other copulating human on the planet."

I suppose Ill summarize the relationship thus far so anyone who takes the time to read this can have a better understanding of the dynamics and standing of our relationship. **TL/DR at the bottom.** It has had its ups and downs, as well as painful curveballs. I have had depression and anxiety disorders from a young age, and she was born with the same, but she also has bipolar 2 disorder. We met at work in the winter of 2018. We both were delivery drivers for a well known pizza chain. We started off as work friends, she approached me and started up a nice conversation. She is more socially outgoing than I am. We thought highly of each other and found each other attractive. After a few weeks to a month of being strictly friends with just a tad of flirting thrown in, she invited me over to her house to hang out. We sipped some wine and smoked some pot with her roommates, then went into her room to watch a movie. We got to cuddling and ended up hooking up. I left later in the night and went home. Things were going well, we had a friends with benefits type of relationship at that point and for the following months. Time passed and I had begun to fall for her. She was/is sweet, friendly, warm, beautiful and more. She definitely felt the female equivalents of these feelings for me, but due to her past and her current situation she didnt feel like she wanted a romantic relationship. I was disappointed but accepted this. We truly did/do have a great and deep connection. The people she interacted with from her town did her wrong more often than not and she didnt have any close friends, I was the only one. Thus, we got into a deep personal/sexual relationship. She had even told me she loved me on the phone one night. I felt I loved her too. When we werent hanging out after work, often times shed call me on the phone and we would have long talks about almost anything. We had gone on as friends with benefits for probably around half a year or so, maybe longer, until she hit the point where she felt I was trying too hard to get her into a concrete romantic relationship. I saw where she was coming from and backed off a bit. I didnt want her to feel smothered. For this next time period I need to briefly explain her family and living situation. Her mother is an alcoholic and an ex drug addict- not a model parent by any stretch of the imagination. She had verbally and physically abused my fiance as a child. Her father has been absent since she was around 5 years old, and was stuck with her mother. My fiance grew up in a shitty small town with a fair share of crime and drug use. She became somewhat of a hoodlum herself as shes told me and did some unsavory things. Her mother met a man named Bob and was involved with him for a time. They had a relationship of sorts, I dont really know the full extent of it, but my fiance looked to him as a father figure. He is a tax preparer and owned a few houses that he rented out in the same town. After my fiances mother and Bob ended things, Bob let my fiance stay in one of his houses when she was 17 or so. She paid the bills there and took care of herself. She had to stay afloat by working multiple jobs and tried to put herself through a local community college. This next part could very well belong in r/ Cringetopia, hold onto your hats. She has almost always struggled to make ends meet. This all becomes relevant now when I say that she had a sugar daddy for a couple months. This was after I backed off when she felt I was trying too hard with her. I still liked her a lot, Id dare to say I still loved her. I still quite shamefully look back at this particular time because I kept holding onto feelings while she developed them for a 40 something year old man. I was disgusted. I thought I could have been a source of financial support if shed wanted to be romantically involved with me. It sounds so stupid I know, I wanted to omit this part but I figure it speaks something about the both of us. Her financial struggles and feeling somewhat hopeless, and for me the perhaps desperation of my situation with her. The worst moment of this chapter in our relationship has to be when I had spent the night at her house, woke up with her and hung out. She then told me that her sugar daddy Mike was going to be coming over. I should have gone home. I cant tell you why I stayed. Maybe I thought if I were there they wouldnt do anything sexual. I was sitting on her couch in the living room when he showed up. I remember thinking I could beat the shit out of this guy which made me feel like him and her couldnt possibly have hit it off that well, among other reasons. They went into her room together. I walked up to the door maybe 20 min or so later to tell her something and I see Mike laying on her bed on his back and she was straddling him. Both clothed, nothing sexual. But I felt like dirt. Like a brainless fool. I left at that point but it should have been the minute she told me hed be coming over. Anyways, their relationship fizzled out after a month or so. She began reaching out to me after that, and we slowly got closer. I was still feeling like an imbecile but I didnt want to be shitty and not still be her friend. Her life has been a lot harder than I have described previously. I get it. Around the skeevy sugar daddy period, I began to work on myself a lot more. I wish it didnt have to come to that for me to get some real motivation but there I was. I quit smoking pot, (I used to be a real pothead) I took steps to joining a union carpenters apprenticeship and more. I felt driven. She saw this and became more interested. We kept talking and hanging out and having sex and eventually we got into an actual romantic relationship. This was around July of 2019. It finally happened. At this point I was able to push the shame and guilt aside and try to make things work. During that fall of 2019 she proposed to me. Shes not very romantic or lovey dovey so thats how she felt comfortable bringing up spending our lives together. She got me a ring, nothing fancy but it was a sweet gesture. I got her one a couple months later.This brings us to our current standing. **Finally**, I know. We have an apartment together and have had it for about 3 months. Cohabitation has been interesting. Good and bad, but the bad is standing out. She has issues with my lack of proper communication, vulnerability, listening skills, etc. She feels I am not reciprocating her openness, vulnerability, etc. It makes her feel undervalued and depressed. I understand her on this. I had only one previous long term relationship, so Im pretty inexperienced. It was from 7th to 8th grade with a toxic, manipulative girl. I am 2000% over it, believe me, but I cant help but feel that some of the toxic effects of that relationship somehow still linger. I was nervous to properly communicate my feelings, I felt controlled, and feared her becoming angry with me. Its now late February of 2020 and I dont know what to do. I have written down, researched and studied these things that I need to improve for the sake of our relationship but somehow I have trouble implementing them. Its infuriating. We really love each other and we want us to last a lifetime. She says I am not on thin ice with her but I somehow have trouble believing her. This makes me anxious and screw things up. Not giving her my full attention because my mind feels jumbled, not communicating my feelings, not being vulnerable, etc. Now that Im writing this I feel like the underlying problem is my anxiety. In my research I have found that anxiety can wreak havoc on a relationship. This is not good. I am in the process of trying to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I am more than likely starting a new job on Monday. I am a carpenters apprentice but the nature of that is you will be on and off different jobs. This one in particular is probably going to be the hardest one Ive ever worked if it goes as expected. It is an outage at the #7 Blast Furnace at US Steel in Gary. It is massive. Itll be a couple month job at least and well probably be working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. Id hold off and wait for a different job but Ive been laid off since early this month and we need the money. She got a second job early this year so shes busy too. I will not be able to see a therapist if this job goes as expected, Ill have to wait till its finished. She has an appointment this Saturday to see one so Im happy for her about that, I just wish I wouldve seen one sooner, Ive been depressed and apathetic about it and didnt get around to this until this week. I am a master procrastinator. To summarize, I would appreciate any feedback, advice, tips, etc. about how I can maintain and fix the problems that I brought to this relationship. Thank you so much for even reading. **TL/DR:** I have weakened our relationship by not reciprocating my fiance's open communication, vulnerability, and honesty about feelings. I also need to be more present with her when she talks to me, and not let my anxiety jumble my thoughts. I am seeking therapy for my anxiety, it destroys relationships and how my mind functions. I need advice and feedback as to how I can implement the research I've done and things I've learned."

I lost my dad in January 2018 to cancer diagnosed in 2017. I'm estranged from my father so learning he was diagnosed the day after my 21st was really confusing for me, since i had a plan to get to know him after my 21st(seeing as he was an alcoholic) met a girl at a concert shortly after learning of his diagnosis, i was 21, she was 17, all the parental consents were there, but i was lonely and without understanding the full circumstances of the situation jumped into my first fully sexually active relationship. i lost my virginity (PIV) to the woman described and what was intially a fun and vibrant sex life became balls to the wall BDSM and some not so comfy fantasies that led me to being someone who i am not in the bedroom, this ranged from really rough rape fantasies too me being asked to pretend to be a sibling, all filmed type nonsense. i was completely blind to how bad it was and kept justifying it to myself by saying things such as ""who wouldn't want their gf to be into this kinky stuff, i guess i should appreciate it"" as these ideas perpetuated i became so focused on my performance and position as a role it began to eat my soul. in the end this girl was very toxic for me in ways almost not worth explaining in this post. Physically, Mentally, Emotionally abusive and amidst my dad's passing i really didn't know what to do about the entire things just hoping facets of my life would improve. When this girl and I ended things in September of 2018 i was absolutely shattered, i never thought i had fallen in love till this scenario and i was gravely mistaken. after losing her i was now grieving the loss of a loved one, to which the emotion's were repressed due to my own lack of ability to deal with them and expectation to be happy from toxic relationship, and the loss of a lover. From this point i became depressed and very unhappy. Within 2 months i turned my life around and was attending school for engineering, met different girls, had other sexual experiences that weren't nearly as morphed or twisted but still their fair share of kinky and fetish oriented, but none of which i developed true feelings for, especially acknowledging the fact i wasn't really in the appropriate place for a relationship. So fast forwarding to now, i have reconnected with a female friend from my past, always platonic before, that i am absolutely head over heels for. We've been seeing each other since Mid October, so i'd say roughly 4 months. She's a quirky nerd just like me, and our chemistry really clicks. As things develop i can feel my vulnerability opening and i keep finding these walls that i need to slowly take down. I can honestly say i literally feel myself falling in love again and it's the SCARIEST thing in my life due to what happened last time. i'm struggling to not put the filter of what my toxic ex wanted on top of what happens between us, even though its so far from the reality of what i'm experiencing. most of my issues as of recent have spawned in the bedroom and as for that, i previously would struggle to maintain an erection via performance anxiety, but that has since resolved itself, but now i just find myself being really careful, when i truly want to be the passionately aggressive and dominant man that she expresses wanting to see me let loose. i have all these performative issues going on in my brain like what should i be doing because i feel so new to the fact this is the first healthy sexually active serious relationship i've been in. i know a lot of this could be solved by being mindful and communicating but i think i'm looking more for advice on how people changed from being defensive reserved and careful in relationships, to being freely loving and just okay with the way things are naturally unfolding. TL;DR Toxic Ex Girlfriend made sex performative, now i'm very concerned about my healthy relationship and how the consequences are now popping up in places i haven't considered because i haven't been as deeply intimate with someone until now"

My heart especially goes out to people who are insecure due to things their partner may have said regarding sex with them, intentional or otherwise. But I just wanted to share a ray of hope in the darkness with my own story. When I was in high school, I was in a relationship with someone who I lost my virginity to for about two years. I was so nervous about sex because all I could think about was am I doing this right, do I look weird, etc. to the point where I was unable to really enjoy myself. Especially for those of us with self confidence issues, and in my case at the time a severe eating disorder, it can be hard to let go and actually experience pleasure with sex. For a while I actually thought I disliked sex because I just never felt comfortable enough with it. This was difficult for me because I didnt want to let my partner down, and felt like I portrayed myself as a sexual person so thats what I should be. I didnt have a single orgasm with my partner throughout the entire relationship, and I was too uncomfortable to voice my feelings about it or say what I wanted. This led to sex feeling like a chore, or something I had to put up with. I never told my partner about these feelings because I blamed myself for feeling that way. Fast forward to college. The relationship ended with high school, as we were going our separate ways, and as Id been in that serious relationship for 2 years, I felt alone and craved emotional intimacy. However, I didnt want to get into a relationship right at the beginning of my freshman year of college, so for the first few weeks I tried the good old one night stand. I have nothing against hook up culture, as long as both parties are doing this in a healthy and consensual manner. However, as I was trying to use unsatisfactory sex to fill an emotional void, this just made me feel more alone and depressed than ever. Luckily I realized this after about a couple weeks and 5 people, and stopped. Thats when I met my current boyfriend, who has been such a blessing in my life. Never have I had a partner be so invested in making me feel comfortable with myself as well as with him. I was afraid of being vulnerable in sex, but he helps me to enjoy that vulnerability and makes me feel beautiful while doing so. He was the first person I was ever able to orgasm in front of, and our open and clear communication about our likes and dislikes has helped us to continue having even better sex every time. We have been able to try so many new things together, and have found so many things we didnt even know we enjoyed, and I am so grateful for him. He goes out of his way to make me feel safe and comfortable, and this subreddit has helped me to appreciate that all the more. So to all of you who have felt this way, you are not alone. I promise you, it gets better. Just focus on being comfortable with yourself and your partner outside of sex, and have clear communication with your partner about what you both want. Its understandable if this is difficult for you, and if this is the case, be open about it! Say you have a hard time expressing what you want, and ask that your partner be understanding and assist you in any way they can. If its really too difficult to even bring up, consider a sex and relationship therapist. Healthy and comfortable sex can be such an important factor in relationships, and it can really impact your overall happiness together. Best of luck to all of you, and again if youre struggling you are not alone!"

It makes me embarrassed to say things so explicitly. I'll cover my face with my hands or have to look away or close my eyes or smile too bashfully or have my voice get all weird if I'm asking my partner for something. Maybe someone would find it cute, but my partner does not. (They want confidence, and my lack of confidence / bashfulness / embarrassment is not a turnon to them.) This isn't a problem that's unique to my partner. I'm just like this. I've always had trouble asking for what I want, just in life, and I guess sex is an extra layer of vulnerability that makes me act weird when I try to ask for things. Sometimes, I feel like the wording is silly, or that my partner is going to laugh at me for wanting one thing or another. I'm not really sure how to get over this. How do I get over it?? I guess it's a combination between not being sure how to say what I want and a fear of judgement. I'm not sure what even to ask my partner to do to help support me through this? Please let me know if you have advice or have gone through a similar issue yourself :)"
50,vulnerability,sex,Why do I feel uncomfortable to try to be sexy?

As an adult, I'd like to turn on a guy but I'm uncomfortable to try to be sexy such as wearing a lingerie or making sexy moves. I guess it is because trying to be sexy feels too vulnerable for me. I'm more comfortable to make a guy laugh... That is also in my nature. Guess how I did seduce my FWB? He isn't the type to try to seduce a girl in a traditional way, either. We are very alike btw. We just started to make jokes and use funny metaphors. What I said got him cracked up, so that led us to hooking up. When we want to hook up, we rely on humor. I'm not really like other women. I wouldn't flirt sexually or try to be sexy because that feels too vulnerable. I just say funny or sarcastic things."
51,vulnerability,sex,Is it possible that my very thick ex-BF ruined sex with smaller guys for me?,1,eo9vl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/eo9vl0/is_it_possible_that_my_very_thick_exbf_ruined_sex/,2020-01-14 07:35:16,"The guy I had the best sex of my life with was very, very thick. Basically as thick as my wrist. I know it sounds crazy but we measured it once and it was slighlty over 6 inches in circumference, almost 6.5. He was also longer than I was used to but not so long that he couldn't pound me once I was aroused enough. Before him, I had been able to orgasm from penetration with most of my bf's and I thought I knew what great sex was. But once I met him, everything changed. The first time we had sex, he made me orgasm in a way I had never experienced. My entire body would shake and I couldn't stop it, it felt like he was pushing my vaginal walls in every direction at once and the feeling was amazing. On top of that, he was also the best lover I've ever been with. I don't know where the cliche comes from that guys with big dicks are terrible lovers, but he was the exact opposite. He was dominant and extremely confident but also affectionate and very perceptive. I felt like he always knew what was going on inside my mind and body and would adapt immediately to doing the thing that would make me cum the hardest. That allowed me to trust him and really open myself up to him, and as a result my orgasms gained in intensity as we built that trust and vulnerability to higher and higher heights. A few weeks into our relationship, I actually had an orgasm so strong that I had tears in my eyes solely from the intensity of it. I remember laying there in shock trying to get my bearings. I felt as if I'd just come back from a trip to another dimension, it honestly felt like a spiritual experience. I fell madly in love with him, I think partly because of the constant massive flooding of oxytocin in my brain, and also because he was legitimately amazing in every way I could think of. You know the kind where you stop making a list of his qualities but instead look at him as perfect in every way because you're basically losing your mind lol. He eventually left for grad school in Europe and as devastated as I was, I knew I couldn't legitimately ask him to stay monogamous in a long distance relationship, so we broke up and left it as ""who knows what the future holds"" and are still in contact, but I know (he's not hiding it) that he's dating other girls. Anyway...since then I've also dated other guys, three of them in the last year, but I haven't been able to orgasm with any of them :( They're not as good lovers it's true, but the second one was actually pretty good and still couldn't make me cum. And I've come to the realization that it's probably due in large part to them not being thick enough. While I was having sex with those guys I felt insufficiently filled up, it was very clearly a feeling of disappointment. I fear that my ex's dick was so pleasurable in the way it filled me up that anything less is now disappointing and underwhelming to the point where I'm not able to have orgasms. I'm seriously really fucking scared. I've actually looked up how rare a dick as thick as \~6-6.5 inches is and it's incredibly rare, maybe a handful of guys out of a thousand...on top of that, add being a really good-looking, smart and confident great lover, and it's gotta be 1 in a million odds or less. I think I would've been fine if he'd just been a mediocre lover with a huge dick, but I think the fact that he was so amazing in bed created an association between dick thickness and pleasure in my brain way beyond just the physical aspect that a bigger dick feels better as far as physical sensations. I don't know what to do. I'm hoping over time my brain will be able to reset to lower standards, but I'm honestly not sure it's possible. My orgasms were so strong with him that they feel etched in my brain forever. No matter which guy I'm dating, I think about him instead and wish he was the one fucking me. When i touch myself I always think about him and the way he used to touch me and look at me. It's killing me...my true hope is that he'll come back and be with me again, but I know it's very unlikely. I'm sorry, I know I'm ranting. I just don't know what to do...has anyone experienced something like this? Can I go back to enjoying sex with smaller guys ever again? I'm seriously thinking about getting hypnotized so that I can forget my time with him and go back to normal..."

These last months however, I have begun to get comfortable verbalising my secret inner thoughts during sex. I wanted to share a short list of things that helped me get over the hurdle. *These are mostly points taken from different articles across the web* * Its going to feel stupid. Practice saying things by yourself. At home and even in the mirror. Practice until you get over that initial feeling. * Try to set an atmosphere of no-failure with your partner. So that if you try a phrase that turns out all wrong, you can just laugh at it together. Playfulness over seriousness. * Pay attention to the things you really want and just say them. It can be simple as long as its loaded with true intention. A genuine ""I want you"" can be so hot and trumps any half hearted phrase even if it is longer and more descriptive. * Tip on how to describe what you want. Simply tell him/her what you like It feels so good when you X my Y - Your tits are perfect, I want to \_\_\_\_ them, or You look so hot when you \_\_\_\_. * Dirty talk is part of the fantasy of sex, and fantasy doesnt always translate perfectly to reality. This is ok, and you should both understand this. The largest mistake that I used to make was taking it all way too seriously. I wanted to sweep my SO away by unexpectedly whispering the most perfectly composed filth she had ever heard. Holding on to that expectation made me feel like a failure. I want to include some bonus quotes on the subject of vulnurability to get you going. Because willingness to be vulnurable is key. Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren't always comfortable, but they're never weakness. - *Bren Brown, Daring Greatly* ""You cannot be a powerful and life-changing presence to some people without being a joke or an embarrassment to others.""- *Mark Manson, Models: Attract women through honesty* **Now. What are some tips you would like to add on to this list?**"
53,vulnerability,sex,"My husband (32M) and I (32F) have had friends participate in threesomes and other group sex activities, but weve never had the chance.

It kind of ha s had both of us thinking about this. Weve always considered trying that out with someone or another couple, but weve just never had anyone express interest in us. Its kind of a bummer kind of thing to have heard stories like this from this friend and others, because it seems like this sort of thing may be becoming more of a social norm from what we hear, and yet were somehow never a part of it. My husband and I have only ever been with each other, I suppose were both curious to try a new adventure like that together and were both a little let down and sad that the opportunity never crops up for us like it seems to for others. We visited a swinger club a few months ago to see if it was for us, and really it just wasnt. Most of everyone there was decades older than us and were kind of creepily pushy about it in not so subtle ways. We kind of realized that if wanted to explore that sort of thing in any way, some sort of casual thing wasnt the way to go because it just felt a little awkward and gross to us. If we ever do explore it, we sort of feel like it would need to be with someone we have at least a little bit of emotional connection to and can trust as a friend. We certainly wouldnt want any deep poly type relationship with anyone else, we often joke that one husband or one wife is plenty enough to worry about. But someone were friends with that we can trust with vulnerability and some intimacy? Sure. It seems like some of our friends enjoy it, so it it seems like it isnt entirely impossible. It just sucks feeling kind of apart, invaluable, unwanted and undesirable so much. We of course have each other and thats great. However, it would be nice to know that we arent just living inside our own bias bubbles. It would be great to know that other people find us desirable and worth it sometime. Anyone have any advice on all this?"
54,vulnerability,sex,Weird Feeling Around Men? Anxious? Horny? Trauma?,1,eu6aje,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/eu6aje/weird_feeling_around_men_anxious_horny_trauma/,2020-01-26 23:48:24,"Throughout my life I've had this reoccurring feeling and it's been really troubling me as of late. Ive recently had my sister's boyfriend stay with us while we look after my parents house. Just me, my sister and her partner. This guy is a nice person but absolutely not my type, but when he's in the same room as me I feel really weird. Im 99% sure it's not my body getting turned on, but the feeling is in a similar ballpark... A similar vulnerability? It's like anxiety - like my space is being invaded by someone bigger than me, whether that be physically, through their intelligence, age, whatever. I remember this feeling from being told off by my male tutors who I got on really well with as a child. There were a couple of male tutors in middle school where I was their favourite - perhaps because I was a bit different, singled out so obviously more vulnerable - I'm not saying they had any weird intentions, but they made extra effort to speak to me personally. They would call me by the same nickname and wink at me, In a sweet way, I guess. It seemed I'd have these slightly more 'special' relationships with male teachers, and it did make me feel special when I was around them... My work was always their favourite, they'd call it 'genius' and get others to come over and look at what I'd done... This same tutor actually told me what Playboy was when I found the bunny logo cute and put a little sparkly gif of it on my little school blog. He had quite a piercing stare - I could feel him looking deep into my eyes even when I was looking away because I was embarassed when he told me the real meaning of it. BUT as soon as some authority was put over me I'd feel this horrible mushy mixed feeling of anger, anxiety, attraction in some cases, but also complete dismissal of their existence on my part. It wasn't just for the moment I was told off, I'd feel this way forever about them. I know it's not a strictly weird sexual thing I've developed from a kid as I've also felt this way around my brother when I've had to look after my parents house with him a year or so ago. He'd be in the room with me and suddenly I'd feel invaded mentally and physically. He'd work out and lift weights around me and I'd almost feel angry... I love my brother to bits but I felt like a loathed him around this time. My sister's partner shouts at the dogs when they bark and raises his voice around her when they argue, and it triggers this horrible response in me, which feels like passive aggressive submission, which I can only really put down to a trauma reaction of some sort, I'm just not sure where it came from. Same with virtually any guy I've had sex with beside my partner - I end up hating being around them. Like knowing I've been so vulnerable with someone I still had to see everyday at college made me feel so uncomfortable within myself, which made me anxious and angry and subsequently hate them for making me feel this way. Like their presence just shakes me up. Now my dad is back from holiday and I'm now feeling a slight hint of this feeling around him! It's driving me mad! I don't hate men, I love them honestly, and my partner has helped me get over a lot of weirdness I had around men to the point that after about 9 years of watching porn (I'm 21) I can finally watch just guys or watch videos where they're the main focus and get off on it. It could be an age thing, I am attracted to older guys as my partner is 10 years older than me. But I'm struggling to figure out where this is coming from as I've felt this way since a child, not just since my last abusive relationship when I was 17 which is where some other trauma happened. Possibly related? I suppose I need to take all of this to therapy, but has anyone else felt this weird, anxious, vulnerable irritability around men that haven't done anything wrong?"

First time posting and having an account on reddit but def not my first time on the site. I love coming here to find answers and advice. I need some advice and I cant really talk to any family or friends about it. My bf and I have been together for about 6 months. Were pretty serious. Hes the best guy Ive ever dated. Back ground info: Ive been physically, mentally and sexually abused by more than one boyfriend, mostly in my teen years (Im 28 now). I never told my family or friends about the abuse Ive gone thru, especially not in detail. I never have sought help and never went to the police. The abuse has left me emotionally scarred and with mental health issues ranging from mood swings, fear of strangers, paranoia, PTSD, fear of new places, vulnerability issues and nightmares. My bf is very understanding, he has had his own fair share of trauma in his life. We live in a tiny trailer together and even work together and we never get tired of each other or fight. We have very compatible personalities and we want a lot of the same things in life. Heres where it gets complicated. He has been much more adventurous sexually and for much longer than I have. He is slightly bi and been into group sex since his teen years. Hes been with couples, been in an open relationship and dated multiple people at once. Even tho he has reassured me that he wants to be with me and only me right now, I cant help but be intimidated a little bit. Im not gona lie, the idea of any of those things makes me feel really jealous and insecure. He knows this and understands how I feel and why. But he also has been very up front with me about the fact that he classifies himself as kind of a slut and he does fantasize about group sex with me and other people and that he isnt sure how that may affect our relationship in the future. Im trying very hard to be open but my own experiences have left me with a very warped view of sex. And no lie, Im sightly bi also and the idea of trying a threesome someday does excite me. But i have such a hard time getting past my anxious and insecure feelings. He doesnt pressure me to do anything but at the same time i do WANT to be more open to what hes into.

I disclosed with him that not only am I a virgin, but that I could possibly have endometriosis, so penetration could be extremely painful for me. In my time of vulnerability, he basically didn't care. So, I stopped talking to him. For a while, I felt disheartened. But it's not the end of the world and I'm only 21. With more research and still getting to know myself and my body, I've discovered non-penetrative sex and it seems like something I could really be into.

I crave them to be near me, and they are in my thoughts for weeks after. I am a 17-year-old male teenager, and therefore it is often young girls aged 17 to 20 I suddenly can get very drawn too. I have seen my share of Bondage porn, but I don't enjoy that anymore, and therefore this weirds me out. It is not like I want to dominate them, but I still have a huge wish to be with them sexually WHILE they are sad or scared. There is something about a sad girl's scared face I really find attractive. It is weird, because it is not like i want them to be unhappy.... This can happen in real life, but also with characters from movies. A good example is the Netflix series ""The Witcher"", where I have been really drawn to Ciri, and the scenes where she is vulnerable. I am normally a person who is in control of my emotions, and always able to pinpoint the feeling and what it exactly is. I can't do that here, and it freaks me out that I might actually get turned on by vulnerability. Not physical, but emotional vulnerability. I hope you could understand my English and are willing to help me get to the root of this emotion, and why I find the sad girls so attractive."

There was a sharp intake of breath, and the look on his face was pure vulnerability. I could tell he had been nervous about showing it to me.

Insight and suggestions requested. My husband [26m] and I [25f] have always had a healthy relationship with sex, for the most part. I have endometriosis, which has created blips on the sex timeline, but at our best we both have high sex drives and enjoy one another. When we were first dating, I was afraid to even have sex because of the vulnerability associated with it and my body. What if it hurts? What if I have to say stop? Will he be kind? What if I can't, will he react badly? Etc. I brought it to therapy with me and figured it out. Things got easier for awhile. Then, in September, I started Lupron - a hormone against that put me in medical menopause to treat my endo. Yiiiikes. I lost my sex drive entirely, which was an identity issue for me, plus I was generally depressed. That created some separate issues, but we maintained open and honest communication and worked through it. I'll admit that it was tough, but it feels resolved. I realized that I couldn't handle what the med was doing, so I stopped. Over the last month or so, I've slowly started to feel more like myself. My sex drive is on its way to, if not entirely, back! Yay! But I've found myself back in the ""I don't know how to initiate"" place. It's not that I don't *want* to, I do, it just feels like a literal block. I'm kind of scratching my head on this one. I have answers to all of the questions I was afraid of in the beginning. I don't necessarily feel anxious. It just feels like I... can't. I've expressed this and he's told me I can literally just ask, but somehow that almost feels harder. So, anyone out there with this issue: how did you overcome it? Did you figure out the source of the problem? Those of you with sex-related health problems, have you experienced anything similar? Everyone else, how? How do you ask your favorite human for sex, or let them know that you want them? What does your partner do to let you know they're horny?"

Or have you had this and realized you can be this vunerable with anyone and actually like casual sex? Context (I apologize for the length. I'm still processing this. You reading this is obviously optional): Last night I had the most intense, letting go of control, orgasm with myself, and with anyone for that matter. Before, I had been exploring my sexuality and not caring what type of relationship and sex it was (one night stand, series of one night stands, sex budy, bf) and what emotions or lack of if they where there, or goal oriented or not (no orgasms) or spontaneous or planned. I wanted it and liked it all. However, I had my first orgasm 3 months later after trying this. I kept doing all forms of casual sext until I found someone who I wanted to be exclusive and committed to. This soon ended and I kinda went back to my old ways but not as frequent and with wanting to establish more of a trust or some form of connection such as friendship, so this obviously means less because it is hard to find someone who feels the same. Anyway, now that I've had this intense orgasm, I feel like I wouldnt be ready to feel that in anyone else's arms unless they are at least a friend with benefits, with any type or level of friendship involved, not even a one night stand because the other person might be bad in bed and why settle for anything less now that I know what good sex and intense orgasms feel (mutually exclusive included - I dont need an orgasm and enjoy sex a lot but obviously this kind of sex still needs to be satisfying and with mutual effort in pleasing both parties). I'm just realizing that with any type of sex - spontaneous, planned, orgasm included or not, I want it to be good and am realizing that I can't give that level of vulnerability to someone who isnt trying to get to know me at least as a friend or acquaintance they trust. I need some reliability and trust to be that vulnerable."

In my sexual lifetime, only one man has ever touched my face and thats my current partner (29m). My previous lovers touched me everywhere but my face. Its like they avoided it so I waited three years of a break from all men and sex to finally have a mans touch on my face when I decided to date again. When he first kissed me and placed his hand on my cheek, it felt like an electric shock in a good way. I felt cherished, desired and safe from such a confident yet sensual touch. It woke me up and made me realize what Ive been missing out on. Also, I felt his emotions through his touch and it made me feel closer to him. Every time he places his hand on my cheek, whether hes kissing me on the lips or neck or penetrating me, I still get those feelings and feel the same emotions from him. So the last time we had sex, I was ready to return the touch back to him despite the fact weve been together for awhile. Ive never touched his face due to shyness and my own vulnerability, but when I touched his face, it felt so natural and intimate in a surreal way. Caressing his stubble and jaw and stroking his cheekbones: absolutely divine and therapeutic. Hes the first and only man Ive touched in such a way because my feelings for him are true. And since I also trust him, he can touch my face. I avoided touching previous mens faces because of the lack of true trust and depth between us and the fact that they didnt touch my face as well. I view the face as very personal. Edit: Face touching during sex , by both me and my partner, is almost sacred to me."

It's strangely arousing so every time I look into his eyes I'll cum but it's in a sort of uncomfortable way? Like I feel like he can see into my soul in that moment and while I want him to it also scares me so I close my eyes within seconds. He's also quite shy about eye contact, so it barely ever happens, and I really want it to because I feel like it'd bring us even closer. However when I'm in the moment, I just can't help but close my eyes. I'm not sure what I said makes so much sense, but even just hearing how other people feel about eye contact and how they deal with the feelings of vulnerability that comes with it would help :)"

I feel like if any girls I potentially date find out they will see me as less. If my male friends find out they would be like wtf. I dont have it hard. I just wish girls I knew were more accepting about bisexuality. I dont want to have to join LGBT or a safe space to find people that will accept me. I like where I am and the people I am around.

Anyway he fingered me and it felt good and definitely increased my pleasure overall. But today I feel kind of uncomfortable about it and I dont know why.

Ive always been the high libido one, although my boyfriend is quite sexual himself. He masturbates more than I do. I prefer sex to masturbation so I try to have sex whenever I can, but I understand that these two are different and he enjoys alone time as well. We usually have maintained a frequency of about 1x/week, and I used to nag him quite a bit to have sex more often. And I actually did nag, I was not loving or seductive or encouraging, but rather I was entitled and immature. Hes my first long-term relationship and the first man Ive loved, so sex has been a huge learning experience for me with him. This put a strain on our sex life, although his emotions and love for me never wavered, his sexual feelings toward me did. Now, were in a more stable place where Ive admitted fault where it is and Ive accepted his individuality and sexuality and Ive begun to try to understand and listen to his preferences instead of asserting my own. This has led to an organic increase in sexual connection and vulnerability between us both, and our frequency has shot up to about 3-4x/week, with mutual masturbation on top of that. Im stoked! The only problem is that in trying to connect sexually with him, hes opened up about his fantasies and preferences and they involve thinking about me with other women, or him and me with other women. He never wants to have sex with another woman in his fantasy, just play with them (hes realllllly into large breasts, which I have very tiny breasts so this sometimes hurts, but he tries to make me see how he still loves them and me). Or sometimes we just watch his porn or favorite actresses and he likes to watch me watching and telling him hes a good boy. Alternatively, he likes me to tell him a story if theres no porn. He wants me to talk about someone I/we have seen in passing and basically concoct a story about how wed all fool around or treat my boyfriend to a good time. I struggle with this mostly because Im taken out of the moment and feel a great deal of pressure regarding something Ive not had too much experience in and he is relatively vague about what he likes to hear and doesnt give a lot of feedback during. Hes done a great job of working in what I like, but I like him. So its just about him telling me Im doing a good job or telling me Im bad or just typical naughty stuff, and hes into that himself so its always fun just both of us talking dirty on that topic. I never need porn or to think of other things, just him and how he feels and what he does or says to me. So Im torn here, really. Weve never been more connected and Ive never been more physically sexually satisfied with him. And I understand these fantasies and porn watching takes pressure off my boyfriend that hes felt for a while in our relationship because Ive made him feel a bit rotten about not satisfying my needs or having sex as often as Id like. And he really thinks so far that Im enjoying the porn and the ease and connection with it just as must as him, so its not just a selfish need or want from him. I wonder if I give it a while longer and see how we go, we could get into rhythms and start working this out together and hell not need porn or fantasy to feel comfortable and relaxed during sex with me. Dont get me wrong, we make love and have sex just wrapped up and together and he really seems to enjoy that all the same. But that comes organically when we have plenty of time to lounge around and cuddle for hours. When were both busy working, the quicker sex comes from being relaxed and in the mood and Im finding him leaning toward the porn during times like this. And because porn addiction is always mentioned, I can just say Ive only caught him masturbating 4 times since we started dating and two of those times there was no porn involved, and weve lived together for 2 years. Ive also known him to go a week or two without masturbating at all, but Im not sure either of these are any solid evidence against it, Im just not too suspicious of a dependence on porn. More like its a safety blanket for the time being in our sex life. So Reddit, what do you think of this situation? Does it seem odd? Should I let it go on for a while and see how it goes? Should I address this with him, knowing he will be disappointed to hear Im not enjoying the new routines, and likely feeling less connected to me? If everything else is awesome, should I just ask him for reassurance afterward and let his actions show that Im enough for him? - **tl;dr: Ive made my boyfriend apprehensive about sex, weve always had sex only 1x/week, but Ive wanted more. Now, we watch porn or my boyfriend wants me to tell him a fantasy story 80% of the time we have sex, but were having sex 3-4x/week and thats awesome for me and my boyfriend feels really happy and connected to me. Do I address my feeling a bit sad or not enough for him? Do I reframe this in my mind? Do I let it go on for a bit and see how it evolves between us? Do I ask to watch less porn?**"
71,vulnerability,sex,Dissecting my kink,1,dx26y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dx26y9/dissecting_my_kink/,2019-11-16 15:27:29,"For years, I've had a kink and wondered ""why this?"" It was the sort of thing that I enjoyed as a fantasy, but would have hated as a reality. Hearing from people who are into it IRL, their stories never rang true for me. There were simple explanations, but those didn't ring true, either. So, I've spent some time breaking it down and I think I've found it. I'm posting because I've read a lot of posts here where people are struggling with fantasies that bother them in some way. I'm hoping that my own deductions will be helpful in some way. So, my fantasy is cheating wives. I'm a heterosexual cismale, never married, and this fantasy manifests in a couple ways. I love erotica told from the woman's perspective, when it is her first time cheating and especially if some exterior force is motivating her. For example, a wife secretly doing porn because of financial difficulty. Blackmail or coercion is a bridge too far, though. There's also a woman doing something like stripping for her fianc's bachelor party, getting caught up in the moment and getting gangbanged. The other manifestation is husbands getting video or photos of their wives cheating, again, if it's the first time. Breaking it down, the triggering elements are passion and jealousy. I don't have jealousy issues. I'm fine with a partner having a night out with mixed company or having dinner with an old friend who is a guy. However, there have been issues with past girlfriends not making time for our relationship or repeatedly coming over drunk after a night out that I was expressly not invited to. The feeling that I'm getting the dregs, as it were. Which is something I've been able to calmly explain to them, with a variety of results. The passion part isn't hard to understand. I love a sexually charged atmosphere and that intensity of ""I need to fuck you, right now."" People tell me I'm an intense person, in general, so that tracks. This translates into the cheating wife thing for a couple reasons. First, there's the taboo of it. That creates a barrier which requires the atmosphere to reach a certain level of intensity to cross. Men cheating doesn't feel as taboo because it's something of a cliche. I, myself, have never cheated, but there is a cultural narrative that it's psychologically easier for men to do sodespite this having no basis in reality. The passion is also why first times are much more exciting; cheating is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it. Jealousy, in certain doses, can spur passion as well. When you know your partner wouldn't cheat, watching them have a sexy dance with someone else gets your blood up in a really fun way. Additionally, any first year psych student can tell you that seeing a person receive positive social feedback makes them more attractive to you (if it's from your own society). So, seeing a bunch of dudes lusting over your girlfriend makes her more attractive to youprovided you're secure enough in the relationship. Factoring in my IRL fantasies, I hit upon something else. I'm a lingerie guy and I have a whole catalogue of things I would love a partner to do that are predominantly visual for me. I've always wanted a partner to show up at my door in nothing but an overcoat and I have asked for a lap dance as a birthday/Christmas gift (never happened, though). I realized, it's voyeurism. But, specifically, of someone I know. Now, there is power-voyeurism, where the excitement comes from invading someone else's intimacy. For me, however, it's more about peripheral intimacy; accessing intimacy without becoming vulnerable myself. Essentially: safe intimacy. Because intimacy is scary, even with someone you trust. Hence, the lap dance; I'm not vulnerable, but still experiencing the intimacy of someone making themselves vulnerable with me. It's also why I haven't gotten one; that kind of vulnerability is scary. I'm a firm believer in the theory that kinks are usually our brains' way of making something scary safe. So, as someone with a history of personal vulnerability being met with judgment or misunderstanding, it makes sense that my fundamental fantasy would be intense vulnerability where I'm not the one who is actually vulnerable or where the ambient sexuality is so strong that I lose control over myself. So, that's me. I hope this proves helpful to other people."

We met online and weve been almost inseparable since two summers ago. I went over to his house one night and I was planning to lose my virginity. The experience was absolutely horrible. I dont know whether my expectations were too high but I wasnt expecting a bed full of roses nor Marvin Gaye playing in the background. We started out watching a horror movie that he chose out and we were on the sofa keeping each other warm. One thing led to another and I was feeling him up underneath the blankets. We were passionately kissing and pressing our bodies against each other and he proceeds to take off the biker shorts I have underneath my dress. Later on after things get more heated, he starts grinding on me with just my panties on and my legs up in the air. Things get to the point where my panties go who knows where and he starts rubbing up against my pussy and Im starting to get pushed over the edge. I tell him to go get a condom, but he claims he doesnt have one. Confused, because we had been talking about having sex for many months, I refuse and say he cant stick it in. But soon after he still is grinding up on me and pushing my buttons, I made the split second decision to let his slide it in with no condom. He quickly readjusts his position and pushes it inside of me. All these thoughts were bombarding my head and with the horror movie screeching sounds of people being murdered, lights flashing from the TV, I couldnt think straight. I had a love and felt so much vulnerability for him while he was going in and out of me. A few pumps later, he said that was enough for me that night and slipped out. He kissed my forehead and called me a butthead as he went to go to the bathroom. Sitting there vulnerable and exposed in so many ways, I was tearing up. Why did he call me a butthead right after he knew he took my virginity? I did not know what to think. Soon after he came back and we still were cuddling on the couch, and I was just in the mood to get over what had just happened and cuddle with him. After spooning, he told me to get on all fours (on the couch) and he started rubbing his tip on top my pussy, I remind him that he doesnt have a condom, so he suggests that he sticks it in my butt. Im like ehhh but then he reminded me that I said earlier he could do whatever he wanted to me (which was true) so I agreed. I arch my back and relax and as soon as my booty was relaxed he shoved it ALL THE WAY INSIDE (did I mention this guy is pretty well hung?) I welp in pain and jerk back up with my hand covering my butt and hes apologizing profusely with kisses. A month later, my butthole groans still thinking about this moment. He chuckled and asks me Why do you always get hurt when we try something (new)?. He decides that we should give that a break and he ends up standing in front of me and wants me to blow him. I then realized when I put him in my mouth, I could taste my own LITERAL FECES. I didnt want to ruin the moment, so I just was deepthroated and gagged as I took him in and out. At the end of the night after some more cuddling he suggests I should go home because his mother didnt want me there. I understood, and was more than happy to leave. The thing is, I have such a love for this kid that was far more than just a physical attraction. But after this experience, and Im starting to overthink about it constantly, I dont know what or how to feel about him anymore. What should I do?"
73,vulnerability,sex,i oscillate between feeling comfortable and feeling inhibited about sharing my kinks/turn ons with partners or potential partners. Fear of admitting these,1,e0hi9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/e0hi9b/i_oscillate_between_feeling_comfortable_and/,2019-11-23 23:56:12,"Guy here(I live in the US), I tend to find myself oscillating from feeling open and somewhat closed/restricted/inhibited about sharing what turns me on with women I talk to. I have always liked cis women and felt compatible with their genitalia. In more recent years I discovered that trans women at times could be immensely attractive to me. I understand that trans woman do not always want to keep their genitalia they were born with nor do they always like using it. I discovered that attractive woman that are well endowed, more in length than girth, stimulate an erotic/sexual attraction that is of a unique dynamic more pronounced degree of being ""turnt on"" for some reason. Like it presses me buttons(that I did not really know I had before even) to the degree where I fantasize and get off intensely at the notion of submitting to a beautiful woman in high heels who happens to have a long girl dick, or whatever term she wants for her genitalia. I would say I am more leaning towards the submissive side but my kinks are not a desire to be abused, humiliated, or degraded. Specifically, I like deep throating attractive and hung women until they orgasm down my throat or into mouth for me to swallow. I don't know why this turns me on but it strikes a deep chord in me. The emotional vulnerability component in ""submission"" turns me on also very much not just the physical aesthetics of the act. It is just super hot to me to see a women be powerful and show that side to her but in an intimate and caring way that is really bonding for everyone. Like I don't want to be called names or slapped or etc. I don't mind if she like guides my head down to make sure I take her balls deep but again it has be in a nice way and not abusive or throat fucks me in a non abusive way that would make me throw up or something. I also find it enjoyable to just do things for a woman like help her clean, do chores, whatever helping activity really, etc. I however feel somewhat shy about vocalizing this. Like some days I feel like yeah I could verbalize this and affirm these things when that time would come up but I feel like not all women may want a guy to be into these things? I don't know. Like if having these kinds of kinks would be attractive to a woman. I never really disclosed to a cis woman how attracted I can be to some trans women and my interests orally speaking. I also feel this is a huge and nontrivial part of my sexuality and it's a definite itch that I need to scratch. I've come to terms that I like women that have long girl dicks and I feel very compatible with them(not just sexually but romantically/emotionally as much as any cis woman). I don't know if telling a cis women this would make her think different of me or be less attracted to me? Since guys are expected to be more ""dominant""?"

I was talking about sexual vulnerability about kinks that are kinda niche. Were in a LDR (never technically met irl) and I wanted to illustrate that I was a bit uncomfortable with fantasizing too much about something because I wasnt 100% sure hed be that into it in real (i.e., pee, feet), like he has said himselfneither of us have tried these before. I dont want my desire and yearning and anticipation for something to run into a huge brick wall; some things Im super confident about, but others? Im a bit hesitant of and Id like to wait for a green light before diving into them. And then he snapped at me for some reason, saying that he has to have some sort of backdoor for the number of times Ive backstabbed him. I was confused and reeling. I asked him what this wasand the only thing he said he could remember something he said that hurt his feelings a bit and felt like a side swipe. What it waswell. The context is when I was iffy on a certain fantasy he brought up (lets call it the Thing)I said noooo playfullywasnt that I wanted to shut him down but that I wasnt really in the mood for that thing in particular. Then he said stop appeasing all the time, and aggressively supported his point, implying that I was just pretending that I was into the Thing to placate him beforeand also said that we are just talking about hypotheticals and what we logically would be down for. Ironically he even said that hes not even sure he wants it, its a bit dirty (not THAT much but still) but somehow argued that it has to do with ruling passion. Or, likehaving a favorite food. Even if you hate it at the moment, you still logically know you have it. That was his argument. I broke down hard in tears because.well, I try to be a sincere person, being accused of just appeasing him facetiously and pretending to be into it when I fantasized about the subject before (btw I have said Im not that into it all the time and noooo about it before; really depends on my mood whether or not I ache for it) hurt so much. He only tried to make peace when said well, you are the most unique person Ive ever known, maybe you arent like the other people Ive known? And I was just trying to make a point that I didnt operate logically in terms of my desires/wants, while he was insisting that normal people dont rely on whimsical desire states to know what theyd be down for. So while I was breaking down like a baby I tried coming up with points. For example, before you met me, you werent into stinky feetyou arent sure how you feel about it yet. I know. Absolutely silly subject; he has never had a particular thing for it before but after a while with camming and giving suggestions about massaging feet and stuff, hes warmed up to it to where its now almost a kink (helps a lot that hes seen how ridiculously flexible these monsters are) and weve both warmed up to a bit. At the time I said it with a flair likeit better supported my argument that it was a niche thing and that hypothetically were not even sure how much well even be into it. This IS an online-only LDR for now. What weirds me out is that he even said, Well, its kind of hard to not be hurt when you say Im into sniffing rotting, disgusting feet. Its likewhat? I didnt say that! Stinky *can* be fun and fairly neutral; what I was TRYING to imply was that feet is preeeetty, uh*niche.* And that likewise, the stuff he was saying about it being his ruling passion was a bit wrong. Its not a big fetish of his, just something fun to fantasize about. Sorounding back to the conversation yesterday, again, he said he likes to keep a backdoor open because of all the times I backstabbed him. And I tried to defend myself, saying that I wasnt trying to sass him, that I actually genuinely love that he likes my feet so much  after all, its probably my worst feature and I have image issues  and cherish thisthat I wasnt intentionally trying to hurt him or demean him. He seems to really be sensitive to the idea of bad sass from me, though he cant seem to remember them outside of the very, very rare times weve had arguments. In the conversation he ended up saying stuff like I know you better than you know yourself, it seems. That you exploded is proof I am right, if you were right you would have just said I didnt mean it. It hurt a ton. I felt a bitcrazy honestly? Kept on questioning myself and likewise wondering ifwell, when I had said the stinky feet thing, I didnt feel mad or even bitter towards him, I was struggling and just trying to defend myself. I dont think lowly of the lowest limbs in my body, or even liking them as long as it isnt to the point of soliciting random people for picturesbut, he made me feel as if I secretly am some monster and very facetious in nature? That I do things to hurt him without realizing it? I broke down into sobs again and later on he also said that it was laughable that I was crying at this and that I should think of all the actual bad things people go through in the world. I meanI have only cried over him a few times over the past few months andreally nothing else. I am not that emotional of a person. So, there it is. I know this all sounds very stupid of me but, I mean, life can be pretty stupid sook, whatever. It was just quite scary to me that this came up so abruptly andat the bare minimumif it turns out I am wrong and I really was just trying to hurt him, I dont understand why hes conflating &gt;a) Us having a fun conversation about fantasies (while not really being horny) and me opening up about my vulnerabilities as the best context to attack me in; we were joking around just a minute before &gt; &gt;with &gt; &gt;b) Versus me being exasperated at being basically called insincere and sobbing and typing a stupid argument in frustration that ended up being a concealed swipe against him as being an equal playing space. Either ways, it feels bad to me. I think a part of his problem might be the concept of me doing these things and*not admittedly Im doing them on purpose?* Therefore, the insincerity hurts a lot more. But I dont know. I didnt feel angry at him, and Im wracking my feelings and my brain. I didn't want to hurt or demean his kink."
75,vulnerability,sex,"Deep emotional, almost spiritual connections impact sex and sexuality far more than I've ever heard about, and I've learned the hard way how bad it can be.",1,e2tr6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/e2tr6v/deep_emotional_almost_spiritual_connections/,2019-11-28 17:07:08,"Obviously, sex is nice. It's a good thing to be open about and sex of course can be anything between casual and a bond. Perhaps this is more my personal experience, but often so far sex for me is incredibly different based on the connection and situation. For context, I recently went through a breakup. I absolutely do not want this information getting out on anybody so I will use M for my ex girlfriend's name. I am an 18M and she is the same age, we dated nearly 2 years and it was the closest bond I ever had with somebody. She was my first and it didn't take long for sex and arousal to come naturally. I most certainly was not the best at it but we had our fun often. Then somewhat recently, nearly 2 months ago, she broke up with me. It was a huge blow, and the reasoning was...up for pondering, however my family mistreating her was the main cause. Anyways. About a month and half after the breakup, i reconnected with some old friends and ended up getting a friends with benefits situation with a girl we'll call H. Although I'm a very sexual person and enjoyed the act for what we could do, my arousal was extremely limited and I could not exactly... Get hard easily. It's been incredibly embarrassing! Luckily H has been kind and accepting or this would not have gone on. And although I'm not over the break up per se I wasn't thinking of M in the moments at all, but without what I once had I noticed am enormous difference in my performance. I've slowly improved, and mentally I'm perfectly fine with the fwb idea. But it's worth noting how difficult it became in the actual situation. Another thing to mention is how badly it's bothered me that M has done the same. Now, part of her breaking up with me was because she wanted to flirt around, I suppose. That is perfectly within her bounds as she never cheated, and I can go on about how much I hate that or how it affected me but ethically she didn't break any social contracts or whatever. M and I had a moment of vulnerability where we talked about our lives in excruciating detail recently, and I learned a lot about her regretting it and all that, but I also learned 2 weeks after the breakup she began a whole situation with someone older and say, much more experienced than me... I've slowly come to accept all that she said, but all the talk of her new sex life on top of her admitting he's better than me (I did kind of ask but I didn't expect that, I should have)...that has affected me most, emotionally, it seems. To think of someone else pleasing her and doing better. It makes me feel as if it feeling better for her and how easy it is for them means we didn't have that great a personal romantic bond anyways in the end. I'm not sure, I thought so but if it's beat that easily, yknow... I could be over thinking, but it's made me feel the most sick. The point of all this is that of all things our sexual/romantic relationship seems to have the most *emotional* bearing on me. I thought sex could be easier to use freely and not think so much of it in a relationship, but mentally my reaction is one thing, and my heart and sick stomach tells me much more. I now even struggle with masturbation, of all things. Do you have a similar story? What are your thoughts on the way it makes you feel? Feel free to vent, I want to support one another!"

Like many of you out there, I was molested intermittently by my dad and grandmother. I've mostly worked through that stuff as most of it stopped by the time I was around eight or nine, and I saw my grandmother less and the stuff that happened with my dad seemed to be more and more unreal as I got older and our relationship settled into a pretty neutral -- if distant -- one (I lived mostly with my mom). I don't know if it was my mom threatening prosecution on abuse charges or what but he's a completely different person now that he's remarried and had another kid, etc, and we're cool. It almost feels like all of that never happened. Every now and then the reality comes back to me though as it did the last time I went to try losing my virginity and ended up shutting down, trying not to completely lose my shit as I dissociated and tried not to be too cold with the girl, and evasively watching Friends with her on her laptop for an hour before going home to bawl my eyes out. I consider myself a pretty tough -- if somewhat metrosexual (closeted bi) -- guy, so this was terribly out of character for me as I never cry/chow vulnerability (even when alone) as a rule. I'm honestly not trying to make this out as some tumblr-esque self-validating sob story; there are loads of people who have had to deal with far more trauma-related situations and who come from far less privileged backgrounds. I am just wondering what practical advice all of you have for a dude whose 20, has never more than pecked a girl on the lips/made out with a dude as a kid, acts really confident (only three friends know I'm a virgin, and are suspicious of my sexuality), and desperately wants to stop the cycle of girls/guys-who-got-away? I guess this post is both a dating and a sex question, but momentarily intimacy alone seems to be the primary hurdle. It's gotten a lot better since I've discovered I'm a descent flirt with drugs/alcohol to gas me up, but even then I doubt I can go much further. I've never talked to anyone about this (except who my mom, who thinks my attraction to dudes is just a product of molestation/confusion, and refuses to accept it) and never would have thought I would turn to reddit. I guess I'm more desperate for some sort of connection than I thought. Pretty f\*\*\*ing alone tbh. Thanks again if you read all that without cringing and moving on with your day."
78,vulnerability,sex,"Just unexpectedly had my first pleasant and successful blowjob at the age of 37, following decades of disappointment",39,dko00e,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dko00e/just_unexpectedly_had_my_first_pleasant_and/,2019-10-21 05:58:22,"TL;DR: I've had many attempted blowjobs but they were either all bad or felt like an obligatory 'necessary evil' for the giver, which always turned me off and I've never enjoyed one and I've never cum from one. Today all that changed. \--- Okay so I'm writing because my entire world view has just been turned upside down. Of course I grew up as a young guy learning about oral sex and blowjobs from magazines, and when I first started to get some sexual experience, either my partners were uncomfortable and inexperienced, or they felt like they ""had"" to do it out of a sense of obligation. Either way, it was always awkward and unfulfilling, and I never once was relaxed enough to actually cum. The few times somebody would try, I usually ended up telling them ""No, don't worry, you don't have to"" and doing something else instead. I had a couple of very long relationships with women who actively disliked giving or receiving oral sex which didn't help either; every experience in my life had told me that oral was hard to do, and that porn stars and online commenters were basically just exaggerating everything. Until today! A very dear friend had recently become a FWB and we were exploring each other. For various reasons, she is unable to have penetrative sex right now, so after a long night of kissing, touching, and fingering each other, she wanted to give me a blowjob instead. I was hesitant but just so horny that I said ""Okay, if that's what you want"" and she started but then hesitated. Obviously my lack of enthusiasm was showing through, and given the newness of our sexual encounter, it was putting her off. So we gave up on it and talked a little before going to sleep. During the talk, the subject of the oral sex came up, I told her about my disappointing past experiences, and she told me that she actively enjoyed giving blowjobs. The next morning we started fooling around again and she asked where I wanted to go with it. I suggested that we give it another try and after a moment's hesitation, to judge my intentions I suppose, well, she went for it. And it was amazing! She knew what to do and she did it well. I'm kind of embarrassed to say that between the horniness, and the excitement, and the lack of experience of having a very pleasant blowjob, I didn't last too long. She seemed a little disappointed that she didn't get to do it for longer, which was another upside-down; I'm used to the people who feel obligated, wanting to have it over and done with as quickly as possible. It was one of the things that put me off them in the first place. But I can't stop thinking about it! I've tried a bunch of positions and styles over the years and I thought nothing could beat good old fashioned PIV sex - and it's still my favorite - but wow, this is a close contender. I think I finally understand all the hype, as well as the change in dynamic (getting to lie back and enjoy it instead of working all the time was new for me, as well as the feeling of vulnerability and trust you need to have). I'm amazed and saddened that it's taken me so many years - decades! - to finally have a good experience here, but I'm at least glad that I finally did. So if you've lived your whole life thinking that one thing or another was bad - never give up! There's hope yet!"

But still it reminded me of the only time I've ever happy cried after sex. I had only been with my SO for maybe two or three months, but I knew I was falling for him hard. While we were fucking one night, we were still experimenting and figuring out what we both liked. I was young and hadnt really tried any kinky shit yet, but when he gently put his hand around my throat and asked if that was okay, I could literally feel myself get like 10x wetter. I asked him to choke me harder. He did, and I started to cum almost immediately. It honestly may have been my first real, full body tingling kind of orgasm, and while I was cumming I was simultaneously realizing that I was deeply in love with him, that I had given him all my trust and vulnerability and he had given me back the most incredible feeling that a human being can experience. The tears started before I had even finished cumming. I was so filled with such extreme emotions, it took me a good minute to compose myself so I could assure him that they were not unhappy tears, and that I loved him, and that he had been the first and only person to show me just how close and connected you can feel to someone during sex. It's not just about cumming, it's about giving each other a special piece of yourselves and saying ""I absolutely trust you with this."" (sorry for the shitty format, did what I could on mobile)"

I feel like getting pegged/showing a side of vulnerability, sexually speaking, could really fuck things up with how Im perceived. I like being the strong one, the dominator, protecter, provider... the man. I grew up in a very conservative and athletic area, so I have no doubt that my masculinity is a product of that. None of my friends practice BDSM or anything closely kinky. I feel like an idiot for liking sex too much sometimes and exploring monogamously. I fee like getting pegged would render me unlovable. Its so hard finding good pegging porn too. Im 21 and its seems that most people that peg are much older, so its hard for me to visualize pegging at my age. I just feel so young and attractive that I would rather try it now then when Im older. Not that its bad to get pegged at any age, but now seems like a good time. Any tips/insight/advice would be greatly appreciated. Tl;dr I feel super hesitant."

Sex is the most vulnerable you can physically be with another human being, and there's something cute and charming about it that I just can't get over it. Doing it with someone that I just recently met, or with someone that I have known for a long time and started developing sexual desire towards one another, the answer is the same: An emotional connection has far more weight on achieving sexual pleasure than anything merely physical. But being a sensitive guy with a high sexual appetite has made me realize something very important that a lot of people miss, that being sexual perception. Everyone has a completely unique perception about having sex, and it's meaning varies from person to person. That variaty is rooted on on how different lives each one of us lives. Being concious about the different variables that can affect sexual pleasure has more often than not help me to achieve a better emotional connection with whoever I'm with, and that automatically translates into a healthier and more enjoyable sexual experience. In all my experience, I've found that guilt is the main reason why people don't allow themselves to enjoy anything (and sex it's a clear example of that). People feel guilty of the things that they enjoy, due to fear of being judged. Sometimes they feel guilty of the way they look, due to the constant comparison with the acceptable social standard. And sometimes people feel guilty about their performance, because they believe that their partner expects them to be sex gods, and can't get that amount of pressure off their shoulders. Showing vulnerability during sex can go a long way if you know what you are reaching out for. Some words of encouragement, or just straight up saying whatever your partner makes you feel and think can do wonders, and it's a shame that this is the part about sex that gets often overlooked. Being honest, comprehensive and sensitive with your partner when you are both in a sexual enviroment can do way more to reach an orgasm than the most scrumptious of penises, the most delicious of boobs or the most bootylicious of booties can ever do. I know it's scary to put yourself out there, but trust me, if that person already trusts you with their most physically vulnerable state, maybe it's worth giving it a shot. Sex is such a wonderful thing to experience, and sometimes people just need that little push. So, let's help each other to get there :) Just something I wanted to share."

I know it sounds silly, and maybe a little irrational, but I kind of view it like I am doing a drug that I shouldn't be doing.

It makes me feel like I am giving I am giving into temptation. I don't really like the vulnerability. I don't like letting my guard down for anyone and sex is telling. I still get horny like a normal person, but ultimately its just another distraction. The deeper reason is that I got my heart broken pretty bad when I was a teenager. I fell in love with this girl and I wanted to have sex, but she wasn't ready yet. Being the horny teenager I was, I kept pushing and eventually it led our downfall and ever since I can't initiate sex with anyone regardless of mutual attraction. Every time I have the urge to initiate sex with someone, I stop myself because of guilt and to save myself from embarrassment. 10 years have gone by since I have had any physical relationship of any kind, not even a kiss or anything. I just feel ashamed for even trying or having the desire to. I know its not normal, but I think at this point I would rather be celibate for the rest of my life then to attempt another physical relationship due to the fear of hurting that person emotionally. I feel like my desires go against what another person might want, so I just cease to attempt these relationships anymore."

The resort is surrounded by a golf course on one side and the ocean on the other, it is fairly secluded as there are no other high rises around and its about 5 miles from the main road. During the night it gets very dark, I use a golf cart to patrol the property. About a year into the job, I was patrolling around 2:30 am and decided to take the golf cart onto the adjacent golf course. It was pitch black with the course to my left and the dense woods to my right. I wasnt permitted to be on the golf course, it was a separate property. I turned off the lights so to not attract any eyes (even though there were no people around), as I was only about 1000 feet from the main path. I felt very vulnerable as the woods roared with suspicious sounds. The vulnerability combined with the taboo nature of what I was doing aroused me and I immediately started to undress myself. I wanted to get completely naked and drive the golf cart deep into the golf course and masturbate. Since it was pitch black, I felt I could be completely free. It produced an unbelievably erotic feeling. It was more intense than anything Ive ever experienced (sex included). I was so excited to take my clothes off and ride around in the dark in the middle of the night with my cock in my hand. I would cum 2/3 times on my knees onto the sidewalk or into the grass. After I would cum, my senses would come back and I would be very nervous and feel a sense of dread. I was surrounded by the wilderness in the middle of the night and combined with the small chance of being caught petrified me. I would feel weird coming back to the property and interacting with my coworkers knowing what I had just done, but it didnt change the adrenaline rush and pure excitement I would get when I undressed and started to masturbate. Since then, Ive done this about a dozen more times. Each time I get a little bit deeper into the golf course and I cum harder every time. I rarely do it because it is quite the hassle with the added risk. Also I feel like my monkey brain fears what animal could attack me when I expose myself to the dark woods (the golf cart doesnt provide much protection). Im just wondering if there is a psychological explanation to why this experience is so intense for me and whether there is a way to experience it without so much risk. I know that there probably isnt as the risk is apart of what makes it so erotic to me. Also if anyone has similar experiences I would love to hear."

We have good sex but for some reason I always hold myself back. As a result I never come during sex (any kind, including foreplay). I'm not even able to come on my own because I overthink everything and when I get close, it feels too intense so I stop and never allow myself to reach that peak. I've always been like this with past partners as well, so it's nothing new. But he's the first one I have actual feelings for so I really want to overcome this. I recently bought my first vibrator (tango by wevibe) and he wants to use it on me next time we see each other. I've never used a sex toy with a partner and I'm excited to try it but at the same time I'm super nervous. Obviously it'll be a really intense sensation to use it during PIV, which is a good thing, but I feel so scared to let myself be that vulnerable sexually with someone. I also feel this way every time I do something new with a partner, like the first time I give someone a BJ or go on top. I feel so scared the first few times until I realize it feels good and I enjoy it. This definitely has to do with how I was raised: my parents and culture were super sex negative and the positives of sex were literally never discussed. It was always that sex, pleasure, masturbation, etc were these big scary horrible things that are only appropriate after marriage, blah blah. You get it. Honestly I don't know exactly what I'm scared of, like letting myself be taken over by pleasure? Or letting him see me in such a raw, intimate light? We've had plenty of sex already so obviously he's seen me like this before but I guess in my mind, experiencing peak physical pleasure would be another level of vulnerability that I'm scared to experience. I would really love if anyone has any advice or just helpful words for me to overcome this fear I have of my full sexuality. I like sex, it's fun and feels good, but I have a mental block that makes it so hard to completely let go and feel everything I could be feeling."

This all goes back to the time when I was wounded as a child. I had feelings for another but I was laughed at and it made me feel terrible. So I started making walls. I became stoic. I had the ""stiff upper lip"". I ignored my pain or at worse, tried to medicate it through various means. I was invincible. So I thought. I've had friends. I've been able to keep things at a surface level, but I just can't go deep. I can't let my friends know I am suffering. I can't let them know how much I love them or depend on them. It's just too much for me, knowing someone has control. This has haunted me to the ripe old age of 28 years old, knowing that I am deeply scared of ""losing myself"" in another person. At an age where many people have already gotten over things like these. The act of sex itself is the ultimate vulnerability. I just can't let another person see me in that position. Knowing that I am virtually helpless in an emotional sense. There are no barriers, no smokescreens, no walls to put up. Knowing that someone can see right through the facade I put up in that moment in time, knowing there is no escape. Especially me beings someone who has no experience, knowing she would control the dynamic, scares the hell out of me. I don't know what to do with this feeling. Would anyone advise?"
91,vulnerability,sex,After having her first hook-ups my [M24] girlfriend [F23] dumped me. My self-confidence is shot.,4,ctf0xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ctf0xp/after_having_her_first_hookups_my_m24_girlfriend/,2019-08-21 20:38:50,"Wed been dating for almost 8 months. She came from an evangelical upbringing like I did, but hadnt completely worked through her deconversion when we started dating. I was her first for a lot of things. Physical intimacy, sex, weed. She has a pretty serious anxiety problem that we worked on throughout the relationship. I dealt with so many panic attacks and manic periods that I cant even remember them all. Originally I kept things fun and light but as she pushed me for more commitment and vulnerability I let my guard down and fell in love. The more vulnerable I became, the less I feel like she was attracted to me. Throughout all this, the sex was a challenge. I did everything I could to try and help her get off, but no luck. I bought her first toys, I tried everything she wanted and then some. Read *She Comes First* and put it into practice, but nothing. Whats crazy is that she still wanted to have sex ALL THE TIME. Wed spend entire days in bed fucking. She loved it, but no orgasm. It was really messing with me that I couldnt make the girl I love cum. A month ago I left for a trip to Mongolia (Im from the US) and while I was gone she hooked up with 3 different guys, one guy multiple occasions. This wasnt cheating by our rules as we were open, but she had never been with anyone before and I was just shocked that she slept with 3 people while I was gone and never checked in with me at all until it was over. I was pretty upset and asked that we closed the relationship until I get back and we can decide what to do then. Whats crazy is that early on she had expressed similar concerns about being open when I would see other people so I always made sure to check in with her way before, and after to make sure she was still okay with our agreement. As soon as I got home from my trip she says she wants to see me and asks me to come over, but says she has strep so shes sick. I decided to surprise her with soup and a strep care-package (cough drops, etc.) to make her feel better. So I get all this stuff together and come over to her place. I get set up in her kitchen to cook then go check on her in her room. She wants to cuddle so I get in bed and cuddle for a bit. We talk about my trip. Im there for almost an hour before she brings up that she wants to break up. Her reasons are pretty bullshit. Youre a really great boyfriend, this just doesnt feel right for me. Now I dont know where to go from here. My self confidence is shot. She says its not about the sex but I dont believe her. I think she finally got off with someone else and thats part of why shes leaving me. I feel ugly, small, bad in bed. I really fought for this relationship, I always went above and beyond to make her happy or make her life easier. Weathered all her anxiety issues and manic phases. Then she just dumps me out of the blue after having her first hook up. I just dont know why I wasnt good enough."
92,vulnerability,sex,To the people on this subreddit trying to take advantage of people looking for help/advice.,0,ctxr9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ctxr9m/to_the_people_on_this_subreddit_trying_to_take/,2019-08-22 23:53:19,"So last week I posted on here asking for advice. I did get some decent advice, and to those people I thank you from the bottom of my heart. However, I did get one person messaging me to dump my boyfriend because of an issue in the bedroom. This person then tried to make me question my sexuality, made wild assumptions that I'm into things/do things that I don't do and other stuff of the like. Usually I find this subreddit to be very encouraging and friendly, but this person has almost made me think twice. I get that this is the internet, you'll get all sorts of people coming out of the woodwork. This might just be an isolated incident, I don't know. But please people, if someone is asking for genuine help don't do this shit. I know that Reddit loves jumping to the ""dump them"" conclusion after hearing one hiccup, and I expected one or two people to say that. But accusing me of being bi or lesbian and saying that I'm into this person when I'm in a vulnerable state and asking for help is absolutely not okay. Don't harass people when they disagree with you. I'm only bringing this up to vent and to make people aware that this shit isn't okay. Taking advantage of someone's vulnerability to get a hookup is shitty behaviour."

I was looking for a little kindness and help on this. Most of the people I know aren't equipped to talk to me about this, with this but I figured you guys and gals might be! I ask that you be gentle with me, because this a point of vulnerability for me and I've always been a bit nervous about talking about it. There's some emotional stuff here, but since both that and sex are closely linked for me, they have to be mentioned. Apologies if they don't belong here. I've been thinking a lot about what role I would take and my kinks in a relationship. In the effort to break down some barriers of shame and embarrassment, and maybe unlearn some toxic things I've picked up from the ahhh less then healthy things I've seen. I have about the whole sex thing. I'm still a virgin really, I've never officially been in a relationship I'm doing some self work before I do that and I think it's going well. One thing that's been bugging me lately. I'm pretty sure I'm a more dommy person. Idk if that's just a BDSM term but if it is, I just wanna be a top then basically and the one leading the way most of the time. Which I've been met with a lot of backlash for. One friend I had called me rapey for it (Even though them voluntarily wanting me and trusting me so much is part of why it's so sexy/beautiful to me? But whatever) or people saying ""I don't truly know what I want. Maybe a nice strong guy will come along and you'll like being dominated by him."" And thats just...igh to me. I've explored my sex stuff through roleplay and still do now! I did since I turned 18, and the kinks I like. I notice when I go into more primal mode for lack of a better word? Like not thinking too much and just following what I wanna try and want to see, I am naturally more of a dom by nature. With a lot of kink rps I find myself taking the role of being the character in control and giving the pleasure more often then not. At least 80% to 90% I suppose. If I play the more submissive character it's normally for more emotional RPs then sexual ones, or it's because I like my RP Partner and they want it, so I play it out. It's fun for sure, but dom seems to be preference. There was also in real life an incident with someone. Where I told them I liked them and they said something akin to ""Well...if you decide you want to pursue it further...you know where I am\~"" Almost in a ""Come and get it"" type flirty tone. And it triggered something in me. This deep desire to pursue her and make her fall for me and let me take care of her (she also had a screwed up past that brought out my more caretaker edge too. Very broken person.) It wasn't exactly a healthy dynamic though I'll say. I'm embarrassed by how head over heels and dumb I got because I was thinking with my reproductive organs more so then my brain. Because it turned out later she knew I was inexperienced and such and she was actually taking advantage on purpose and then sprung some hardcore stuff on me that I wasn't emotionally ready for and it messed with my perception of how a healthy relationship works. That being said I would definitely say I am more of a dom by nature. Though if I trusted my partner enough I would be the sub if it made him happy. But I would definitely be unhappy if I got stuck being the sub all the time, or honestly even the dom all the time. I am a person of variety, even if I lean mostly one way and I like to try new things. One problem for me though is I'm almost afraid to be submissive irl. I've spent my life in that position non sexually always following orders and getting stuck doing things I didn't really want to do and being toyed with and manipulated when romance came into play. Like I didn't matter and I was just a toy for them. I've been spending a lot of time trying to become a stronger person and be a better person so I can be my more authentic self. Part of me is afraid if I give in on those instances where I'd like to play the more submissive role, then that's all those will see and want of me and I'll get stuck playing the role of the demure one my whole life. Or honestly vice versa. Having to be the strong one all the time and never even getting to let my walls down. It's a complicated fear I guess. I'm used to being made to be one dimensional and not having my needs be heard. To the point where I got a lot shyer about expressing all of what I want to people, sexually or otherwise. I always wonder if I'm asking for too much or worry that show of vulnerability will trap me into getting hurt by someone I really care about. I've also been told I cant be the true dominant one because I have no interest in causing my partner physical pain like the whole BDSM thing, and that I'm not aggressive enough to be the more dominant one and I'm too gentle and caring for it? I mean...that sounds wrong but I'm still going to ask because I do wonder. I'm honestly really confused. I guess some of my questions are my feelings towards that whole sub/vulnerability thing silly or are they understandable with what I've had happen. Should I work harder at getting over it even if it isn't even exactly my biggest preference? I already know with the emotional angle and my communication skills should be for sure because Id want that from my partner, that trust and such because Id want them to be as happy and comfortable as possible with me. Are dynamics supposed to be stuck being static like that where one person is always the aggressive one and the other kind of just does what that person wants? I've seen it so much so I'm not sure. Or are like dynamics in a healthy relationship mooore fluid? I suppose. Are there different styles to the more dominant/sub thing or is it supposed to be like one is agressive and kinda made of stone and the other isn't? The right partner would want me to be all of me and not just the more subby one or the more dommy one correct? I'm sorry again I know these are a bit silly questions but I really am not super experienced and I'm confused. I've seen a lot of icky stuff go on around me even within my family that was abusive and toxic and it's really confused me and it really screwed me up."

I have a hard time talking about this to people in real life. Im a 24 year old female, and Im a virgin. Not to sound big-headed, haha, but Im an attractive person, and I could have had sex many timesthats not the problem. I have some anxiety and personality disorder issues. Basically, Im uncomfortable with intimacy and vulnerability. This usually only goes away when Im drunk, which of course is not conducive to forming a good relationship. I recently broke up with a guy Id been dating for almost six months because I was so uncomfortable with sexual contact. I tried very hard to push past it, but my anxiety makes me freeze up completely, like I have no control at all. Many times, Ive thought about going out to a club or something, finding a guy I find attractive, and just sleeping with him. Thinking maybe if its not a committed relationship, and we have no emotional intimacy, Ill be less self-conscious and feel less vulnerable. Maybe burst the bubble and finally be able to have sex with someone I know? I just feel like its something I want to experience and might like. Im very frustrated. Thanks for any thoughts, everyone."

Anyway last night I put my head in my wifes lap and just talked with her. Its so basic and normal I guess for other couples but it was scary but also slightly erotic for me. She stroked my hair and pet me on my back. I felt warm and emotionally safe. The added bonus to her was that I was paying attention to everything she said too! I think this is at the heart of what I want more of in my life. Gentle but firm loving but strong, pure but earned.

Whenever I'm around a girl I close off and start to become a bit more lawfully and legal and try my best to be the best I can be around a girl than just being a person. I get so scared and afraid that I like to become a statue and I DO NOT want to open up and act myself. It's like I'm so afraid inside to hurt them or do something wrong that I have to be something else, something not human but like a shield or something. I know this targets my masculinity and my vulnerability which are two big topics that I been questioning about myself. I don't know when to be man, something in between like a shield, or someone a bit more feminine and normal. Someone who can just hang out with girls and be normal not someone awkward or unsure how to act around girls. It helps to know that I accidentally kissed a boy in pre-k, had a very vivid wet dream in 1st grade, and started watching porn in 4th or 5th grade (in the US) and from then on I watched porn frequently and have my stories with porn but I feel like porn has done some changing inside me that makes really awkward with the opposite sex, unsure about my masculinity and what I should be when it comes to sex and my emotions for girls. This has led me my whole life to be socially awkward and never to have a female friend, so I always grew up with guys. I know I'm a straight guy but it's like I'm so unsure inside. Some battle between femininity and masculinity I can't seem to grasp. Now, since I want to be more personal with girls and I think want to have sex I don't know how to act or what to do.

Theyre both great. The thing is though, I have stopped receiving head from the two of them. And to be quite honest, I dont mind at all. I think social media has plagued my brain in terms of receiving oral sex as a woman. Theres always jokes about men who dont go down on women, and theres this almost feminist notion that we should be demanding head from men because they expect us to give them head every time etc etc. So I kind of just adopted that mindset, subconsciously. And Im realizing now I didnt even really believe it myself. Im only starting to realize once I stopped getting head. I really dont think I enjoy it. I love the vulnerability in sex, but the vulnerability specifically in receiving oral sex makes me nervous. When all the attention is on my pleasure, I feel like its a performance and I dont like that. At least with penetrative sex, both parties are enjoying and both are vulnerable at the same time. Im not sure I like having the spotlight on me in that way. And I dont need head to get wet/turned on at all. Anyway, just curious if other women dont like receiving head either!!!

I've had more casual sex than I have had relationship sex and that in itself says a lot about how I view sex and relationships with men... I'm not sure if it because my priorities have changed or just my need to connect, but for me I've had FWB or One night stands where I had little to no emotional connection/intimacy and I was ok with that. I respected them as people and had tons of fun but if they dropped out of my life I probably wouldn't be too hurt by it. So to think I let these people into my body for a few moments of fun makes me question if I'm actually comfortable with emotional intimacy and vulnerability myself or of I'm just conforming to the trend of casual sex. I'm noticing that now when I let my guard down with men I feel as though I am ""consciously"" choosing, they seem to be emotionally unavailable and pull away. Am I doing this wrong? Am I still choosing the same partners as before but with a different goal in mind? I want meaningful sex and intimacy... doesn't have to be in a relationship, but this is what I want. Does anyone feel this way??? Is this something that can only happen in a relationship?"

I fantasize about being with a woman and we are both sharing a man together! It is not a typical threesome though, its more like the woman and I are both in the female or submissive role and we are sucking his cock together and taking turns getting fucked by him! It is like the role play that happens with pegging or strap on play but taken to another level. I have no experience at all with men. I am not and never have been attracted to any guys in my life. I can appreciate a nice male body but the vast majority of the time, the female body is much more appealing or stimulating. Now, I said that this fantasy involves a woman and not necessarily my wife, because I do not know how shed react to this or if shed be into it. Im not even 100% sure that ***ID*** be into it, if it really happened and I am not in a place where I really feel comfortable asking. So the fantasy basically takes the form of any woman that Id find attractive. Id be kind of like an honorary girlfriend of hers for the night and wed be sharing a hookup with a man. Id get to feel what the whole experience is like from a female point of view. The vulnerability and sense of danger that comes with allowing someone to penetrate you. Wondering if he will be good in bed. I think it would be a real trip to take the burden off of myself to perform and be placed in a position where Id be judging someone elses performance! Learning how to please a man orally, sucking cock without gagging on it. Just the notion of seeing this giant penis up close and in my face has got to be and entirely different experience than going down on a woman. Also, this is pretty strange I have ZERO desire to kiss or make out with a guy, even in this fantasy. However I really COULD see myself kissing a guys ass, giving a rimjob! That is something I enjoy doing to women and I could see myself trying it with a guy if he had a nice butt :) Then there is fucking! It would be wild to try all of the positions Ive been used to all of my life from the other side, from the receiving side. Instead of performing and being so constantly active, Id be basically at someone elses mercy and going along for the ride. I think getting fucked would be like a crazy roller coaster ride where you just hold on, go with it and let it happen to you!! I have fantasies where Id be with a woman and wed share different types of men! For example: An older businessman whod invite us up to an amazing suite, high above the city, take us out onto a balcony, turn the lights off and and fuck us both as we see and hear the city down below us and a light rain is gently falling on us! Then as the rain picks up, he moves us to the bedroom and fucks us more aggressively. He'd look like a typical middle aged executive, nothing special but would be amazing in bed. I imagine a young college guy doing us in a messy dorm room. Hed have an amazing body and stamina like crazy but would probably be a bit of a narcissist or a jerk but wed both enjoy the sex too much to care. I imagine surprises like skinny, smaller guys who end up having HUGE cocks. The point is.. Id be experiencing what WOMEN go through when they have sex with guys, casual sex at least. The success, failure, anticipation, frustration, satisfaction and Id be experiencing it along with a woman as we go through it together. I would not want to ALWAYS have sex this way. Its just a world Id like to visit. Its the other side of the street! I woudnt want to live there but it would be fun to check it out occasionally ;) I also think it would make me a much better heterosexual lover in the end because I will have experienced sex from a female -centric point of view and know what to do and what to avoid doing. SO. There it is. I have no idea what that means about me. I guess it means that I am bisexual to some degree but with other guys, Id lean towards being submissive and feminine AND Id want to share this with a woman or not do it at all. Not sure it will ever go beyond a fantasy because I am not sure Id be able to bring this up in my marriage. Even if something happened and I were single again or if I had this fantasy when I WAS single. I can imagine that it would be rather hard to find a female that I was attracted to and was also into this. Wondering if I am alone with this type of fantasy.

If you are reading this, it means I have done all that I can to try and live a normal life but that right has been stolen from me. If you are reading this, it means I am a woman that has been emotionally battered and wrongfully victimized by the malicious acts of a man that for years believed he was invincible and would suffer no consequence. If you are reading this, or even listening to it, please know that I appreciate this opportunity to write about what happened to me in 2016 and 2017, the years that my life changed forever. I thank you for your undivided attention. Before you read on, I want to apologize for the length of my statement; as long as it is, I no longer want to be silent. I deserve to be heard. For many years, I was happy. As a student at a prestigious high school, I was learning at an accelerated rate. I had participated in the schools cross-country team, was the Freshman Year student body president, and I approached every challenge with optimism and excitement. I was proud of myself and my accomplishments, and I had my eyes set on a wonderful future. My dreams of a fulfilling college education and a shining future came to a crashing halt when (RB)s careless, invasive and barbaric crime knocked me from my pedestal. He stole so much more than a few images of me. He stole my trust and my faith in the good of man; he sabotaged my dreams and goals by doing something that completely and utterly damaged my reputation, my mental state, and my hopes for the future. Not only did he steal something so personal and private and suffer no consequence - he robbed me blindly of my privacy, and shared with the world a body that was not his to exploit; he robbed me of the rights to my own body, and I can never get that back. RB, what you did was groundbreakingly traumatic for me, and I looked you in the eye and I forgave you. I forgave you, because in my heart, there was no way a human being would purposefully prey upon and degrade another in this way. But, this incident has never left me. I hope it was worth it to share my nude images with your friends, because youve destroyed my life because of it. In our class, you did not hesitate when you decided you wanted to hack my cell phone. You did not hesitate when you plugged my phone into the schools computer with a USB cord. Your ignorance shined when you stole multiple images of me, naked and revealing my most private self, and downloaded them to your flash drive. You did not consider the ramifications and the hurt you would cause when you shared these compromising images with your friends and others on the internet. My body is not yours to share. My images were not yours to distribute. Youve assaulted me, and every time these images resurface, I struggle to find it in my heart to forgive you again. I choke down tears and try to process my pain every single time I see them online - I am both red with anger and horrified that you would do this to someone that had never wronged you. You did not stop and think about the impact something as sensitive as this would have on a motivated and driven young lady. You stole so much more than a couple of images from my phone; youve barbarically stripped me of my clothing to hundreds of people Ill never know. Do you have any idea how it feels to walk down the street, or into a store, and feel as if everyone has seen you completely naked and vulnerable? Can you even comprehend the evil behind what youve done? I cannot make a friend that hasnt seen my breasts, I cannot enter a college class because of crippling anxiety, and I am wounded in ways I fear I cant recover from. Because of your sharing of my explicit photos, you have allowed countless men to assault me over and over again. You ripped me from my own body, a body that has been preyed on, commented about, shared with and obsessed over. I no longer own my body. Let me repeat that - I no longer own my body. Because of you and you alone, youve allowed an innocent woman to become the victim of stalking, sexual harassment and threats that have not stopped since 2017. You are a predator, and you will get what you deserve . The physical, financial, psychological and emotional impact of what youve done does not take a day off - every single day, I have to carry this guilt in my heart. Because of the stress and trauma associated with being humiliated and degraded constantly for months on end following this incident, I have developed an unhealthy relationship with my body. A once dedicated athlete, I have been reduced to obsessing about my imperfections and the overall shape and curve of my body. I have gained more than 30 pounds while I mourned and grieved the loss of ownership of my body - psychologically, I have become convinced that the bigger I become through disordered eating, the less people will want to see me naked and maybe, just maybe, the requests for naked pictures of me will stop littering forums online. My relationship with myself is dramatically impaired, and I cannot look myself in the mirror and find the strength to smile knowing people like you are out there, preying on unsuspecting women. For a long time, I hated myself because of the harassment I would receive on social media - men commenting on my body, what they wanted to do with me, asking and sometimes demanding that I sleep with them, threatening rape and assault. I felt like a piece of meat, and shame and disgust consumed me for years. For YEARS, I have tried to cope with this and learn to love myself after what you did, but I am still suffering from weekly panic attacks, dreadful nightmares and intense thoughts of suicide. Financially, I have had to pay for numerous behavioral health services including extensive psychotherapy sessions. You have burdened me with these financial obligations, and how do you think I feel having to shell out $300 and hour to talk about YOU to a psychologist? I feel sick when I think about you - you can never understand how it feels to have to pay for services to curb the feelings of vulnerability, hopelessness, sadness and betrayal that you caused when I was simply a bright high school student. In addition, thanks to your cruel invasion of privacy and distribution of child pornography, I had lost my job - the only job I had when I was living on my own at 16/17 years old and could barely make rent. Months after you violated my trust and exploited me, multiple people had found where I worked and came into my place of employment and stood at the counter staring at me. Some made sounds and sexual gestures to me. A co-worker sexually harassed me shortly after. And when I rejected his demands to sleep with him, he had stated that I had nice nudes on the internet, and he further pressured me into allowing him to have a turn. I had to leave an entire job because of you, because men came in badgering me after stalking me online and asking for my personal details such as my address and phone number. I felt terrified, isolated and humiliated, the subject of scandal and rumor to all of my co-workers, and I was distressed and hard pressed for days before I couldnt walk through the doors anymore. You robbed me of a job, and a paycheck. You robbed me of my reputation and allowed anonymous persons to slandered my name. You wrecked me, and you dont even feel sorry. To this day, I am in constant fear of these images making their way into the hands of my young adult colleagues and fellow co-workers and spread like wildfire. I am in FEAR that any day now, I will be told news I cant bear to hear and lose this job too. Thank you for this. I have had to see multiple mental health professionals to cope with the stress and suicidal thoughts and attempts Ive made because of you. When I meet people with your name, I shudder and my heart jolts with a fear you cant even begin to comprehend. I have seen a behavioral therapist and a psychotherapist and have been diagnosed with massively overbearing depression, mood issues, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa disorder, all thanks to you. For some selfish reason, you wanted the world to see me naked and in turn, you have extinguished every ounce of self-love and a sense of control I had within me. You have made me cry every single day for the last three years. You have made me a sufferer of frequent and paralyzing anxiety attacks when in social situations, as I have to live with the agonizing fear that members of any crowd have seen my breasts and genitals. I cannot maintain friendships with men in my age group anymore because I am terrified that they are interested in me for all of the wrong reasons; I second guess every single person, male or female, that approaches me with genuine kindness. Youve stripped me of my ability to form trusting and healthy relationships with my peers, and because of the massive shame I am forced to contend with, I am confined to a dark bedroom to cry and ask God why something so criminal had happened to me. A few months ago, a man I barely knew had gone through my social circle and boasted about having an intimate sexual relationship with me, and I have never met him before. He showed off the revealing pictures to his friends (former acquaintances of mine as well) and I found out from a family member at a FAMILY GATHERING. I was hot with rage, embarrassment and guilt and in that moment, I wished the absolute worst upon you. I couldnt escape this situation, and was the subject of false stories and lies of sexual escapades because you had the nerve to leak my pictures. I could not even find comfort and solace in my own family because of you. You took away my sense of security and safety IN MY OWN FAMILY. On the revenge porn websites, each new thread starts with a user posting an image of the place he wants to recieve nudes from - whether it be a local high school, or a university or even just a city. What youve done is so severe and invasive that I am literally frozen in terror at the thought of attending a four-year college. I am in constant fear of being recognized, harassed, slandered, blackmailed and manipulated into doing things I wouldnt otherwise want to do. You stole my future from me because now, whenever I have a brief moment of motivation to move past this and I look at colleges online, I can not, no matter how hard I try, get over the dread of going to a new school to have my nude images passed around again. Every single time I see my hometown sign while driving, my heart sinks because the crime you commited is fresh in my mind. I cannot go to the movies, because I am scared of running into people I know. I will never set foot in a mall or shopping center again because the very last time I did, you were there with your accomplice friends and I made eye contact with you. I sobbed and ran to my car, and have not been back since. I had mentioned I was suicidal - and because of you, I have been battling with this for years. I have made two attempts on my life because I cant seem to outrun what youve done to me. The wound reopens every single time an anonymous person posts my naked pictures online. I can no longer have a decent day because I obsess over finding my body exploited online in chats, forums and blogs. I have tried everything I can to get away from these demons but they follow me, because whenever I think theyre gone and things are going to be okay, somebody else posts my pictures and Im assaulted on the internet all over again. At any time, anyone can undress me, can see me at my most vulnerable, can tear open my blouse for the world to see, and I cannot stop them, no matter how many tear-filled nights Ive spent up, fighting with porn websites to have these images removed. The issue is, even if they are removed, shortly after theyll be requested for again and again, and Ill be left shattered on the floor trying to open a bottle of pills, only my hands cant stop shaking because I am angry at you and I wish you would have never done this to me. I cannot run from this. It hangs over my head and drowns me whenever I feel even the slightest bit okay. You left me cracked and in pieces - I am not the woman I once admired. You destroyed me for your own gain. Every single diary entry Ive written in the last 30 days has idealized suicide as the only means of being forgotten. Men will trade my pictures like Pokemon cards every single day and I cant stop them. I feel POWERLESS. I have you to thank for that. I once had a large Facebook following, a SnapChat account, an Instagram. I have had to remove myself from the publics eye in order to avoid sextortion, slander, and harassment. I can never connect with my friends and family again because when you posted my full name on that website to shame me, I received hundreds of messages from complete strangers detailing horrific, disturbing things. Ive been stalked, and followed. You did this to me. I have developed a fear of social media because it was used to harm and embarrass me. Youre a monster. You have depleted my finances, scarred my emotionally, ripped away my sense of confidence and faith, and have led me to suicide. But do you know what else you did? You snaked your way into my personal life. I cannot trust anyone anymore, that much is clear. But when you leaked those pictures of me, you ruined my ability to distinguish between people that were really there for me, and people that had ulterior motives. I have had to remove myself from several strong friendships and relationships because I was unable to comprehend why someone would do something so heinous to another human being, and I was terrified that my friends were going to use this against me. I am left alone now, because I cant form meaningful friendships. I am so paranoid now that I have nobody left in my corner. That is a result of the trauma you caused when you shared pictures that did not belong to you with the world. And wait, while we are on the topic of pictures that did not belong to you, why me? What did I do to you? What did I say to deserve to have the past three years of my life ruined by you? I have lost a job because of harassment and Im unable to function socially. My grades plummeted as I could no longer sit and focus in a classroom, and spent most of my school year in the guidance office trying to make sense of whats happened. I was bullied, shamed, targeted and further exploited by my peers that turned to victim shaming and blaming instead of asking how the pictures were leaked in the first place. That is a problem I contend with today - people dont care about the person who is being victimized; they only acknowledge the person as the one that deserved the invasion of privacy. She should not have taken the pictures, and She got what she deserved because she took the pictures, are comments that reflect societys ignorance. Having these images on my phone was my choice, and keeping them for myself was my choice - having my phone broken into was not. You had no reason to do this and yet you did. Why? Last year, an old classmate of ours approached me at a restaurant and claimed that you were bragging about what you did to me and how it has affected me. The person explained that you were cold and unfeeling in your statements, and this led to a physical altercation. In the 2017 school year, your accomplices explained that your father was not angry at you and you were teasing me behind my back. You knew I was underage at the time, and still went forward and spread these images just because you could. You violated my privacy and stole so much from me, and I want for you to really and truly be punished for what you did and for the years youve taken from me as a result, years that I cannot get back. I want an apology from you. And not a simple, Im sorry and this is why,... I want for you to realize the magnitude of the wrong youve done, and to look me in the eye and tell me that you really are sorry. I want you to dedicate a few hours of your life writing me a letter. I likely will not be able to bring myself to read it, but I want for you to really reflect on how wicked you were to me. You have taken so much from me - this is what I need for you to do now. For three years, I let you control me. I will not any longer. I will not hunt for my images online anymore and then break down when I inevitably find them. I will not be afraid to create meaningful male friendships. I will not be silent - I will speak out at child advocacy centers and publicly speak up about situations similar to this and how revenge porn needs to be taken more seriously. I will take this as a hard and painful lesson and grow from it. This afternoon, I made a promise to myself that I was no longer going to let this define me and dictate my life anymore. Today, Im taking my body back. FUCK YOU, RB."
104,vulnerability,sex,in need of some advice from the internet,2,cmdfol,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/cmdfol/in_need_of_some_advice_from_the_internet/,2019-08-06 02:46:10,"Hi friends. Much like the title suggests, Im in need of some perspective and dont want to ask anyone I know. So, for some context, I (21F) and my partner (24M) have been together for going on three months, so its still relatively new. Hes very open and direct about his sexuality and as time has gone on its become pretty clear that his sex drive is higher than mine. Weve had conversations about why I say no to sex, which were brought about by him feeling rejected. He did say, though, that it was part feeling rejected, part not being used to girls telling him no..the yeah Im used to three times a day with every girl Ive dated kind of thing. So we cleared the air and it was all fine for a bit. Its since come up again, and now that Im really thinking about it, his offhand comment about what hes used to - that kind of stuck with me, and I think its created an unspoken expectation that every time he kisses me he expects me to take my clothes off, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. And it might not matter a ton, but this guy was my first and tbh Im still getting used to thinking of myself as sexy and desirable and being comfortable with the vulnerability of it all (coming from several years of body image issues), which only adds to the mental dilemma. Ive told him multiple times that its not personal, I initiate more now, etc. but hes still frustrated that its not as often as hed used to. Im not sure how to approach the conversation, how to really emphasize that Im not trying to make him feel rejected, or how to explain whats going on in my head. I also dont like that hes acting like he gets to decide whats fair, or that it feels like hes trying to make me feel guilty. Literally any advice or perspective at all would be greatly appreciated. Hopefully the above made sense. TY "
105,vulnerability,sex,Trying sex with guys has possibly made me a better lover with women!,938,cmv2bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/cmv2bm/trying_sex_with_guys_has_possibly_made_me_a/,2019-08-07 05:22:15,"I (34m) recently discovered or I guess accepted that I am bisexual. I just came out of a long term relationship with my ex-gf and decided to explore what it was like with guys. I had a series of casual hookups and it taught me alot about what women experience with guys! So, I quickly learned that I am more submissive with other guys.. a bottom I guess. As such I pretty much was able to hook up with straight guys who didnt mind getting a blow job or fucking as long as it wasnt reciprocal. From the very beginning, it was a 180 degree change of view! I suddenly realized WHY women were more hesitant to have sex. I realized how vulnerable it is to become the person who is about to get penetrated. Sex suddenly became more than just satisfying an urge, it became a judgement call over who I am agreeing to make myself THAT vulnerable to! It was wondering if this person would respect me during or after the act. Instead of wondering how I would perform I was wondering how THEY would perform. It was also empowering because now I got to choose if wed have sex or not. The guys were just horny and just wanted it so it was wild to be in a position to be this sexual gatekeeper or get to pick from a selection of horny guys on an app. I really also was not prepared for the emotion that comes with the vulnerability. The sense of danger, the sense of really being at someone elses mercy. Once you make the choice to let them inside you, its hard not to feel something even in an casual hookup. I wasnt prepared for my boundaries being challenged. When your in a vulnerable or submissive sex position, its hard not to internalize it in a way and if the guy gets too rough or does something you dont enjoy, it isnt always easy to speak up in the moment. What is odd though is basically the same thing happened in separate incidents with two different guys and in one case I felt cheap and violated and in the other, I enjoyed it. The first guy slapped me in the face with his cock basically, like they do in porn. The second guy was more aggressive with facefucking and then moving me into a position where he was sitting on my face so that I could kiss his ass and he had me do it for awhile. What is odd is, with the first guy, I felt cheap and used and was mad at myself for not telling him to stop but with the second guy, I found that I enjoyed it. I really cant explain why other than there was something about the second guy that made it ok for me and something about the first guy that did not. Does that make sense? I now realize why good hygiene is important! I now realize why foreplay and starting slow is important! I now realize how much the sex act is so much simpler and straightforward for guys I now realize how many options women (and gay/bi guys) have for sex if they want it. There is a huge, endless supply of horny guys out there and its real eye-opener to be in a position to pick and choose like that. I realize that penises come in all shapes and sizes and there is really no way to tell by the guys body type or external appearance. Some real surprises over who was packing and who wasnt ;) Want Examples? Big, buff bodybuilder type dude wasn't and skinny emo guy absolutely WAS. I also learned that really big cocks are nice to look at but can be difficult to have sex with. I also realized that with guys, it was just about trying sex. No emotional connection and I dont think I could feel that way for a guy even if I wanted to. So like I said, it was just casual sex with guys who pretty much identified as straight but willing to bend the rules if it were not reciprocal. Most of these guys have also only ever been with women so it really was like I was stepping into a womans shoes in a way and experiencing the same things they do (as much as possible as a guy). I made absolutely sure to play safe. Used protection for penetration. Got tested. Insisted they were. Im kinda over this now. Back to dating women.. trying casual at first and its back to a culture shock at how much harder that is. I have discovered that its made me a much better lover. More considerate, more attuned to the female body, less in a rush. I'm also less in rush to initiate sex even if it's a casual hookup."
106,vulnerability,sex,Im curious if wanting to listen to and fantasize about my partners sexual past is wrong?,26,c06bng,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/c06bng/im_curious_if_wanting_to_listen_to_and_fantasize/,2019-06-14 00:13:21,"Im curious if wanting to listen to and fantasize about my partners sexual past is wrong? Hello. As the title implies, I am genuinely turned on by the visuals created when my wife has mentioned details of her past. Whether it was an outfit she wore, small shorts with a strap top, or being fucked by a larger than usual cock, it drives me pretty nuts to hear it. Ever since puberty, when a prospective girlfriend narrated to me over the phone what she was wearing one day, I have associated a great deal of pleasure from this imagination-heavy form of arousal. My wife and I are both are confident and sexual people so when one night we got to talking about our naughty pasts, it blew my mind to hear her extremely hot and detailed stories. This kink is all mine although she has shared plenty. However, Im the one who primarily gets off on hearing her storiesalthough shes also told me that she enjoys how naughty I have been. There is a vulnerability that comes from sharing oneself like this with another human being. In recent years, as the relationship has had its ups and downs, its gotten harder to feel comfortable about talking about this kink of mine with her. This is despite the fact that I really want to hear and know these things from time to time. As many here can attest, when the relationship grows with time, life gets in the way and work, kids, responsibilities make it difficult to keep the flame alive. There are times when I feel guilty thinking about this because I dont ever want her to feel like I dont appreciate her. But, she is the most beautiful and radiantly sexy woman Ive ever met and imagining her in various scenarios is, to me, better than anything pornography could ever hope to be. That is how much she turns me on. Her objections come when shes not in the mood, or when shes told me that she will run out of content one day. But its not that I want her to come up with new stories. Its that I love how her voice sounds, how commanding and sexy it is, how assertive and dominant it is, and also the hints of domination that come from hearing her in situations that have nothing to do with me. Society often shames us for not being vanilla. Its fine that some people like vanilla, but I sometimes feel like Im off for getting aroused at this even though I really enjoy it. Plus, Im having trouble expressing myself sexually to her lately because of my reluctance to feel comfortable in asking her questions or making comments that arise from the stories she has shared, that go on to fuel my fantasizes about her in the present. Im not sure what my question is, but maybe I just want to know what others think about what Ive written. Its good to get out of your head. Thank you."

This didn't worry me as I enjoy them a lot. However, my latest partner can only finish in missionary and at first I thought it was pretty boring as I like to participate and prefer rear penetration positions. But, I have started to love it after a few months. I love feeling his weight on top of me and the physical closeness, seeing his face next to me and his hot breath on my shoulder as he struggles to catch his it. Burying my face in his shoulder and smelling his Paco Robanne Invictus mixed with his familiar and warm masculine smell. Looking into his eyes and kissing him and grabbing his muscular back. I also like it when he gets tired and we roll over and bury our faces into eachother and being able to watch his face when he finishes. But I also love the vulnerability of being taken from behind and the tighter and deeper feeling. Not knowing when he's going to enter me and feeling it finally happen. Have you gone from feeling missionary is boring to enjoying it or have you always enjoyed it as a position, or do you find it boring?"

Older by roughly ten years. Slim, possibly tall. Handsome in a cute and boyish way. Well-spoken, middle-class accent. Graceful body language. Polite and courteous. I mean it is just ridiculous when somebody ticks off all the boxes. Instant attraction. I just kept looking and looking at his face, hair, clothes, posture and hand gestures, as I was trying to answer very sensitive questions about my life. He was probing me for personal information, I was literally checking him out. I noted so many details about him in only a short period of time. I'm a very shy person and, normally, I wouldn't be able to hold eye contact with a stranger for very long. But he was an exception. I'm not actually registered with this doctor (GP), but I've seen him twice over the last month. I *would* let him do things to me that I wouldn't let another male doctor do, such as give me an intimate examination without anybody else being there in the room. Since I'm sexually attracted to him, I'm not going to mind or care about misconduct. At all. I frankly want to be touched by him (wrongly or rightly). I believe that I possess attractive qualities, too, in spite of being dressed down. My face is very feminine. My voice is really soft with a high pitch. My body is slim but also curvaceous. I am a particularly feminine woman, and men certainly like it. I want to be deliberately provocative in subtle ways, like wearing a thin top without a bra underneath. If the weather is cold: my nipples will be hardened. I want him to Blush. I want him to smile. I want him to fear getting an erection at the worst time. I love sex. Is this just a fantasy? Delusional thinking? A consequence of mental illness and vulnerability?"

In my non-sexual every day life, I am notoriously spontaneous and take enormous risks. I work as an engineer and I am good at it. In school, I was known as a confident, outspoken, go-getter with a somewhat vulgar side. I am not ugly, I am not a beauty queen but I am not hideous either. I have a small figure, babyish face, think Ariana Grande. I am not asexual. I do have the desire to have sex, but each time I got close to it, I felt like it would make me ""conquered"" or something. I tell myself, that's not how sex works, both people should enjoy the process, but I just hate the idea that someone else is involved. I hate the porn I watch and the erotica I read, where the guy gets all possessive and demeaning, ""mauled teens"", ""owned ass"", you get what I mean, and all I can think is 'that will never be me'. And here we are, a 31-year-old virgin. The vulnerability that comes with having sex with someone, I avoided it at all costs. Because that's me, I take care of myself. In all ways. But its stopping me from having normal romantic relationships, for obvious reasons. Guys I meet don't even know why I ""don't date"". Everyone thinks its because I'm a man eater. And the kicker? The only 2 people I told don't believe me. They think I keep my house private because I have a rotation of guys and girls coming and going. And so this Saturday, I am going to this guy's house.

But I felt like it also had something to do with her vulnerability. I dont want to get into a pattern where we have the best sex after emotionally abusing each other.

However, things are a little fucked up on the sexual side. When my SO and I first started dating, there was an incidence where he emotionally cheated with his ex - it was very obvious that he was still infatuated with her, would tell me stories about things he missed from their relationship that he wished I would do with him (some even sexually) kept notes and gifts of everything she gave him, and talked to her very frequently, sometimes even telling her detailed of our sex life. I felt like a rebound for months and the cherry on top was when he went to visit her a year into our relationship without telling me about it. I was furious when I found out, and distraught. He promised he would stop talking to her and discarded everything she gave him, and we talked it out over many months and I do truly believe he is over her. However, I believe the whole ordeal made me incredibly traumatized as for months after his ""visit"", I would keep reliving moments where it felt like he was emotionally cheating. The moments would come on without warning or with the smallest trigger, I would feel the emotions and turmoil just as strong as when they first happened. The frequency of these moments decreased, but occasionaly they still come up However, even after these years, I feel like there's a mental block for me towards him sexually. I am unable to fantasize about anything with him in the equation and this has led to a lackluster sex life. I don't have the highest libido but even when I am horny, I can't imagine anything to do with the SO. Everytime I try, this painful feeling in my chest swells and almost defensively, I try to shut down the idea maybe because I don't want to be vulnerable. Have never orgasmed before, but when I feel like I am close during sex I try to block it as a way to ""get back"" at him (because he said he liked when the ex came) and not show my vulnerability to the SO. I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly, but this is a big issue for me. I do love him and emotionally things are great. We have a wonderful dynamic and can lift each other up. I also want to add that I 100% do not think he is still in love with his ex anymore, but the trauma from everything that happened still gets to me. No, I don't want to break up, but would love some advice on how to fix this toxicity in our relationship. Thank you! P.S. writing this while exhausted, sorry if things don't make too much logical sense!"
112,vulnerability,sex,"I have a bizarre sexual fetish, and feel the need to tell my partner. Advice?",1,caihih,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/caihih/i_have_a_bizarre_sexual_fetish_and_feel_the_need/,2019-07-08 18:39:45,"Throwaway account because who knows. I'll also preface this by saying I've done a lot of research, and feel like I just need to straight up hear other people's perspectives/opinions. &amp;#x200B; I've been seeing my girlfriend for about 8 months now, and things are quite serious. We founded our relationship on communication, vulnerability, and trust. Already she knows more about me than my friends and most of my family. What she does not know about me is that I have a diaper fetish. I have a complicated history with my fetish; throughout the years I've gone through terrible binge-purge cycles, and indulged into the fetish world only to suddenly hate myself and my desires. Anger, shame, guilt, and other negative emotions have been common, although as much as I try to suppress my desires, they always seem to pop back up again. &amp;#x200B; After a separate struggle with mental health, and the self-confidence that this girl has given me, I feel like I need to really figure out how I need to approach my fetish and how to do it in a healthy manner. I'm tired of the negative emotions surrounding it, and the feeling that I have to live 'in the closet' about my fetish because it's so weird and deviant. Recently, I've started thinking about telling her for several reasons: 1) I've told her everything else about my life, and she's handled it like a champ. She is one of the only people that I feel comfortable enough around to even consider telling. 2) I feel like I am doing our relationship a disservice by not telling her, especially if we continue to date long term (which I hope will happen) but I have this horrible secret undermining the whole thing. 3) I want her help to not feel bad about it anymore. She's my #1 fan, and I think with her help I might be able to finally accept my sexuality. &amp;#x200B; What I'm afraid of, however, is that it might be just too weird and she'll dump me over it, which I honestly wouldn't blame her for. While she is an incredible person, everyone has their limits and I'm worried this one could be hers. I don't necessarily want her to partake in any way, simply just to have her know that this is part of me. I'm also afraid that if she dumps me, it will lead to more negative emotions about my fetish that might be difficult to deal with. I've looked into seeking help from a professional, but most therapy is expensive and not covered by insurance. I'm really stuck on this one, as I don't want to lose the best thing that's happened to me, but I also don't want to suffer because of my fetish anymore. &amp;#x200B; Has anyone had similar experiences, or any advice on this matter? I'm feeling a little lost here. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR looking for advice on if/how to tell my girlfriend I have a diaper fetish."
113,vulnerability,sex,I've been a sex worker for 10 years. This is what I learned about myself &amp; male sexuality.,35,cao7mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/cao7mo/ive_been_a_sex_worker_for_10_years_this_is_what_i/,2019-07-09 03:41:32," The first time I met sex work it was love at first sight. I was 18 years old and living in San Francisco. Being a young thing in the bay in the golden age of Craigslist adult jobs was a beautiful thing. I remember hanging out in the the Mission when broke teenagers could still afford to live there, chilling with a bunch of gay boys who assured me that it would be so easy to hustle this tight young ass. And in a way they were right. I remember the first time I nervously got into some mans car to sell my panties for $60 and walking out of that car feeling like the smartest bitch on the block. The next thing I did was trot on over to the Crazy Horse where I worked a day shift and made probably around $230 in 8 hours. Now, that is a pittance for a stripper but at the time, making in a night what I usually made in a week waiting tables in a two bit diner felt like a glorious triumph. In my little fresh-off the-farm teenage heart I felt certain that all my problems were solved. From that moment on, sex work was my sole means of income. I couldnt imagine myself doing anything else. The feeling of dancing naked on a stage with money being thrown at my tits felt as right as a blanket in the cold. Ive always told people seeking advice for starting in the sex work industry that you truly are either wired for the work or youre not. You can learn to be good at sex work but you cannot learn to love it. Thats something youre born with. Sex work has brought me to levels of healing that simply would not have happened otherwise. When I first began that work I had the attitude that most young hustlers have: fuck these dudes, dont trust these dudes, Im here to take em for all they got. On some level I thought that sex work would be payback. However, that attitude did not last long. I realized those feeling were a response to feeling taken advantage of by men in the past and that I didnt want my lifes work to be dispensing more mistrust in a world where experiencing vulnerability is so hard. There would be no longevity in my work if I couldnt find a way to feel good about the mark I was making in the world. I began working at a full body sensual massage parlor. What I loved about sensual massage is that it was centered around the client receiving and myself giving. The rules were that I could touch them but they could not touch me. While this may seem like a rule no one would go for the result was remarkable because it removed the option for my client to perform. The opportunity for a man to receive pleasure without the expectation to perform is a very rare event. Often times a nervous client would suddenly reach out and grab me aggressively attempting to dominate me. At first this was very startling and evoked an immediate fear response. Obviously! \*\*Ill take this opportunity to say to you gentlemen that regardless of the societal expectation that women want you to take control or dominate them, you need to remember what a unique position of control you are in. Ultimately you are stronger and can hurt us which gives you the control. Always err on the side of extreme caution and courtesy when you are having sex with anyone least of all a sex worker.\*\* But at some point I realized I was fortunate enough to be in a safer environment and came to the conclusion that these men did not intend to hurt me. What was actually happening (other than a huge blind spot for considering my sense of safety) was that they were performing the image of the man they though was expected of them. A man who takes control and performs the deed like the body is some sort of conquest. The imagery of the dominant male is ubiquitous. There is not a single popular movie with a strong male protagonist who does not, at some point, respond to a woman asserting, No by throwing her to the ground, ravaging her body, having his way with her and in the end she falls in love with him. Now we all love a good action movie but I found myself in a unique position to not only identify this fallacy and the harm it caused both femme and masculine people but also to rewrite the story and find healing for both myself and my client. One day when a client was getting a little too rough and ignoring my clearly stated boundaries I tried a different method of confrontation. Instead of ending the session and asking him to leave I simply sat back and stopped touching him entirely. I looked him in the eye and said in a very level headed, compassionate voice, Look, I dont know what you think I expect you to be but I dont need you to be anything or act any kind of way on my behalf. What I want, what I truly desire, is for you to lay back and enjoy the feeling of me touching your body. I want you to enjoy the opportunity to lay back and let someone else do all the work. I want you to feel pleasure and know that I have no expectation of you to perform. The shift in the energy of our session was incredible. This man went from performing some machismo posturing to letting out a slow exhalation of relief, exclaiming Thank you! before lying back and being perfectly content to simply enjoy his massage. From that moment on, my work was forever changed. I saw how harmed we all are be these violent expectation and lack of clear communication. That was a distinctive moment when my work went from a basic hustle to a path of sexual healing and growth. Eventually I moved on to doing full service escorting. Sensual massage had served me well for years but I was getting the feeling that I had hit a plateau and there was no where else for me to go within that modality. Escorting was wonderful because I no longer had to uphold the stringent rules of fbsm and could be the insatiable, playful freak, nasty gal I truly am. Finally I had a platform where I could really let my skills shine through! After investing several years finding the quiet, centered healing of massage I was ready for something more. Sex work does not have to be wholesome and meditative to be healing. On the contrary, some of the experiences that have left me feeling the most revitalized and whole have been nasty as hell! We are complex creatures with complex sexualities and desires. The thing is, our society drills this idea into us that anything healing must be sterile and abstinent while vice, debauchery and sin are specifically not healing. Lies, all lies. You need touch to be healthy, and if your desire is for that touch to be filthy wet, juicy and raunchy there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Ive said it once and Ill say it again and again. No one and I mean absolutely no one, has the right to judge or condemn acts that transpire between two consenting adults. No one has the right to define your sexuality or what brings you joy. NO ONE. As I walked the path of escorting I found I was falling into the old societal expectations I had avoided for so long. Without having the expressed intention to facilitate a unique experience my sessions started resembling a main stream porn, dominant male paradigm. I acknowledge that I was not being authentic to myself and that I must make a change. I employed the consulting services of my incredibly talented friend Zachary Prince. With his help I realized I was engendering the typical stereotypes I thought were expected of me. I was succumbing to the expectation that I be a nice, normal lady; mainstream in my looks and demeanor. The typical expectations placed on women; that I be demure, non-threatening, submissive. This is very clearly not who I am! So much so that when I realized what I was doing I laughed out loud. I am a dominant and powerful femme. I love to hold a position of control, I have the experience to back it up, and I take very good care of my play partners. Why was I trying to fit this round dildo into a square hole!? I took this last month off to have a little sojourn in the woods and really take some time for myself to reflect on who I am, what I want and what I have learned in these last 10 years. What I concluded is that I am saying goodbye to traditional gfe. It is no longer who I am and I cannot authentically facilitate that experience for people. I choose to reflect in my work who I am in my real life; a strap-on top, a fisting expert, a cuckholdress and a bad bitch in need of a willing sissy to usher into womanhood. I believe this work is incredibly important to begin healing a society that is mired in toxic masculinity. The people I am casting out for are the ones who, like me, cannot fit into the roles of dominant male, submissive female. I am now creating sessions for clients who crave to submit and serve. I am not a sadist, I am just reversing the roles. The client experience is just as capable of evolution and growth as the provider experience is. I am a provider for the client who is ready to transcend the norm and find the dominant, feminine touch they need and deserve. This is my personal statement. This is who I am. This is a declaration of gratitude for the healing and evolution this work has brought me. This is a call to the people out there seeking a similar healing and exploration. You are not alone. You just have to reach out. It will all be worth it. &amp;#x200B; The original posting of this is on my personal blog which I don't think I can post here.

There is a moment when things are starting to warm up, when you are making out, touching each other's bodies in simple ways and then suddenly... He pulls your hair and demands that you take your pants off (Yes, I like it dirty best). Losing control and becoming animals. I love being bent over, being controlled, having hands grab my ass tight and I love even more to flip roles on them casually, without warning. I like demanding them to make me cum or the really dirty talk. Last night I wanted my asshole stretched with as many fingers he could fit. Sucking on him and then on his fingers back and forth, feeling his hands inside my ass, pussy and to the thumb on my clit. Making him cum down my throat and then sitting on his dick to make myself cum again. Listening to the little whimper and moans from being so sensitive, but feeling how hard he stays. I like talking about sex, the anticipation and vulnerability of it all. The different positions to tackle, the new experiences and sometimes even the straight up uncomfortable moments. They all tie into the big event. Now, I'll be honest. I haven't had just passionate, missionary old school sex in a while, but the connection in the bedroom is what's important. Whether you are becoming daddy's little slut or you are passionately having sex with all the oohs and ahhs and I love yous, it's all in the connections. If it feels wrong, or you become grossed out and reserved, it's not right for me. So, what turns me on, the most? Confidence, new experiences, and some hardcore fucking. I also really like a bad boy or some tattoos, the long hair and the surprise factor (I like a lot) What turns me completely off? Feeling absolutely nothing in your partner. I'm a freak, I can get pretty intense, I need someone who can keep up and have no boundaries and shame. Touch Me Gently and Then All At Once Xoxo"

Im too focused on the other person and tend to fall into a pattern of putting on a show for them. I was sexually assaulted a few years ago and its been really difficult for me to truly be intimate since then. Ive had two 6 month relationships and some casual sex partners since, but I havent felt comfortable with or connected to anyone if that makes sense. Even though Ive always been rather submissive in bed, its strange to me that I continue to assume this passive victim role, instead of truly taking control which I feel would empower me to heal a bit more. I end up feeling taken advantage of, even though I like being used. I feel hurt, even though I like it rough. I do what I think my partner wants me to do not really feeling anything but kinda okay. I remember how different things were with my first LTR (2yrs) and how uninhibited I was. I feel that Ive somehow lost that part of me that was able to be vulnerable. I have tried being open about this issue and have experienced kind but awkward reactions. They want to be sensitive toward it but dont know how to be supportive or talk about it in depth. Tbh neither do I. Im seeing a new guy who is great but Im honestly scared of losing him by having these problems. I want to ask advice from people who may have been in similar situations (big hug if you have, it can be such a lonely place). How to do you regain intimacy and vulnerability? How to you lean into being submissive without having flashbacks? Tl;dr Sex hasnt been the same since being assaulted and I really yearn to regain that intimacy. Advice?"
116,vulnerability,sex,Blow Jobs Philosophy,3,bt8glw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/bt8glw/blow_jobs_philosophy/,2019-05-27 00:22:18,"From a symbolic, philosophical, and metaphysical perspective.... blow jobs and ""eating"" someone's ass... I think we would all agree that these all represent vulnerability and submissiveness to your partner... I mean... you're eating someone's ass here. I don't care how clean you are, there's a risk anyway. And with blowjobs, you're on your knees, giving yourself and your life force to pleasing someone else. At the same time, it's an act of vulnerability for a man to trust a woman to properly handle his penis in her mouth. That's a biggggg risk if this woman isn't trustworthy and decides to chomp down on you instead. I am wondering-- from a male's perspective-- can you feel that energy of subservience? How does that make you feel? I am sure it is different if it's just a random blow job vs. someone you are emotionally intimate with, as well. At the same time, you know- Freud would speculate that all women really want to have a penis. So for women who really love giving blowjobs-- are they actually trying to acquire some of this ""power"" from men? But ultimately, maybe they are in control if he is trusting his most prized possession in her mouth? At the same time... if she loves doing it and he says no, he has power. So ultimately, he has the power anyway. It's all an interesting power dynamic to me. This is all speculation. for conversation as I was thinking on it today.. hopefully nobody gets their panties in a twist. :) I'm not saying either sex has more power or dominance. Sexual dynamics are different for everyone and between everyone."

So this happened a few moments ago... I'm \[26M\] writing this from my phone on another room while my Fiancee \[27F\] is asleep. Basically, yesterday was our relationship's ""aniversary"". We are planning our wedding, but live at different houses with our parents cause of airtight tradition. My brother went out on a business trip and allowed us to stay at his place sporadically for the rest of the week. We celebrated by having dinner at a fancy restaurant and then moved into the apartment for some sexy time. We drank a bottle of wine between the two, but then tanked and fell asleep without having any action. I did not expect we would have sex after that, and was fine. At 3AM tho, she woke up and started to flirt with me and woke me up. We started some very nice foreplay and later stood up to have some sex against the wall. The harsh part: While having sex against the wall she had an intense orgasm and asked me to pull out quickly. She can often get tired of penetration as she is quite sensible, and that's fine too. However, after I pulled out, she said she felt VERY sick and wanted to throw up. She resisted hugs, aid, and even my presence for a rapidfire event of a minute, while lying helplessly on the floor. She later asked me to help her move to the bathroom, and completely lost her patience at me again when she was at a safe distance from the toilet. She probably said the worst things to me in this quick interval of time, from our very long time together. She made comments about my smell, demeaning snarks at me overall, and outright offensive shit. I was floored. She kept asking at the same time for water and crackers, which I did provide, in order to help relief the stomach sickness. She commanded me to help her dress herself, while making retching noises as she stood as I knelt. I did so, and in the panic remained naked as she used my clothes as some kind of mat. Afterwards she used my legs as a pillow and we remained petrified for a solid 10 minutes. I was honestly thinking she had food poisoning, and acted in a very calm way. She finally composed herself and asked if I was fine. I said I was not, but that she being physically ill was a priority. After some moments of silence in bed, she said she was sorry. However, for me the worst part was when she finally said that she said that she was aware about what was being said the whole time, and was sorry. I was unable to react. After a minute she fell asleep again, and here we are. Honestly, knowing she knew all along what was happening and did not stay awake for damage control became my nightmare fuel. I lost any ability to sleep. I lost any wish to have sex for the next month. I don't know what I will say, or which issue I'm going to address first tomorrow. Some of the things she said would destroy friendships or at the very least make anyone cry out of shame/vulnerability. Will this happen again? What the hell was that? She is usually a horrible sick person, but hell this was nowhere near as her worst case of actual food poisoning (just physical sickness). Why am I so hurt? I feel like if she actually puked on me there would be no difference on how bad I feel right now."
119,vulnerability,sex,People witb Disabilities and Surrogate Sex and Intimacy Partners considered.,1,buzfdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/buzfdk/people_witb_disabilities_and_surrogate_sex_and/,2019-05-31 08:23:23," I am drawn to looking into becoming a surrogate sexual/intimacy partner for many reasons. I have worked as a care/support worker most of my life, and am an artist/musician empath, poly, and lover of beauty. i don't know how or where to begin. i feel the judgements, stigma, suspicion coming down. this is still very, very new and strange territory for most of us. i've looked into the eyes of some my girlfriends over the years, (both younger and much older than i) as they tell me they had/have never climaxed before. the first time i heard it said, i was shocked. but then i heard it again. and again. and again. and again. and again. I'm no longer shocked. i am heartbroken. I'm angry and I'm outraged. Orgasm is like Mother Earth rising up from the ground to embrace, caress and complete us. and making love is, ideally, how we journey there with a loving, trusting partner, who offers up his own vulnerability to his lover, assurance that, in this place, she is safe to explore, dance, sing, fly, swim, run, celebrate, or wander quietly, safe in knowing your lover holds you, while you drift in the bliss that is your beauty, yours alone. to put it another way... the woman inside that tiny body in the wheelchair, that homeless woman in front of the bank, the bank's ceo, wintering in Tuscany, and his wife, only half-hiding her cabana boys and how bored she's become with these adolescents, and shocked to realize that, like that tiny person in the wheelchair, nobody at all is listening to her needs. when it comes to this chronic disease, the deep loneliness that Mother Theresa called modern society's greatest affliction, is only spreading. And online dating makes us even more suspicious of one another, so we trust a mathematical algorithm called ""admin"" to keep us safe from each other - and pay a lot of money for it. online dating feels life what a visit to the Coliseum might have been like in ancient Rome. and that is a terrifying thought. we are love. it's a crime how much time, money, sorrow and suffering we spend on trying to deny this fact. Take a walk downtown and silently open your heart to those around you. you will see it and hear it: 'please love me' and you'll know it, because we have all cried out the same silent, lonely cry, sometimes to the one beside us. if you're not listening, then who is? stop, power-off, relax, breathe, and, at eye level and a respectful distance, offer up your complete and undivided attention for as long as she or he needs it. drop all expectations, and everybody speaks, whether through words or sounds, eye movements, hand gesures or an interpreter. every caregiver knows that ""whoa, waaay to much information"" moment. if anybody has said that to you, then you know that little sting of shame that seems to linger: what if the people who said that to you were also the people you literally depend on for your survival? Chances are that somebody who is a complete stranger today will be the one to keep you alive tomorrow. and chances are that this person will look and sound absolutely nothing like what you'd thought or hoped."

As the title says, why do people enjoy feeling so exposed during sex? It honestly still scares me to be naked (both physically and emotionally) in front of another person. Not only am I afraid of what they might think of my body (I'm very underweight), but also about crossing their/having my boundaries crossed. I've only been able to orgasm with a partner once.

TL;DR I struggle to cum from oral. SO offered to do it as long as it takes to finish me. Couldn't stay hard for more than a minute. This all starts with me having difficulties cumming from oral. I've had 3 partners try, could rarely finish with any of them. I just figured I've never gotten good oral but that can't be it. I've been with SO for 6 years. She was upfront with me that her previous relationship turned her off to giving oral. She said that that was all her partner wanted and rarely took care of her needs so in her mind oral was a no-no. Luckily for me she has changed her mind and does go down on me. I would love if it happened more often but I respect her and won't force her to do something she hates. Our sexual histoy has been rocky and it's led me to be prioritize her needs over mine, to a fault. There have been many times when my needs weren't met but she was happy so I didn't say anything. I know, that's bad, and so a few days ago I took the plunge and opened up to her about wanting more. It was a huge moment of vulnerability on my part. I'm not sure she realizes how much courage it took me to ask for more oral. SO says of course and goes at then and there. But as usual, she stopped after only a few minutes. Didn't say why or anything. And that's part of the problem. She always does that. I feel like she gets me ready only for her to jump on me and get her rocks off, which is what happened. So today she tells me to lie back and that she's going to finish the deed. I've got all this crap running in my head. Why did she stop the other day? Why does she always stop? She hates cum, maybe I shouldn't let myself go... Stop tensing up, relax. Literally a minute into it and lil homie just goes away. Naturally I got frustrated and we chatted about it. She said we'd try again another day, told me to stop worrying about it. But I can't stop worrying about it. Ugh, just typing this is is frustrating."

Please let me know if this is not the right forum. Gf doesn't use reddit but using a throwaway just for precautions. My gf and I have been together for about 7 months. I'll call her Piper. We are both second year grad school students at the same school (she took a gap year to travel Southeast Asia...that's only a glimpse into the kind of person she is); I am during my MSCS, she is a PhD candidate in sociology. Such differing fields of study, yet we're so compatible. That's probably due to the incredible person Piper is. We met at a grocery store at about the beginning of the semester. I was disintegrating, a horrific mess, just yearning for the sweet release of death. Grad school was extremely difficult, my mother was continuing the practice of crushing my self esteem with perpetual calls of berating about my mediocre grades and pressure to get married, someone who I had been such good friends with, had shared my most intimate secrets including my sexuality, had betrayed me..it was awful. I had just finished a sob session and was buying about six packs of mega oreos when she came. Piper. An angel. She saw the stain-laden school sweatshirt I was wearing and came up to me, saying that she went there to. Then she made a witty comment on the unfathomable amount of oreos I was buying. Piper's wry wit and kind demeanor was what first entranced me. That, and her beauty. Holy shit she is beautiful. Then we were talking, and she kept making all these wonderfully intelligent comments and hilarious quips, and I either stayed completely silent or awkwardly rambled on and ugh I was a mess but she didn't mind. She asked me out for coffee. And we've been together ever since. Piper is brilliant and empathetic and pragmatic and just so...incredible. Sometimes I would look at her and think...how? How would a boring, unoriginal, ugly ass piece of shit bisexual trashload like me, appeal to such an amazing person? I was constantly trying to impress her and make her happy but she didn't care. She didn't pay attention to that stuff, she just liked me I guess for who I was. Now Piper is the first girl I've ever been with. I have been in very few relationships anyway, mostly due to my lack of social skills and strict mother. (she is Indian, so she forbids any fraternizing with the opposite sex all through high school, yet expects me to be married with a stable job by 22. typical.) I was with a boy once but it was pretty standard. Most importantly, I had never had sex when I met her. In fact, I lost my virginity to her on our third date...I wasn't tremendously eager to, because I was so frightened, and also I didn't know where this relationship was headed, so I didn't want to lose it to what would become some random chick...but I was also terrified of her knowing what the boring person I was. I didn't want to expose my naivete, my vulnerability, and her sexually confident self to be completely turned off. I wanted her to like me, to think I was as cool and awesome as she was. So I did it. And it was pretty great to be honest. And thankfully I was so, so wrong, and Piper is not just some random chick. She's Piper. The spectacular woman I can spend days with and laugh with and she can call hers. One day Piper wanted to do it. This was around three months together, in the early stages. I was on my period, so I denied, but then she got super excited and said she wanted to experiment something with me. She wanted to eat me out. I was like, dude no way, that's kind of weird, and I could see her getting mad. Then she said words I will never forget...""That's what I thought"". Her face was not disappointment, but more like- irritation. It had happened...she had been disgusted by my sexual inexperience. She had realised what a dull person I was, that I was one of those fearful girls who would only stick to the stuff she knew. I was so anxious, I thought she would treat me differently, she would call me a bore, she would break up with me...so I immediately agreed. And she did it. It was honestly so weird, but she was so freaking happy with me after. So yeah. I kept on agreeing. It was so bizarre and kind of revolting to see my period blood all over her mouth, and the way she did it...like she would devour my vagina. In fact, whenever I wasn't on my period, she refused to give it to me because it wasn't ""interesting"" anymore without any blood I guess. She got really mad a couple months ago because I didn't tell her that I got my period..its just I didn't want to deal with it that time. But she was so mad, and I just wanted to make her happy. So I never did that again. It was a bit nauseating, but I endured it because other than this little sexual experimentation, Piper was magnificent, my savior and I loved her beyond belief. In addition, it was on the pretense I would never have to do it to her. But two days ago, she proclaimed that very thing. She wanted me to suck her off while blood heavily flowed out of her vagina. Now, I usually comply with everything she says, because a. it's almost always the right thing, and b. I didn't want her to get upset with me. But for the first time, I said absolutely not. I said that it was weird and I let her do it to me because it made her happy, but there was no way I was going to do it to her. And of course, my worst fear came true. She called me naive and monotonous and a ""little baby when it comes to sex"", and said that she always did all the work. Then she stormed out. I was sobbing furiously as she slammed the door. She's been working on her thesis, I think?, so I haven't heard from her since. I am devastated you guys. I tried so hard to prevent it from happening, her realising how awful and boring a person I am, but it happened. I love her so, so freaking much and she has done so, so much for me...she pulled me out of the dark, interminable hole of sadness I was struggling to get out of, she has helped me come to terms with my sexuality, she has always been there to defend me with my mom, she's the light of my life. It's just this one thing, that may not even be that weird, that my stupid, baby self thinks is weird. Can you guys tell me what to say to her and what to do? I don't know what to do. Thank you, and apologies for the graphic details. Best, C"

124,vulnerability,sex,"Initiating sex while Im sleeping. My (44m) husband and me (38f) have an active sex life, but....",31,bdgncc,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/bdgncc/initiating_sex_while_im_sleeping_my_44m_husband/,2019-04-16 00:31:48,"Lately hes only initiating sex after I fall asleep. So heres some more details. We have been under a lot of stress lately. We have sex almost daily, and our chemistry is great. Im beyond attracted to my husband, and find him incredibly sexy. But we have been fighting a lot more lately due to stressors with family and custody crap. So my sex drive isnt as high lately. My husband is insatiable, which I love. But lately when we go to bed, I fall asleep fairly quickly because I take sleeping meds due to the stress. But almost every night before hes ready to go to bed he starts playing with my pussy, and of course my body responds to him, and always has. Heres where my frustration comes in. I said we have been fighting more than normal, and honestly I dont want to be touched when Im pissed off. I think most women are like this. Theres no emotional connection between us when we are fighting. But the thing about is, when I fall asleep, my subconscious obviously doesnt give a shit if Im mad, because the minute he starts touching me while Im sleeping my body betrays me and I get super wet, which arouses him, because he knows my body craves and wants his touch all the time. So if we are arguing or go to bed mad this is how he has sex with me (I eventually wake up horny, so hes not raping me or doing anything without consent). I guess I get mad that my body betrays my mind when Im mad. I feel like after we have sex, the argument is over and not dealt with. Its hard to stay mad after youve orgasmed 2-3 times. The endorphin rush makes you feel euphoric. So my rant or frustration is that, I hate that I dont have control of my body when I want too. I have never experienced this before with another man (2nd marriage). But it doesnt matter how pissed off or angry I am, my body craves his touch and him and when Im sleeping, he knows this so he takes advantage of my vulnerability. Sorry if Im all over the place, I just dont know how to convey the frustration at times."
125,vulnerability,sex,Why is sexually - especially female sexuality still so taboo even amongst women? Why are almost forced sexual gender roles really a thing? (Focusing on US but anyone please chime in).,1,bdhizf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/bdhizf/why_is_sexually_especially_female_sexuality_still/,2019-04-16 01:48:00,"So I'm beginning to get really curious. We seem to accept and take it as standard that men are sexual creatures. Women seem to expect men to be sexual or make advances under the right conditions. It's cuturally acceptable it seems for men to masturbate, talk about sex, assume a dominant sexual gender role. Buy why on Earth is this an existing double standard. Why is it still stigmatized that women are sexual too? I've noticed this on reddit, anonymous secret posting apps like whisper, tinder even. If a conversation moves towards sexuality you start to see differences right away. Now I'm acknowledging that a lot of women get approached purely for sexual gratification of men and it's most likely put many of you off the topic when getting to know someone but I think you can genuinely get to know each other on an intimate ""behind the public mask persona"" without it becoming weird. It's a raw and primal expression of ourselves that everyone has. So why are we so afraid to talk about it as a culture and as women as a whole? Generally speaking. This came up as a thought to me when in another reddit someone assumed women of ""mom age"" simply didn't masturbate or own toys anymore. As if female sexuality served a singular purpose. As a side note I've also noticed at least in my area of the US (CA) That many women (and men) are heavily ingrained in what seems to be the ""socially acceptable gender roles) i.e. women will only show interest in being sexually submissive and are almost hard wired to think men should be dominant (either in vanilla or kink) and that women should be submissive. Many even seem to go out of their way to fit these roles. So what's the mindset about it? Why do women shy away from sexual dominance and empowerment even when it's clear you're in a judgement free zone. Why does society even now think a woman open in her sexuality has something wrong with her in any way shape or form and in all honesty why don't I see more women trying to empower themselves and break the mold so to speak. Is this a deeply ingrained cultural thing we've been kind of brain washed into as we grew up? It's just curious to me. I'm pursuing my Masters in clinical psychology and getting a BA in human sexuality and intimacy has always been a fascination of mine. Ideally and in theory our sexuality is the most raw and primal form of communication and expression of self and vulnerability. Why do we smother it? Why does this assumed dominant submissive gender role typically exist do you think? I'll admit myself as a sexually submissive man but I ask this not out of frustration at trying to find a dominant partner that accepts and encourages the side of me I truly feel I am but because I've noticed that over the years if I've been truly honest about it the reactions to a submissive male that's been assumed to be dominant have been extremely mixed and responses such as ""I like dominant men because submissive men seem weak"" for example don't really say much about me but about stereotypes and misinformation as a whole. I've also noticed that when you organically get to the part in knowing someone where intimacy is brought up you see distinct patterns in many people with some of us being outliers (women admitting too and being into being dominant, men truly sexually submissive and not seeking just a night to explore a fantasy and get off too it). Here's a fun side bar to an already long post and question. To the men and women that do fall outside the typical gender roles, how would you prefer it to come up or be brought up. I.e. I'm a submissive guy, how could I approach you displaying this or bringing it up in a non creepy fashion that encourages genuine conversation in getting to know each other. Or i.e. you're a dominant woman how do you wish you could say this early. Because intimacy is one of the hardest branches to find compatibility in yet we shy from talking about it until we're already fully invested only to experience let down if the other isn't what we need? Sorry for the long post it just really stuck in my brain for some reason."

128,vulnerability,sex,'Women don't want to sleep with virgins' and why I feel it's more complicated than that,2,biutqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/biutqe/women_dont_want_to_sleep_with_virgins_and_why_i/,2019-04-30 07:12:14,"Reading [this post;](URL got me thinking about the other side of the issue; the ""Women don't want virgins"" side. Formed from my own opinions and from picking up on a fair amount of frustration from guys who believe women aren't being 'fair' by not being more forthcoming, or attracted to male virgins. I think there should be things that changed regarding the topic of being a virgin regardless of gender; but there's a constant topic I don't agree with and the above linked post has encouraged me to share it. I'm a 28yr old guy who is a virgin and I've found that yeah, some women don't want to be the one to pop a guys cherry. I don't blame them, though. I'd like to be optimistic and think that it can be a fun experience for both, that it's all part of the early stages of discovering sex &amp; sexuality and so on, but in reality it's more complicated than that. I can't speak for female virgins but as a guy, I imagine it can be quite taxing for a woman to take a guys virginity, especially the older the guy is. An imbalance of experience can put a lot on her to be the leader of the encounter, and to 'do a good job'. Even if the woman prefers to be submissive in the bedroom, I imagine that experience can put her into a more dominant position by default. Unless that woman is romantically/emotionally invested in him or it's her kink, taking his virginity will benefit him more than her in a ONS or hook up scenario. Even when not intended, there can be a selfish element to a guy losing his virginity; thinking of it as ""yeah it'll be bad but it's my first time"" won't make the experience much better for her and could come across as a ""Well I've got mine"" kinda thing. Enthusiasm is great and sexy, but it's not garaunteed to hold up the experience on it's own. Another side is more sinister, and that is to consider that there's an ever present risk of approaching a virgin guy on the topic of virginity. Spend 10 minutes in an Incel/Red Pill etc subreddit and you'll understand why a woman might be apprehensive getting involved. Whilst myself and many other guys look forward to the intimacy and connection sex brings; some guys just want to substitute their right hand, start the notches on the bedpost, brag and so on. I'm sure there are women reading who may have found themselves in a position where the possibility of them taking a guys virginity could be implied, only for the guy to take this as a 'sure thing' and become pushy, impatient or down-right rude. Not to mention salty, vindictive or threatening when not getting what they felt was 'promised'. Finally in 'I'm a virgin so please take my virginity from me' scenarios there's the fear of the guy getting attached, which is a legitimate concern. Coming from myself this may come across hypocritical given my post history; but it's a big ask to ask someone to risk that. Sex and Intimacy are closely linked, and both parties could be hurt from it. I remember reading that sex for a woman can potentially be a much more vulnerable experience than it is for a man. This vulnerability can be present with any new partner, so it's understandable that it's multiplied when facing the issues above. I'd recommend that anyone who feels that it's unfair that women don't immediately want to jump into bed with them because they're a virgin has to understand that: * They're not obliged to take your virginity from you &amp; losing your virginity isn't a valid reason to have sex in and of itself * They should look deep into themselves and not ask 'Why don't women want to take guys virginities' but rather: 'Why wouldn't a woman want to take *my* virginity' If you're failing to have sex with people, it's more than likely because of who you are, rather than you being a virgin. This isn't to say you're not attractive or not trying, just that you may have to consider how you direct your energy into being someone people want to sleep with, or putting yourself into a situations where people are more likely to want to sleep with you. Everyone was a virgin at some point; but it's not like there was a big 'Virgin match-making' party you missed out on; those people continue to have sex because they're people other people want to have sex with. There are women who wrongfully belittle or talk down on a guy who is a virgin but I won't spend much time expanding on that, because you'll gain little wasting your time with those types of people. ""Be a person someone wants to have sex with"" isn't constructive advice; You need to be more than someone who hasn't had sex yet. I've found through my own struggles that virginity is usually a label you impose on yourself more than others impose on you. People will argue what sex is and what it means; but for a lot of people it's a valuable thing, and not something they're willing to give out. Just being a virgin shouldn't be seen as the sole, worthy excuse to have sex with someone else. I just think ""Women don't want to have sex with me because I'm a virgin"" is mostly a myth, and an excuse to put your own shortcomings on someone else."

I am recently single and it is not due to this topic but now that I am single, I have been reflecting a lot on my past relationship and a theme that has come up is my obsession with wanting to be the 'first' at something sexual. Example: the first guy she's tried anal with. The first guy to have sex in the shower with. The first guy to go skinny dipping with... etc. I realize that asking to be the first sexual partner altogether is asking a little too much now-a-days but I would literally take it incredibly personal when I found out I wasn't the first guy my ex had done anal with. It's not that I love anal sex, I just wanted to be the first guys she tried it with. I think it has something to do with the vulnerability and intimacy that makes me want to be her first at something. Like I am claiming that part of her sexuality as mine, somehow, in a weird kind of way. So my question is, has anyone heard of this before. Have you dated someone who wanted so badly to be the first at something sexual? I really don't get why I worry about it so much and let it bother me. I don't expect a girl to want me to be a virgin. I have done almost everything once and I don't expect the girl to want me to be her first at anything but when I hear the girl I am dating has done many things sexually, it really hurts my feelings like she should have been saving that experience for me so we could enjoy it together for our first time. Kind of embarrassing and I guess I just want to hear that I'm normal and every guy goes through this but I highly doubt that so what's going on with my psych-e? Why does this bother me when I can't ask the same of the woman I am dating?"

I just couldn't stay hard enough for reinsertion and the lack of feeling from the condom didn't help and we eventually just quit. We cuddled afterwards and I lied to her and told her I had a bad breakup awhile ago and hadn't had sex for awhile cause I was ashamed it took me this long to lose my v-card. She seemed supportive and said it wasnt the worst shes had but after I left a few days passed and she unmatched with me and told me that she just wasn't feeling it between us, I asked if there was anything I could of done better but she said no it just wasnt working out for her. I'm pretty sure she was just trying to spare my feelings but it still just makes me feel inadequate.

I thought it was recovered but knew it to be quite vulnerable and part of the reason why I think I could enjoy and crave sex with him so much is because when I felt unattractive or unlovable I could hide at home and he never had to see me at my 'worst'. Now he does see me at my worst and the reduced intimacy is beginning to reinforce my fears about that. It's relevant too that he works in construction, sometimes 60 + hours a week and I noticed around 6 months into our relationship that he was much more frequently too tired for sex, but it always hovered around the 2 - 4 times a week mark and would be a high priority, we never went a week without it. Also, he would give clear signals that he was too tired on certain days, and so I didn't feel too much 'will we/won't we' disappointment. It never mattered because for me it was frequent enough. But he seems to be able to switch off from anything sexual at all except late in the evening just before we go to sleep. I'm up for it at all times, whenever I see him really. The difference is noticeable. He doesn't like PDAs for example. All of this is subtly changing since we first got together, where it was much more 'Shakira' (by which I mean: whenever, wherever) I'm understanding about the physical tiredness, of course and wouldn't expect him to have sex if he wasn't in to it. However, we recently moved in together (since November) and since then the sex has gradually declined to once a week and occasionally even less. There have been one or two times since we met when he's hinted that he doesn't masturbate really, because we have so much sex (even now it's once a week). He's also sort of chuckled at my use of my vibrator, almost a disbelieving attitude I guess? So I'm wondering how low his libido is... But the real kicker for me is that I've realised that now I'm with someone I love and trust and who loves and trusts me back, my desire for him just isn't dwindling, and most days I wish he would fuck me or let me blow him or even just give me intimacy and cuddles, but I've started to feel and notice his resistance to sexual intimacy. As a girl formerly abused, I would find it hard to just whip his dick out or do anything so basic and clear that I want him, because I think it lacks consent and leaves me very open to the risk of actual verbal or angry rejection (expericed firsthand). I prefer non verbal communication where it comes to sex. Right from the start we always lead into sex with a heavy makeout session. He's always been a bit resistant to certain things, set i his ways e.g. Won't do morning sex because he can't get work done on site well, which I respect but it seems to apply to days off too. Lately, I've found he is less and less likely to indulge me when I try to start those make out sessions and he took to drinking beer on the couch after he gets home from work to the point where he falls asleep or he plays video games until I'm asleep. It feels like a conscious choice because it happens any night he goes to the couch to 'wind down'. I don't know how to signal to him that even when im tired or stressed (which I am a lot lately due to a new job) I still want him, in fact maybe more so because for me sex with a loving partner relieves stress. I think it may be different for him. I touch him a lot which to be honest I am starting to think he doesn't like, and even though he always affirms how much he loves me verbally, I kinda feel like I'm pestering him. Now it's been a week and I cracked, going mad wondering why he hasn't allowed any kisses to linger and hasn't felt the need to jump into bed with me or do anything sexual. I texted him that I was horny before he left work on Friday, and told him I wanted him. He read the message but said nothing about it, and when I saw him later I let him just talk and joke about other stuff. He basically ignored it, didn't even affirm, yeah I miss you or I want you too. I've put on weight (about 7kg) with the crazy amount of stress my new job has brought on, and apart from the low self esteem I have from struggling at work at the moment, naturally the lack of enthusiastic interest from him has led me pretty quickly to look at my own shortcomings. I'm looking fatter than when we met, I'm not as confident/comfortable in my own skin (although I could still lose myself in the moment if he showed he wanted me). I just feel like I'm losing myself when all it would take from him is just a few extra touches, or even a chance for me to blow him/give a handjob, or sex regularly 2 or 3 times a week and not just on his days off, ideally. It's not about a need for sex, purely, either. When it's that I can handle it myself. This is about a need for intimacy with the pair of us. Its a key way that I express and reaffirm my love... I've no idea how to communicate my needs to him without seeming like I'm being critical of him, and without it making things forced and awkward. I know from experience that once you get inside your own head about sex stuff it can be difficult to get out of it. As it's been once to twice a week for a month now, and just dipped a little more, am I overreacting too quickly, could it just be because of the stress of our new jobs? It feels like I have to do something about it now, because it's making me miserable and a bit resentful of him... Tldr - how do I tactfully bring up the declining sex and intimacy with my partner? Should I be worried or wait it out a while longer? Is it literally down to me to initiate every time? "
135,vulnerability,sex,I had my first orgasm with a partner in years !,1,aptn10,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/aptn10/i_had_my_first_orgasm_with_a_partner_in_years/,2019-02-13 01:04:00,"/ Trigger warning: rape, sexual abuse recovery / Woman in later twenties here. A year ago, I could say I had given up on having one. I have had three seriou-ish relationships, and had maybe one or two orgasms per entire (1-3 year) relationship. I didn't know how to prioritize my own sexual pleasure, and focused mostly on being this perfect porn-like partner. I have been raped as a teenager and two of my exes were emotionally and sexually abusive - I see now how it all played a huge part in me being completely disconnected from my body. I would be constantly talking about how much I love sex, and was seen by all my friends as the most adventurous and open-minded girl around, but when it would come to it, I wouldn't know how to enjoy it to the fullest; at the same time wanting it so badly. It caused so much frustration and led to a lot of bad decisions. I met my current lover almost two years ago. He was the first one to whom I was completely open about my past trauma, and for the first time I stopped faking orgasms. We had a lot of intimate and loving and fun and kinky sex, but me never finishing was an elephant in the room. It was difficult, confronting, I felt like a failure, I felt so much anger towards men who had hurt me in the past, I felt I had been robbed of an essential part of human experience. I started therapy, went on-and-off anxiety meds, started masturbating more, bought different vibrators to use with my lover, opened up about my fantasies - it was all part of a journey towards the first one. But the true breaking point was realising that I carry the responsibility for my own sex life. That I can, and I have to take the control back. That I can't expect to find a perfect partner who will magically fix me, that I have to do the work myself - and wow, did it pay off ! I also found the power in trust and vulnerability, and I am so lucky to have a partner that is worthy of it. It took about 15 months of patience for each other, and I finally had my first mind-blowing orgasm with him. I was letting go, but at the same time I was finally in control of my pleasure - I figured out what I wanted and now I dare to take it. Shortly after the first one, the second and the third followed. I am writing this to get it off my chest, to share my joy, but also I am hoping that someone out there who is struggling with the same issues, will find comfort in my story. If you are, please don't give up - if I could see it through, you can, too. Thanks so much for reading ! "
136,vulnerability,sex,I have to mentally prepare myself for intimacy because (I think) Im afraid of it? or something like that.,1,aqds1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/aqds1i/i_have_to_mentally_prepare_myself_for_intimacy/,2019-02-14 11:39:10,"My boyfriend (21) and I (f20) have been together for a year and its all been wonderful. He is incredibly loving, caring and kind. I have only been in long term relationships in the past, but my current one is by far the most fulfilling one Ive been in. Sex feels amazing with him, by far the best Ive ever had. I am incredibly attracted to him. He doesnt do anything Im uncomfortable with, is always incredibly respectful and asks for consent for anything new(we experiment often), and stops IMMEDIATELY (without whining or making me feel bad bc blue balls or whatever) if Im sore/cant continue. It also feels amazing on an emotional level. Im comfortable with him and trust him, and the vulnerability that comes with physically intimacy feels right. Despite all this, I am sort of..afraid of sexual intimacy with him? I dont know that afraid is the right word but its the closest thing I can think of. I sort of...plan ahead to when hes going to want sex. Ex; Well we had sex yesterday, so hell probably want sex tonight unless hes too tired from work. Assuming hes too tired then hell definitely want sex tomorrow night And if its a night where I know/think hes going to want to do something, I subconsciously try to postpone it(and then realize what I had been doing later on). Like throw a movie on or make food or start painting or something to distract him/me from sex. I dont know why I do this... Im a chronic ovethinker and I worry about everything a bit too much. When I think about intimacy, Im not afraid necessarily, its just something I have to prepare myself for. When I was younger I was assaulted/raped on several different occasions...the last incident occurring in late 2017. Ive gotten past it, and Im doing really well. I know itll always affect me, but I wonder if this is potentially causing whatever this is. I also identified as asexual for about 4 years, but at age 17 or so I decided that wasnt correct, that maybe it was just the trauma that prevented me from being super into sex. Hes noticed me trying to postpone intimacy, and he didnt mind but he was worried that he wasnt good/that something was wrong. Its nothing like that, I dont know why I do this. I feel like somethings wrong with me. Sex feels good on all levels with him, I want sex, but Im also mentally preparing for it a lot more than Id like. Am I asexual? Is my sex drive too low? Am I doing something wrong? Is he? Is my trauma getting in the way of being excited about sex? Is my overthinking ruining it? If anyone has a similar experience or any advice, please let me know. I dont want him to worry, and I want to stop worrying. TLDR; Amazing relationship with amazing sex, but I find myself overthinking/overplanning our next intimate moment and its making me crazy. I feel more worried/afraid of sex rather than excited. Could past sexual trauma be impacting me? Am I doing something wrong? "

You must be making decent money and be overall successful and independent. I'm ready to get into a serious relationship and get married because I got two important things most women look for in men, stability and independence. But I'm still afraid to get married for numerous reasons. Those reasons are: the divorce rate is really high and men are more likely to get screwed up in a divorce if things don't work out, dealing with in-laws and your partner's friends and the most important reason: SEX. There are some reasons I dread sex. My penis is not small but it's not the biggest either, you must perform well, and I find sex quiet nasty, creepy and quite sinful and let's not forget the emotional vulnerability that seems to come with it and seems to be required. Sharing feelings is one of the things I hate doing. It's always a chore to me. Even though it's a rare thing. The only person I share feelings with is my long time childhood male friend (no homo) because I feel at ease with him. Call me a pussy and all you want but I'm afraid of marriage because I'm afraid of sex. Sex seems like a performance task and it's nasty. So why do y'all like sex so much ?

And how they never do? And how they claim to be bisexual but never seem to have good relationships with any women? I thought I would start to end up like one of them. Too scared and comfortable to explore the full range of my interests because what I had with my bf was enough. But in the last 2 weeks, I decided to push myself both physically and emotionally, and let me share what I learned about enjoying a threesome without worrying about it. 1. Be prepared for things to go wrong. Talk to your partner about how one or both people might end up being jealous and how you will reassure them and comfort them if that happens. 2. Find a unicorn. No, seriously. It's hard to find uncommitted girls without a lot of drama or strings attached. We got lucky. A mutual friend of ours had a break up, and while she was looking for intimacy, she wanted something comfortable and here we were. We talked about it over a casual dinner before thinking of anything more. 3. Communicate, communicate, communicate. How long is the encounter going to last? How does it start? We decided to watch a movie at our place with drinks and start. We decided we'd all shower the next morning and have breakfast together and then head our separate ways. It was easy. Nothing awkward about who leaves and when. We had an extra bed in case we got uncomfortable in our Queen. 4. And most importantly, shed your inhibitions. It's going to be a whole another level of vulnerability that you never thought you could have. Feelings about yourself, about your partner, about your partner's feelings for you, and more. All laid out naked and bare, pardon the pun. But talk it over with everyone that this is going to happen and your job is to have fun. And that things end if ever anyone gets uncomfortable. 5. Don't forget to use protection, and most likely a lot of it because folks, you can't reuse condoms. 6. Hydrate. And have some snacks, because you're going to be a little anxious, you're going to have to do more physical work, and yes, you get surprisingly more hungry afterwards than you think. 7. Spoon and cuddle with your partner. The long-term one. The unicorn will understand. I might have missed out on a few more, and I'm only just getting started so many the more experienced of you all can chime in and tell me exactly how silly and naive I'm being. But this is the story of how I cribbed from a great movie title and loved the threesome."

In my teenage years I found a lot of good times in front of a webcam being watched getting naked and jerking off. Occassionally I'd chat with a girl willing to return the favour, but it wasn't always necessary. Nothing unheard of so far, I know. This lead to the discovery that I get very turned on being watched. Whether it's the idea of someone also getting off on what they're seeing, or just the general feeling of vulnerability, I can't be sure, but I liked it. I stopped the webcam thing a long time ago and am in a happy relationship, but sometimes I find myself getting turned on at the idea of not fully closing my blinds while I jerk off. I'm not talking wide open windows and being on full display, but more like if someone happens to look, they would be able to tell. I will add that my SO isn't really into the whole watch/be watched deal. I will mention that yes, a couple of neighbors who might see are women, and I'm not trying to pursue anything with them. One of them actually never closes her blinds at all and has on more than one occasion been topless on full display (not that I'm using that as permission). Anyway I'm rambling, I just wanted outside opinions on it, without coming across as overly creepy. TL;DR - Guy enjoys being watched while masturbating, turned on by being partially visible to neighbors, but doesn't want to be a creep about it."

Ive done rubbing which always works for me but whenever i try to finger myself i dont feel shit. I recently told my friend about this and she said i should go for whatever i want but like she started talking about how like when she lost it to her guy or whatever it was panful for her like the first 4 times and she told me how her different bfs comfrted her and cared for her and hugged her while she cried. like thats a moment like a bonding experience. If i use a dildo now I wont be able to get that. and i will feel like ive missed out on that sicne i fucking fucked a tooy instead and the comfrting thing like that seems amazing and special and also shows what kind of person the boyfriend is like it would show alot about the other person's character and how they act in the most vulnerable times. Like to be honest I bought a dildo and idk wtf i was thinking cuz it was like 9 inches and i thought id be fine LMFAO. soooooo i tried it and only got like maximum a half of it in before it was sooo painful and i started bleeeding but i could see why people enjoy it. that was after a bunch of attempts. like i started bleeding after like a tenth went it. So yah ive decided maybe i should stop u and not order a smaller dildo all together but i want to have sex but ugh i want that bonding experience vulnerability and character thing etc..... but also want to be able to have sex with people with no strings attached and have no problem with it. so yeah help me out people im on the fence give me u opinions. thanks !

There are 2 things he mentioned that I don't know what to do with, and I'd like advice on how to approach them. The first thing he mentioned was that crying turns him on. I'm not weirded out or anything, and he didn't act like it is super important for him, just a quirk. Neither of us is into any kind of roll play or acting, so my only thought of how I can integrate this is to ""use him"" (in a positive way!). I have anxiety issues that aren't completely handled with my medication. When it gets overwhelming (rarely, maybe once every few months) I tend to go full recluse and ride it out alone until I'm functional again- I hate emoting with witnesses. I have an intense connection with him though, and I might be able to work myself up to sharing that vulnerability with him when it arises. I will get physical comfort and a surge of feel-good hormones (hopefully... admittedly I've never tried this strategy before), and can low-key fulfill that fetish for him. I'd love feedback from someone who shares this proclivity with him... do you think this would satisfy that part of him? If not, any other suggestions? I'm not a crier in general, so that's about the only thing I can think of. The second thing he mentioned was that he'd find it extremely hot if I were to be a total bitch to someone in public (server, bartender, ticket seller, whatever). I'm the kind of person who will do absolutely ANYTHING in my power to keep others from feeling uncomfortable or hurt, so I feel like this one is completely outside my wheelhouse. He's also super polite and kind to strangers so I'm sure he would try to undo any damage haha... but still don't think I could do it. Any suggestions as to how I could pull this off?

148,vulnerability,sex,Sex workers challenge prostitution law on constitutional ground.,1,ajgrw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ajgrw1/sex_workers_challenge_prostitution_law_on/,2019-01-25 07:38:14,"French sex workers are finally challenging the nordic model regulation ( making selling sex legal but buying illegal) of sex work in France. My question is does receiving compensation or things of value in exchange of sex automatically make all sex for pay exploitative and without autonomous consent? Why do some cases of forced prostitution justify the ban on all forms of prostitution / escorting/ pro domming ? I can't help but to think it is small group of moral based group or anti-sex work/ anti-porn feminists pushing their agendas to control the sexual behavior of all of us. &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; Paris (AFP) French sex workers have lodged a constitutional challenge to a 2016 law making it illegal to pay for sex, reopening a debate on whether women should be free to sell their bodies. On Tuesday, around 30 sex workers backed by nine associations, including a medical NGO, went to the Constitutional Council to argue the law infringed their sexual and commercial freedom and made them more vulnerable to attack. The law, which punishes people caught paying for sex with fines of up to 1,500 euros ($1,800) for first-time offenders and 3,750 euros for repeat offenders, took years to make its way through parliament after fierce debate. Inspired by Sweden, it makes it a crime to buy sex but not to sell it, shifting the criminal responsibility to clients. Hailed by many feminist groups at the time as an advance for women's rights, the law was assailed by sex workers as an infringement of ""constitutional rights to personal autonomy and sexual freedom, respect of privacy, freedom of contract and freedom to do business."" The sex workers also argued that by criminalising their clients the law has eroded their earnings, forcing them to take ever greater risks to earn a living. These include agreeing to engage in unprotected sex or to have sex in isolated environments where they are more vulnerable to attack. In August a Peruvian transgender sex worker, Vanesa Campos, was killed in the forested Bois de Boulogne park west of Paris. She was shot dead while trying to stop a group of men robbing a client. ""It's the client who dictates his conditions and we have no choice because we have fewer clients than before but still as many bills at the end of the month,"" one sex worker, who gave her name as Anais, told AFP after Tuesday's hearing. \- 'Schizophrenic situation' - Many rights groups argue women do not engage in prostitution freely but are forced to do so by hardship or other circumstances. They accuse clients of exploiting their vulnerability. Issuing a robust defence Wednesday of the law, France's High Council for Equality Between Men and Women argued prostitution was ""the opposite of sexual liberation"" and ""oppresses all women"" by enshrining the notion of male domination. The council pointed to a poll showing that 78 percent of French supported the ban as proof of widespread support. ""We don't want a society where it is possible to buy someone else's dignity,"" a lawyer for the abolitionist camp, Cedric Uzan-Sarano, argued before the Constitutional Council. But a lawyer for the sex workers' camp, Patrice Spinosi, countered that by making it a crime to buy sex but not to sell it the state had created a ""schizophrenic"" situation and ""infantilised prostitutes."" ""Who are you to forbid me from doing what I want with my body?"" he asked. The Constitutional Council will publish its decision on whether the law is compatible with France's basic charter on February 1.  2019 AFP"

But intimate sex-- intimacy? It makes me nervous. I have struggled with emotional vulnerability and affection for years. Fucking is the closest I can allow myself to get to someone. Yesterday, however, something happened. Whilst in the middle of a particularly steamy session with the SO, he stopped abruptly, stared deeply into my eyes and my very soul, and just said: ""I don't want to just fuck anymore. I want to make love to you. You're not just anyone to me. I want to grow old with you"". He kissed my forehead and held me for a long time, while I tried to understand the sudden warm feeling on my chest, the stupid smile on my face, and then, the tears. It really felt like he could see right though me at that moment. Sex afterwards felt like the first time. I've had lots of it in my lifetime, yes, but this felt...strangely right? Everything feels so new to me! We made love for the first time yesterday. And for the first time ever, I felt at home. "

It started off with us having really good sex a couple times and then me just not giving him any attention or effort (ive never been in a relationship, so true affection scares me.) Weeks later, he pours his heart to me and tells me Im hurting him with the games I play. While really putting me in my place, in a sad yet angry tone, it turned me on so much. Physically and mentally. We both were so excited to have sex that night, I mean the sexual and emotional tension was blowing through the roof. We got into it and about 6-8 mins in, my partner (18m) becomes flaccid. I realize hes having issues. He gets flustered and sort of pissed and begins to aggressively finger me- which begins to really really hurt. Because ive really only had sex with 3 guys, it was so hard for me to communicate my pain and tell him to stop so I begin to dry up. We kind of laughed it off, and said theres no rush we could literally get back into it anytime. So about an hour later, things heat up and we begin to have sex again. Its going really really good, until 15 mins into it he becomes flaccid again, where I just decided to finish him off orally. This is the first time we have had sex in over a month, and the one time where we actually showed feelings and vulnerability to one another, the sex was just not there. Im so confused and cant stop thinking about it. Why was the sex so good when it was sort of meaningless for me but now that we actually opened up to each other about one anothers feelings, the sex was just not there. Advice anyone "

Ive had boyfriends and was able to fool around just fine in my early teens but intercourse has continued to be an issue for me and I dont have fun with it for long before my emotions get the best of me. I use to think it was just a matter of me getting comfortable with someone, but Ive realized its much bigger than that and even when Im comfortable with my partner, its very hard for me to remain calm when engaging (internally) and so I begin to disassociate and experience discomfort. These feelings have hindered me from indulging in an aspect of my life I would like to enjoy but its filled with so much guilt, fear and vulnerability that I cant enjoy the act, not even with myself at times. I am in therapy for unrelated reasons so its hard mentioning it during sections but it is something Id like to resolve. I like to think the abuse hasnt had much of an effect on me, but it seems like it has given the circumstances. "

I'm not sure if I'm developing feelings of some kind or I'm over thinking things. I guess another thing in worried about is how much self disclosure is safe whether it's info or a picture of myself.

155,vulnerability,sex,Wish we lived in a sex positive culture like the Mangaian people of the Cooke Islands,1,acibsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/acibsi/wish_we_lived_in_a_sex_positive_culture_like_the/,2019-01-05 00:50:03,"I'm a 25 yo heterosexual male and I've never had sex or been in any kind of romantic relationship. I don't mind that I've never had sex, and ""losing"" my virginity isn't really a priority for me, but I do wish sex was a much more open &amp; accessible topic in western culture. Recently I learned about the most sexually liberated culture in the world, the Mangaian people, and one aspect of their culture that I found especially interesting is how they address sex education &amp; sexual relationships, especially the concept of sexual mentors, who tutor maturing pubescent members of the tribe in the art of sexually pleasuring a partner. I know that for myself, I would really appreciate having access to resources like this when it comes to sex education. Some background: I grew up in a very dysfunctional family, and a major issue growing up was the total lack of communication. As such, personal feelings and issues were never discussed freely, especially such a taboo subject as sex. Literally the closest thing I've ever had to the sex talk was my dad asking me, ""do you want to know how it works? No? Okay..."" and my mom screaming at me when she caught me jerking off to porn in high school that sex was nothing more interesting than **""a lock and key, that's it! Nothing more!!""**. Good times. So you can understand my curiosity on the subject, and despite growing up in a repressed household, I strongly believe that sex is a crucial part of a person's emotional &amp; psychological growth &amp; health, not to mention physical. If only more safe spaces were available to people like me who sincerely wish to learn about &amp; experience sex in a controlled, safe &amp; educational environment, especially better, more comprehensive and actually helpful sex education in schools for kids so that people never have to end up in a situation like mine in the first place, with zero support to explore &amp; educate themselves about a perfectly natural, healthy activity &amp; become well balanced, mature members of society. So many issues like sexual violence, unplanned pregnancies, STDS, injuries, toxic relationships, etc. can be so much better prevented through education programs that teach better sex instead of just abstinence &amp; fear &amp; shame. We place so much emphasis on physical health that other equally crucial medical areas like mental health &amp; sexual health take back seats to gym memberships, personal trainers, massage therapists, chiropractors, nutritionists &amp; diets. If an adult in my position wants to experience and learn about healthy, safe sex first hand, there's way too few options that don't involve unsafe, even dangerous levels of risk to my health, and youtube videos &amp; articles can only offer so much guidance. So the idea of sex professionals, therapists, educators, mentors, etc. is much more preferable to the idea of trusting strangers or investing in a relationship just to exercise my right to explore my sexuality in a safe, healthy and appropriate way without shame or stigma. I am still a sexual being regardless of how sexually active I chose to be or not be, and repression of any of our natural drives is never healthy. I am tired of denying the parts of myself that have been shamed by society as taboo, emotionally as well as sexually. I am tired of choosing repression over vulnerability and denying myself permission to be myself in all aspects of my being. We don't have to be in love or in.comitted relationships to explore sex &amp; relationships, and neither do we have to live with the risk of unnecessary exposure &amp; harm or lack of a proper support system to help us in this crucial area of our development as thinking, feeling, self aware beings. What are you thoughts on a more sex positive culture? What are some of your experiences that could have been improved by or prevented with the help of better education/resources/support? What options are out there for people like me who wish to but may not have the necessary means or support to experience, learn about &amp; explore sex? "

I'm not really ashamed for being a virgin still anymore, I used to be in high school because I knew a good fair amount of peers who weren't. And a couple who lost it when they were young (consensually, and I don't envy them). I knew a teen mom as well. But when its come up in conversation, and this may come off as rude, particularly with men, I was always asked ""why?"" I would say: ""I'm not comfortable,"" or ""I'm waiting for marriage."" Or ""I'm just not ready"". Even at 16 years old, when I would say this, their responses made me feel like I was... weird. I still get that at 21. I feel like maybe I have to justify why I'm a virgin or something, but that could be my head talking there. Sex often times disgusts me. I masturbate, I have a sex drive and all. I look at my body and think no one would ever want to see it, even when I lose weight, and I don't shave down there. I've seen comments on porn videos of people being disgusted by seeing a womans groin, or ass, naturally. Which, I get, it isn't always pretty to look at sometimes, and everyone has preferences but it still, I guess, bothers me. And then there's knowing, in sex, you're naked. Your s/o sees EVERYTHING and that scares me. That level of vulnerability honestly frightens me. I guess I'm just wondering if this is normal, to be 21, a virgin, never had an s/o.. I'm as inexperienced as it gets. Am I a prude or something else? Sorry for the ramble! TL;DR: Is it weird to be 21 years old and still a virgin?"

I've not had a lot of time alone with him because we both live with our parents, but I'm planning on booking us a hotel for the weekend in a nearby city just before Christmas if our schedules align. He's not very good expressing his emotions or showing any kind of vulnerability, e.g. how he's feeling, has never complimented me, etc. I had to do a lot of guesswork in the early days depending on his texts/ voice/ actions. The big issue is that he's also not expressed vocally/ physically anything even vaguely sexual. The most that we have done so far is made out, mostly because I started it. I'm a virgin and have been patient so far knowing that he's needed the time to get to know me to start feeling more comfortable opening up, however now more than anything I just really want to rip his pants off, kneel down and watch him lose his mind as I blow him (I've been told in the past that I'm quite good but I want to be the best and I want to learn how to incorporate more balls action). It's driving me crazy, and I know that we probably won't get any alone time until the city trip. In the meantime, how do I go about start slowly incorporating some sexy lingo in the conversations to let him know that I'm more than ready for it when he is and start seducing/ teasing/ getting him excited for it? The only thing I can think of is that I know he gets stressed with his studies and work, saying ""I know a very good way to help you relax"" and leading from there but I know that we won't get a chance to act on it. Tl;dr My boyfriend hasn't talked/ hinted about us having sex yet because I think he's a bit awkward about it.

I almost lost it to strangers at parties when I was the 'normal age' i.e. 16-19 but didn't because: 1. felt like i should wait until being in a relationship as I grew up in conservative environment and had some internalized issues around sexuality. Of course I didn't feel mature enough for a relationship until this year probably so that was dumb. 2. was scared of the pain as I was never able to insert tampon/fingers; I tried to have pelvic exam and was too tight as well and thought that I had one of the weird hymens that required surgery. I have since found that I can insert one finger but still have trouble with two, this mainly worries me because ideally I could have sex with someone without saying that i'm a virgin but seems like they would have to take it slower than normal with me. also i struggle with vulnerability but that seems like something to talk to a professional about maybe, if anyone has advice on overcoming that would be much appreciated! 3. general lack of confidence, I was depressed and gained a lot of weight in university and felt very ugly and awkward in my own skin. I think feeling that way made me very guarded, especially around guys, like i would just assume that i was hideous and anyone talking to me was being nice and not flirting. it would take a guy outright asking me out for me to get a hint but i was uncomfortable with the possibility of being intimate with someone i was friends with? I feel like I'm in a better place in my life in a lot of ways now - I am healthier, more confident, generally less of a mess and masturbate frequently so I am aware of my body more. i don't want to wait for a relationship anymore, I am horny literally all the time and it feels unhealthy to not act on those feelings. the perfect scenario would be having sex with a complete stranger who i would not have to face again after them seeing me at a vulnerable moment because for some reason that makes me nervous + they are somewhat experienced and would care at least a bit about me having a positive first time. or a friends with benefits type situation where they would be patient enough to deal with someone who doesn't know anything at first. i'm sorry for how annoying this post is i just feel so frustrated and stuck, i dont know if i should just go home with someone from a bar? post on craigslist? dating apps? i feel like no guys on there would want to deal with someone who will likely have pain and overall be less fun than a more experienced woman? i moved to a new city recently and don't really know anyone TLDR want to lose virginity, too old to have sex with a random guy and it seem normal, the longer i wait the more anxiety around it i have, what are some strategies for overcoming this"

Usually I'm always in my head, but if someone touches me in specific ways I completely block and only focus on the physical pleasure which is great. So I would like someone to take advantage of that, to use this weakness against me and shut me down. As you can imagine, the idea of being dominated like this makes me feel very ashamed as it's a total vulnerability. Also whenever I meet a bossy kind of woman I usually don't like them, but I imagine they would be exactly those that would be down for that. So... what do I do? Keep it a secret? Tell my partners?

Am I right thinking that wasn't right for him to do that? Or am I just freaking out over something small. I feel guilty for making him stop but I was genuinely frightened. "

164,vulnerability,sex,28M I've realised I have a 'routine' when it comes to sex,1,a32rht,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/a32rht/28m_ive_realised_i_have_a_routine_when_it_comes/,2018-12-05 04:26:31,"I was recently fantasising about sleeping with a woman I encounter in my day to day life, and how it would play out. As I was running the situation over in my head, I realized that I have a 'routine' when it comes to sex that comes in three 'stages'. I've always been the one to initiate sex, and all of my sexual experiences have been with short term partners (40ish women), so I've never had much of a reason to mix things up. 'Stage one' is starting out with something that will make me cum quickly, like a handjob or blowjob. This is primarily because I hate the experience of going through all of the build up and tension with light foreplay, only to transition to vaginal sex and cum within 30-60 seconds. I can sense that a woman is really getting into it, and as soon as I cum it's a huge let down that we will have to stop. If I anticipate an evening of sex I might even jerk off to get the initial 'rush' out of the way, so that I don't disappoint. I typically get hard again within in 2-5 minutes and am then able to last much longer. 'Stage two' of the 'routine' is filling this time with pleasuring her, whether it's with my fingers, orally or breastplay, before then transitioning to 'Stage three', which is a longer session of vaginal sex. Seeing it in writing I can attest that I've never consciously kept a routine or called them 'stages'. I do mix things up because each partner is different, and sometimes that 'break' lasts a long time if she's enjoying it. Reflecting on this has made me realize the inherent vulnerability I'm shielding myself from by sticking to a routine like this. I'm scared of a woman judging me for cumming so quickly, and her getting 'bored' or 'losing interest' whilst she waits for me to get hard again. It's strange to admit to that, because during the subsequent rounds I last much longer, and that frees me up to explore and experiment with doing things differently. I had one woman tell me I was 'like a horse', which I found very funny. I was reflecting on those fears, and losing my virginity at 21. We met at a bar, and arranged for her to come over to my place at a later date. We cooked some food together, and she stayed over, and it wasn't until the morning that we had sex. I was awake most of the night hard as a rock with no idea how to initiate sex, and was intimidated by the fact that she was more experienced than I was. We went straight to vaginal sex, I came straight away, and then she got dressed and left, claiming she had to go to work. She was polite, I suppose, but I felt very vulnerable, with a strong desire to continue. A couple of days later she texted me accusing me of not wanting anything to do with her now that I had slept with her. I couldn't understand why she'd want to see me again after such a dismal performance, AND I was ashamed of her finding out that I had lost my virginity to her. I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I feel I've lost interest in sex because its so difficult to find a partner I'm not only attracted to, but who like me has a high sex drive and is motivated to explore and experiment in the bedroom. I feel frustrated that the responsibility and burden of initiating and leading sex seems to fall upon me as the man. Or maybe I want to have control to protect myself. Perhaps my high standards on women performing in the bedroom is really a reflection of my own performance anxiety. I wonder if some other guys can relate to having a 'routine', or if some women can provide some perspective from their side of things. "

Dating in 2018, woohoo, its the best. So, last guy I dated seemed to be really nice, we texted every day for 2 months, I went further with him than most other guys both physically and emotionally. Then I left town and I saw he updated his Tinder bio. When I broke up with him, telling him this was really hard on me but I felt betrayed, his response was ok and he hung up. Class act. (Found out later he was just protecting his pride and he was kinda sad about it but in the moment it felt shitttty) I didnt date for a while. Six months maybe? I broke that dry spell and dated a coworker this summer and, when we finally took things to the next step, I discovered that apparently I just cry now.

I wasnt sad, but just getting close to him reminded me of the times I had done the same only to have my heart broken or my self esteem crushed very shortly after because I realized I wasnt enough for them or they didnt like me. All that emotion + being vulnerable for the first time erupted into tears. My coworker asked what was going on but I couldnt really talk because there was a lump in my throat so I just kind of went fetal position, said I needed a minute, and he held me. What a gentleman. Needless to say we didnt have sex that night and communication was a little stilted the rest of the week. We still saw each other in the break room and made our usual jokes and work chit chat but we didnt text as much. Then on Friday, he had a new girl he was dating meet him at the elevator bank my desk just so happens to have a view of. What a dick. Ive been off dating apps and stuff for almost a year now, so the coworker was the only guy Ive dated/ gotten close with this year, and that experience didnt really boost my confidence, so now Im just anxious the same emotions+vulnerability= tears is going to happen with the next guy. ...Speaking of next guy, I happened to meet a guy at a party last month. Weve known each other through mutual friends for maybe 1-2 years but didnt realize we had so much in common until we basically shut this party down by talking the entire night. I told him I kinda move slow and hes been so understanding. Any time weve done more than a quick kiss, Ive been able to stifle the emotional baggage and he hasnt noticed the occasional tear that I immediately wipe away while brushing my bangs out of my face or something. I know I may be jumping the gun but its been a month with him so Im sure hed like to go further and I...well I still have half the box of the first box of condoms I ever purchased (I. E I need to get laid). Id reallllllly like to sleep with him in the coming weeks (not that Ive planned or anything but we might grab drinks on Wednesday and have plans Sunday so one of those 2 days. Again. Not that Ive planned. But Wednesday or Sunday would be great). I will try to keep my shit together but is it a boner killer to warn him beforehand I might cry a little because of some bad recent relationships? How much detail do I go into? I want to make it clear Im just a little sensitive and havent had super awesome experiences with guys. I dont want him to think I was abused or anything*** ***speaking of, that might come into play if he tries to go down on me. I had some very unwanted attention once a long time ago, had therapy etc and Im generally over it EXCEPT when a guy goes down on me. Its not a big deal, Id rather grind on a guy or go down on him (Im submissive so giving BJs are my favorite thing and getting oral was always a weird power dynamic in my mind). Is it ok to talk about that like...a year in? Do I have to? Can I just say I dont enjoy it? I feel like every time I say i dont enjoy it and a guy enjoy giving he is convinced I just havent had good oral and tries even harder. PS as long as Im asking... when is a good time to mention Im a sub?  Ive mentioned it early for two of the other guys I dated and they LOVED it but, again, they turned out to be assholes. So Id rather keep that on the down low for a little bit longer this time. "
167,vulnerability,sex,My sexuality is changing and I'm (24f) confused,1,9v4t3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9v4t3j/my_sexuality_is_changing_and_im_24f_confused/,2018-11-08 10:48:47,"TW: mention of rape &amp;#x200B; I'm hesitant to post here because, last time I did, I got a lot of gross messages from men. I really don't want that to happen again, but I don't have anyone in my life I can talk to about this so I'm going to try again at posting here. &amp;#x200B; As a kid, sex was always framed as something scary and painful. My mom told me that men would want to hurt me because I'm pretty. My doctor told me men would only want me for sex. Boys would bully me and tease me. Just, all in all, I grew up fearing sex, seeing myself as completely undesirable, and convinced I was asexual. &amp;#x200B; I had my first kiss at 19, with my first boyfriend, who was 22 at the time. The relationship only lasted a couple months. He was a gross guy who would constantly pressure me for sex and try to force it. He'd say hurtful things to me to try to get me to give in. At the time I was convinced I didn't want to have sex until marriage. I was very upfront about it, letting him know on the first date and telling him he didn't need to stick around if that's not what he wanted. He assured me he wanted to wait until marriage too. That lasted all of a week before he began trying to force sex. &amp;#x200B; After he broke up with me, I became even more convinced I was asexual. Even dancing with men would cause a panic attack. I was absolutely convinced men just wanted sex from me and I wasn't worth loving. &amp;#x200B; A year and a half after that, I met my ex-fiance. We were both 21. I was still convinced I didn't want sex until marriage, so, again, I was very upfront. I know it's not popular and will frustrate a lot of men. I never wanted to ""trap"" anyone. So I had the discussion with him, he swore up and down he also wanted to wait, and I thought things were finally good. &amp;#x200B; Then he started raping me. There was no PiV sex. He used his fingers and objects. Things got bad. He told me he wouldn't need to force it if I would just stop being a ""frigid bitch"". I believed him. I stopped saying no and I just let it happen because I wanted so badly for him to be nice to me. I would escape in my mind. &amp;#x200B; That's when this fascination with BDSM started. I'd never really been interested in it before. But if I imagined BDSM scenes in my mind, specifically with me being submissive, I found that I could enjoy sex. My ex-fiance wouldn't stop until I had come. Asking him to stop was useless. So I found that if I fantasized about BDSM I'd come and it would usually stop. So I became reliant on that fantasy. I also started becoming attracted to other women and grew convinced I was bisexual. Hell, I felt even more attracted to women than I did to men. &amp;#x200B; When I left him, I got together with a guy who really did understand consent. I was 23 and he was 31. He was a good guy. He was also extremely into BDSM. I still wasn't sure if I would actually enjoy sex. I'd changed my views on sex before marriage after I stopped being religious. But I still thought I was asexual. I wanted to show the new guy I was into him though, so I got deep into BDSM with him. I found I could just escape with that. I could go deep into my mind and be in a different world, just letting him use my body however he wanted. BDSM felt safe. &amp;#x200B; Things just didn't click with that guy though, and I left him after a couple months. Then I got together with my boyfriend, who turns 29 in a few weeks, and things started changing. &amp;#x200B; When I met my boyfriend, before we even got together, I started fantasizing about him. And what was so weird was that, for the first time, none of my fantasies involving him involved BDSM. My fantasies involved slow but passionate PiV sex. Very vanilla. To make things stranger, I felt sexual attraction to a man for the first time. I stopped feeling attraction to other women. &amp;#x200B; We had sex together for the first time (it was my first time having PiV, but far from his first) after 2-3 months of dating. We've been sexually active together for quite a few months now. My attraction to him has not dwindled. It's grown. I haven't felt attracted to another woman in almost a year. My interest in BDSM has plummeted. I have never needed to think about it to come since I got together with him. I haven't thought about it while masturbating for months. I tried to do so again a couple nights ago and I felt absolutely nothing. &amp;#x200B; My boyfriend has a good understanding of consent. He's a passionate, naturally dominant guy but we've never discussed or tried any sort of BDSM. I've never felt afraid of him while having sex or pressured to have sex with him. I even initiate it sometimes, which was absolutely unheard of before. I \*love\* having sex with him. We always naturally flip flop between one of us being in a more dominant or submissive position. It's amazing. &amp;#x200B; I don't understand this change in my sexuality. I spent most of my life believing I was asexual. Then I got reliant on BDSM and started feeling attraction to women. Now I have a healthy desire for sex, don't feel attraction to other women, and feel nothing when I look at BDSM stuff. &amp;#x200B; I like this change. I'm just confused. I'm not entirely sure what to ask about regarding this. Has anyone else experienced changes in their sexuality over time? What could be causing this? &amp;#x200B; And please, please men, don't send me disgusting messages. This is something that is tied up with a lot of trauma and vulnerability for me. I'm just posting to try to understand myself better. "

It was disgusting to see him get that angry and speak to me that way. I just cried and then went to sleep because I didnt even know what to say to him. Long story short me and my boyfriend have amazing sex and are extremely compatible in that way. Ive never turned him down for sex ever and vice versa. Were always on the same page about it. But the next 3 days after this fight, I turned him down 4 different times. Something in me just snapped and Im not interested in having sex with him. Hes obviously still attractive to me, weve cuddled each night since this happened but something in me just doesnt want to intimate with him anymore.. I think it might be something to do with the vulnerability of sex and I just have a huge guard up with him now.. Will this pass with time?"

Even before I knew what sex was, I was like 5 engrossed by strong Amazonian women on TV. Awhile ago my gf bought a $20 bdsm kit off Amazon on Valentine's Day which was honestly a hell of a deal because you get two sets of cuffs, rope, collar, ball gag, blindfold, whip... anyway she let me use all this stuff on her which was awesome and amazingly hot but in my head I was like...""I want her to do this stuff to me doe"". At this point it's 2 years into our relationship so I spill the beans on all my weird sexual fantasies of being dominated/tied up/hurt and she eats it all up and loves it, says we can do it when we see each other (last weekend). We get down to business and my dreams have come true, I feel this crazy new sexual emotion I guess you'd call it, it was just this total vulnerability being tied up and unable to help myself if I wanted to. It was unlike anything I've felt before like my whole body felt hot and a little shaky. We have fun like this for like 30-45 minutes and it starts to get really heated when she gags me and starts whipping me. I don't know what happened but just that feeling I mentioned before escalated so far and so fast that all I could do is cry. She immediately stopped and checked on me but I told her to keep going and when it was over I just kind of sobbed on her chest. I wasn't sad and it honestly felt kind of good. I couldn't really tell her why I was crying and it took a lot of convincing to let her know I was okay. Does anyone have insight into this?"

Im 19, just lost my virginity to my boyfriend. Hes been great, amazing really! I have vestibulodynia (recently diagnosed) and have not been able to do much penetrative sexual things since we got together almost a year ago- ie it took a couple months of trying before getting a finger inside and a couple more after that before getting a tampon. Ive been going through therapy and dilation and have finally been able to have sex- albeit quite painful during the initial penetration. Its quite a feat for me especially since I was sure that sex would be something I would meet enjoy. Now, heres where I really need some advice. I know that some of the answers can be taken from FAQ but I kind of want different opinions i guess? Im extremely self conscious and Ive been slowly working on it- ive never felt so comfortable around anyone else as I am with my boyfriend. But I just cannot even fathom ever doing girl on top position. Lets not even get to the possible pain from initial penetration but the vulnerability of him just seeing my basically pleasure myself on him to me possibly doing absolute shit at bouncing (google says there is so much more to just bouncing and idk how to incorporate). He has had many many many sexual partners in his life and he has probably had amazing sex and Im just really scared that I cant compare to that. He says the sex weve had is good and hes managed to orgasm (I think I have too? The sensations are very different to clitoral stimulation) 2/3 times weve had sex (we had to stop one of the times because I felt pain). But I mean what if im shit? how do i not be shit? how do i stop getting self conscious over being on top? idk the technique and i dont want to look like im trying to be this sex goddess when i know im the furthest away from that. I just really want to make him feel good and I cant help but think that I cant. Any advice is welcome and sorry that this is so long. "

173,vulnerability,sex,"Looking for books/resources/advice to help me deal with trust and intimacy issues, which are damaging my sex and love life",1,9mjq60,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9mjq60/looking_for_booksresourcesadvice_to_help_me_deal/,2018-10-09 09:53:09," Alright, lets see how much information I can give without this turning into a sob story. Ill open with how this started. Ive been dealing with sexual issues for a long time. For the curious; I have trouble lasting a long time. Don't worry, that's not all this is about. I can sometimes go off when cuddling. No shit. I realized this might be more complicated than first glance when I had sex with a random person whose name I didnt even get, and was able to last as long as I wanted. I even trained myself up to last a long time on my own but still had problems with a partner. After a while, I began to realize that this about to go off feeling I have when physically intimate with someone (*especially* when its based on affection, not sex) is closer to fear and anxiety than excitement. I shake violently and cant think straight, my body tenses up, its miserable. I figure it's probably causing the PC muscles to tense like crazy when that happens. After some introspection, I realized this ties into a few things. * Low self-esteem and low self-confidence. This is despite praise from my partners, and the knowledge that Im at least decent looking. In other words, unreasonable low self-esteem. * My tendency to always assume the worst, assume things are going to go poorly, that people will stab me in the back or hate my guts. * I overthink things like crazy and often beat myself up for them. I'll go shooting, do terribly, then hate myself for it. So, in this context, I recognize my sexual flaw and wind up hating myself for it and spiraling. * Im a perfectionist. I always have to live up to *my own* unrealistic standards. Many of these are issues Ive been working on. Mindfulness has helped, as has therapy. Unfortunately, I moved for a job and can't find a therapist where I'm currently at. I also realized that I havent improved *at all* when it comes to intimacy and sex. I did further introspection. Now, before I get into my realizations, let me give some background information: My mother was an abusive alcoholic. She almost killed me, my brothers, and my sister on several occasions. She manipulated me and my family. She stole money from me in grade school. There was a recurring thread of her manipulating people into trusting her, only to go right back to abusing us, often *using* the rebuilt trust as a tool. My sister learned from her. My father, while an excellent dad, was deeply in love with my mother. He tried to protect us from her, but also had low standards on what a good mother was and always defended her when I accused her of being abusive. This resulted in me feeling like *I* was crazy. As my therapist said: When youre the only sane one, you can be damn sure everyone is going to make you feel nuts. My school life wasnt much better. I was bullied hard. I grew up in a rough town. And then most of my long-term romantic relationships both turned out abusive. Highlights include a girlfriend was emotionally abusive (also an alcoholic) who would dump me any time she got pissed off, or sometimes just for funsies. Another was an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive alcoholic who would threaten suicide constantly, and cheated more than once. Both would get angry and cruel at the drop of a hat. Next to no warning. In other words, the people in my lifeespecially the women closest to mehave been abusive, manipulative, and untrustworthy. They used trust as a weapon, and most of them were extremely unstable. I walked on eggshells with all of them, constantly watching my behavior to keep from pissing them off. Part of what I worked on in therapy was the realization that, at this point, I dont know what a healthy relationship would be like and Im fucking terrified of one. That brings us to the epiphany. I realized that Im extremely anxious when physically intimate with someone because Im worried Im going to do something wrong. That Im going to make the wrong move and boom, theyre going to hate me. Theyre going to threaten suicide or berate me or emotionally and maybe even physically abuse me. Then, theyre going to spread as many lies as possible to the people around me. Im afraid of being judged, of the person Im with turning out to be a monster. I figure that the core of all of this is simple: I dont trust anyone. Not just that: I fully expect them to wait til Ive let my guard down and try to shatter me. Given that sex and emotional openness both constitute vulnerability, I go haywire and have a virtual panic attack when Im in those situations. Probably because my body is ringing all the alarm bells at once. One manifestation is being a touch trigger-happy. But, its obviously not the only manifestation of this issue. I dont trust my friends. They complement my art? I cant shake the idea that theyre lying. I have trouble making friends or communicating with people in the first place. I assume they hate me or that theyll betray me eventually. I dont trust that anyone actually *wants* to be with me. I assume that its all a game, or that theyll go crazy on me at the drop of a hat. Healthy romantic relationships are unthinkable. Connecting with people on any real level is next to impossible and when I do it, I can go overboard and overvalue the relationship. The weirdest part? No-one has any idea that Im dealing with these issues. Most of them know at least some parts of my past, yeah, but to most everyone on the outside, Im actually the successful, level-headed, reasonable member of the group. This is the first time Ive said *any* of this shit to anyone who isnt my therapist or my older brother. And he doesn't know most of it. Dunno if thats relevant, but it might be. So, why am I bringing this massive stupid goddamn story to this subreddit? Well, mostly because Im looking for books, resources, and advice (preferably books) to help me deal with this specific issue: Trust and anxiety that damages intimacy, sex and ones ability to connect and form relationships and friendships, the cause of which is rooted in extreme childhood abuse that continued into adulthood. Before anyone suggests it: Im actively trying to find a therapist. But in this po-dunk town, its difficult to find any therapists that arent explicitly religious. So, Id love any suggestions. If you have a resource that seems perfect for this issue, Id love to hear it. Or, if you have resources to help deal with single parts of it: (childhood abuse, sexual anxiety, intrusive negative thoughts, PE, trust issues, et cetera), Im also interested in hearing those. Or resources on how to form healthy connections and sexual relationships. If you know a better subreddit to post this in, well Im open to that, too. I don't think this post breaks any rules, but if it does, go ahead and remove it. Thanks. &amp;#x200B; P.S.: Two things. Number one, I originally posted this on r/booksuggestions and got nothing. Just figured I should mention that. The second is that I *have* read through the FAQ. Used some of the suggestions, actually. But the sexual issues book list seemed a touch old, and I wanted to see what would actually be suggested to me, here. I'm also considering the possibility that my PC muscles are too tight. I do reverse kegels, but I'm not sure how to really loosen that area, or how to know if that's the issue in the first place. Any advice on that is welcome, too."
174,vulnerability,sex,Huge anxiety when it comes to even visualizing sexual scenarios that end up preventing me from enjoying myself... any advice?,1,9mu7p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9mu7p1/huge_anxiety_when_it_comes_to_even_visualizing/,2018-10-10 10:26:44,"So I'm a 20 year old male, and I've been very conflicted with expressing myself sexually. There's a tug-o-war going on in my head and it's driving me nuts because there's this sexual frustration I hold mixed in with some sort of deep anxiety of *irl* eroticism and sex. I'm a virgin, or at least, I've never experienced PIV sex, but have only made out, given oral, but more times than not, there's always been a slight anxiety with my vulnerability during these moments of intimacy, and it ends up exploding by the next day when I look back at the experiences. I've always gotten this dull, muddled feeling of remorse, disgust, self-deprecation, and even slight panic, and during the experiences, there would be a lot of tension from my end which just left my penis being flaccid. I even get this same feeling after a masturbate, whether to porn or not, and it's fucking weird because one moment I'm super horny and excited and the next I'm just kind of wanting to dissolve into thin air. But there's this huge urge where I really want to branch out and practice sex with someone like an fwb or something, but I've got this fear attached to it too. Like, my mind dramatizes a scenario of a sexual experience to such a degree that I end up kind of being wigged out, and almost like I get this strong emotional rise during these mental visualizations that makes me feel as if I'd end up crying after sex. And then it makes me worried that if I were to actually have sex, I'd end up crying, and then it gets awkward as shit or I don't know. I know I have performance anxiety for one, and it's also very possible I have a fear of intimacy. But on the other end, I want to feel sexy and I want to be able to have fun, express my erotic side, and learn how to genuinely please a woman. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this?"
175,vulnerability,sex,Positive Benefits of Masturbation,1,9ncozl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9ncozl/positive_benefits_of_masturbation/,2018-10-12 05:46:08,"This past weekend my friends at TENGA invited me back to the yearly Sex Expo to learn about their second United State(s) of Masturbation survey and also offered me the chance to pick Dr. Chris Donaghues brain about TENGAs findings, which is what I looked forward to the most. I was nervous about what to discuss with him, because sex is a vulnerable topic, especially when you only talk to someone once a year. However, I was more excited to dig in, because I love learning from others and hearing about things I never would have known about on my own. This survey is interesting as it compiles data from people of all ages (1,200 Americans between the ages of 18-74) and takes a look at their habits and attitudes towards masturbation, sexuality, general health and well-being. I walked into the day ready to talk about lube with Dr. Chris, but I instead left with a better understanding of how masturbation affects our confidence, health and relationships with others in more ways than you think. This years study found that 42% of people masturbate at least once a week, and 20 percent do so at least four times a week! My first thought was, Who has time to masturbate four times a week, especially if youre having sex with someone consistently. I have things to do! I asked Dr. Chris how someone can go from having sex once a week to four times a week? He taught me that you have to begin by prioritizing it, and you have to start acting on moments you feel aroused, even if it means calling someone to say youre running 15 minutes late. (FYI  you most likely masturbate for an average of 13 minutes.) You start with a lower level of arousal, but it grows over time, because youre taking advantage of these moment more. Overall, Dr. Chris says, The more sex you have, the more sex you have. The less sex you have, the less sex you have. Being in a relationship for over a year now, I also wanted to talk with Dr. Chris about relationships getting stale over time. I have friends who mention this, including masturbating when their partner isnt around, and I think about how I dont want to get to that point where I love my boyfriend and things are good, but sex becomes a low priority. Dr. Chris told me a few great things to keep in mind, whether youre being preventive or recovering from a slump  which naturally happens. You need to know what your partner enjoys. You cant maintain a healthy sexual relationship unless you understand what gets them off, which only happens through asking questions and sharing details, including masturbation habits. Do they do it at all? The good thing is that 89% of people who talked to their significant other about masturbation have had an overall positive experience, no matter how initially awkward it was. Your partner may not want to have partner sex all the time, and thats okay. Sometimes they just want solo sex, especially because masturbation is an experience that focuses on individual desires and fantasies. However, you can try to involve yourself in your partners masturbation session by doing things such as stroking them with a toy, providing dirty talk, watching and more. How is stroking your partner during their masturbation session different from a handjob?Dr. Chris explains that handjobs are still about the two of you together, but you stroking them during masturbation is about involving yourself in their experience, which may include them watching porn. Its not about you. What if the porn your partner watches is nothing like what yall do or what you look like? It doesnt need to be. The porn your partner watches is about them having another sexual outlet and turning towards another part of themselves that they dont explore or may not want to explore in real life. The porn they watch is not about them turning away from you. Uncover to recover. When your sex life isnt ideal, be open to saying, I want to feel desired by you. I want to have more sex with you, and if you cant give me that right now, what are the roadblocks. You have to uncover what is standing in yalls way to then recover to where yall want to be. TENGAs survey also found that people who are masturbation warriors (at least 4x a week) have four big life benefits. One that Dr. Chris and I really got into was about having a higher body confidence. The best masturbation experiences require you to be in sync with what pleases your body, and when youre in sync with your body, you love it no matter how it looks. Additionally, if you can be vulnerable enough to talk with your friends and sexual partners about masturbation and what does or doesnt sexually work for you, then you will have more confidence in all areas of your life, including talking with your boss about what you need from your career. This year I walked away from the Sex Expo and the chat with Dr. Chris about TENGAs United State(s) of Masturbation survey with a deeper understanding of how masturbation is this gateway to seeing yourself fully, and it can shape how you interact with others  including how confident you are in your career. When you pair it with vulnerability and communication, it can be the ultimate good time. URL "

Keep in mind I'm pretty much referring to dirty talk in the context of a casual-ish/FWB context, because I've never dirty talked in a relationship (I was just too vanilla at the time) I'm afraid to say things that the other person would then get to walk around throughout their days, for the rest of their lives, knowing. Let's say I said, during sex, I'm your dirty little cum slut."" Then when I'm walking around, living my life, going to school, working, buying groceries, being a respectable human being etc. ..., very likely not in contact with that person anymore (or maybe we are neighbors or see each other at PTA meetings?) that person gets to *know* that. They can look at my social media, check up on me, see me smiling with my family in pictures, or holding my dog, or at my law school graduation and picture me looking in their eyes and begging for their big hard cock. I wish after sex they could just forget that I said anything, because i dont want them to know that about me forever! It's like they have something on me. Does that make sense?

Hes been my only sexual partner in life, so Im not that experienced, however, I adore being intimate, exploring our bodies with love and passion, and the vulnerability of being totally naked in front of him makes it even more special. We havent got the longest list of sexual achievements so Im sure theres a lot yet to be discovered, and Id like to start this voyage of discovery with him. So Im looking for any ideas on how we can explore / deepen our intimacy. Sexual or not, any suggestions are welcome :) Thank you"
178,vulnerability,sex,Was I raped by my boyfriend?,0,9ds4w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9ds4w1/was_i_raped_by_my_boyfriend/,2018-09-07 18:02:05,"A year and a half ago I started seeing my now boyfriend for the first time. I was 18, he was 22. We went on a really nice first date and decided to go on a second, we had a meal and then went to a bar. I was sober because I was driving home but he had had a few drinks. We kissed a few times in the bar and then he suggested we go back to his and watch a film. Before seeing this guy I had only been with my previous boyfriend - I had never had casual sexual activity of any kind, and I had absolutely no intention of having sex with this guy on our second date. I realise now that this was super naive (perhaps because of my age), but I believed he invited me back to watch the film because he actually wanted to watch a film with me. The date was going so well and I didn't want it to be over, so I said yes and we walked to his house. As soon as we got to his bedroom in his uni flat he started kissing me quite aggressively and taking my clothes off - none of this was reciprocated by me, and I was so shocked by the situation that I didn't really know what to do. He carried me across the room and put me on his bed and finished undressing me, however he was still fully clothed. I told him at this point that I did not want to have sex with him. He said that was okay, but undressed himself and started going down on me. I didn't know what to think about this - I knew I didn't want to have sex with him, but I wasn't sure where I stood on foreplay. I didn't reciprocate anything, and at one point he took my hand and placed it on his crotch, but I still didn't actively engage in any sexual activity with him. After going down on me, he started kissing me again and it felt like he was trying to have sex with me. His penis was right at the entrance to me, and in my mind it felt like he was going to have sex with me regardless. I remember clearly thinking, 'this is going to happen anyway - I don't want to be raped. I like this guy and want to continue seeing him, if I don't intervene I will be raped'. At that point I didn't feel like I could say no again (I know I obviously could have done, but I have a social anxiety disorder, and I think that combined with the vulnerability of being naked and younger than him and so sexually inexperienced made me feel like I couldn't say anything). I said ""do you have a condom"". After saying that, he went and put a condom on and came back and had sex with me. I just sort of lay there - I wasn't really reciprocating anything. It finished and we cuddled and I went home and never told anyone what had actually happened. By asking him if he had a condom, I was sort of consenting - but I said it because I was too shy to say no (I also didn't want him to think me a prude and lose interest in me). I said it because I really felt that I was about to be raped, and I didn't want that to happen. If the sex was going to happen anyway, id rather there was a condom. I didn't want to have sex with him, but if I consented at the last second, at least I wouldn't be raped. I have no way of knowing if he would have actually forcefully penetrated me without me having asked for a condom, but I remember clearly feeling like that was going to happen. In the weeks following this, we had lots of consentual sex, and it took several months for us to actually talk about it. He would joke around that he used the film Whiplash to lure me into bed, and eventually admitted to and apologised for coercing me into sex that night. On another occasion he said that it only happened because I had been 'all over him' in the bar when we were kissing, and he thought that meant that we were going to have sex later in the night. I have never really come to terms with what happened and we have never properly spoken about it. The more I think about it, the more I am certain that what happened was definitely at least sexual assault. I feel like I need to come to terms with it and have a proper conversation with him/someone about it, but what is there to say? I love this man and nothing even remotely similar has happened since."

But being a guy I know the incredible feeling of being inside a woman. The feelings of my penis being inside my girl. That feeling of being engulfed by her wet, warm vagina is hard to describe. Thinking about my younger years and not understanding a girls needs to what I know now. I now look for the Holy Grail and try to have my girl orgasm with me. I try to sense her body, her feelings, her vagina contracting on me, Her body twitching, the blissful look on her face. I now rub her clit to try and bring her to orgasm with me. Then that moment of no return when all that I have, I push, and pump against her, inside her, as deep as I can be, then that moment of orgasm, just feeling that total release of cum inside her, pulsing, again, and then again. Holding her tight against me,, wanting to maybe kiss her, but the moment of orgasm, it's very hard to do anything. The incredible sense of intimacy, the feelings of vulnerability, There are times that my girl has held my there and wouldn't let me pull out. Please tell me why!! Its awesome!! Then at other time I have slowly pulled back to feel this gush of cum flow out of her as I pull out of her. Its sexy, wet, hot and very messy at the same time. I will never know what feelings go through a women, as I describe my feelings during what is the most intimate, and personal times of my life. Can you share?? "
180,vulnerability,sex,I [22 F] had my first hookup after my breakup and Im processing what next,4,90ynxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/90ynxw/i_22_f_had_my_first_hookup_after_my_breakup_and/,2018-07-23 01:52:00,"I broke up with my boyfriend recently over a difference in sexual compatibility on top of other things. I started tindering early last week and had a hookup Thursday night. Ive realized some things about myself that I think are important to know. Being single before being in my first serious relationship and being single after being in a serious relationship is way different. In addition Ive processed a bad hookup experience way differently now that Im not with my boyfriend anymore. Right before I met my boyfriend I had a hookup with a man I matched with on tinder. He seemed nice and said all these great things and I believed him. I told him we could hang out and cuddle and stuff but I didnt want to have sex with him until he was tested. I was very inexperienced and I didnt know how to have casual sex or handle myself. Later he forced me to give him two blowjobs and swallow his cum. Afterwards I couldnt leave because his very conservative muslim great uncle showed up randomly and started watching tv in the next room. He turned over and fell asleep, completely ignoring me. I brushed it off and tried to joke about it with others saying his cum tasted disgusting or insulting his incompetency. However, this happened following a month where I had been sexually harassed on the metro 3 times and sexually assaulted once. I felt disgusting and used and unsafe. I met my boyfriend and something in me trusted him completely and to do this day I dont know what it was. Maybe it was his vulnerability, raw emotion, honesty, or comfortable sharing of his sexuality. I felt safe and wanted and heard. I craved that feeling of safety, knowing that he would never want to use or hurt me like the other men before. I didnt think too much about it but I relished in the feeling of safety and security he afforded me. I admitted to him the other day that I was scared and I told him the truth about what happened to me before I met him. He said it made him understand where my intensity came from. He assured me that we would continue to be friends and that hed be there to help me feel safe if I needed it. I was incredibly frightened to break up with him before because I was afraid I was lose this important relationship but now I feel happy knowing that hes still here for me. After leaving the relationship I worried and still continue to worry about entering a relationship too soon and having a rebound relationship. Im paranoid I wont be able to tell the difference. The feeling is heightened because my hookup on Thursday went incredibly well and the guy was very nice. We match perfectly with all our kinks and sexual interests and Im so excited about the potential to maintain a sexual relationship with him. We also have similar interests and sense of humor. Even with all this Im worried Im goading myself and will develop a crush on him when Im not ready. Whats interesting to me is that while I had a lot of fun and had great sex with him, I wasnt particularly turned on. I wasnt dying for his dick if you know what I mean? But having been a few days I definitely am now. I havent stopped thinking about having sex with him. I think what this tells me is that now he is a safe person and I can feel ok and secure. My body needs to feel totally safe and secure with a man before I can be turned on. Im not sure how to do that without having sex with a guy first. Im ok with that because I have a pretty good idea of who I would have potential sexual chemistry with even if I dont feel it immediately but its still an interesting idea. I dont know how Im going to proceed if I develop feelings for the guy I hooked up with. I told him Im not looking for a serious relationship because of a recent breakup and he said that was ok. I think for now Ill just have some fun and take advantage of having a great match when it comes to sex. I look forward to it. "
181,vulnerability,sex,How to combine your two favorite things: Erotic Massage Meets Fetish,3,91tp9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/91tp9y/how_to_combine_your_two_favorite_things_erotic/,2018-07-26 03:07:38,"Erotic Massage is a low-maintenance way to receive pleasure. There are no expectations to reciprocate the service. You dont need to be charming, just civil. You pay for your time and are free to leave without the pressure to follow-up. Fetish/BDSM sessions follow a somewhat similar procedure. If you love getting a good deal, you should probably start thinking about combining the two experiences. Fetish massage is a fairly prominent segment of the industry. It allows individuals interested in a variety of fetish services to entertain their fantasies in a safe and stigma-free environment. At the same time, it allows clients to experience the intimacy and attention that more traditional massages provide. Combining the two services allows individuals to experience the best of what both have to offer. Among the most popular fetish massages are a genre know as tie and tease sessions. These sessions operate around the BDSM themes of dominance and submission. Often, toys, ropes and other accessories are incorporated into the service. Restraint play allows individuals to experience a level of submission and vulnerability they dont always encounter out there in the real world. Unlike other erotic massages, the [tie and tease](URL session doesnt revolve around climax. Orgasm denial is an integral aspect of the massage. Of course, thats not the only brand of fetish massage out there. There are the famous foot fetishists; i.e. professionals who allows interested individuals to enjoy the look and feel of their feet. Foot worship is one of the most popular fetishes around, especially among men. In fact, academics suspect the foot is one of the most eroticized areas of the body, apart from the genitals. And that has helped make it one of the most popular massage services on the market today. Pegging wasnt exactly the most popular option a few years ago, but interest in the activity has exploded in the past few years. Today, a variety of service provides offer pegging on their massage menu. It allows individuals to experience the sense of vulnerability and submissive that more traditional [BDSM services](URL provide. At the same time, it allows them to experience an increasingly popular pleasure service: prostate massage. For those who arent in the know, the prostate is small gland located around 3 to 4 inches from the anal canal. The easiest way to access it is through penetration. While some practitioners prefer to use their hand, others enjoy saddling up with a strap-on. The area is packed with sensitive nerve endings that provide pleasure when stimulated. Its been subbed the male G-spot. Combining these specific interests with elements of more traditional erotic massage allows individuals to experience sensual touch, erotic pleasure and fantasy play all in one sitting. Again, it allows clients to unleash certain aspects of their sexuality in safe and supported way. It also allows room for exploration. Service providers are typically open to custom deals. Special requests can be considered and accommodated when advance notice is given. Maybe you want to experience the tease without the tie. Maybe you want your [prostate massage](URL to come paired with a bit of bondage. It can be hard to uncover a kink. But little exploration and a little flexibility can help you where you want to go. "
182,vulnerability,sex,Me [M/24] stuck between a rock and a hard place,1,92sk1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/92sk1e/me_m24_stuck_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place/,2018-07-29 15:20:15,"It's a bit of a long post this one, I'll try and cram as much context as I can into this post. Please bare with me while I try. Before I begin writing, let me preface it with this; I am aware that love and sex are two different things. This post is about sex, not love. I am a male, 24 years old, 6'3. Currently at university. Finishing next July. I do something I love for my degree and this keeps me fulfilled and enjoying life. I have friends, and socialization is fine - even with complete strangers, I can build a bridge between me and them and get a conversation going. Everything else either works, or is on it's way to working, apart from one thing; The sex life I forfeited years ago. I don't talk about it, because it genuinely feels like whenever I do, it's akin to coating a plate full of yummy food with shit. So I try to stay away from it and focus on other things. But even then, sometimes there's a scratch that several hours of porn won't scratch. And I hate it. With a real passion. If there was a button to turn off my sexual lust I'd smash it so violently nobody would be able to get it unstuck again. I was born with a disorder called bladder exstrophy. I put the name there so you can Google it and find out for yourselves, but the condensed version is that I was born with my bladder outside of my body, one of my kidneys is atrophic, my genitalia too damaged and small for any kind of penetrative sex to be an option. I've spent a lot of my childhood in hospitals with doctors trying to fix me. My penis started as non-functioning, and over the years, the result is a penis that's about 4cm in length, erect. I am full of scars from the waist down to the thighs. From the time I was 17, I've been with two women - when I say been, I mean that it got to foreplay, and I stopped before it evolved past that. My pants never came off. I did it *only to prove to myself* that it's not my inability to attract a woman that is stopping me, but my physiology that's stopping me from going for it. Call me an egoistical self-centered asshole for turning on two women and leaving them there, I deserve it. The first one was when I was 17, and the second one was when I was 21. For those years in between, I chose to stay away. For those who see sex as a numbers' game, two. For those who see it as actually having sex, technically none. A few nights ago, all these demons that I try to keep hidden came out to play again. My new roommate, guessing about my age, doing a Master's degree too, albeit in a different subject. She came back from a night out while I was having a few beers with a mate. We welcomed her into the conversation, and even exchanged food. You know, human things. At some point she said she'd go slip in her pyjamas and come back. She came back to the room with short pants and a crop top that even a blind person could see her nipples through. Said mate is married so he jumped ship not long after, leaving me with her. I swear to whoever you believe as a god, the moment she walked into the room dressed like that it felt as if nature gave me a punch and a big FUCK YOU to the face. I remember thinking ""Ah for fuck's sake, not again."" Earlier I had shown genuine interest for her job, I am not going to say what or who or any other details. The conversation carried on, and I always tried my best to look her in the eyes and not anywhere else, as a matter of respect. I could feel the tension building up between us, we went out for a zoot and then back in again. I could tell she wanted sex, and I think she could tell too. I thought to myself ""save her the disappointment and spare her the task of having to get out of it when your pants fall, you've done it before, you can do it again."" And it fucking hurt. I started talking bullshit, and the more I saw that I was turning her off, the more I went for it. At some point, she went back to her room and put her robe on, we rolled one last zoot and went for a smoke. She was going to go to bed, and at her bedroom's door I playfully asked her for a hug. She gave me one, and it lasted for a little bit. She held on tightly and so did I. I told her ""I'm a contact animal, sorry for this"" which she responded with ""me too, sometimes I wish I wasn't"" to which I replied ""Tell me about it, it's fucking annoying."" I said good night and went to clean the room and went to bed. Remember earlier about nature giving me a big fuck you to the face? that hug was that confirmation. It felt like it. I saw her the next morning, we talked briefly, and she went on her way, and saw her the next day - said hi but never got an answer back. Haven't seen her in several days. I have a feeling that she's avoiding me. It's mental torture. Not this incident. The whole thing. Every woman I've ever been with in my life, I've had to say no to sex. It really fucks you up, knowing that they want it and that you want it and knowing that you're going to end it just as it's about to go further. Being oblivious to any woman showing any form of sexual interest to me seems to be the solution that yields me the least amount of pain, but recently it doesn't seem to work the way it did in the past. Disconnecting myself from reality and escaping helped keep the pain at bay, but it can't go on like this. Porn keeps me satiated so I don't have to go out there. I look after my health. Since sex isn't an option for me, I have no incentive to look after my figure or my looks since technically it's a person who is able to have sex's job. After all, they lose if they don't do it. I've already lost so what's the point... A phalloplasty operation is in the works for me sometime next year, so that I'll have something that despite not being the real thing, allows me to be more comfortable with myself. In the meanwhile, I'd love to experience sex in my current form, before this operation happens. But I'm terrified. Taking my pants off puts me in a position of vulnerability that scares me. Women talk about ""being filled"" being an amazing feeling and it really hits me hard knowing I can't provide that. I don't know if writing an honest letter for her to find explaining my side of the story would help her understand why it didn't happen that night, and clear the air between us. (I won't be back until September so I won't get to see her until then). We are going to be roommates for the year after all. I would like to have sex with her. In the sense that, I want her to teach me how she wants to be treated. I'm a virgin, so I thought that if I am going to have sex, then make something productive and useful out of that session and not just do it for the sake of doing it. (My virgin is showing, I am painfully aware of it). Hell, even strap-ons and toys. I'm open minded - I need to be in order to stay adaptable. I don't have a choice. Cuddles. I miss that feeling. The last time I had it was years ago, and sometimes I wish I didn't. After all, you can't miss what you've never had. What do I do? I feel lost and alone. I've gotten close to it time and time again and every time it ends the same way. It' been in my head for the last 2-3 days, and while I find ways to distract myself, every time I go past her room it comes back. How do I handle this? Sorry for the long post. If you've read all the way down to here, thank you."

It's actually the first time I've sent something like that to anyone and I hesitated for a little while before pressing send. I was nervous. Que 6 hours later I finally get his response. Are there some unwritten rules to sexting? I think you should answer a sext as soon as you are able since there's vulnerability involved. At least I feel like if you put something like that out there, you want the response asap. What do you think, is it acceptable to let your partner wait several hours even if you're able to answer pretty much whenever? **TL;DR** sent a sext for the first time to my bf and had to wait 6 h for his response. Are there some rules to sexting, for example that one should respond asap?"

Personally, I like when sex is intense and passionate, when you and your partner are so into it that little things like weird noises, faces, or whatever dont even register as funny because youre so turned on. The best sex Ive had is with guys that have a great sense of humor and are goofy in day to day life, but are very intense and serious in bed. Gentleman in the streets, freak in the sheets, yknow? And the worst sex Ive had is with guys that couldnt shut up and stop cracking jokes. I think maybe it has something to do with using humor as a defense mechanism. I feel like sex that is that intense and passionate comes with serious vulnerability, and I kind of got the vibe that those guys that were always cracking jokes were using humor to deflect and avoid awkward moments, but instead it backfired and did the opposite. Am I making any sense here? What do you guys think? Am I strange for feeling this way?"

Last night, my wife and I were 69ing as we often do. It has always been one of my favorite positions; the vulnerability of her grinding her pelvis against my face, the feeling that we are both working towards gratifying each other, and the divine smell of her fluids can get me off as fast as anything. This time, I was massaging her buttocks with both of my hands while performing cunnilingus, and the combination of me kneading her glutes and licking her clitoris was moving her towards orgasm properly. Seeing as we've been together for so long, and I've performed oral sex on her hundreds if not thousands of times by now, I knew she was close. I made my rhythm as consistent as possible, and gripped her butt and hips as hard as I could. As she began to climax, she let out a long, windy, two-part fart (thing BRRRRRRRRRPPPP ... PFFFF type) straight up my nose. We were both surprised, and she hurriedly jumped off and started profusely apologizing, but I did not mind at all. I did not derive any explicit sexual pleasure from this, and the hot gassy fart air *did* shoot directly up my nose like one of those sinus rinse things, but that she was comfortable enough to do that not only in my close proximity, but straight into my face like you would see in an old cartoon, oddly made me feel loved, trusted, and cherished about as much as any other gesture she's given me. Thank you for reading."

Call him John. Neither of us is romantically interested in each other, but we had compatible sexualities and saw each other pretty frequently. While I sometimes found his personality grating, he was always a respectful and satisfying sexual partner. Then I started dating this girl. She was okay with me seeing him, but I only took advantage of that a couple times. I much rather prefer sleeping with someone that I have an emotional connection with. Plus I prefer women. We discussed the sleeping arrangement in detail, and during that discussion we brought up the idea of a threesome. At first she was nervous, but eventually she decided she wanted to try it. Since my only other regular partner was John, it made the most sense to ask him. John agrees and comes over for what was an initially awkward but ultimately mind-blowing sexual experience. I had an incredible time, John enjoyed himself, and my girlfriend was sexually satisfied and enjoying all the attention. I was so relieved and glad that she was comfortable. We also realized that the experience deepened our connection with each other somehow. I dont know if it was the trust and vulnerability or what, but in the days afterward we just felt drawn to each other. I was very grateful that John helped make it a positive experience. My girlfriend went out of town, so I asked permission to see John. We met up and had another sexual encounter where I expressed my gratitude and offered him the possibility of another threesome. Then we had very disappointing sex. During the second I noticed a lot of behaviors that seemed selfish to me. For example I pretty much never ask John to go down on me, even though I suck him off all the time. But this time I was really trying to cum and asked him to go down on me. He halfheartedly did before asking to get on top of me again. I also asked him to stimulate my nipples, so he pinched one and promptly moved on. He came at least four times, where I just came once from my own effort. After I came he asked me to help him because he had one more load. His penis was obviously raw from the intense amount of sex and he couldnt really get an erection, but he kept asking me to help him cum anyway. The whole situation really turned me off. The way Im feeling now I really dont want to see John again. However Im wondering if these behaviors are new or if theyre really just starting to bother me because Im comparing him to my girlfriend and the threesome we had. In the past three years I would have described him as a very good partner, so it seems like the threesome must have had an effect on my perception. My girlfriend would no doubt trust my opinion if I said I didnt want to see him again, but that means we probably wont have any additional partners for the foreseeable future. TLDR: am I outgrowing my fuck buddy? "
187,vulnerability,sex,My [27FHL] husband doesn't seem as obsessed with our sex as I am,20,8sj6ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/8sj6ms/my_27fhl_husband_doesnt_seem_as_obsessed_with_our/,2018-06-21 01:25:13,"I am a 27FHL who is married to someone that acts like they could take or leave my desire for them. Let me explain. I'm on my throwaway account I sometimes use - he has a Reddit and I don't know if he would read this before I get some answers on my own. We've been together for years, recently married and our sex life is truly amazing. I am talking like, we've continued to grow together and incorporate new things into it all of the time. Our sex life has made me a better person in terms of taking care of myself - it makes me *want* to get my hair done more often, take care of my body daily, be more outgoing and basically indulge in articles, podcasts and books on sex. I love sex with this man. There is nothing I'm not up for and so far, we've both seemed pleased by it. We went from ""regular sex"" to BDSM, public sex, sexting, making porn, watching porn, etc. If either of us has suggested trying something, the other has been pretty receptive to giving it a shot and that has been wonderful. Due to this, my sex drive is through the roof because I am always excited to see what we end up doing. I wake up in the morning and can't take my eyes off of him over my coffee cup as he nakedly dresses. He will usually finally ask what I'm looking at and I tell him I just love watching him. I will stop a chore to make him a video and send it with a text that I can't wait for him to get home. I do this *a lot.* When he's home, I kiss his neck, his arms, caress his legs - I can't keep my hands off of him and it generally leads to my initiation going forward. That's how it's been for the last 2 months or so. When I look at how into it he is - I'm confused. He enjoys the sex, he tells me mid sex how amazing it is but it starts and stops there. This man does not blink twice if I walk by naked, he doesn't join in showers I ask him to, he doesn't ever text *me* throughout the work day to tell me he can't wait to fuck me, he rarely initiates (I don't know if this is because he loves that I so often take control now and do it?), he does not ever tell me how hot I am or beautiful he finds me and he never, ever just grabs me and kisses me to. Again, totally into the sex and all up for suggesting we do something new together but the part where he's infatuated with me is not a thing. And that is what hurts. I want him to be the one making comments in my ear while at dinner that he can't wait to get home. I want him to be the one to text me that he's hard at work and can't wait to get home. I want him to come up to me and rip my clothes off. Again, he's all about the sex, just not the build up to it or the raw vulnerability to get there. I guess I would feel silly asking someone to admire me more, if that's the best way to phrase it. I would feel silly asking someone to try to act like they can't keep their hands off of me, to try to act like they want to look at me, to try to act like they can't wait to see me after a long day. I don't even want to call it laziness on his end, I just don't think he desires me as hard as I do him. That is a painful thing to think of. I am trying to think of a way to start a conversation with him about it and address it so he truly understands the insecurity it causes me. We've talked about it briefly before but I don't think he took me seriously and his only response was, ""I will make a conscious effort to remind you of these things more"". These things meaning how much he wants me or how attractive/appealing he thinks I am. He said that and I never heard a word out of his mouth about it again. I don't want to give him ultimatums, I don't want to withhold sex from either of us - I just want to express to my husband how I don't feel as desired as I know I feel for him and show him and it really brings me down. Is this straight forward and I am missing something or should I be looking at this differently? (I don't want someone to suggest he isn't attracted to me. I don't think that's the issue. I hope that's not the issue anyway.)"
188,vulnerability,sex,Better to discuss sexual hangup with new sexual partner or barrel through it?,2,8vnl7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/8vnl7t/better_to_discuss_sexual_hangup_with_new_sexual/,2018-07-03 10:06:48,"(Throwaway account for reasons that will seem obvious in a second) **Context:** I am a 27 year-old cis man (heteroflexible? Still thinking about it) and I am jumping into dating after about six years celibate. I'm looking for a monogamous committed relationship with a woman (someone feminine-of-center) and I am already talking to people who might eventually be in this position, and I want to move slow (3-5 dates before sex slow). **My hangup:** My last relationship went badly when my girlfriend broke up with me because she said my penis was too small for her. And... I am a fat dude and due to fat around my pelvic area it's about 4"" erect and basically 0"" when flaccid. I don't want to say that I spiraled into depression, but I definitely instantaneously developed a fear of dating and sexual intimacy. In my darker moments I feel as though there's no way that I could ever satisfy a partner ever again. In my clearer moments I can convince myself that's not the case, but whenever I honestly think about being sexually intimate again I am filled with an intense mixture of both longing and dread. **My question:** As I see it, there are two options: 1. I bring this up with them at some point before we become sexually intimate (timing to be determined, feedback here would also help) so as to explain in advance any difficulties I might have during naughty times and ask for their support, or 2. I keep this to myself and attempt to barrel through it and do sex as it comes naturally, in a sense forcing my way through my hangups and hopefully coming out unscathed. Best case for #1 is that they understand and proceed carefully and with care. Worst case for #1 is that they end the relationship (subtly or rudely, who knows?) and decide I'm not worth the baggage or putting up with a small dick. Best case for #2 is that I succeed in sexual intimacy without exposing my vulnerability and I have a cutie to smooch on. Worst case for #2 is that I can't bring myself to handle sexual intimacy well enough and they call it off. And no matter what I do, there is an absolute worst case that can happen either way. I can't avoid the nagging doubt that they'll decide I can't actually satisfy them and do exactly what my last partner did. And I don't think I could fucking take that. Help?"
189,vulnerability,sex,The fuck twice rule,98,8w2h6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/8w2h6s/the_fuck_twice_rule/,2018-07-05 01:29:23,"People some times wonder if they should go ahead and fuck on the first date if the both feel like it, or will having sex too early prevent a relationship from developing? Reflecting on my own experience I noticed an unexpected pattern and I am curious to know if my experience confirms with that of other readers here. In essence what I noticed was that in cases where we fucked twice during the first time we decided to have sex, there was another date, and continued effort to pursue a longer relationship but in cases where we fucked just once the first time, it wound up being a one night stand. It did not matter if sex happened early or after multiple dates. Fucking on the first date was completely fine. Why does it work this way? I suspect it has to do with the weird sense of vulnerability that creeps in during the aftermath of the first fuck. If you go your separate ways this tends to leave a bad after taste. But if you fuck again a different set of reactions takes hold because sex comes to be seen as worth repeating, while confirming that our partners find our naked bodies attractive. During the first time there is a mystery about what your naked partner looks like but this is overpowered by temporary feelings of lust. Getting it on a second time can be incredibly affirming because both parties already know what each other looks like naked and are choosing to get it on anyway. Finally, the second time is often better, leading one to wonder how much better still might it get. What are your thoughts on this?"
190,vulnerability,sex,Girlfriend scared of being hurt once we have sex,2,8w3dje,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/8w3dje/girlfriend_scared_of_being_hurt_once_we_have_sex/,2018-07-05 03:25:12,"Hey everyone, I've been with this girl for 6 months now. We're in a really intimate and exciting relationship. She's 18 and I'm 20, we're both virgins. A pretty ""sexual"" girl to be honest: she only had one relationship when really young, no experience when It comes to sex, but quickly got confortable talking sex and escalating, but we never got past oral. I've been trying to gently initiate sex with teasing, exciting her more and more.. she got a bit more confortable with contact as weeks passed, but still shows lots of resistance, oddly for pretty common things (lying on her belly for too long, going doggy, completely removing her panties..). I can tell she's pretty insecure about her body in general (although she's fine as hell) and for instance never wants to remove her bra or show her breasts. (Looks like she has some serious insecurity about them) that's an example among others. All these things aside, for a long time she explained to me she had no experience in sex and had many reasons not to have sex for now, without ever simply telling me she wasn't ready. It was always confusing. Even though I knew something was conflicted within herself.. I put that on behalf of her immaturity. Sometimes she cried, telling me she was fearing losing me more and more as she felt she was making me wait for sex, thinking I would get bored and dump her. One day she told me she could not ""afford"" to have sex, that even if she had the sex drive for it, something deep inside her would tell her not to go any further. From that day on, I quickly understood one side of her wanted to go further, but another was stopping her in her momentum. It was not her being totally platonic. She wanted me but was conflicted. I always told her ""whatever it is, just listen to yourself and tell me if you're not ready for that.""  **But finally**, a few days ago, we went to bed together and she opened up. She told me she's afraid of being hurt. She said she fears losing me once we have sex. That giving me her virginity means so much to her, that her first time with me is like giving me a part of herself, and she would be devastated if l got to leave her later on. She told me she loves me so much that she could have sex right now without hesitation, but deep inside there's this resistance that tries to protect her from being hurt later on. She was bursting in tears. I'm no psychologist but it looks like she sees sex as a threat to our relationship future (me leaving her once I'm ""satisfied"" - I guess) rather that a way for us to connect even deeper and strengthen our love for each other. As if sex would trigger in me the need to see other women, to move on. This is nonsense of course, but how to make her understand that? Before you ask, I think I'm a very caring and loving person, that shows lots of affection when needed and she *knows* I care for her. **But again there's this deep resistance that prevents her from listening to her own desires and just letting go.** I also understood that her playful teases, stops, her preventing me from going further, backing off when it gets very hot or physically resisting when I try to move her in the bed, and saying she's not an easy girl and that I ""won't always get what I want"" - while looking like her trying to be a challenge - all come from this ""self-protection"" (a world she used many times) that comes from a deep insecurity, and not a lack of desire for me. I was wrongly taking it personally in the beginning, but finally understood the use of this ""protection"" word - not protecting her integrity - protecting her emotional stability if ever she got hurt by me after we have our first time. I think this looks like a weird syndrome where the girl thinks that giving her body equals losing all her self-respect and becoming too vulnerable. She's afraid of this vulnerability. She ""withdraws"" sex to keep that vulnerability away for now. **I don't know if this phenomenon is common in inexperienced girls but I'd like to help her getting rid of this state of mind.** I already made her understand I care a lot for her and that I'd never make sex my only source of satisfaction with her (that's obvious... I would have dumped her months ago if it was the case). I really love her and she knows it. But there's this part of her definitely doing more harm than good to both of us. Have any of you experienced this? Thanks for your help."

The stroking motions appear to be loving as with a child or a dog; but they're not - they're just physical pressure seeking release. I get no feelings kick out of any aspect of it whatsoever. Never did. And I want to forget the vulnerability on both sides as soon as it's done.

He suggested a position (doggy style) and I instantly wasnt comfortable with it. He said, give it a try and I was nervous and going to but the second I was on my knees and about to bend over, I instantly was pulled out of the moment and i said no. He respected my wishes but my saying no effectively killed things and we werent able to have sex at all. I told him I wasnt going to apologize for saying no and he said very sincerely he didnt want me to. However, for the past few days I have been fighting extreme feelings of guilt, like im broken for not being into it at all. I will admit to crying, liek I did something wrong but also from the residual feelings of mental discomfort when I think about the position and if I had gone throughout with it. I felt like I was having something taken away from me (control and a level of vulnerability Im not yet comfortable with in a new and jfc fiest relationship) once I turned around and I wasnt comfortable not being able to see him. I keep reading that most girls love it and its something I need to get over and the fact that he lost his erection the moment I turned him down makes me feel like ive done something wrong. What didnt help was the next day he made a joke about it. I asked to fix a stray piece of hair and he said no and I asked again (playfully) and he said Im not going to apologize for saying no. I was openly shocked and he said, its just a joke. He doesnt know Ive been beating myself up about this. On a similar note, I also feel guilty and broken for having no desire to try to give oral. He does it for me sometimes and hes expressed a great fondness for giving it and i feel guilty for not reciprocating but Im currently completely adverse to the idea and have not been curious about it in the past. I feel guilty for being boring. I dont see myself as a very sexual person (im Demisexual) but I enjoy it with him, I love being with him and its fun and i feel good and comfortable. I just keep coming across people that are totally into sex in a way that I cant even comprehend and it makes me feel like something wrong with me for being vanilla. "

Not wanting to subject a potential romantic partner to the burden of my mental health ended a lot of the relationships I was in before they could really start. I would make the conscious decision to forgo emotional and physical intimacy for the calculated safety of knowing I could hide my issues if I didn't embrace the vulnerability of letting your guard down as you get to know someone. I still had a libido, I still had desires, I was just too scared of everything that came with it. I had friendships and dated socially and many of those friendships were with women, friendships I still have today. For some reason sex just never really happened. And I find myself soon to be 27 years old without having had sex. 2 years ago I decided to seek help, and 2 years of therapy and months of medication I finally feel like I am healthy and happy and normal. But the Antidepressants I'm on have really done a number to my sexual desire. I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit has experience with a healthy sex life while on antidepressant and anti anxiety medication? I am finally healthy enough to have healthy relationships but I feel less physically ready to have them. "

So let me give my experience. Not all guys have the same sensations, but I think most will relate. To me, one of the most arousing sights is when you pull off her panties. She smiles and lifts her soft, supple legs so I can slip them off. She has those healthy curves in her hips. Between her legs, I see her pussy: wet, hot, glistening, inviting. Whenever I'm at that stage, I feel the rumblings of primal desire to be inside. Her high voice... her shapely body... her feminine aura and eyes... and of course her womanhood between her legs. At that stage, I usually feel an urge to inhale her. It's a sudden sexual desire. I'll push her legs open, bury my face in her pussy, and draw her scent into my nose. Her hot muskiness enters my brain. I always love this point. I'll be hard and throbbing with desire as my face is slick with her juices. It's hard to describe: it's kind of like a deep craving to be inside her, to feel her warm femininity encompass your dick. An aggressive hunger to enter her. Eventually, I start pushing myself into her. I always feel an involuntary moan coming whenever I do that. I feel my throbbing, sensitive head pushing into her warm, juicy embrace. There's slight resistance at the pink opening. Then I push further.... and further..... I'm totally engulfed *inside* her femininity. And psychologically, that's such a turn on. I'm buried all the way, the base of your dick is touching her wet lips. She moans in pleasure too. That turns me on more. I push in and out, feeling a deep, primal thrill at being between her legs -- that she wants *me,* *my dick* -- and a desire to cream deep, deep inside her. I can't hold out any longer. She spreads her legs wide in the air, saying my name in desire, asking me to cum inside her. That vulnerability makes me even harder. Her muscles contract, spasming around my member. I feel a desire in every fiber of my body to cum and feel our warm juices mingle. I orgasm, feeling ripples of gripping pleasure on my head, and my semen spurts inside her.. I'm consumed by that burst of blissful release... billions of years of evolution have led to this point. I collapse onto her, and my semi-dick twitches and pulsates in her pussy, the cum oozing and both of us bathing in the after-effects of the orgasm. That's how raw sex feels like to me... It's one of the most amazing experiences. "

It's seen as this hyper-sensitive overly broad vilification of normal, natural, everyday behavior. To many, it represents the worst kind of political correctness and a zealotic incarnation of feminism that is easy to disagree with. Admittedly, toxic masculinity is a bit of an aggressive term. The goal of identifying and labeling behaviors as toxic is not always to shame, but to induce self-reflection, but that seems to be lost when you're being called toxic. Additionally, there is a huge disconnect between the basic premise of toxicity and the subtle ways in which toxic masculinity operates. At some point, it starts to feel like a witch hunt more than a social awareness movement. When awareness for social change builds, new terms often leak into the public lexicon well before a broader understanding of their definition and history can be established. What usually happens is these terms are often derided and mocked as newspeak; as attempts to deceptively reshape our shared language according to some overbearing agenda. There is also often an understated moralistic sentiment that jabs at the ribs of anyone who may resist this new terminology - and that only makes them resent it even more. As an example, it was not too long ago when I would overhear people scoff at the idea of the term ""LGB."" Then, the eye-rolling continued as the term was updated to ""LBGT."" Soon after, more eye-rolls came with ""LBGTQ."" The acronym has not stopped expanding. It seeks to be inclusive of every flavor of sexual orientation apart from the norm, but the newer updates continue to be mocked, while the more seasoned versions have gained a sort of legitimacy. And that's how these things usually work out. Right now, we're in the wary, untrusting stages of ""toxic masculinity's"" arc. Toxic masculinity, like many new terms that reshape our public discourse, is not meant to be aggressive and accusatory, despite how it feels to hear it applied to you. It is not meant to insult the people who it describes. It's a label to highlight the subtle effects of common behaviors that (patriarchal) society at large promotes which are ultimately bad for us. Advocates who use the term cannot escape the resentment they feel toward the behavior, but they use it in order to invoke introspection, not shame. Imagine bearing witness to cruel, insensitive treatment of someone, but when you call the perpetrators out on it, they act as if there is nothing wrong with what they're doing. What you would want is for them to reflect on their behavior, try to view it through a different perspective, come to terms with how they have behaved, genuinely apologize for it, and then seek to avoid behaving like that in the future. Instead, they defend their behavior, then redirect their animosity at the person who called them out. (Obviously, this pattern is textbook toxic masculinity.) Now, let's reframe what toxic masculinity is meant to be a label for. It starts as a set of behaviors that are commonly attributed to masculinity or masculine culture. These behaviors are not necessarily perpetrated by men alone; they encompass the entire culture that mascilinity promotes. The effects of these behaviors are subtly deleterious to everyone involved, even to the perpetrators themselves. A key word to focus on here is ""subtle."" As in: not obvious. So, the next time someone describes something as toxic mascilinity, but you disagree, it's possible that you're not taking the larger picture into account. Before you simply dismiss the claim as an aggressive agenda to shame you, perhaps you should stop and listen. Maybe ask for clarification before shouting the other person down. You're being invited to think a little harder about your actions. You're not being insulted. You're being given an opportunity to show just how decent a person you are. Decent people consider the opinions of others and rectify their behavior so that they don't cause harm. Decent people apologize for their mistakes and work to remove them from their repertoire. Here are some general attributes that are common to toxic masculinity: * agressiveness * competition * shaming * peer pressure * possessiveness * mansplaining * interrupting/speaking over others * denial of vulnerability * gender roles There are more, but I've gotta run. I hope I was able to make the topic a little more palatable for some. Feel free to disagree, however I would prefer civil debate over insults."

She has admitted to never having orgasmed with a sexual partner, but is able to orgasm through masturbation alone. We both figure it's a question of comfort and vulnerability. In addition to continuing our regular sex which we both find satisfying, we have decided to try masturbating together and slowly incorporating each other into our masturbation over time. Any suggestions from people with related experience? I want to support her and make sure I am not being selfish."

I made a post about it in my history if you care to check it out. After the assault, I went through a promiscuous phase with very negative results (I was assaulted again and generally just had pretty low-quality, nerve-wracking sex). Since then, I've worked pretty hard on my trauma with the help of my therapist and have resolved to treat sex very carefully instead of recklessly. All in all, I'm in a much better place, but sex with new people still makes me feel nervous. I feel like I need to be in a place of strong trust before I can allow someone to share a space of physical and emotional vulnerability with me. So... I'm seeing a new guy and he seems great. I can definitely see this turning into a serious relationship. I'm very attracted to him and I think he is to me. It's just now the sex thing is hanging in the air and I know I have to tell him that I need to take things slowly. I know that if we were to fuck soon, I would probably not handle it well. Whatever we might have had in the future would probably implode because I fucked it up. Anyone been in this situation? Anyone have a script for me to use? "

That being said, I feel like this is one hurdle I can't break through no matter how I tackle it. Background: my attempts have all been made when alone (I want to be able to do this without help), they've all been unsuccessful, I have tried to use instruments, I have tried to use various types of smut. I wasn't raised in a particularly religious or repressive house, I just never felt the need to do that. I was assaulted by a roommate when I was a teenager, but I don't think that's related to this because it never really haunted me or anything. I logically understand that this is a really healthy practice and I don't think it's gross when other people do it. I have no issues coming so long as my partner is involved, so it's not that I don't know what to expect. Essentially, I've gotten to a point where I can get really close, like 95% and nothing more. And every time I try it makes me unreasonably emotional out of the blue (and I'm not an emotional person). So I guess I'm looking for advice from anyone that's been in a similar crunch. I'm a girl, but I don't think this is really a gendered thing so anyone is welcome to chime in. Thanks in advance"

The majority of our sexual contact has been me giving oral, which I genuinely enjoy. However, we've both come to feel that our sex life has become lopsided, focusing almost solely on his pleasure. For personal reasons, my partner isn't that interested in penetrative sex, so we've been trying to include more oral for me. The problem isn't that he doesn't want to give me oral, and I don't even have the classic concerns about my vulva's appearance, scent or taste. However, for some reason, I just can't relax when receiving oral sex. I tense up my legs subconsciously which pushes him away, and I struggle to keep them open unless I really focus on it. Sometimes I wince or whimper inadvertently which, unsurprisingly, makes it harder for him to continue. I also get little pleasure and some discomfort from the act apart from one time where I came close but he got too tired. He does tire very quickly and I wonder sometimes if I am just uncomfortable being the focus of his attention and relinquishing all my self-consciousness. However, what I'm feeling also feels sometimes like genuine fear and vulnerability. I want to get over this as I do find the idea of oral sex hot, and most of all I'd love to be able to orgasm with a partner. I'm very good at exploring my body on my own and have no problem bringing myself to orgasm. However, it too often ends up that he has a more reciprocal and passionate sexual experience, and I'm left feeling quite alone when it comes to my pleasure. Do you have any advice for how to get over this and start enjoying oral? (TL:DR - I can't relax let alone orgasm from oral sex. What techniques can I use to make this more possible?)"

Dated around a bit but mostly just hooked up with people or had FWB's. I definitely had issues with vulnerability and intimacy so stayed away from it. I also put sex on a pedestal and was sort of sex crazy, though I wouldn't call myself an addict. My libido has always been very high, I regularly would masturbate multiple times a day, have crazy sex, most guys couldn't keep up with me, and I was told my many men how I was the best they'd ever had, etc. Though I wasn't aware of it at the time of course, I'm pretty sure I derived much of the pleasure from sex from making the other person feel good because it validated my self-worth and made me feel powerful. I definitely have spent a lot of my life trying to please other people as a way to gain validation because I couldn't give it to myself. I used sex as a tool to feel powerful, though ironically all I was doing was giving away my own power. Anyway, fast forward to years of therapy and a lot of work on myself and I'm in a relationship with an amazing human who is caring and sensitive. And I feel bored, have a hard time getting aroused or feeling in the mood for sex ever. His penis is on the smaller side for what I'm used to and I've previously always been a size queen. I would automatically lose my attraction if I was hooking up with a guy who had a penis on the smaller size. He's definitely not small small, like 5"" with a decent girth but I usually prefer 6.5-8inches with a solid girth. In my head, I blamed his penis size for awhile for my disinterest but I don't think that's it. He's able to use it well and it does feel good for the most part when we have sex. I am pretty sure the reason I'm not getting turned on is because this feels safe and secure and that feels boring in my head. I feel so bad for both him and myself and desperately want to fix this! How do I get myself to believe that safe, emotionally connective sex can and is hot?? TL;DR: Used to have a lot of sex, got into a solid relationship for the first time in my life and all of a sudden have zero libido. How do I convince my brain that safe, emotionally connective sex is hot??"

I'm feeling particularly frisky this morning, and with no hubby in sight, I'm going to treat myself to writing a few words about one half of our particular bedroom dynamic in lieu of his lovely company since I consider it to be both extremely satisfying and emotionally intimate, and, well, putting this stuff down on paper (keyboard) is just too damn fun. Strap yourselves in (on) girls as this will probably end up quite long! ### Background When I first met my husband, it quickly became apparent that there was a serious imbalance in our sexual experience. I'd had a couple of long term partners in the past, both of whom were very open sexually, whereas he was a virgin at the time. Being a long time sexxit lurker, I made sure that we took things slowly and let him set the pace (our first time came around 9 months after we officially started dating and is absolutely one of my favourite memories). As a kinky person, however, we very quickly ramped up the ante and he became very enthusiastic about sharing his own kinks with me which has led to some funny and memorable failures in the bedroom, but even more long-standing favourites which we still enjoy to this day. Whilst we do take pleasure in more vanilla encounters, the majority of our sex involves one dominant, and one submissive partner, with us each taking about a 50/50 split of those roles. Since there is information aplenty on this subreddit for male led sex (and being honest here female led is my favourite), I'll just be discussing that half of our approach to having great sex in this post, in the hopes that it can bring even just a little more great sex to the world out there should anybody find this to inspire an evening or two for themselves. ### Why Is Sex Like This Fun? Let's start at the top with some sweeping statements. Sex is all about intimacy between two people. We express this intimacy by letting down our emotional and physical barriers. When the barriers are down we consummate this intimacy by experiencing mutual pleasure. Intimacy, letting down barriers, mutual pleasure. Simple right? Great sex, in my opinion, is built upon the strengthening of these three pillars. We strengthen intimacy with love, affection, kindness, romance, closeness, shared experiences etc - if you're in a relationship with someone you truly love then you will be well on your way to building this pillar. We strengthen mutual pleasure with improved sexual technique - positions, angles, g-spots, p-spots, part of which we'll come onto later in this post. But the key pillar which I believe dominance and submission strengthens is that of breaking down the barriers between our two lovers. When you're blindfolded, you are innately opening yourself to your partner and placing your trust in their want to pleasure you over your need to watch what they do. When you are tied up, you are innately placing your trust in your partner over your need to freely move. Each act of submission breaks a barrier, brings us closer together, and allows for heights of pleasure and intimacy which, for me at least, are not possible without. That's why it's fun. ### Okay, Heights of Pleasure Sounds Good, But What is Female Led Sex? Female led sex is any encounter in which the dominant, leading role is filled by us girls, whilst our hot hunks open up and allow us to break down every barrier to intimacy they have. And that's it. Female Led Sex for you could be as simple as tying him up and riding him every Wednesday like clockwork. He sees it coming each week but oh how he gets hard throughout the day at work thinking about how, as soon as he gets home, the ropes go on and they don't come off until he's submitted that hard cock to be used by you for as many orgasms as you please. Love, check. Intimacy, check. The feeling you get knowing your husband trusts you so much he lets you tie him up every week and ride him to your hearts content, priceless. Of course, this is just one small example. Let's continue and see if we can work our way slowly through all the different building blocks which you might like to use to create a greater transfer of power between partners in your bedroom and hit new heights of intimacy. ### 1. The Pre-Foreplay Contrary to what some may imagine, truly great sex does not begin in the bedroom. That's not to say you have to go on a room to room tour of the house making love on each surface before going to the bedroom, only that anticipation, hints, and seduction throughout the day make us all feel desired and will ultimately lead to a much more satisfying evening when both partners are already aroused from their ""pre-foreplay"" throughout the day. **The expression of desire for your partner is a key point here.** Have you ever been with a guy that you just couldn't get enough of? Maybe you were bonking like bunnies with such an exciting frequency in the beginning only for you to notice that, realistically, you were the doing the majority of the work, the foreplay, the seduction, the sexy texting etc - feels a bit silly when you realise that doesn't it? *Both* partners need to feel desired by their SO, there's just no way around it. Before we continue sit back think about this a little - is my partner putting in the effort to our sex life that I need to feel sufficiently desired. Accordingly, am I happy with the effort I'm putting in to make my partner feel desired? If you're unsure on either of those points, sit down and talk to your SO - we're not going to get very far if one of you isn't feeling like the hottest shit. All right, enough of that. Onto the meaty bit. Here are some Female Led Pre-Foreplay ideas to help you set up an evening of your wildest dominant dreams 1. Wake him up in the morning by gently sliding him inside you and riding him. Tell him he gets 1 minute of pleasure for each submissive act he agrees to for that evening. Climb off without letting him come to make sure he's thinking about what he's agreed to all day long. 2. Wake him up in the morning by gently guiding his face down between your legs - remember dominance means your pleasure comes first. Have him pleasure you until you're satisfied and then tell him that you expect a lot more of that from him that evening. 3. Be upfront about your intentions by texting him if he's out/at work. This is your partner after all, if you can't be direct about your desires with them then you're setting yourself up for a life of missed hints and unsatisfying encounters. 'Tonight I'm taking control of you, I'm going to do X, Y, Z and expect A, B, C from you.' Simple as that - think of the power this gives you - request your favourite underwear of his be worn or that he prepares himself or the bedroom or any sex toys you might have in a specific way when he gets home. Maybe you tell him that you'll be requiring a massage as soon as you walk in the door or that you expect him to be blindfolded on the bed at 9pm on the dot. The possibilities are endless - it is making sure that you're both thinking about this throughout the day that is key. 4. Keep a few pictures of your favourite toys on your phone and send to him the ones you intend to use periodically during the day so that he can be kept fantasising about what you'll specifically be doing with them. 5. Require that he finds a private place (bathroom cubicle) every X hours during the day and strokes himself for exactly X strokes before returning to what he was doing. Tell him he must text you what he was thinking about each time so that you can keep track. 6. Require that he wears no underwear during the day. 7. Require that he wears a male chastity device (if you have one) during the day to remind him that today his erection belongs to you. This can be particularly fun and powerful if you've not previously thought about exploring the avenue of chastity toys. 8. Forbid him from initiating sex for a period of time. 'Next week we're going to try something new. Only I will be initiating sex, since I know how rock hard it makes you when I take the lead. I want you ready and shaved each evening and you'll not make any advances until I push you down onto the bed.' 9. Above all else, communication with your partner is key to the pre-foreplay. If in doubt, tell him or hint to him about what you plan to do that night/next week/X date to get you both thinking about it and aroused leading up to the main event. ###2. The Initiation Everything has to actually kick-off somewhere. From everything we see on this subreddit, this can evidently sometimes be a stumbling block for partners. I'm too shy? what if he rejects me? what if I mess up and do something really unsexy? It's okay, we've all been there at some point in our lives. A few points: If he rejects you, don't just let it get you down - talk to him. Why did he reject you? Was it a bad time, was he ill? No problem, we have to be reasonable here but that's okay, just initiate again at a later date with no hard feelings. Does he give a more substantial reason - something that signals you two might not be as compatible as you thought? Discuss that more and look for a compromise. There comes a point in every woman's life where we have to stand up and say this is the line, right here is the quantity and quality of love, sex and intimacy that I need to be happy. If your partner cannot provide that then I suggest you take a deeper look at what you want from life and whether you're going to attain that in your current relationship. As for accidents, doing something unsexy etc nobody cares - a great partner will either see you laughing at yourself and laugh with you or see that you're nervous and do everything in their power to help you save face. They are on your team, they are helping you succeed, they want everything you want and hey they were probably just admiring your breasts at the time anyway and missed the entire thing. Preamble over, let's look at some ideas on how we can initiate some kinky loving right here! 1. ""Take out your cock for me."" Lead him to the bedroom with it. 2. ""Go and set up the toys please, I'd like you to take out X, Y, Z and then to strip naked on the bed and wait for me."" 3. ""I'm going to make you mine tonight. Please undress me - we'll be starting with a massage."" 4. Set up an expectation during the day so that it can initiate for you. ""When you get home tonight I'd like you to be naked and available on all fours on the bed at exactly 8 pm. I won't be mentioning this to you again - I expect you to obey my instructions purely from this text."" 5. Spread your legs whilst on the sofa in a skirt. ""I think you've been bad today with everything I know you've been thinking about. Put your tongue between my legs and let's see if you can make up for it"". 6. Something as simple as taking his hand and leading him to the bedroom. ""Strip for me."" 3 words and away you go! 7. Bring the chastity device to him. ""Put this on for me - you'll need my permission for an erection for the rest of this evening."" 8. (This is my favourite) Start kissing him like you would on any other day. Slowly make it heavier, put your hand on the back of his head and pull his tongue into yours. Gradually move your hands onto the top of his shoulders and then start pushing him downwards. Keep pushing until he's on his knees looking up at you. ""I think we need to put your tongue to work down there."" There's just something about standing over him whilst he kneels and makes me come that I adore. ### 3. The Foreplay Oh what a wonderful world we live in where we can live out our deepest sexual fantasies and then discuss them with strangers on the internet to compare notes. I'm going to stop holding back from this point so apologies in advance if any of my suggestions don't fit your particular kink landscape. I guess that uniqueness is what can make sex so special with your partner - there's a whole rainbow of their interests out there awaiting discussion, discovery, practice and combination with your own interests! Before we jump into suggestions, I'm going to talk about a few recurring themes that will arise in foreplay and the main event. In mainstream media men in sex are largely portrayed as initiators, penetrators, the partner in control, the partner who chooses which orgasm is climax of sex, and largely the main recipient of oral sex and giver of anal sex. **This is extremely lucky.** 'Lucky?', you might ask. Yes, this is entirely in our favour because it means that turning this common perception on its head will: - Take most men out of their usual comfort zone (vulnerability = 0 barriers = intimacy = great sex) - Automatically give everything we do an erotic taboo appeal - Experience everything sex has to offer - not just the narrow view of sexuality that we see in the media So to summarise then, if in doubt, anything that loosely adheres to the following should be nicely taboo. (You'll know you're hitting the nail on the head when you see a hybrid look of deep vulnerability and intense arousal on the face of your submissive partner). In my favourite sex, women are the initiators, penetrators, the partner in control, the partner who chooses which orgasm is the climax of sex, and largely the main recipient of oral sex and giver of anal sex. Erotic right? I'm wet just thinking about it. No holding back now. 1. Order your submissive partner to gently ride a small dildo whilst you watch and enjoy cumming from your favourite vibrator. 'Good boy, show me how much that nice big dick of yours responds to that naughty little plug in your ass.' 2. Tie him spread eagled on his back and sit on his face pointing towards the headboard. 'You're going to make me come like this and taste how wet making you submissive gets me. Make me cum and you can enjoy my other naughty hole.' When he gives you an orgasm like this turn to face the other way to reward him with your ass whilst he makes you come again. 3. Tie him spread eagled and straddle just over his head so that your weight isn't on him but you force him to take in the view of your dominant pussy. Use your vibrator to cum in front of him and reinforce that these sessions are about your pleasure, orgasms, and that you're calling the shots. 4. Take a powerful vibrator and begin with it at the base of his shaft. Slowly make him agree with how much he enjoys submitting to you and move the vibrator up towards the head of his cock slightly each time. 'I know you like it when I initiate don't you' 'I know you spent most of today thinking about my hot wet pussy pushing your tongue down into the bed. That's true isn't it?' 'We both know that, deep down, you're hoping that I get my strapon out later, admit it' Don't let him cum yet of course - controlling a man's orgasms is one of the most erotic things you can do to him. 5. Enjoy his tongue all over your body - lie back and enjoy naming all of your erogenous zones. See if you can discover a few more. I like to always end this by making him lick my asshole (the repetition of this each time we play that game raises his arousal as he knows how naughty I'm going to make him at the end of it). 6. Put him on his knees and have him give your strapon a blow job. This is seriously taboo for most guys - it'll either not do much for them, or the power of the role reversal in the situation will give them a raging erection despite not being touched. There's really only 1 way to find out which way your guy leans, though obviously discuss beforehand if he's relatively new to female led fun. 7. If your man is good with his fingers, feel free to lie back and order exactly what you want from his menu. I like to combine this one with a chastity cage since when I'm on my back and he has his fingers inside my warm wet pussy, I don't want there to be any doubt whose in charge of what his cock is allowed to do (nothing but stay all soft and sensitive no matter his state of arousal). 8. Handcuff your partners hands behind his back, lube up a small anal plug and then ask him to fill you up with it using nothing but his mouth. Wide bases are his friend here, and this usually results in his nose getting up close and personal with my pussy so we can let nature and pheromones do our job of driving him crazy with arousal for us. ### 4. The Main Event... ...by which I mean penetrative sex ah yeaa. That's an arbitrary definition of course, and please do completely ignore any semblance of order in your use of these suggestions - this is just what works for us :) Before we dig in, a few thoughts. To me, nothing is more powerful or erotic than the closeness of penetrative sex. Being inside your partner removes all physical barriers and leaves only mental ones to disarm. In this way, combining penetrative sex with dirty talk and other techniques to have your man open himself, mind and body, in submission to you has produced the most powerful orgasms I've witnessed in both myself and my partner. If you've followed a few of our steps up until now then you should be feeling nicely dominant, have had a good number of orgasms to warm up without being warn out, and have your man well on his way to a trance-like arousal in which he is permanently rock hard and willing to follow your every desire. If you're not there yet, then hey why not just keep going on foreplay - there can never be too much foreplay in the world! With your pussy warmed up and wet at the thought of what's to come, and your man accepting his place beneath you, let take a look at my favourite ways to seal the deal on a night to be remembered, where the sex was hot, kinky, and we entirely opened ourselves up with our partner. 1. Tie him on his back with his legs apart and hands behind his head. Gag him with your underwear so that he can constantly taste your arousal and then slowly lower yourself down onto him in your favourite girl-on-top position. Gently begin to fuck him with your pussy. If he moves his hips to meet you or makes the slightest sound, stop and remind him 'you're mine tonight baby, stay quiet and still for me give up everything you have'. Gradually work up the pace but stay true to your command - if he moves or makes a noise bring everything back to the start. I love this one because of his face whilst I fuck him and watch him try not to moan or move which is against just about everything his body wants him to do. He's giving all of that up so that I can dominate his cock as fully as I like to. 'It's so hot when you submit like this for me baby, and I can see in your eyes how good it makes you feel. Give everything up to me quietly when you're ready - my pussy is waiting for your little submissive orgasm.' I promise it will be anything but little. 2. Have him suck, lube, and set up your favourite strapon. I very much prefer strapons that allow me to orgasm directly from fucking him - if that sounds as hot to you as it is for me, take a look into either vibrating or double ended strapons and pickup a quality model. Push him onto his back and ask him to hold his knees up to his shoulders. Tie him in that position and then blindfold him and gag him with your underwear. 'I don't want you to see anything or make a noise hunny - I want all your senses focused on that naughty tight asshole of yours whilst I spread you open and gently fuck you into your submission to me. My cock is in charge tonight, I'm just going to steadily fuck you and we both know you're going to cum just from the feeling of me inside you.' If you don't touch his cock at all and there's been a good level of buildup throughout the evening, there's a good chance you'll get to watch your husband cum just from being fucked by you. This is possibly my most favourite thing to do to a man - it represents a complete reversal of bedroom roles - he received sex from your big hard girlcock and his body admitted to liking it so much that it triggered an orgasm without you allowing him to involve his cock in sex at all. This can be such a mindfuck for a guy that you shouldn't be surprised if he needs all of the sweet aftercare that you've got. Whew. 3. If you really want to take number 2 the extra mile, don't remove the chastity cage whilst you take his asshole and make it yours. Denying him even the ability to get his own cock hard whilst you force moans from his naughty hole with your big plastic one can be so erotic for a man that you'll probably start to see cum dripping freely from his cage. I like to have him on all fours when we fuck like this so that we can both appreciate the way his cock dribbles in response to my pounding. There's just something so sweetly submissive about a steady trickle of cum ebbing from him instead of the usual three or four aggressive spurts that clicks in with the eroticism of his submission. This effect can be especially pronounced if you've denied him an orgasm for a number of days beforehand (either through chastity or teasing) and resulted in easily the most intense orgasm that I've ever seen my husband have. 4. Putting the strapons away for the moment, and climbing back into your favourite cowgirl variation, we can play a game we call 10 pumps. Sit back whilst your SO's cock is deep inside you and make yourself cum with a vibrator whilst he has to lie there and watch you moan (more restraints I think, mmm). Each time you have an orgasm ride him for 10 aggresive strokes. I like to encourage him to moan as loud as his body wants to with this one since I find it makes the 10 strokes all the more intense. Of course after the 10 are up go right back to your vibrator. This will slowly drive him to crazy level of arousals and you'll be amazed at the strength of the orgasm you can force on him. As we've done this more and more I've enjoyed lowering the pump limit (my husband came from a single stroke once in a very long and memorable evening!), but 10 is a good place to start. 5. Another game we love playing as the finale to an evening doesn't really have a name but it goes like this. My husband bets a number of thrusts (usually around 30-50 depending on how much teasing I've subjected him to). I then fuck him nice and firmly in my favourite cowgirl variation for that number of thrusts and we do the following based on what happens: - If I cum from fucking him, my husband wins the predetermined wager (usually a few nights of dominating the me before I can make him submit again). - If I haven't cum from fucking him, I slide up and sit on his face for him to lick me orgasm before choosing another number of thrusts (the game keeps on going with this one). - If my husband cums from me fucking him, I win the wager and I get to dominate him all over gain the next night ;) Of course, this game really gets me hot under the collar when you consider that points 2 and 3 will often happen in the same round ;) ### Conclusion That's about all I have for now, reddit. I hope that someone out there finds some value in my ramblings. It ended up taking me all afternoon to get these notes down but I think it's an afternoon well spent considering that I got really quite turned on towards the end there. If this list was a little bit extreme for you, why not consider making your own! Just jot down a few bullet points of your favourite ways to make love to your partner and ask them to piece together an evening so that you can share your kinks with them. That's all we're looking for at the end of the day I guess - some loving, intimate sex :) Also guys out there reading this thinking well hey actually I might just be into that, go ahead and show this to your SO and see what she makes of it! The only way you'll definitely never experience your deepest fantasies is by keeping quiet about them! "

However, when we were teenagers we grew apart. My cousin is autistic but he always wanted to live independently. Anyway, he left his parents house and started working around the country (United States). Unfortunately, he ended up living with a woman who had some sort of personality disorder. She was attracted to the fact that he was autistic and liked this vulnerability. When he eventually said that he wished to leave and move on, she tied him up and kept him as a prisoner basically. She would leave him long periods of the day while she was out at work or shopping and then she used to come back and sexually assault him basically (he is essentially asexual so he didn't even know what was happening to him). This would have continued for god knows how long until a neighbour found out what was happening and alerted the police. She is now in prison and out of his life. However, he has been essentially sectioned for a while (because of the mental state he was in) and he is very upset by this as he has always resented his autism 'holding me back' and he wants to leave and start travelling across the United States again. This has lead to him becoming suicidal (which of course is not going to make the doctors want to release him). I hate seeing him as a shadow of his former self but everytime I visit he asks me if I can help release him? The problem is that he wants a lifestyle of travel and doing labour here and there. he is very hardworking that is no problem. However, his autism makes him vulnerable and he refuses to see this? Anyone been in a similar situation?"
210,vulnerability,sex,"Posting on behalf of my [27M] partner [27F]. Dealing with feelings of debasement/shame with actual sex, though 100% comfortable with abstract. Additionally, overwhelming feeling of physical sensation being bad/uncomfortable.",1,7nrbc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7nrbc2/posting_on_behalf_of_my_27m_partner_27f_dealing/,2018-01-03 12:51:39,"Hey everyone! I haven't posted here super often, and this is a bit of a weird topic, so I apologize if I ramble or miss the point at all. **TL;DR:** Partner looking for input on dealing with debasing feelings with physically engaging in sexual/intimate feelings, despite abstract being fine/normal. Also issue of physical sensation being overwhelmingly uncomfortable to the point of it being a ""nails on chalkboard"" effect. &amp;nbsp; ***** My partner and I have been together roughly a year, and the trends of her sexual/intimate tendencies have varied wildly during that time, largely due (in our understanding) to mental health changes. She's been in therapy for over three years, and has consistently improved her state of being, and will be discussing the sex part of this with her therapist more, but we were hoping to get input from others who have dealt with these things. Rough pattern - last Autumn when we met, she was very enthusiastic about sex, with some pretty hard reservations - her giving oral, anything from behind, and anything regarding power dynamics - and was generally happy. Despite that, she had ups and downs, with downs being depressed/suppressed, and ups being aggressive trends - think burning bridges. She was managing well without medication, but that changed around this time. She would describe this as not being regulated, so having no real solid baseline. Come December/January, we hit some stress regarding polyamory (much better now, though not exactly smooth), and her mental state tanked - these are unrelated though. Anxiety became more frequent, and the shut down state of depression progressively got more prominent. With this, sex/intimacy gradually became more infrequent, with there being no desire for it, but additionally the understanding that intimacy would be bad, causing shut downs, panic, etc. Fast forward to now - physical stuff is difficult, but actively trying to improve it now that medication is leveling out (hopefully). This is part because she, in abstract, thinks sex/intimacy is important (despite opening up/vulnerability being a huge hurdle for her), and she understands the importance of it for me/sees how stressful it is over time. &amp;nbsp; ***** **First Issue:** The desire is there, in a waning pattern, but when it is possible, she often immediately cycles out of it. This is usually when physical sensation gets involved or we engage in anything - even just a few seconds of kissing. Sort of like a flame bursts then sputters out. When we've had sex recently (3 attempts in 2 days, after ~2 months with none), it leaves her feeling debased/dirty/shame - literally as if her cat is judging her. Raised in a *very* southern baptist mindset, and having a very distinct break from all of that after dealing with her mental illness, is undoubtedly playing in. But sex in the abstract is...fine. And the feelings don't make sense. She's going to talk to her therapist more on this, but she's frustrated and wants to find something that helps those feelings, to prevent the crashes, or cycling in and out if anyone has dealt with anything similar. &amp;nbsp; ***** **Second Issue:** This is more of an ""always there, but worse when mental state is rough"" kind of thing, but physical sensation is literally a horrible feeling for her most of the time. This can be that her skin feels gross when it touches itself, or clothing, etc. to the thought of kissing or hugging or holding hands feels un-enjoyable to a point not unlike physical pain. Think nails on a chalkboard effect, through touch. This prevents constant difficulty, though we work with it through communication, patience, etc. Has anyone dealt with this? We haven't found much information, and her therapist is thoroughly stumped. &amp;nbsp; Many thanks for your patience and anything anyone can offer. &lt;3 Edit: I know to a degree, this merits a mismatch on compatibility between a very physical/expressive person and someone who isn't, and while that is something I'm aware of, I love this woman dearly and am thoroughly committed to finding something that works here."
211,vulnerability,sex,In a fantastic relationship; still feel shame about limited sexual experience.,6,7o1i2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7o1i2s/in_a_fantastic_relationship_still_feel_shame/,2018-01-04 18:44:49,"I've just recently come into a monogamous relationship with a woman who means everything to me. I honestly was convinced that the experience I am enjoying now was either definitionally impossible or exceedingly rare (maybe it is and I'm even more fortunate than I realize). However, I am having a difficult time dealing with inconvenient, misdirecting dissatisfactions that I have with my own life. I feel the need to sleep with women who I don't know. Not specific women, I just feel like I need to sleep with women who don't know anything about me. The sensation of being known so deeply as my partner knows me and being so wholly approved of is more wonderful than anything I've ever felt, but for some dastardly reason I also feel the need to be sexually desired for more superficial traits. She tells me that she loves my body and I have no doubt that she appreciates those traits that I exhibit, but our connection was initially built on an intellectual level, concomitantly muddying my perception of her perception of me as a sexual being. Some deep insecurity must be demanding that I prove that I am attractive sexually, without need of aid by my emotional or intellectual capacities. I had my first kiss at 22 and first intercourse shortly thereafter. This was due in part to a by-then abandoned religious background that not only kept me from engaging with women sexually, but also instilled a very avoidant attitude toward romantic engagement (dating was for the sake of marriage, marriage was for life, so you'd better be absolutely certain that someone you dated could be a realistic candidate for spending the rest of your life with--lots of pressure). What I think is even more salient, though, is that I don't believe I could have found a mate prior to that even if it hadn't been for the religious constraints. I constantly chased women to date as potential lifetime partners and was consummately rejected without fail. Maybe this was resultant of the pressure that I felt and inadvertantly extended to my potential partners, maybe it was simply a delay in acquisition of social skills, or maybe it was just that I was sexually unattractive visually and behaviorally. All of these things have improved by orders of magnitude and I feel somewhat confident that if I were afforded the opportunity to exercise these more newly acquired traits, I would see success. But there is absolutely no reality I can imagine in which I would prefer to exercise them in preference over continuing my relationship with this woman who I feel is the love of my life. I don't know what to do with these feelings of shame and inadequacy. When I even see casual sex referenced in entertainment or hear it spoken of among friends (or even worse, when she shares stories of her or her friends' casual experiences), I feel so much disdain for myself, it's like physical pain in my stomach. I don't believe that it could be solved by seeking out any feasible volume of casual sex for myself, but there doesn't seem to be any other obvious course of action to take in combatting this hideous monster of an insecurity. Has anyone here had a similar experience? Not only does it feel like an unsolvable puzzle that causes pain for as long as it goes unsolved, but I also feel utterly alone in it. I'm certain that I'm not, but I don't have any close friends who I would expect to relate; and anyone who would is likely to hesitate to share due to the vulnerability required. I hope someone here can at least express some understanding of this struggle."

I've had it for the past 10 years or so, but lately I've been getting wildly turned on by the thought of having a woman kick me in the testicles. I'm not generally a submissive/masochistic type. It's more about the contrast between being masculine/strong and having a male-specific vulnerability exploited by a female. It's becoming all that I can think about, and I just want to know if there's any way to cure this fetish, or at least significantly diminish how excited I get by it.

Even though we don't subscribe to the BDSM lifestyle in anyway. I do take on more of a dominant role (I am older and much larger than she is). She's very loud and confident (she asked me out for drinks first). This is very different from who she is when she gets turned on. She's soft-spoken, needy and touchy. She was very upfront about being an affectionate person from the beginning. This typically manifests as her trying to get as close to me and touching me as possible before she cums. Afterwards she gets pretty emotional and sensitive and wants to cuddle and talk for about 15-20 minutes after we're done. I understood my enjoyment of this as liking control and having a partner to take care of but I feel like it's become more than that. I work in a very stereotypically masculine field and all my friends are men. Before her there was very little affection or tenderness of any type in my life. Now I have this person who looks me softly in the eyes, strokes my hair, asks about my day and in the height of her bliss, just wants to be close to me. I accepted all this because I was just happy to finally have some vulnerability in my life and I kind of forgot that I'll have to go without it some day. I know it means more to me than her. She's affectionate and attentive with everyone in her life. She's built friendships around that, so she has that. I find myself feeling disappointed when I can't see her or she doesn't want to cuddle after sex. Maybe it's because she's the first friend's with benefits that i'm actually friends with but I feel like i've crossed my wires and started depending on this companionship. I know I need to talk to her but i'm not sure what about. I've articulated that I've gotten used to the affection after sex and sometimes I need to be held even if she doesn't. The sex is good and frequent enough. Honestly, i'm scared to say anything at all that might cause her to leave. I'm happy with where we are now but i'm scared of the day she decides to move on and I have to learn to live without that affection and acceptance but it isn't fair to ask for a commitment to this without a relationship. Please help Edit: Thank you all for the comments. I expected a few people to reply telling me that I was selfish and I should just tell her. I'm still apprehensive about telling her and ruining this but I likely will because all of this has been occupying my mind all day and it'll have to come out at some point. If anything, she deserves honesty from me. Edit, again: I guess. If I put it succinctly. I don't know if her affection for me and all this tenderness is a reaction to the sex we have or because she wants to do those things with me regardless. I don't know if i'm reading more into this affection and drawing false conclusions about it and my feelings because it's something so pure that i've never had."

Here's what happens at the moment: things start getting hot and heavy with a guy, and eventually he says ""hey so far do you wanna go?"" And honestly, I don't know how to respond. Sometimes I sort of know what I want; maybe I don't wanna have penetrative sex but I do wanna jerk each other off, or I just wanna explore him with my hands and see what happens (but that seems like a vague response). And I always worry that I'm massively disappointing him by not wanting to have penetrative sex (fear of being a massive disappointment is a recurring theme in my list of sexual anxieties). How do your conversations around sex and boundaries go?

I dont know why, but I started feeling aroused and I knew as I started to get wet. I dont know if it was him holding my hand which triggered a feeling I hadnt felt in so long or his vulnerability. I am thinking its a combination of my attraction to him physically mentally and emotionally. As a new adult I have never felt that way in my life before. I am also a slightly dominant woman. Im the kind of person who loves vulnerability in men, as I think society is sexist in trying to man up men and rip them away from feeling empathically. I love seeing them show emotion, opening up about their feelings... I just wanna know is it weird that I got aroused by his vulnerability? Like that doesnt make me a sadist right... I just think I got triggered so deeply on all levels that it was just a side effect that I got aroused. Does this happen to anyone else?

217,vulnerability,sex,"On trust, consent and date rape",0,71n51y,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/71n51y/on_trust_consent_and_date_rape/,2017-09-22 09:32:38,"Hello r/sex. I'm 19M, and while I am a half-virgin, I do have a lot of time to think about sex, and prompted by a number of posts here about date rape happening, and the victims even being in denial, I've been thinking about consent a lot. What triggered this post was that I was talking to a friend about a potential boyfriend coming over to hers, but that she didn't want to have sex with him yet. She said that even though she is adamant she doesn't want sex, if he came over it still might very much happen. At that point, I became concerned. Very concerned. Let us remind ourselves how consent works. First, among mutually respecting humans, consent of all parties involved is required for anything to happen, and that includes sexual activity. Second, consent can be withdrawn at *any* time, by *either* party involved. That means consent can be withdrawn after the condom has been put on, that it can be withdrawn during sex, and that the guy is perfectly allowed to decide he is not ready for it yet, even though he's naked and hard. Third, it is never implied. No always means no, silence always means no, but yes doesn't always have to mean yes. Let's leave the conundrum and talk coercion. Rape doesn't have to be the use of brute force to extract sexual activity from a person. Statutory rape aside, there are many examples of different forms of rape between adults, from using drugs to render a person unable to give consent, to using one's position of authority to make sexual activity happen, to women threatening false accusations to men to make sexual activity happen, which is terrifying in its own right, to the one I wish to talk about here, which is SOs and prospective SOs expecting sexual activity to happen and not taking no for an answer, and exploiting the vulnerability of their SO, be it their sense of guilt, or their dutiful upbringing, or any emotional attachment that may have already formed, to make sexual activity happen. ""It's normal to do it on the third date!""; ""Everyone does it""; ""You invited me over to your place, what did you expect to do?""; ""We're having sex because we're supposed to!""; ""I'm not taking no for an answer!""; ""Well, you love me, don't you want to have sex?""; ""I'm your boyfriend, you're supposed to take care of me!""; I may be wrong about what actually goes on, having not experienced it myself, but the gist of it is - the perpetrator uses weaknesses in the victim's mind to make the victim's mind succumb and ""consent"" to make sexual activity happen. In my mind, this is not consent. This is hammering away at a mind and tearing down its defences until it is broken enough to not be able to give consent. It's equivalent to using drugs, but weakening the mind, not the body. That's why a yes doesn't have to mean yes. Notice how I haven't used the word ""sex"" to refer to what happens after either feigned consent or the lack of it. Because it isn't sex. It's **rape**. Rape has some very different definitions throughout global law. To give a terrifying example, English law requires the perpetrator to have a penis, which means an XX-chromosomed woman cannot be convicted of rape - a very bad place to be if you trust the wrong people. Especially if you consider that most female-on-male rape occurs through threats and coercion, rather than brute force, purely because of human anatomy. The same human anatomy that's led us to falsely assume that an erection implies consent. It doesn't. An erection is triggered by a passive process in the nervous system that responds to physical stimulation of the genitalia - nothing to do with the wish, or will, or consent, to perform sexual activity. And this awful, patriarchal, sex-negative society has led us to assume that a man will always consent to sexual activity, because ""Why wouldn't you?"", and ""It's your biological imperative."" Men are perfectly entitled to say no. But I digress. My local law is much better at this, defining a rapist as someone who forces or coerces a person to perform ""sexual intercourse or equivalent acts"" with the rapist themselves, a third person, or solo, and, to my surprise, even defines consent. Consent is defined as existing when a person is able to decide on having sex of their own volition and express that decision. It's specifically defined as being absent when threat, deception, misuse of authority, exploiting the inability to not consent or is held captive. Now, while this is a very good definition, at least at nearly 1AM when I'm writing this, it still leaves the very murky area of date rape, especially the kind I described above. Hopefully, this would occur much less frequently if we were more careful where we place our trust. Trust is a fickle thing. Best defined as ""Placing the ability to fuck one's life up in another's hand and believing they will not do it"", it's a thing we give way too easily. Levels of trust differ, ideally taking different orders of magnitude of time to build up, the higher the level, the more power can be placed in our trustee's hands. However, sex is a powerful thing, requiring much more thought than we give it. Unintended pregnancy is always an option, and so is date rape, be it by force or coercion, something able to taint our minds for a very long time, if not forever. This is especially true with virgins having their first time with a non-virgin - two virgins will usually understand each other's concerns. Each and every one person experiencing such a difficult, yet wonderful thing for the first time needs to experience it at their own pace. While they have most to gain from the experience, they certainly have the most to lose, and the onus is on their non-virgin partner to not expect things to happen, because while they may have forgotten, things work differently when it's your first time. It's okay to be nervous, it's okay to want to slow down, it's not supposed to hurt... And you don't have to do anything. Let us remember the tea analogy. Consider that you think partner wants a cup of tea, and you'd be very happy to make them tea. If everything goes well, you boil the water, put the bag in, use sugar and milk to their taste, they drink the tea and everyone's happy. Your partner is happy because they had a nice cup of tea, and you're happy because you provided your partner with a nice experience. However, your partner can change their mind on the tea at any moment. They can change their mind immediately, while you're boiling the water, dipping the bag and even while they're drinking it. If your partner says ""I want a cup of t..."" and then passes out, they don't want tea, because unconscious people don't want tea. If you offer tea, or suggest you were about to make tea, and they say no, you can make the tea, but they aren't going to drink it. You wouldn't force tea down a person's throat, you wouldn't threaten to destroy their life if they didn't have that cup of tea right there, right now, and, finally, you wouldn't make them feel guilty for not wanting to drink the tea because... they said they don't want it. Tea being made doesn't mean the tea has to be drunk. And if you're a terrible person, you would persuade your tea-drinker to drink tea, and they will feign a smile and compliment it, but a cup of tea you don't want is a cup of tea you don't enjoy. And whoever exploits a person at their most vulnerable for their own enjoyment is a fucking terrible person. This is one of the most dangerous things about the ever-accelerating pace of life in the 21st century, combined with the lack of education. Relationships progress from meeting to regular sex way too quickly, and many young people become sexually active without understanding consent beyond the level of what they learned from their peers. *Stereotypes ahead* This is dangerous because boys start thinking it's normal for girls to provide sexual activity at their whim, and girls normalise it in their minds, thinking that's how the World works. *Stereotypes over* Furthermore, it's dangerous because it's detrimental to our collective enjoyment of this thing that our bodies are pretty much designed to do, and they're the best at it that's existed so far. Sexual activity without mutual consent isn't sex. Sex isn't something that only one side enjoys, and the other plays along because that's how it's supposed to be. No one should ever be forced or coerced into doing something they don't want just because ""they should"". Thankfully, we can prevent this from happening, or at least try to minimise it, by making sure that anyone who doesn't understand consent is nowhere near a situation where they could be having sex, or they could be raping someone, or they could get raped. Everyone, especially ladies, be careful out there. I'm all for one-night stands and hookups, but sometimes it doesn't hurt to be careful, and it certainly doesn't hurt to judge whether a prospective SO you're about to invite for a cup of tea understands consent."

I have been sexually intimate with about 10 women (who I liked), but mainly due to a lack of confidence on my part and performance anxiety, did not have sex with them. For me, sex is something that requires trust, vulnerability and intimacy- in fact, I have come to realise that I cannot get turned on without feel intimately connected and fully trusting my partner My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for about 11 months now. She is currently on an overseas trip. Right before she left she told me that after she broke up with her first boyfriend she decided that relationships and love were a scam, and slept with a large number of people in the 7 years that followed. These were all people that she specifically did not like, as she decided that she did not want to feel intimately connected with anyone again. Her intentions in this time were to devalue sex for her and use it to as something to blow off some steam. She also told me early in the relationship that she thought she could be a hooker (she never has been). However she did tell me about a year or 2 ago she had a realisation that she didnt really like her past behaviour didnt really represent what she wanted. She said she stopped sleeping with many people in this time and started looking for more connection. I have been the only person she has had a relationship with since her first boyfriend. Its seems like the last 7 years of fucking strangers has devalued sex for her and closed her off to feelings of intimacy. She has told me explicitly (and recently) that she does not believe in love. For me, I think love is something that exists, and is an emotion I feel fairly easily. I probably started feeling love towards her about 2 or 3 months into the relationship. And it feels like the feelings are mutual- she takes care of me when I am sick, I can be open and honest about things when I am feeling down- she is a caring partner and I try to be the same for her. The hookup culture isnt something that I am opposed to- I consider myself pretty open minded with most things and my general attitude is that if it doesnt directly hurt me or anyone, its not really any of my business. I understand that opening up about her sexual past was difficult for her, and I dont judge her for her behaviour. I guess what Im worried about is incompatibly when it comes to sex- everything in sex is centred around intimacy for me. Rough sex for me makes me feel closer to my partner. Intimate sex turns me on immensely and makes me feel closer to my partner. I see sex is a very emotional, pretty special experience for me and my partner to share, and afterwards, I need to cuddle a lot with my partner. I cannot imagine seeing sex as a commodity or fucking people I dont like. And I guess it makes me feel unsure of myself and our connection when my partner can see sex that way Im mostly writing this to get my thoughts out. Im having a hard time processing and understanding this rationally right now, especially because I cant talk with her freely about it. But I guess if anyone with more experience than me has any thoughts or has been in a similar situation, advice is always appreciated. I would like to understand this situation in a better way so I can move past it. And its probably pretty possible Ive misrepresented some things so feel free to ask questions! "

No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to see sex in the same way other people do. Some parts of my story are as old as time - I'm 22, a virgin, never been in a relationship, never been kissed, etc. I have some of the same issues many guys my age do - lack of confidence, fear of rejection, etc. But there's something very deep inside me - whether physically or mentally - that is fundamentally revolted and horrified by the idea of sexual intimacy. TL;DR: My head's not a fun place to be in. I'm on the autistic spectrum (Asperger's), have severe social anxiety, have struggled with suicidal depression, etc. Suffice it to say, the idea of being in a relationship is extremely intimidating to me. And the idea of sex...well... See, this is the part I don't understand. I see posts on here about partners trying different positions, tips for casual sex, etc. And there's so much happiness and positivity and encouragement, because human beings seem to enjoy sexual intimacy. But when I think about it... The best way to describe it is a deep, primal fear and horror at the idea when applied to *me.* I have always been straight, and have masturbated to porn before. But in recent years, a combination of my anti-depressants and my own personal life situation has lowered both my sex drive and my self-esteem severely. When I was younger I was at the center of all my masturbation fantasies. Now, while I still have something of a sex drive and occasionally masturbate, I can't even *conceive* of the idea of me having sex. Let me put it this way: imagine you're with your partner/fwb/fuckbuddy etc, and the clothes begin to come off. For many of you, this is an exciting and fun event to look forward to. But for me...well, I'm trying to imagine it right now and the thought is almost making me cry literal tears. A woman flirting with me would terrify me, because sex/dating/etc feel so alien to me that there's something fundamentally *wrong* with the idea of it. A woman seeing me naked might be enough to give me a literal heart attack, or at the very least an anxiety attack. I don't know why I feel this way. I've always been an extremely sensitive and vulnerable person, and emotional abuse/gaslighting I dealt with in the past as a teenager has made it very difficult for me to trust others or let my guard down. I don't think it's my dick size, since I've never really felt strongly about that. I don't know what it is, but something inside me is deeply, deeply horrified and revolted by the idea of having sex. If I had to guess, I'd say that the vulnerability of it, and the expectation to do something I don't know, really bothers me. So I guess my main question to /r/sex is...how, and why, is sex so important and enjoyable for so many people? I feel like I've never really understood it, and now even as I'm older I only grow more distant from it. I want to know why sexual desire, which has only ever caused me frustration and annoyance, is so essential and enjoyable for many. I want to know why sex itself is seen as so pleasurable and necessary by so many, and yet the very idea of it makes me shiver in horror. Sorry if this is too long, I hope I made sense. "

Sex, and also fingering, always makes me feel overwhelmed with emotions, but in a sad kind of way. I get feelings of confusion and vulnerability and sometimes get kinda panicky and scared. I can enjoy sex for a while but I always start to get these feelings after a few minutes and then we have to stop and have a break. I feel like this is preventing me from being able to enjoy sex, and I'm really confused about why it happens to me. Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences?"

Said partner and I are into pegging. He is an incredible dude who is really in touch with himself and his sexuality, and I love the closeness we get from pegging - and the power dynamics. He enjoys the vulnerability and the feeling of being wanted that way. We're also into getting high and fucking, because, well, who isn't. The other night we'd had a cone or two and were mashing ourselves into each other at full force, albeit somewhat floatily. I ask him to use my buttplug on me as we fuck. He gets the buttplug and kindly obliges, then as he's getting ready to enter me with his cock, he sighs dreamily and says, ""You know, that's one thing I've never tried. Double penetration. It'd be really amazing having..."" he trails off, looks momentarily confused, and then exclaims ""fuck! I don't have two holes."" It was hilarious. And entirely delightful. tfw when ya boy is so in touch with his feminine side, he forgets he doesn't have a vagina. &lt;3"

She told me hers and Its nothing uncommon but Ill let it remain private. Mine is that I want a threesome but with a guy and not in the way that most people would imagine I want to basically share a guy with her but its more than that. I want to share the more feminine or passive side of sex with her. The other guy would be mostly straight and her and I would suck his cock and wed both get fucked by him! Wed basically be sharing sex with a guy. Ive had some experience with pegging in the past and I love the totally different dynamic where I am vulnerable and the power dynamic shifts. It reverses the roles we normally play in sex. It puts sex in a whole different perspective. You are not as much thinking about performing as you are wondering if the other person will be good at fucking me. There is much more vulnerability and trust and the first time I did it, I totally understood why sex is more of a big deal or a loaded proposition to women than it is to men. Its like a window into the female experience of sex and I guess its just as much fun and enlightening as it is when a woman wears a strap on and tries fucking someone else for the first time. I am not really attracted to men but in this context, the ultimate would be to be with a woman and share the same man! We are both sharing that cock and his skills. We are both sharing the feminine or passive side of sex. I would not want to have sex this way all the time but it would be so much fun to share a man with my wife and share the female experience of sex with her. Just really hesitant to tell her. We have good communication but Ive never hinted at any attraction to men and honestly I dont think I have any. Ill admit this makes me some degree of bisexual but I honestly would have no desire to be alone with a guy and doing this. Im just wondering how she will see me or maybe I am overreacting. "

I'm just looking for honest answers. I've only opened up to a girl once before, and it ended up scaring her away. She was the first girl I ever had a crush on, and the first girl I ever dated.

I've [20M] been dating a girl [20F] I really like her, and she seems to like me back. She's the second girl I've ever had a real crush on, and she's the second girl I've dated.

I'll be seeing her again relatively soon, but I won't see her again in person for a while, so I have plenty of time to think about this. Would it be a bad idea to open up to her?

224,vulnerability,sex,A guy I've started dating confessed that he likes crossdressing. He was embarrassed and shy to tell me about it. What can I do to help ease him into being comfortable with it?

The history: We met on OKCupid and have been talking for a few months. I've met him twice, so far. This all happened last night, and I'm still reeling from it. I'd gone to his house, and we were having drinks and talking. The conversation drifted to sex, and he started sharing some things he's into. The first few were a little vanilla, then he shared that he tried crossdressing a few weeks ago. I was instantly intrigued. I started asking him questions to understand. He seemed shy about it all but I think he was relieved to share. I've always been a very open and accepting person, and he said that he's trying to be more open with people. Conversation about it went on until I said, ""I'd like to see that sometime."" I was really surprised when he offered to show me what he bought. I don't think I'd ever been so excited in my life. He got changed and came back in lingerie, stockings, and a silk robe. Long story short, we got it on, and it was *amazing*. So to the point of my post: while he was initially showing me, he said, ""I'm really embarrassed."" I understand that revealing something like that could cause a lot of anxiety and make someone feel very vulnerable. Also, he is 6'5"" and very athletically built. He expressed disappointment that he has such a masculine body, but he isn't trans nor does he want to transition. I told him that I thought he was gorgeous, all dressed up, and that I actually liked the difference between his masculine body and the feminine clothing. I didn't say this, but his vulnerability really struck me and touched my heart, as well. So, I'm asking for advice, anecdotes, or experiences of your own you'd like to share, about making him feel more comfortable in crossdressing. He seems to be really into it, but I could tell he was shy and anxious. Do you think what I've said already was good? I want to make sure that I'm sensitive enough, because I really like him! We mesh quite well, and I find this really damn hot! **TL;DR: Guy discovered he likes crossdressing. I'm totally into it. He was very shy about it. How can I help him be more comfortable?** **EDIT:** Thanks everyone for your responses! I absolutely did not expect this to blow up, and I'm not sure if I have the time to respond to everyone but please know I really, truly appreciate everything you're sharing. **If you're currently struggling**, I hope this gives you courage and hope that one day you'll be accepted! You all have taught me a lot and helped me consider facets I didn't even think of. Thank you so much!"
225,vulnerability,sex,Having difficulty being vulnerable,5,6sds9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/6sds9f/having_difficulty_being_vulnerable/,2017-08-09 00:20:56,"Super long so thanks for reading. I [21M] have been with my girlfriend [22F] for almost 2 years now. The other night we were having a conversation about sharing our feelings and she made a mention about how I don't share as much as I used to. She's right, when we first met I shared every single thought that came to mind. In some cases that led to great conversation and in others it led to a problem. But lately I've felt like I've had a hard time being vulnerable. We're currently at distance right now and will be for the next couple weeks. As I've tried to work through this issue, I've been thinking about the possible causes. And I keep coming back to our lack of physical and emotional intimacy. To me, once the physical side of our relationship ended I felt as though there was a distinct disparity in emotional connection. Now I do want to mention we have been at distance for 2 months, but it's been nearly a year since the physical side of our relationship existed with any sort of regularity or frequency. When we were together in the same place, our sex life was down to if I'm lucky once a month. This naturally had caused tons of stress on us. We were so busy with school and finding jobs for the latter part of that year that anybody could have a hard time focusing on sex. However, even through that I recognized that I had needs and if she's reasonable it's possible she might too and pursued it if the time was right to no avail. Our shortcomings in our sexual life presented a lot problems in the way we function. Never was sex I suppose a staple of our relationship. But it was the absolute lack of it that made me start to wonder and have questions about things. As well as notice parts of her behavior. In short I realized that while she maybe on an interest level attracted to my personality, she is in no way physically/sexually attracted to me. In the beginning I had a bit of an issue with premature ejaculation. I came early the first 2 times we had sex. I had been used to having it daily if not multiple times a week for about a year so the months between that and us starting took a toll. I've gotten somewhat of a handle on it but it's just forced us into a negative cycle. For her the first time having sex after a while (a month) usually hurts since she isn't used to it. And for me, if I go a month between times there's a higher likelihood I'll finish quickly as I have no rhythm to it and the feeling might as well be brand new. On top of that she even moves her body to make me finish as fast as possible so neither of us really get to feel or enjoy the sex. This has all led me to realize that for the past year and some change. She's been pity fucking me instead of working with me to improve our sex life. I nearly had to force her to talk to me about what she likes in bed. And once I knew what she liked, she did everything possible to just make me finish quickly so I couldn't even try. For example, she'll touch me until I'm about to finish then make me put it in so I'll just finish in a few strokes. I think she thought I didn't know it was pity sex because she seemed a bit taken aback when I asked her if that's what she was doing to me. The problem is, I don't want pity sex. A pity fuck is worse than none at all. And here's where it relates to my vulnerability. I don't need the sex at the end of the day. I have a fleslight. If she really doesn't wanna fuck me then fine, she can go on being sexless until she finds a way to meet her needs. I have to meet all of mine in that category and she has no interest in helping. But I've felt like an entire part of me, the part that likes the deep emotional connection formed from having loving, positive, and exciting sex with a partner has been shut down. A whole facet of my ability to be vulnerable has been told I'm not longer valid. I have such a little sex drive now. She wants me to be vulnerable every day and talk about issues relating to our future when because of this I don't always feel safe to talk about certain things because of how negatively this was handled. I know it may sound silly. And I want to clarify, I don't want sex in exchange for talking about my feelings. I have just felt so invalidated and hurt on a large front of my emotional identity that I don't know how to really open up safely the way she wants me to. When we've talked about this it always comes to her saying that I just want to get laid, when in actuality I don't want it anymore. I just want to feel I don't know, safe, wanted, cared for, validated. TL;DR: Lack of sex has shut down a part of our emotional connection. More so in the sense that I was forced to meet all my own needs and has made my needs in any regard feel invalidated. And I don't know how to move forward and give her the emotional depth she wants while feeling hurt."
226,vulnerability,sex,How do my partner [M24] and I [F24] get comfortable with putting things up our butts?,3,6u3ypx,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/6u3ypx/how_do_my_partner_m24_and_i_f24_get_comfortable/,2017-08-17 04:17:29,"This is a two part question, but any information or advice would be much appreciated. :) So I've been a long-time lurker of this subreddit for awhile now, and it has been AMAZING for our sex life. We've been essentially experiencing a sexual renaissance, and I have the people in this great community to thank for it! I'd very much like to keep the exploration going, but I have a few concerns about anal play. I want to work up to him having full on anal sex with me (his penis in my ass). And for right now, he's interested in fingers, butt plugs, and smaller toys going near him. I don't know if pegging is ever on the horizon, but I'd be more than willing to oblige if he's ever interested. However, we are both novices in this regard, and I think we both have some psychological blocks to overcome. As for me, I have tried anal sex ONCE and it was somewhat traumatizing. I was 16 and and how it went down was pretty much everything they say NOT to do with anal. My ex and I were in the shower, and it was very spontaneous (no preparation besides us washing ourselves in the shower). No build up with fingers, butt plugs, toys, NOTHING. And we never tried anything before, so it was just immediately a dick in my ass. No lube. Stupidly, I didn't even tell my partner to stop even though it hurt so bad, because I thought it would get better. NOPE. Here's the thing, I am fine with chalking up that experience as a lack of preparation, communication, education, and experience. I am definitely more educated about how to prepare for anal now (thankfully). However, I still can't get over the idea that it's going to hurt really badly. My ex had a below average to average sized penis. My partner on the other hand is about 7.5 inches and girthy as fuck, and needless to say I'm terrified. His dick feels incredible in my pussy (and mouth ;) ) but I'm scared that anal is going to hurt really badly. It's something I really want to try again. In five years, my partner hasn't even asked or seemed all that interested in anal until I expressed interest. He's concerned he will hurt me too. Recently, I also brought up that I was interested in playing with him in this regard. He was enthusiastic but a little hesitant as well. This weekend, I fingered and licked the outside of his asshole and even put a pinky in! WOO! As someone who is recovering from some obsessive-compulsive anxiety in regards to contamination and germs, this was a HUGE deal for me in that regard. My partner said he enjoyed the experience, but also seemed somewhat uncomfortable. I constantly checked in with him, to make sure everything was okay, and I think we did a good job communicating. I think the position of me licking him felt very vulnerable, and he's not used to being penetrated. When I put my pinky in him, he said he liked it but said he ""freaked out a bit"" and asked me to take it out. He said that it's ""something to get used to,"" but that he wants to try it again. I even saw him researching it a bit online. Anyway, the bottom line is that we both have certain psychological blocks that we need to overcome in order to really explore this. For me, the size of his dick is intimidating, and I'm afraid it will hurt really badly again. For him, I think he feels vulnerable. He's very secure in his masculinity, but I think the idea of being penetrated is a bit daunting. I would appreciate any advice about how each one of us can help overcome our psychological blocks. TLDR: How do I overcome my fear about my boyfriend's big dick hurting me during anal and my fear of anal in general? How can I help my boyfriend overcome the vulnerability of being penetrated?"

My wife of 5 years was my first sexual partner. On the whole I have little to complain about, and I've had a lot of lovely firsts with her. That being said, she's pretty clear about her dislike for sucking dick and being unskilled in doing so. Now I love blowjobs. The visual of it, the vulnerability, the flexibility of a woman's mouth are something I really enjoy. That, and I've heard many a tale of other fellas having these incredible, mind-blowing experiences receiving them. I've been nudging her about a willingness to provide or even just to practice giving them, but only ever gotten cold/passive-aggresive/sarcastic responses. So what I'm driving toward here is for those who have received (or given) those amazing BJs I keep hearing about, is it something you think you could ever give up? It's something important to me, but I suspect I'm not likely to make much headway with her so I'm trying to judge whether it's worth it.

I [M18] have a very high libido. I would love to make love to my girlfriend [F18] of two years daily. Last year, in 2016, her libido seemed to me nearly as high as mine, but within 2017 her libido has dropped to what I would consider ""extremely low."" I have explained to her that my libido is high, but it's paired with this deep and unexplainable desire for her. I don't just want sex because my body wants it, I want to really make passionate love to her because it feels like the way to share that feeling with her. And there's something about exploring sex with her that I desire. Her reply was that she understands my sex drive isn't me thinking with my dick but is backed by passion and desire and that she doesn't want me to think she isn't passionate for me because she is, her body just isn't keeping up with it. She explained that she doesn't feel as if she should have to force herself to be ""in the mood"" but that she should just be able to wait until it feels right for her (which I completely understand). I asked her what the potential cause for this dramatic decrease of sex drive and she landed on a few ""possibilities."" Paranoia of pregnancy (although she religiously takes her BC and makes me wear a condom 90% of the time, which in turn makes it much harder for me to finish making the experience a bit....), memories of a time a parent walked in on us 8 months ago which was a bit traumatic for her, more thought over the last year of an experience of sexual assault in her past, and maybe her birth control messing with her hormones. None of these were sure answers but more of a brainstorm of what could be up. I suggested maybe attempting to make herself get into it once, and see if it changes anything. This was met with the response of ""I shouldn't feel like I need to change or that I should need to force myself to be in the mood."" At this point, we have sex about once a month with maybe a one or two days of light fooling around thrown in. Up until now, I have been accepting and have just jacked off a LOT. But I can't take it anymore. I want to share the experience with her so badly. As pathetic as it sounds, last night I tried to jack off and I just started crying. I hated it. Everything I saw made me think of my desperation to be with her. The experience just wasn't fulfilling in the slightest. This is really starting to take it's toll. I'm very sexually frustrated today. I attempt to make small moves every other day(ish) to test the waters, see if she's into it. All of which get shot down. I am just starting to feel depressed over the whole thing. Sex is so important to me, not because I just want to get off, but it bring an intense emotional vulnerability and a strong sense of validation that I need and desire. Without them I start to feel wary about how she really feels about me, even though she tells me I shouldn't be taking it personally. I find myself getting more jealous about other guys she talks to, something I never used to be afraid of. I touch her sensually and I get told off (touch is one of my main love languages). I just want to make love to her, hold her naked body close to mine, SOMETHING vulnerable. Something sensual. I'm craving it. A friend suggested I break up with her. This is not a solution I am a fan of as we have been in a relationship for 2 years and, despite a few recent events, things seem to be going well. I'd even say that our relationship is on an up swing. I should mention that she leaves Friday (tomorrow) and I won't see her for a month. I expressed desperately wanting to have sex before she leaves because I think it's really important, but she's also just recovering from being fairly sick. I'm appreciative of any help you all can lend. Thank you for listening."

Like they like it because it makes the girl submit more and makes her more vulnerable. My question is, do men generally like it because of the hesitation in girls about it? Or do you guys like it if a girl is really into it as well? I really enjoy anal (sometimes more than PIV) and I frequently request it, it's pretty clear that I've done it before. Does that take away from the appeal? Thanks! UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your thoughtful responses. What most of you said is very reassuring and I am glad that he general consensus is different than what I had thought. The resounding answer here is that submissiveness plays little/no part of anal and it's good because it feels good or is taboo. I have received QUITE A FEW PMs saying that the hesitance and vulnerability is the turn on, but I suspect those men were afraid to comment publicly and get downvoted.

I often focus more on what happens right after the rape. I want to be broken and vulnerable, and call my boyfriend crying telling me he needs to pick me up from somewhere. There are many, many 'afterwards' scenarios that I think about, ranging from hiding it to going to the hospital right away. I think my fixation focuses more on the vulnerability than the actual act. When I think about it as objectively as possible, most of my fantasies involve feeling hurt and being comforted, dealing with what's happened. It ranges from just minor injuries and trauma to being completely bedridden with severe injuries, with my boyfriend waiting at my bedside. To be clear, **I know that rape is awful in all forms.** I'm not trying to romanticize or justify any sort of non-consensual act. I know that this is wrong, and I do not want to feel like this. I don't know why I think about this so much. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm worried about letting this horrible thing happen to me, just because I fantasize about it. I'm worried about what would happen if I told my boyfriend about it, or that I will feel like this for the rest of my life. I want this to stop, but I don't want to let my boyfriend know about it.

I'm 20 and he's the first time i've had consistent sex with one person, and also the first person i've actually been in a relationship when we had sex. How do you let someone in? It's really hard for me to make eye contact with him. I still like the sex we have but it doesn't feel too different from when we were just hooking up. A lot of people talk about how much more meaningful sex is when you're involved with the other person.

Any fantasies where I'm asked to alter my voice to be higher(even higher than the false one I put on out of habit), just depress me because I can't even achieve that normally. Fantasies just make me feel inadequate and I recognize it shouldn't be this way but for all intents and purposes, it stands to reason that my SO would prefer a woman that naturally aligns with his fantasies as opposed to someone he just likes emotionally with various physical and physiological aspects that leave much to be desired. I think this is true of all fantasies - people are just settling because what they actually desire is unobtainable in one way or the other. Sexuality is a big part of relationships and I've always felt that the idea that fantasies are 'just for fun' to be naive and a lie to save face. Why would anyone wish to create a sexual fantasy with an idea that was LESS desirable? The fantasies serve to make the subject more appealing. Some fantasies don't really have that same idea - such as job fantasies because they don't alter much and that fantasy is typically about the idea of exerting power over the employed (capitalism? Lol) and a fetish for the pornified attire. Schoolgirl fantasies seem different to me because, perhaps, I can picture the typical schoolgirl and recognize we don't have anything in common. Moreover, the schoolgirl uniform communicates innocence, youth, and vulnerability. Innocence I clearly do not have, youth that is rapidly fleeting, and vulnerability that is actually not a problem but is just 1/3 of the pie. The idea of the schoolgirl, with older men, is also that it is taboo and that idea attracts. I am just ranting at this point. I guess I just would like a frank discussion on fantasies or for someone to counter any points I have made as I can't find a flaw. I think I just generally have a lot of personal issues psychologically about my physical appearance but, at the same time, I feel sensible."

I was with a girl for 4.5 years, and things were great. However, she had a lot going on in her life that was out of either of our controls, and she asked for a break. This eventually led to a break up. Soon after the breakup, she asked to speak to me about something. I was generally confused by the whole breakup honestly so I went. She told me she had slept with another guy who took advantage of her vulnerability but also recognized her responsibility. She said it was an awful experience. Flash forward a few months to a few days ago, and I get a message from her. It basically said that she had been with a few guys but nothing felt right and she had to think of me to be in the mood even.. I have been with a couple of girls and I have not been able to maintain a quality erection during sex. When I got the message, my feelings for the girl resurfaced, and honestly I'm not sure they were ever gone. We spent a lot of time together, and were considering trying again. We both explained we had been with other people because it felt necessary to know. Things got pretty heated, and we started fooling around.. I went down on her and had a crazy erection the whole time, but as soon as I went To grab a condom, I think I must've implicitly thought of the other guys who had made that same walk because I lost all hardness. I have a healthy diet, I'm into competitive lifting, and I've never had any self confidence issues. I also truly do love this girl and have loved the time we've been together, but I'm not sure how to proceed if I can't get it through my head that she slept with others. Tl;dr : broke up, got back together, got psyched out potentially thinking of her other sexual partners and lost erection. Thanks for any help/advice. "
236,vulnerability,sex,"Confused, frustrated, and uncertain as to how to fill the [sexual void] in my life.",2,5af2my,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5af2my/confused_frustrated_and_uncertain_as_to_how_to/,2016-11-01 08:19:30,"If you happen to look at my recent post history on reddit you'll see that I have a lot that I've been going through in the past few months. I know I'm getting into some really personal stuff for me, but I honestly don't have anyone that I could talk to about everything that I'm going through. I just want to figure myself out without screwing up my life entirely. I'm going through a divorce and am on the post side of leaving the Mormon church. I've always felt very sexual but my religion and the marriage suppressed my sexuality. And yes, even though I was married and the sex was great for a time, I quickly found my wife wasn't that sexual and whatever sex we did have wasn't all that fulfilling. Now that I don't have a religion making me feel guilty for wanting to be sexual and a single life in which I can freely explore, I'm left feeling overwhelmed and utterly confused at how to go about all of this. I'm stuck between a strong desire to have causal sex with whomever just for the heck of it and my more level headed self which says I should take the time to emotionally bond with someone first. Then there's the primal urge to just jerk it out to some NSFW content, but I honestly don't like po/rn. I feel like it's degrading to men and women, bypasses working with someone for emotional and physical intimacy, and I'd rather save the feelings for when I'm actually with someone. But ironically some fappy time just saved me from making probably a really dumb decision. I've been using tinder lately to try and get back into the game and agreed to hook up with some girl on there. Given the pent up sexual frustration I've been going through, I was totally intending to go through with it. But once I relieved myself I took a second look at the profile of the girl and realized I wasn't interested in her at all except for her willingness for sex. This battling thought process ensued: Horny psyche: Just do it! Fuck all the women! Emotional psyche: Hold up, you still have standards dude. Horny psyche: Fuck that! I just wanna get laid and have copious amounts of copulation! Emotional psyche: That's a quick way to gain every STI under the rainbow. Horny psyche: Think of how good it will feel! Don't you want to be someone again? Don't you want to feel that intimate release? Emotional psyche: Will it really feel that good? Maybe for a moment but afterwards you'll be straight back to that empty feeling. If you sleep with just anyone you're going to have some regrets from sharing that vulnerability with a stranger. It's a whirlpool of strong emotions. That and the void left in my life from the divorce has left me scrambling to fill it but not sure how to. I just feel so confused about to go about how to figure out my sexuality (as in frequency and under which circumstances. I already know I'm straight homosexuality has never been an interest) and how to do so in an emotionally healthy manner. I'm also terrified about getting an STI and don't know the protocol for avoiding them in regards to the new sexual life I'm entering into. Any, and I mean any, input would be helpful. I just feel so confused, and frustrated, and uncertain about who I am and how to move forward in this aspect of my life. Edit: spelling and grammar. "
237,vulnerability,sex,I think my partner doesn't want to have sex because he can't make me orgasm (???) [orgasm trouble] [communication/opening up] [Low sexual desire],2,5bcsk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5bcsk3/i_think_my_partner_doesnt_want_to_have_sex/,2016-11-06 10:15:52,"Hi all! [note: English is not my first language, please disregard the language mistakes! Thanks] [other note: my partner identifies as a cisgender hetero male; I have boobs and a v*gina haha - I'm censoring since I don't know if I'm allowed to use this world - first reddit post ftw] This post is divided in three sections: 1. General infos on my relationship 2. General infos on sex life issues 3. Specific details on the main subject/new perspective on the issue TL;DR at the end of the post. About my relationship: My partner and I have been together for a little over 5 years. I'm in my mid-twenties and he's 10 years older than me. We don't live together and we see each other between 2 to 5 times a week. We are very attached to one an other although he has some (romantic - amongst others) intimacy issues. He says he can't be ""all in"" if he thinks there is a possibility that the relationship isn't going to last on a long-term level. Which is kind of unrealistic since virtually no relationship is guaranteed to last ""forever"", even the seemingly perfect ones. He's extremely sensitive but he passes as cold and distant: whenever he feels vulnerable, he'll withdraw into himself and distance himself from the person(s) he associate with his problematic emotions. It took me 4 years to realize that he's not a coldhearted asshat but that on the contrary, he's as sensitive or even more sensitive than I am (I'm the ""emotional"" and talkative person in this relationship). I have the tendency to ""become"" my emotions, to let my feelings overpower me (the Hulk style, without the turning green part); on the other hand, he rationalizes EVERYTHING (LITTERALY EVERY FRIGGIN DARN THING), starting with his emotions. He is a very secretive person and will get extremely defensive when I try to have conversations about relationship issues of any kind - especially when I try to talk about him or his actions/thoughts/emotions. Anyways, as you can imagine we've been having a lot of communication issues and have been accumulating a lot of tensions and unresolved issues. We've been struggling a lot lately and I thought we wouldn't make it; we're holding on and trying to work things through. Part of me knows this relationship is too hard for me to handle and that the best thing to do might be to let it go already - but I can't bring myself to leave him. Something very deep inside me screams not to let him go. He truly is a great human being, and I'm devastated that we can't ""speak the same language"" most of the time. We're doing a bit better but breaking up is still on the table. Some persistent tensions remain unresolved, sex being one of them. General sex life issues: I have a big libido. I could have sex every day if he were up for it. Except he's not. He's less than not. We had a pretty ""normal"" sex life when we started dating. We are a very good sexual match overall, I'm super into him, he's super into me. But after 6 months, things changed. He wouldn't ""be in the mood"" as often. He started turning me down. It started to feel like sex was a chore to him. We would still have sex, but less often. We started ""planning it"" instead of just having sex - after only 2 years and with no kids around (we still don't have kids, fyi). He was saying that it wasn't about me, that he'd rather spend some quality time with me (watch a movie, cook, have dinner, etc.) than have sex. It hurt me bad. Yes, part of it was (and still is) that I need to get some. But his lack of sexual interest in me also (and mainly) made/makes me feel rejected, like he doesn't want to ""let me in"" (.. well I guess I'm the one doing the ""letting in"" if you know what I mean, wink wink. anyhow-) emotionally and physically. Like I wasn't/am not good enough for him (which is and still - is how I often generally feel in this relationship). My reaction would usually make him distance himself from sex even more. I'd pout, or get angry-sad, or grumpy, etc. We had fights about this. He felt pressured to have sex even though it wasn't my intention to make him feel this way. I'm very careful not to do this anymore, but I think this feeling sticks with him anyways. He knows that I'm unsatisfied. Elephant in the room type of thing. We now have sex more or less once every other month to twice/thrice a month. That's waaaay less than I'd like. It's driving me nuts. I release the tension on my own (i.e. I masturbate), but it's not enough to satisfy me. I miss the sexual part of having sex, but I miss making love too. I'm craving the physical and emotional connection. I miss his smell, the softness of his skin, that look in his eyes, how close we get. I miss him. (*starts crying*, lol.) A couple months ago, I decided that I'd try to understand him better instead of feeling sorry for myself. To look for a new angle. I think it's the best thing I could have done. And also the hardest thing I could have done. As I've said, he has a hard time being vulnerable, accepting his vulnerability, taking about it. He's to emotions what Donald Trump is to Mexico. And I'm Mexico. ""WE NEED TO BUILD SOME WALLS AND MEXICO IS GUNNA PAY FOR IT"". Hahaha I can't even. Jokes aside tho, holy crap, he's really hard to understand. For a while I thought he might be gray-ace (that he might fit within the asexuality spectrum), I then realized it was wrong of me to even consider this option since he doesn't identify as gray-ace - or if he does, he isn't ""out"" and I shouldn't have tried to out him. After that, I tried having a fun and light chat about masturbation and porn - fail. I'm generally very open about sexuality - mine or others'. I'm the kind of person who enjoys having extensive discussions about sex with their partner. But he's extremely embarrassed to discuss these things, which in turn makes me super awkward. The only thing I learned was that he masturbates a couple of times a week and that he's into mainstream kind of porn. I don't know if it's true or not, but I decided to take his word for it. Main issue: And now, here I am, today. I just realized he might be distancing himself from sex because he feels self-conscious that he can't make me orgasm. Mind blown. This is so obvious that I can't believe I haven't considered it before. It hadn't even crossed my mind, although there have been a lot of clues throughout the years: 1- he relentlessly tried to make me orgasm since we started having sex 5 years ago, with little to no results, until this year; 2- even if I've been able to climax before/during/after sex this year it's usually very stressful AND IT TAKES ME SOOO LONG to get there. Mainly because I know he *really* wants me to orgasm since he associates me having an orgasm to me having better sex than when I don't orgasm and feel as satisfied as when I masturbate (he really wants to please me); 3- he knows I can cum within 2-5 minutes when I'm on my own and have intense, multiple orgasms; 4- we've had countless ""post-fail-orgasm-sex-talk"" (after we had sex and he tried REALLY hard to make me cum but ""failed""); 5- he has said in the past that sometimes he didn't feel like having sex because it was a lot of work; Etc. So, I'm starting to consider that he might not want to have sex with me because he feels like a failure, that he's not good enough to make me orgasm, and whatnot. I've told him multiple times that all I want is to have meaningful, stressless sex with him, that I want the both of us to have a good time. Wait... now that I think about it there have also been times when I've been disappointed and sad not to have reached orgasm when we have sex and told him about it (not in an accusatory way, just in a ""I feel like I'm broken and I'm sad"" way - this sh*t has been hard on me too). I had forgotten about it but we had such a conversation recently. I think I hadn't considered that he doesn't want to have sex anymore because he rationalizes his feelings every time we discuss this. He'll say that it makes him feel bad but he centers the conversation on how hard he tries and how much it sucks that his efforts aren't leading to results. Which in turn makes me feel like sh*t, which makes me feel pressured to cum when we have sex, which keeps me from climaxing, which makes him feel bad, which makes me feel bad, which leads to another uncomfortable discussion, etc. We've been stuck in that cycle for a long time. I'd really like to have a empathetic, compassionate, accepting and open conversation with him now that I realize I got it all wrong and that he might be avoiding sex and preferring masturbation (easy, fast and no disappointment) because he feels self-conscious about this and not because he's insensitive, not attracted to me, cold and distant. I might be mistaking again and he might have an other (or some other) reason(s) to avoid sex; but I had a lightbulb moment today, it just makes so much sense and I'm 95% sure that I've finally started to understand him (I really hope I'm not wrong you guys, I'm so tired of not understanding/spending hours feeling like I'm a failure/not good enough for him). Sooo: I would really like to have some advice and opinions on the situation and how to bring this up with him. I think I could do okay on my own, but if he indeed has been avoiding sex all this time because he's been feeling like a failure I REALLY want to make him understand how sorry I am that I haven't understood this sooner, that I just want to understand and for us to work things through together, that it's okay to feel like he feels but that there's no shame in not being able to make me cum; I'd also want the both of us to see the situation in a new light, to have some healthy alternatives in the future (note: I've been using a vibrator every once in a while, not super successful, but I'm going to buy a ""wand""; also, he doesn't enjoy giving me oral and he's conservative/p-in-v kind of guy, not sure if he's shy or just conservative). It would also be very helpful to hear from people who have been/are in a similar relationship (whatever role you played, whatever type of relationship you had/have, from people of any (all??) sexual/romantic identities). So yeah, that's pretty much it. I'll wrap this up since I think I've been yapping and rambling way too much but I can give more details if need be. Thanks for reading! TL;DR: My partner rarely wants to have sex, I thought there was something wrong with me/that he was being egocentric or whatnot, but I just realized it might be because he feels self-conscious about not being able to make me climax most of the time. I need advice on how to discuss this with him, especially since he's bad at having emotions (lol). [Edit: I was thinking of starting the discussion with a written message since I think he might need some time and space to process whatever I'll say]"

I've said no in the past as 'ouch' she's put a finger up there once and it really hurt. She was only using her spit as lube though so maybe that's why but it left me quite nervous about taking a dildo up my ass. She asked me again last week which I answered with a blunt no but she started getting really pissed at me saying that we never do anything she wants. She has a point, she has let me practice a lot of my fetishes out so I finally agreed. We've planned it for Wednesday night. Don't want to sound weak but I'm really scared about pain. I know it's supposed to feel good after a while cause of the prostate but I just can't imagine that thing feeling good in my ass. The thought of a dildo stretching my hole makes me feel a little ill. She's ordered me poppers to help me relax and we'll be doing foreplay like rimming, fingers so I'm hoping it won't be that bad. Also, the positions she wants to try are doggystyle and missionary which makes my feel really weird. Either being on my hands and knees with my ass exposed or on my back with my legs spread so she can look at me while I'll getting pounded. I don't like the vulnerability and submissiveness of it, it sounds really humiliating and I think that's a bigger issue than the pain. It's even worse when she's really into verbal. I've spoke to her about it and she said it'll be fine as she's done it with previous boyfriends and they've enjoyed it, she's assured me she knows what she's doing but I'm still quite uncomfortable with the submissiveness of it. I would back out but it's made her really happy and I can't do that to her. Guess I'm just looking for honest advice and/or reassurance. Does it hurt? Does it actually feel good? Was it humiliating? Did you feel a loss of masculinity? Etc I know it's sounds stupid but right now I'm not feeling too confident about this."

So, I am near constantly wondering about, even fantasizing about what it's like to be a woman, and especially having sex. The whole idea (or what I have learned or thought about it) of a woman's sexuality completely drives me wild. I think sex for a woman must be so insanely wonderful, so fulfilling in a way I can't fathom a man could ever really feel. I dream of being able to experience this firsthand, to know that vulnerability, that sense of giving that I associate with female sex. The thing is, I'm pretty damn sure I'm not bi or day. I'm a straight male, and have never felt any attraction to men. And neither do I feel like I'm ""in the wrong body"" or any of that transsexual sort of thing. Although I want to know what a female body feels like and all, I don't feel like my male body is not right for me, if that makes any sense. Can anyone relate? Does this sound completely freakish? Would you not, if given the chance, want to swap bodies with someone of the opposite sex for a day, a month, a year?"
240,vulnerability,sex,[Communication] Your Ideal Erotic Life,117,4zjsjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/4zjsjd/communication_your_ideal_erotic_life/,2016-08-26 03:44:32,"Hello Sexxit! I put together a questionnaire/tool for describing and sharing a description of your ideal erotic life. Its a way to help you think through your sexual desires by stepping outside the expectations put on you by society, your relationship(s), and/or your own preconceptions. It can be a helpful tool for getting to know yourself better or to share with a partner. Beyond just using it for yourself or with a partner, I thought people might also want to post their answers The exercise is simple at first glance. When thinking about your ideal sex life, write down a series of bullet points following the statement, I want to: These statements should all be tied to the activities and contexts that bring and heighten your overall sexual satisfaction. There are some rules for the bullet points, but before getting to that here is a short, partial example... I want to: * Have sexual intercourse 2-3 times per week with my sexual partner. * Feel comfortable masturbating in front of my partner because I enjoy the exhibitionism. * Sometimes watch my partners face when they orgasm because its a huge turn-on to see their pleasure. * Have a sexual partner who will initiate sex more often than I do. * Frequently have sexual encounters that begin with a massage because being physically relaxed enhances my arousal and eventual orgasm. * Include times where my partner whispers how much they love me over and over in my ear while we are having sex. * Feel comfortable suggesting new sexual activites to my partner. * Have a partner that pushes my sexual boundaries because the newness and creativity give me an erotic charge. * Engage in threesomes from time to time with my partner and another man with my partners enthusiastic consent. * Occasionally be spanked during sex and have my partner provide loving aftercare. * Have sexual secrets that I share with my partner because it gives me an erotic charge and makes me feel close to them. (For example, going out in public when neither of us are wearing underwear, but only we know.) * Have the sexual effect of what Im doing described to me by my partner because it makes me feel sexually desirable. (For example, saying When you kissed my neck and told me you loved me, it immediately got me hard. * Etc. While these may be helpful to give an idea for the results, it is most important for you to come up with what is true for you. Here are the rules on the structure of the answers that will help guide you, along with some Do and Dont examples to help you get started. * No reference to a current or past sexual partner is allowed, your answers are purely about what you desire. As much as possible, try to start from a clean slate with no reference to a specific individual or circumstance. * Never use a partners name, you, or we in an answer. * Use I, me, and my liberally. * Use my partner or the equivalent to describe others. * Dont: I want to make my wife happy. * Do: I want opportunities to watch my partner orgasm because their pleasure turns me on. Only positive answers are allowed. This is a list of things you positively want, not things you want to avoid. Make no mistake, sexual boundaries are important! However, this exercise is about helping you to define and communicate your wants to yourself and your partner(s), not your dont wants. * Dont: I want to stop having my sexual needs neglected. * Dont: I want to only perform oral sex once a year because I hate it. * Do: I want to have sexual experiences where I feel like I and my pleasure are the center of attention. Include things even if they are a common part of your sexual life now. This is a statement of your idealized erotic life, not a comparison to your existing life or a list of changes. * Dont: I want to keep doing what we do now. * Do: I want to have sex 2-3 times per week. (i.e. state it even if its what you do now.) Only concrete answers are allowed. No comparisons vs. current or past relationships. * Dont: I want to have sex less often than we do now. * Do: I want to have sex 1 to 2 times per week. Your answers can, and should, be idealized. * Do: I want to occasionally have days where I tease my partner by wearing revealing lingerie all day. (If true, you should still state something like this even if you live with others and it would be impractical.) Your answers should never, ever be what you think the right answer should be. It doesnt matter if youre adding or subtracting an item because you think your current partner expects (or condemns) it, society glorifies it, or you believe you should or shouldnt be aroused by it due to your own self-image. (e.g. because good girls dont like that sort of thing) * Dont: I want to occasionally have days where I tease my partner by wearing revealing lingerie all day. (Dont include this if you actually dont like it, but you plan to share lists and your partner would like to see it there.) * Do: I want to occasionally spend a day pressing all of my partners erotic buttons because I love to see them aroused and the sexual power makes me feel erotically charged. (On the other hand, this should be included if it would be something you actively enjoy, not something merely expected of you.) * Dont: Leave off something you find erotic/arousing because you feel you shouldnt or it isnt accepted. * Do: I want to incorporate the erotic charge I get from the thought of being naked in public into my sex life. You can be broad (I want to feel sexually desired.) or narrow (I want to have a partner who licks my inner thigh.). However, especially when being broad, it can be helpful to include an example to focus your thinking and/or make it clearer. Include specifics of your feelings in cases where the underlying eroticism can be ambiguous. * Dont: I want to be naked around my partner. * Do: I want to be naked around my partner because it makes it makes me desired and sexually powerful to see their arousal. * Do: I want to be naked around my partner because I eroticize the vulnerability I feel when Im naked and they are clothed. * To a reader or your partner (or, more importantly, to yourself if you arent being introspective), just stating the first could mask the underlying eroticism that the final two explain. There is no limit to how long your list can be and longer is definitely better. However, it should never be under 10 items long. If you find your list is less than that, you may be avoiding thinking very deeply about your own desires or you may be putting items on the list that are much too broad. * Dont: I want to be sexually fulfilled. * Do: A long list of things that describe what being sexually fulfilled looks like for you. Review your list for completeness. Try to think about any activities, desires, or fantasies that arent included on the list as it stands. If youre doing this for real, it can help to take a few days to fully consider your answers. (Though I assume any responses people feel like posting here would be quicker.) Its helpful to write down some answers quickly, even if they dont conform to the rules above. Then, refine your answers according to the guidance above. Once you start thinking about it in these terms, new items and refinements to existing answers will likely come to you. Your goal is to have as complete a mapping of your ideal erotic life as possible. A useful exercise is to think of an anonymous redditor reading your list. Would they really, really know the sexual you after reading it? If you are sharing with a partner, you should both fully complete your lists prior to sharing. A good method for sharing them can be for you to exchange lists, read your partners quickly, then go back and forth discussing each bullet point on each others lists. After you discuss, you should plan to revisit the discussion after a day or two. In many cases, the initial discussion will trigger insights or questions over time. By setting aside a planned later time to revisit, you give each other permission to ask questions or continue the discussion. If you are doing this for purely yourself, allow the experience to really dig into what you find erotic and what you want from your sexual life. Revisit what you wrote every six months to a year in order to add or edit since we all grow and change erotically. When doing this with a partner, this is a powerful tool for driving deep intimacy in your relationship. By giving a structured way to define and share your sexual desires and dreams, it can give you a powerful way to understand your partner, explore areas of shared eroticism, and give each other ideas for desired erotic experiences. Remember to not be judgmental! Be very sincere in your questions and hyper-detailed in your explanations! Enjoy!"
241,vulnerability,sex,"I am turned on by the thought of my girlfriend chopping her hair off and wearing wigs, because it relates to [power dynamics], but I feel like that's a wrong reason to be turned on. Should I tell her?",1,51tcdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/51tcdg/i_am_turned_on_by_the_thought_of_my_girlfriend/,2016-09-09 06:12:43,"So me and my girlfriend have a pretty healthy sex life and we're both switches. We love taking turns being more dominant or submissive and like to incorporate various kinks or just ways about us that can play into that dynamic. It may be worth noting that my girlfriend is black, and thus has all the issues that go along with maintaining black her. She has very pretty relaxed, shoulder length hair, and I love it that way, but lately she's been saying she wants to do something different and has even expressed chopping her hair off and wearing wigs so she doesn't have to deal with it! Initially I was not happy about this. I realize it's her choice but my personal preferences is longer hair. However, the more I thought about it I actually became turned on at the thought of her doing this. For one, I do love all sorts of hairstyles and it would be exciting for her to try different wigs, but what really turns me on is how this relates to power dynamics. Like, a buzz cut on a woman is just not conventionally attractive, but it becomes attractive to me because it's unconventional. It also makes a woman vulnerable in my mind. I like the idea of her wearing a wig in public and putting on a ""front,"" but I know her ""secret"" and we she really looks like without it. I'm turned on by her not being afraid to be vulnerable around me and only revealing her real look to me. Maybe that makes sense, I don't know, but in this sense I'm turned on by having that power over her. That being said, I'm not sure I should tell her this. Honestly I like her hair the way it is now, and I'm not a fan of the chopped look. But when I think of it in terms of power dynamics and vulnerability, I am very turned on. Really, I just feel like this is a very out there kink and I want to open a discussion on it. What are your thoughts?"
242,vulnerability,sex,[Psychology] [Theory] Symbolism of Stimulation,10,4wa76t,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/4wa76t/psychology_theory_symbolism_of_stimulation/,2016-08-05 22:43:59,"#Context: I was explaining to my partner that, of all the sexual acts we do together, I feel most intimate when she gives me a handjob. This caught her by surprise; surely foreplay (especially as vanilla as a handjob) was simply a gateway into into any number of far more personal acts. Your first handjob is non-committal, after all, when compared to something like a first kiss or a loss of virginity; totally forgettable. I spent some time reflecting on this, and wanted to document my analysis. Being less than sober, I've opted to share my thoughts with all of you, throwaway be damned. #Abstract: What this essentially comes down to is that, at least in my head, certain acts are symbolic. In the same way that a certain glance can imply approval or apprehension, certain body language can imply invitation or rejection, so do the acts have meaning beyond what they accomplish in a metaphorical sense. All you pragmatics will probably have no use for this analysis, but those of you who believe that association (in the psychological sense) has a significant impact on our experience will hopefully glean value. This approach addresses one portion of what could perhaps be developed into an entire art form, using a sexual encounter as the medium, with every movement and moment involving the same graceful intent on the participants' part as that of a skillful author, weaving metaphor and depth into his characters. While I'm sure there are many nuances from position, tone, timing, etc, I believe none of these are such essential details as the body parts involved in any given sexual act, which define the fundamental relationship between the two partners at any given time. Without further ado: # Major Stimulators: Any part, involved properly, can be or stimulate an erogenous zone. The neck, the feet, the ear, or even the humble armpit. These equally valid zones are outside of the scope of this post. Instead, I intend to describe the three (arguably) most common points of contact: The genitals, the mouth, and the hands. **The Genitalia** How could I ever do justice to the human genitalia? So long as /r/sex (and perhaps even humanity) exists, it will never sufficiently unravel the mystery that begins here and ends with every single human endeavor. The genitalia are everything, symbolically speaking. At the core of our bodies, they require full-body interaction to use properly. Strangely apt, when we consider that the genitals have always symbolized the part of a person most difficult to control. They are the source of our lust, a primitive and fundamental part that nonetheless impacts our decisions in a way that cannot be overstated. The genitals are delicate, in every sense of the word. Of the most sensitive body parts (which, interestingly, my next two subjects will be the primary competitors), the genitalia have the most distinct and dramatic dichotomy. There are only three ways to touch the genitals: * Sexually, as is our interest here * Aggressively, due to their vulnerability * Professionally, in the sense of a doctor whose great skill allows them to tread the line between the two above Society has rarely allowed for 'friendly' touching of the genitals. One cannot 'sympathetically' touch the genitals (not to be confused with sexually touching the genitals *out of* sympathy), in the same sense that one would rest a sympathetic hand on another's shoulder. The genitals are inclined to receive pleasure in every sexual circumstance. They cannot even deliver pleasure without receiving it at the same time. They are us at our most petty, incorrigible, helpless, but genuinely innocent. It has no pretenses, no uncertainties, no faade. Penetrative sex, then, is nothing more than two lustful creatures coming together for mutual satisfaction. This isn't to disparage it in any way. It is simple, mindless indulgence, to which there is no equal for sheer sensation. **The Mouth** In contrast to the genitals, we'll begin to see nuance with the mouth. Like the genitals, the mouth is certainly capable of receiving pleasure, though to a far lesser extent. A good kiss can certainly make even the most aloof lover melt, but to do so properly requires a degree of finesse. The mouth is relatively sensitive to pain, especially considering how much effort it takes to be sexually pleasured, and how lackluster the impact of a half-hearted kiss are. The mouth is far less of a receiver than the genitals, but has the advantage of being able to give anywhere. A hickey to the neck, a tongue on the earlobe, a tickle of the toes -- all while asking so little in return. The mouth is our grace, the super-ego to the genitals id. A truly silver tongue could single-handedly carry its owner through a one-night-stand, from picking up to going down. The words of the mouth are the basis for the kind of love that simply doesn't exist to the genitals. Abstract, it can be carried over the phone, or transcribed into a smutty novel. No Disney movie shows a sex scene (yet), but everyone knows what happens after the two leads kiss. The words that come from our mouth, though, can also be objections, doubts, or conditions. These doubts are exemplified in the first time a pimpled teenager manages to mutter the words ""I love you"", voice quaking with uncertainty. Everyone has nights where one of your body parts isn't going to be a team player (I'm looking at you, whiskey-dick), but clever use of whatever you have left can leave everyone satisfied. All the mouth has to say is, ""I'm not in the mood"", though, and the encounter is done before it started. Or better yet, it can grind an encounter to a halt, simply by saying the wrong name. Good job, mouth -- now we're sleeping on the couch. The mouth is powerful, but also vulnerable. When you give a blowjob or go down, you're usually bringing your entire body into a vulnerable position just to make it happen. When your partner grinds into your face, you've temporarily lost your ability to object. At the same time, you receive very little from oral. Even if, like me, you get aroused from seeing your partner get excited, that a vicarious pleasure rather than one you actually feel in the mouth. Frankly, oral for too long can become quite tiring for the jaw or the tongue. And all this is why I hold a blowjob as more intimate than penetration. Symbolically speaking, when my SO gives me one, she's temporarily offering me everything from articulate pleasure to her ability to speak. And as we've established, she's giving all this up to what is symbolically the most fundamental and graceless part of me -- my genitals. With all respect to the BDSM fans out there, it's hard for me to see how the finest leather riding crop or expertly-applied rope can compare to a simple blowjob in terms of submission. My one caveat to the above is that I think blowjobs are just a bit more effective (in the above regards of submissive behavior) than going down, only because one is more effectively gagged with a dick. The teeth do provide a bit of mutually-assured destruction potential, but since a good blowjob doesn't involve any awareness of teeth, I've not spoken on that at all. [I've been typing this for about an hour now. It's 5am and I think I'm losing my cool. If this piece ends abruptly or begins to get graceless and unprofessional, I apologize in advance.] **The Hands** Lastly, the hands. Our most distinct anatomic characteristic. The plaque on the Pioneer spacecraft went so far as to [show](URL the anatomy of our hand, demonstrating the simply five-pronged tool upon which human civilization was built. The genitals kept us reproducing, the mouth brought us together, but that very same hand which slapped clumps of mud into bricks is now assembling interplanetary craft. The hand, then, is the pretentiousness, self-righteousness, and all other byproducts of our intellectual superiority. The hand forms and moves things as we see fit, directly translating our thoughts into reality (as opposed to the abstract words of the mouth). It is a user of objects. Like the mouth, the hand benefits from skill and dexterity. Unlike the mouth, it can be aloof and indifferent, like that of a medical professional, caring only about business whether or not the recipient happens to squirm through it all. The hand is literally always at arm's length, and can act in a large area without forcing the rest of the body into a compromising position. One cannot look down on someone while giving oral, but they can during a handjob. They can do it idly and indifferently, distracted by a million other things. The hand can be subtle and manipulative, too, like the caress a few fingertips that send a chill down your spine. It can make a domineering grip around the neck, or a condescending pat on the head. No matter where the hand is involved, it refuses to have its authority compromised. The hand is also sensitive, but caveats abound. Interacting with the genitalia, it feels no pleasure, except the vicarious pleasure of teasing another, and the anticipation of feeling your partner growing ready for more. The mouth can tease the hand by sucking on a finger, once again playing its forte of creating an abstract thought, but is otherwise generally ineffective. Of course, when the mouth does interact with the hand, it's creates a scenario of vulnerability thanks to the mouth's positioning, hardly a split second removed from the hand covering the mouth, able to readily pull away should it ever choose. What best acts on the hand is, in fact, another hand. Basic, aloof, filled with subtlety. Two hands clasped together could be a sign of simple friendship, support in a trying time, or first step in a budding romance, all depending on the context. As always, fingers gently tracing across the skin can create electricity. The hand can comfort and massage any part of the body, including another hand. So in summary, this is a body part that holds dominion of whatever is around it. Even in a gentle handjob, a vicious squeeze is only the difference of a few pounds of force. Unlike the mouth, which does its best to sheathe its weapons (teeth) until they're a long forgotten memory, the hand is itself a multifaceted tool of potential pleasure and pain. On the genitalia, it seduces the recipient in with a gentle touch, only to have control of a person's most vulnerable part, and the aforementioned symbol of their entirety. #Conclusion Nearly two hours in now. I hope this provides an interesting perspective. I have no doubt that my views and metaphors are either subjective, cherry-picked, or both, but I'll be satisfied if they introduce any form of discussion. I would be fascinated to see if, as mentioned earlier, sexual interaction could come to have a theory with methodology and schools of thought like that of Renaissance painters and Enlightenment philosophers. But if not, I'll just have to settle for mindless satisfaction. That usually gets me through."

So it isn't usually a problem. But for about a month now I've been dating someone and she's expressed that she wants to do it. I'm not one of those lesbians who just doesn't like to be touched at all, but the vulnerability of it is really daunting to me, and that's only compounded upon by the fact that I usually am really dominant. My first girlfriend used to do it, and as much as I trusted her it still felt uncomfortable sometimes. I did the smart thing and told her all this. Being a decent person, she said it was ok if I didn't want to. But I would like to see if I could get over it for her sake. I'm not sure what to do though. It's more of a vulnerability thing than a self consciousness thing- I don't think I look or smell bad down there, it's just that I know when receiving oral I involuntarily make noise, move around, etc and that freaks me out. If any other women (or men) have dealt with this, insight would be really appreciated. UPDATE: She is staying with me tonight and I let her have a go. Obviously I'm not over my trepidations, and I made her stop before I finished, but it was pretty good. It's something I wouldn't mind working on haha.

While staying at her house, she doesn't feel comfortable having sex (which I can understand) but it's been awhile since we've been intimate and thus, being the man I am, I'm a little pent up! Not being rude to her at all or anything against her, just longing for her very much! Anyways tonight while cuddling and watching a movie, I asked her to just scratch/rub me for a bit which she began to do happily with a sweet smile and kiss! A little backstory, I've only had one other girlfriend and she was emotionally abbusive and very controlling sexually. She would only give when she felt the need for a release and tended to ignore me otherwise. Call me stupid or not, for me sex was very emotional. And that attachment had control of me. It wasn't all about sex we spent time together but she certainly used sex to keep me around. (She had her own issues and I'm not mad at her. I certainly learned from it all). Anyways, due to this I was scared after our breakup to pursue another woman because I didn't want to be used and ignored. My fianc certainly takes care of me selflessly! All that to say, tonight, for almost an hour she touched me through my pants.. And it was incredibly emotional and intimate for me. The fact that she wasn't necesarrily getting anything out of it, and was doing it for me. The vulnerability of touching something to sensitive for so long. I had never felt so appreciated before. And we didn't even have sex/I didn't climax. Has anyone else had an experience like this that didn't involve and orgasm but involved touching like this? I have never felt so wanted and safe and taken care of. It was incredibly healing in my view of touching and intimacy."

Some insight here, my girlfriend is black and though I don't really know the details of black hair I do understand that it seems difficult to manage in any form, with the washing and styling, be it relaxed or natural, etc. So what attracts me to the wigs in one aspect is the obvious one: I love all kinds of hairstyles and changing appearances, but what really turns me on about it is a sense of vulnerability. Like when a girl wears a wig she's hiding a part of her look, and if she's exposed without one in public she may be perceived as being unattractive, but that's what turns me on about it. Or another example; my girlfriend putting up a front in public and changing her appearance with wigs, but when we get in private she exposes her natural self to me. My girlfriend does have very pretty, relaxed, shoulder length hair, and she said her hair was never that short when she wore wigs, so I think I could easily ask her to maybe try a few without changing her real hair, but it'd really be a turn on for me if she just chopped it and didn't worry about all that hair management and just wore wigs for awhile. Not sure how much I want to tell her though. Is this a common or uncommon fetish? Do you or anyone you know have it? How do you think it may go over? "

248,vulnerability,sex,A word about threesomes and relationships in general... [romantic relationships],11,4kutq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/4kutq6/a_word_about_threesomes_and_relationships_in/,2016-05-25 03:07:21,"Granted, I am not a professional or even really an expert, but I've had a few threesomes, as well as numerous relationships and this isn't particularly complicated. Asking about the effects of a threesome on relationships is a pretty common question but it needs to be approached with a bit of skepticism since questions like this are usually going to have mostly negative answers. Why? Because most people have multiple relationships before they get a handle on their own baggage and/or figure out how to actually conduct a healthy relationship. Consequently, most relationships are going to end no matter what happens, it's just more convenient for some people to blame individual causes and incidents. Any sexual adventure or exploration is going to put *some* pressure on a romantic relationship due to the increased emotional vulnerability. Sometimes this pressure can be good, other times bad. Threesomes in particular put a LOT of pressure on relationships because of the additional trust and potential jealousy. A healthy, mutually-equitable romantic relationship with a solid foundation of real trust, respect and honesty between two mature, consenting adults with solid communication skills and a realistic view of their own emotional needs and vulnerabilities has the best chance of surviving a threesome. Now think about how many relationships actually have all of those things, and how many more do not. Even a healthy relationship still faces the risk of a partner just being blind-sided by jealousy or other emotional fallout, and there's also a risk of the 3rd party breaking boundaries or otherwise causing toxic drama. For perspective, the same reasoning also applies to cohabitation: Most of the time it doesn't increase the apparent ""success"" of a relationship for the simple reason that we've been taught to consider ""successful relationships"" as ones that don't end and most relationships eventually do. Threesomes have a stigma of being poisonous to relationships but the reality is that most relationships simply lack the necessary foundations to survive the strain, in my opinion. That doesn't mean the negative answers themselves are worthless, it just means they need to be analyzed with a bit of scrutiny to understand why the relationship was unable to withstand the pressure, and hopefully avoid the same outcome. Have fun and be safe!"

Basically I've been in a relationship with my current girlfriend for a few months now and she seems to be the first person I've date who is really open minded sexually. So I have this kink that's related to r/abdl where I am sexually attracted to adult diapers. I'm not into age play or even using the diapers, but merely I'm attracted to the look and feel of them and it also ties into vulnerability and humiliation. I have worn them before and enjoyed it, but really I'm more into seeing who I'm attracted to in them. It's almost a thing to wear something like adult diapers is so conventionally unsexy that it is sexy to me. I've never shared this kink with anyone, and truthfully I could live without indulging in it, but due to my girlfriend's openness it's really made me feel the urge to test the waters with her. We've already talked about other things we enjoy. She told me she'd like to try roleplaying and anal, things I've never thought about or had an interest in but would be open to, and she's been open to the more tame stuff I like. But, there's just a mental block with the diaper kink. Essentially, all I'd want out of it is to have an opportunity to put her in a diaper, admire how she looks, and we get off in some way either by having sex with the diaper on or I use a vibrator on her. Or I could be the one wearing, or even just cuddling to watch a movie while she or both of us wear. And that's pretty much it. So, how open would you be to that if you had no idea what the fetish was? Would it be worth sharing. Are their weird kinks that you've shared with your SO in the past? How did it go?"

More of a candid realistic way. I've often fantasized about walking in on my man pleasing himself (maybe a vulnerability thing???) Back to my self-assessment. I always seek to find a mans ""darkest secrets"" pertaining to sex. I am wildly turned on by hearing about someone elses fetishes, and the more uncomfortable/shy they are with sharing the more it turns me on. Pretty much any and every fetish. Lactation may have never turned me on before, but if a guy tells me he fantasizes about nursing then its an automatic turn on. I even masturbate thinking of men divulging in THEIR fantasizes. I was once with a man who I found to be bi. I wasnt really crazy about the idea of him being with other men but if he would talk about it in the bedroom it would drive me crazy. I still occasionally masturbate thinking of him being with another man and I haven't seen this guy in years. To be honest I spend a lot of time on Reddit reading about other peoples secret desires. As a matter of fact, if you have posted your sexual interests on here before there is a very good chance you've turned me on (Sorry if this makes anyone uncomfortable!) Is there a name for this? I have tried looking into it without any luck. Maybe there is someone out there that trolls reddit as I do that has the same interest so I dont have to feel like a pervert.

Whenever I tell them ""I'm into what you're into... no really, it will turn me on to experience your desires. No, really really really, my kink is that I want to do your kink, it will turn me on to please you"" they don't feel like I'm being completely honest with them and are reluctant to share.

I've dated a few guys, never for more than a month or so at a time, and experienced occassional PIV/oral, but not ever really got to the point of feeling comfortable or like I had any sort of technique whatsoever. It's also been &gt;4 years, as that's how long my last relationship lasted. I'm in grad school now in a part of the country where LGBT dating is thin on the ground. I've been interested in dating cisguys, but finding myself avoiding seeing guys I've really liked again because of the sex issue. The standard for people dating my age here seems to be 3-5 dates before sex is pretty much expected, and with the anxiety and vulnerability about my incompetence I feel, that timeline is really stressing me out! I'm not sure how to bring up my inexperience with partners, not sure how to broach whether a slightly slower progression is okay, or how to indicate that I might need them to lead a bit/that it's okay to explicitly instruct. The flow of female bodied sex has always felt really natural and obvious to me, but with cis-straight sex I feel like I don't really understand what you're supposed to do when, let alone how, and I'm quite embarrassed given how old I am! Since this is a throwaway I'll be honest and say that I'm quite socially competent and fairly attractive, so I do quite well with dates and am not really someone people ""expect"" to be inexperience, which makes it a bit harder, not am I really dating people in a similar boat (not that that would be an issue!). Mostly just looking for advice on how to broach it, what I can do to make it less awkward, and whether it would be a deal breaker for many guys? "
257,vulnerability,sex,"[Discussion] I found an article titled, Top 5 Misconceptions About Sex and I compared my personal experiences to them. Your thought?",1,3p75t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3p75t8/discussion_i_found_an_article_titled_top_5/,2015-10-18 16:36:25,"Top 5 Sex Misconception Revealed, Lets See If Experience Can Confirm These Misconceptions! Over the years people have tried to pin point, what they believe to be the ultimate key, great to sex and amazing intimacy. We have studied endlessly, as to what it means to be intimate and how to maximize pleasure with our partners. In this article youll find some opinionated misconceptions about sex and my attempt to compare and contrast them, to my own experiences and thoughts. I dont believe any of these misconceptions are empirically based and neither are my responses to them, but both are designed to give you a different perspective on sex, in the context of societal norms. Misconception #1: Sex is just a biological function. It should be pursued for health reasons, like exercise. Within this framework, partner selection is neutral. Hook ups, masturbation, and friends with benefits are just another way of taking care of this need. This is seen as an updated contrast to the old, moralistic attitude that sex should be saved for marriage, but even as we seem to be elevating sex to new heights by the attention were giving it, I contend that we are actually devaluing it. It is losing its pleasure because were not making it special enough. It has become common, ordinary and relatively meaningless. The reality: Sex is best as an expression of adoration. Its most pleasurable between two people who are deeply in love, in the context of a mutually committed relationship. A merely physical act cant even come close to the joy of intimacy in this kind of union. Casual sex is like using a beautiful, hand-crafted golden bowl to store the rock salt you use for melting ice on the front steps. It may be functional in that capacity, but the use is not in keeping with its intrinsic value and risks damaging something very precious. * Personal I think sex is both part of the misconception AND the reality. I think it serves so many purposes and theres not one size fits all model, to what sex means and, or should be like to the individual. Sex is best, precisely the way you like it and that should be the bottom line. Whether youre into those one nighters, or youre saving yourself for marriage, its never wrong. The only time in my opinion sex is ever wrong, is if youre completely reckless about it. Multiple partners and it being unprotected. I say that only in the context of unwanted pregnancies and STDs, certainly not in a judgmental way. I think sex is both a biological function/need and an expression of adoration, plus so much more. Misconception #2: Sex is about gratification. Its a goal-oriented activity focused on the almighty orgasm. The problem is that the more you pursue a physical thrill, the less thrilling it becomes over time. So you have to look for new ways to regain the old thrill. You become subject to the law of diminishing returns, and the old thrill never really comes back. The reality: Sex is about connection. The richest and most satisfying sex happens when you dont have any agenda at all, except breathing each other in and feeling each other on every level  body, soul and spirit. In this state, your love for each other feeds your desire and arousal, which in turn feeds your love in an upward spiral of passion. It may beautifully resolve itself in a release  or not. But this kind of intimacy bonds you tightly together and keeps the closeness in your relationship. * Similarly with regards to misconception #1, I think both the misconception and the reality are true. In particular when the writer talks about, sex being most enjoyable, when theres no agenda. I have to agree with that statement wholeheartedly. I think sex should be a delicate balance of give and take, but not necessarily both at the same time and each time you engage in sex. I think when partners are happy, it lends itself to making you more happy as well, because the other person feels inspired to please you back, not obligated. Connections are great, love is amazing, but sometimes you just wanna get fucked! So, again theres no one size fits all model. Youre not either out for the BIG O, or youre in it for love, it can be so much more, or so much less. Misconception #3: Youre bound to get bored, so spice things up a bit. Articles abound recommending new positions, new locations, new sexual acts, using pornography, sharing fantasies and a host of other things that would not have been allowed in print twenty years ago. Some of the suggestions are potentially problematic for the couple relationship. Most also activate the law of diminishing returns. The reality: Youre bound to get bored, so agree to a period of abstinence. When food becomes boring, try fasting for a week. I guarantee you that a simple apple will look delicious at the end of the week, while junk food and sweets will have no appeal. If your sex life as a couple is boring, forbid yourselves from touching each other for a whole week. Dedicate yourselves to the fine art of flirting for that week. If you even last that long, I guarantee that the fire and passion will be back. * I think the reality here is both potentially GREAT and damming! I am curious as to why the writer here is so A or B?!?! Why not fulfill each others fantasy? Why not be each others spouse and secret crush? Its the enchantment that gets lost in time, not the desire and that enchantment can extend to how one feels about life in general and of course that can trickle down to you sex life. I mean, I think it all depends on WHY sex got boring for a couple to begin with, because a break in some cases, in my opinion can potentially have devastating consequences, or it can be the best thing you ever did. I think sexual exploration is an amazing thing and shouldnt be discounted as a means to make a bond stronger. To guarantee that the fire and passion will return, upon the completion of a fasting week, is a no, no! When it comes to sex, advice in my opinion should be given case, by case. Sex and sexuality in its simplicity, is very multifaceted and should be treated as such! Misconception #4: Keep reading about sex (or watching porn), we have more for you! As a society, we are addicted to our digital information consumption. Families actually sit around the table at a restaurant and text each other instead of talking. Whenever people have a few spare minutes, they bury their heads in their smart phones, iPads, or eBook readers. We are inundated with information, but lonelier and less connected than ever. We have become jaded from too much exposure to information about and images of sex. The reality: Keep the mystery and vulnerability in bed by getting your information from your partner. Is it really so important to know what other people are doing? When sex was mainly a taboo topic that was addressed once by your same-sex parent in an awkward conversation about the birds and the bees, it was a great mystery. The joy of discovery and exploration belonged to the young couple whose information and experience came from each other. There may have been some whispering in the back rooms, rumors of things some people did, but if you ever did dare explore that behavior, it was a very private moment with your lover and involved equal risk and vulnerability on both sides. You learned about sex, and you learned what pleased your partner, all at the same time. It was a wild adventure! When it comes to sex, do you know fact from fiction? Find out now. * OK! So I kind of agree with this one 100%. As much as I love my technology, porn and gadgets, I understand and recognize that the very best way to learn about my partner, is through questions, physical touch, exploration and the like. Its all part of intimacy, which is separate from sex. Again, I think a balance can and perhaps should be found here, but ultimately at the end of the day, your partner should be at the top of that list. Sometimes, technology can leave your partner feeling alienated and frankly, weve all been there and it sucks ass! I think if youre attached to your partner and youre attached to technology, then why not incorporate both? Explore with your partner and use technology as your tool, together! I know most of this is easier said then done, but if youre both willing, then I think thats the beginning of a recipe for success! Misconception #5: Everybodys doing it. In fact, sexlessness is a real problem thats increasingly afflicting us at a societal level. Our over-consumption of sex information and behavior is actually destroying intimacy, trust and understanding between the sexes. More and more often, I hear stories of men unable to engage in intercourse with a real woman because of all the pornography theyre consuming. More and more often, I hear young women despairing of any satisfying relationship with men because theyre being treated as if they are the unrealistic, virtual women of the digital world, mere extensions of the male ego there for enjoyment, but not expected to have their own needs and desires. Many young people claim to be completely comfortable with the recreational sex lifestyle, but studies show that the most frequent and most enjoyable sex is, on average, being had by married couples. You can argue that my morality is showing here, that Im just an old-fashioned reactionary. My question in return is, hows that hip attitude about sex working for you? Just because all things are permissible does not mean they are all beneficial. It is important to consider the question of whether these changes have been healthy for us. The reality: Be the chooser. While none of us can single handedly change a culture, each of us can control our own choices. Here are some suggestions for healthy choices around sexuality that honor and care for yourself, and open the door to that vibrant and joyful intimacy we all crave: * Choose your partner carefully and lovingly. Dont rush into sex. * Choose a relationship that is based on mutual love and respect. * Limit the amount of information you consume related to sex. * Choose your sources of information about sex carefully. * Avoid behaviors that activate the law of diminishing returns. * Be gutsy enough to stay strong when you feel pressure (real or imagined) to lower your standards. * Hmmm, this one is interesting, because I can most definitely see the point that the writer is trying to make, but like with most of the misconceptions pointed out in the article, they seem awfully one-sided. Theres no room for grey area and certainly no room, for different needs and, or circumstances. I think theres a clear and distinct difference, between picking Mr. Right and Mr. Right Now. Furthermore, theres a difference between sex, fucking, intimacy and so on and we as adults need to be able to decipher between them all! We cant assume people know what were talking about and what we want, so we need to be able to effectively communicate our desires and intentions. That in my opinion, is where I see a lot of disconnect. At the end of the day, we all want to be accepted and acknowledged, I mean thats important to many people. Taking time out of your day to acknowledge your partner, even if its annoying and, or time consuming, might be more beneficial than you might think, as reciprocation is always nice. Whether you read this article or another, if youre looking for that answer, my suggestion is to STOP! I think its kind of unhealthy to search for your answers this way, especially when it comes to sex and intimacy. Find those answers within you, within your desires and needs. Explore yourself first and foremost, then let that same level of exploration and curiosity trickle down to your partner. You know that saying, you cant possibly take care of others, if you cant take care of yourself? I think that can apply to sex too! When you step into a sexual encounter, whether that be with a spouse or a one night stand, with confidence and pride, knowing what you have to offer, knowing yourself inside and out that will in my opinion lend itself to some amazing sex. Remember to treat your partner the way you wish to be treated. If you need some patience and understanding, then give it. Communicate for crying out loud, people arent mind readers and they shouldnt be expected to be either. Yes, all of this is easier said than done, but what if you just let yourself go, what if you just open your mind to all of the possibilities and just went with it? What if youre pleasantly surprised? Some of the sexiest people I know arent ripped, they arent in the best shape ever, they arent this or that, they are confident and they know their worth. You dont need technology, you dont need articles, all you need is the willingness to teach and the desire to learn, at least in my opinion. Above all, do not compare yourself, your sex life and the like to anyone else or to any other couple/situation.ever! Each situation is unique and theres no one size fits all solution to any sex and, or intimacy issues. As always, thank you for reading and Ill see you next time!"
258,vulnerability,sex,[general discussion] Libido Parameters,0,3l84rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3l84rr/general_discussion_libido_parameters/,2015-09-17 07:50:34,"Hello lovely people, We frequently discuss libido here in a single dimension: high v low. I wonder whether we can better understand ourselves and our partners if we add additional parameters to how we think of our libidos. It's a nuanced drive that feeds into some of our most vulnerable and primal facets of being, so let's see if we can discover some helpful terms to help in becoming more of the selves we want to be. Please, rip apart and expand upon the below in any way that you see fit. In addition to low v high, I think libido (at the very least) also includes a proactive v reactive dimension. Proactive libido could be high or low, but would tend to seek satiety, whereas reactive libido would ""wake up"" in response to sexual stimuli. Perhaps there is also a gradient of selflessness v selfishness (how hard is it for you to accept generous pleasure from another v easy to take?) and another of vulnerability v distance. On the latter gradient, I suspect that most of us are fairly in the middle most of the time, but occasionally require affirming vulnerable intimacy v. require role-playing tension (to outline the extremes). Do you think that there are other parameters/dimensions I've missed? Maybe all of the above is absolutely useless and/or presumptuous, but thinking in terms of the above additional dimensionality has helped me better understand my desires and those of my partners. I'm just putting it out there in the hopes that 1) y'all see additional parameters I haven't even considered and 2) it helps someone else too. Be well, Peel"

So I've gotten this far in life and managed to not punch my V card. I've told myself a lot of reasons why this is the case, but one by one my excuses fall away. I've had opportunities, people seem to like me (in general, there are still plenty of people that think I'm an asshole), and I'm not the gigantic shut in that I was a decade ago. The physical act itself is pretty quantifiable so technique isn't really something that concerns me. Size isn't something I'm too concerned with.(I'm not huge but I don't imagine a wave of dissapointment when I take my pants off either), and I'm not trying to exclusively date super models (I like a lot of different women but cute and nerdy is the best). The only thing I have left is that it scares the shit out of me. I can't handle the level of vulnerability that it would take to have sex, so I dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge every time it comes up. The insecurities about being much older than average for a first time and an inate distrust of people just overwhelm me and I bolt. (Not literally as that would be undignified.) **TL;DR** I'm older and sex terrifies me. What do? Other points: I've been in counceling for PTSD (not a veteran) for a while so that's already a thing. Topics to talk about with my guy would be helpful though. "
260,vulnerability,sex,[Advice] I explained my 'rape' kink to my boyfriend... I don't think he gets it.,329,3erufu,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3erufu/advice_i_explained_my_rape_kink_to_my_boyfriend_i/,2015-07-28 00:15:18,"Hey reddit! I'm a 20 year old girl and I've been together with my 22 year old boyfriend for 5 months. We have a great sex-life and we love each other very much. This weekend I decided I felt comfortable enough in the relationship to talk about sexual preferences. I have a slight kink for rough sex and I love being held down, having my hair pulled, getting spanked, tied up and being fucked *hard*. Besides that I get off on power-play. My ultimate fantasy is being forced and used as a personal fucktoy. I completely understand how this is a very weird and unappealing kink for some people, so I don't blame him for responding a little off, but I don't like the way it headed. Here's the story: I told him about it and he tried to fulfill my wishes, but I could notice it wasn't ""him"" and he couldn't get in to it. We tried to build it up a little, starting with just holding down, progressing further, but he just gets stuck past holding down. I think he's just a little weirded out, not because of the acts, but because of the implications that his head just can't fathom not stopping when a girl struggles or says ""no"". I told him it was fine, not to worry about it, that I enjoy our regular sex too and that I'd never want him to do anything he's uncomfortable with, but he kept saying he wants to please me and making me happy makes him happy. Thing is, the way he does it, is cautious about anything and almost looks guilty when he calls me a ""dirty slut"" just turns me completely off too. I can't enjoy it if we don't both enjoy it either. **My question is, can someone maybe help me with sources or your own story to explain to him what this fantasy is about?** I explained that rape in itself is horrible and that I'm so glad I haven't ever had to experience that, but that my kink mostly plays into giving someone else, him, full control and trusting them not to abuse it. Trusting your partner enough to expose full vulnerability to them. I hoped that would show him the loving side of it. I just love the confidence and the pure animalistic lust in being forced. I just think it's somewhat flattering that someone *has* to have you, right then and there. I'd have to let my animalistic side take over and eventually have my body start enjoying it, even though I refused, I just think it's really hot that someone can have that power over you. That's basically what I explained to my boyfriend, but he's still a bit freaked out over it. He even says I am ""extremely kinky"" and ""weird"" over it and he thinks the fantasy is creepy. I tried to talk about his 'dark side', but he says he doesn't have any and he prefers the passion and love that comes with sex. I just can't seem to explain that sharing this fantasy, for me, has a lot of trust, passion and love built into it. **TL;DR: My boyfriend is so freaked out by my rape fantasy he can't seem to enjoy himself in it, yet he insists on pleasing me by participating in it. How do I make this work?** ------------- Edit: I just want to use the opening post, since it's really hard to reply to every single comment, but thanks for all the advice guys! All the tips, personal stories and advice definitely helped me figure out what's up and what to do next."
261,vulnerability,sex,[guide] to sexual (in)compatibility (feedback appreciated),1,39af5t,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/39af5t/guide_to_sexual_incompatibility_feedback/,2015-06-10 22:15:39,"I got fed up with how uselessly vague the term ""sexual compatibility"" is and decided to break it down to an exhaustive list of parts. If i missed anything tell me. Also, there are almost definitely categories I can further subdivide (like I did with physical attraction) but I'm blanking out on how right now. I'm defining by negatives because I found that more fun for some reason. --- **sight** You do not enjoy looking at this person, especially naked **smell** You do not enjoy smelling this person **touch** You don't like touching/being touched by this person. Their skin is super flaky or their hands are clammy or something **sex looks/smells/sounds** You are turned off by how this person looks/smells/sounds during sex. For example, their orgasm face makes you crack up, they meow when turned on, or you think their genitals smell terrible. **lust** You just don't feel any real desire to have sex with this person **body shape** The size of your respective genitalia do not match well (eg long dick, extremely sensitive cervix) . One of you is too tall/short to comfortably enjoy most positions with the other. Any other misalignment of the puzzle pieces **fitness/flexibility** This person is not in shape enough to have the kind of sex that you enjoy. **body in sync** Your bodies are just out of sync. Your instinct for who moves when is wrong. Your rhythm is off. You probably are also terrible at dancing with each other. **kink** There's an overlap in the venn diagram of ""things you/they need to be satisfied"" and ""things you/they won't do, or at least won't enjoy doing"". For example, you want to be beaten and they don't want to beat you. **preferences** There's an overlap in the venn diagram of ""things you/they need to be satisfied"" and ""things you/they won't do, or at least won't enjoy doing"". For example, you want oral sex at least once a week and they don't like giving it, or your favorite position is doggy and they're maybe willing to do that once a year, on your birthday. **frequency** You want sex five times a week. They want sex five times a year. **attitude towards sex** You think sex is a great way to have fun and they think sex is for procreation and otherwise sinful. **attitude during sex** You want soft slow lovemaking filled with endearments in French and gazing into each other's eyes. They want to fuck like a porn movie. **attitude** They're not confident, or they're not enthusiastic, or they spend the entire time apologizing. **sex talk** Their dirty talk turns you off **technique** Let's face it, when you say ""we're sexually incompatible"" to this person, what you mean is ""*you're* sexually incompatible. With everyone."" This is the guy who lasts two minutes pumping furiously while going"" yeah you like that don't you"" and then promptly collapses on the bed, whereupon he proceeds to snore like a chainsaw. This is the girl who lies there so limply you're not actually sure she's not dead, until at the last moment she suddenly thrashes around like a rabid octopus screaming shrilly and kicking you in the balls. **communication and willingness to adjust** This person does not listen to you about sex. You say slower, they proceed at the same pace (or speed up). You suggest gently to them that you'd appreciate more tongue during kissing. They ignore you. Unlike technique guy, their sex might hypothetical be good for *someone* out there, maybe. (or, frankly, they might also suck at technique. These two do seem to go together) **emotional connection** Something is off in your emotional connection. You don't trust this person, or maybe you just don't like them very much. Either way, it's making you not enjoy sex with them **personality** You aren't attracted to the type of person they are, and it's making you not enjoy sex with them. **generosity** This person is in bed for them and only them. You're the furniture they're masturbating with, you're not supposed to have requests or preferences of your own that you'd like fulfilled. **variation** One of you enjoys nice bread and butter sex. The other one wants experimentation and mixing things up. **attentiveness/perceptiveness** They might listen when you tell them what to do, but they can't figure anything out on their own. You curl into a touch you like, they switch to something else. You start moving faster, your muscles start spasming, and you start saying YES GOD YES and they decide now is the perfect time to switch positions. If you're playing BDSM, good luck feeling safe in subspace- they will stop when you safe word, and only when you safe word. thrashing against the restraints and having a panic attack doesn't count. --- What'd I miss? --- Addendum: The components of magnificent sex, according to a study you can Google because I can't find it right now, are: being present; connection; deep sexual and erotic intimacy; extraordinary communication; interpersonal risk-taking and exploration; authenticity; vulnerability; and transcendence. I don't think most of these are part of the bare *minimum* of sexual compatibility but they're relevant so I'll mention them here anyway. "

For some reason, I associate them with weakness and vulnerability and I do not let myself give into sex or relationships. I don't know where this mindset came from at all, my parents aren't really open about sex but they aren't closed-minded either. For some reason, I am programmed to be ashamed of my sexual feelings that certainly aren't out of the ordinary. Everytime I think about sex or feel the slightest bit horny, I feel so much shame and even depression sometimes because I feel ashamed that I'm giving into these ""urges."" I so so so recognize that this is abnormal, but I purposefully deny myself sex and purposefully create a chase that just turns men away. I also have very very low self-confidence. This low confidence is relatively hidden, if that means anything. I am successful, I have lots of friends, I go out, I do what normal 21 year olds do. But unlike my friends, I am never in pursuit of sex because I am ashamed of acting on my sexual desires. Does anyone know how I can fix this? Or rather, is this something I should just live with? Is this even abnormal? Is it just how I am programmed? EDIT: I'm not a virgin and all of the times I've had sex were in private and no one, not even some of my really close friends - are aware of them. I am really just turned off by the idea of someone thinking I have normal human urges. "
263,vulnerability,sex,[Question] How do you take the next step in recovering from sexual addiction/compulsion?,3,3a68m2,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3a68m2/question_how_do_you_take_the_next_step_in/,2015-06-18 01:34:53,"I'm interested in hearing from people who are recovering from sexual addiction. When you are in the process of recovering, how do you start developing healthy sexual relationships? How do you avoid the danger of falling into old habits? How do you recognize when something is becoming unhealthy, and stop it - how do you separate that from fear and avoidance of love and intimacy? How do you find a partner that's in anyway compatible with you when you feel so fucked up? My background - I'm female, in my late 20's. I never exactly identified as a sexual addict, but I do feel like putting my behaviour in that category is more helpful to me now than not. When I was a teenager I used masturbation and online attention as a coping mechanism when one of my parents was sick and dying, and when my other parent was functionally absent because of the other's death. I don't feel any shame for that, but I recognize it for what it was, and because of that I have a pretty solid understanding of how powerful sex can be as a form of escapism and compulsion. Since then, I have had periods of healthy sexuality. I am a very sexual person, not just in terms of sexual activity, but in terms of where my general interests lay. Sex is a huge part of my identity. My friends and my family both recognize it as a part of my identity, and accept it. It's been a big part of my work and education. I've been very lucky in being able to live a life where nearly everyone supports and encourages that in me. But it is one thing when embracing healthy sexuality is a part of your identity, and professional life, and another when living healthy sexuality is a part of your intimate life. I have social anxiety, and during my early-mid 20's I was very isolated and relied on sex as a way to gain human contact. It was rarely ""intimate"" or ""loving"" but I still needed the small amount of emotional vulnerability to function. When I was 22 I started seeing a psychologist for intensive CBT treatment for my anxiety, and as my anxiety got better I was able to recognize how damaging the way I pursued sex was, and able to recognize opportunities to find and develop human connection elsewhere. 2 years ago I started abstaining from sex after years of sexual compulsions that went increasingly downhill. I had a lot of casual sex with strangers of all different walks of life. I had ""panic sex"" where I would go on dates with boys and have sex with them because I didn't know what else to do - they did not pressure me, I initiated, and they were confused. Then I would go home and self harm because I couldn't understand why I was having sex with people when I truly didn't want to. I went to kinky parties, and orgies and sex clubs. I met up with strangers off craigslist, did the kind of drugs that throw all inhibitions out the window, and put myself in dangerous situations. I ended up with an incurable STI (but not a terrible one). In comparison to other women, I find it very easy to open up and feel extreme pleasure sexually, to the point where I disassociated and even hallucinated during sex (that sounds good, but this is probably the most dangerous part of my sexual experience). In pursuing these activities, I neglected my work, my school work, and my health. I was able to stop doing this because of the CBT treatment (although we didn't focus on this aspect). My life has been much better for it, I was able to focus on school and work and developing healthy platonic relationships. Now I am at a point where I have almost worked out my other anxiety issues, and I am almost quite healthy and functional. But it's also been 2 years since I've had sex, or done dating of any kind. In terms of recovering from sexual addiction, I feel like I am quite far along. But I am clueless about the next step. How do you start having healthy, loving, sexual relationships when hook up culture is so prevalent, such a temptation, so much easier? I don't think I'm ready to do this myself, but I think I'm ready to start thinking about it. I barely see my psychologist anymore, the kind of treatment he provides is a lot more intensive than what I need and more intended for somewhat short term help for people in serious danger. I'm glad to say that hasn't described me for years, but it also means he isn't my point of help for this issue, and I can't afford another form of therapy. Hearing from other people who have had similar experiences, and how they have dealt with being at this point in their recovery would be helpful to me. I don't think /r/sex is the best place for this, but I don't know where else to go. This is very hard to talk about, any kind of support is appreciated."

We have become closer and closer these past few months and have consistently been kissing and giving oral. She even hinted at wanting me to tell her I love her (which I did and it was reciprocated). But she revealed that when we had sex, it reminds her of how much she loves her ex. On top of this, her ex is moving back home in a month and wants to see her. So I've fallen for my best friend and even lost my virginity to her and now it's all damage control. She says she doesn't know if she loves me romantically yet, but it seems like she really loves her ex and wanted something physical when he was gone. I'm hurt and confused and have no idea what to do! Any advice reddit? Edit: Thank you to everyone who's given advice. The popular opinion seems to be to cut ties all together. Harsh, but it may be necessary. Either way, it's nice to have you guys when I need an honest opinion, thank you again. Edit 2: I talked to her this morning. Because of her own vulnerability and our mutual investment, I am going to remain her friend, but at a distance. No more snapchat, talking until 3 am, etcetera. I also made it very clear that we cannot be more than friends regardless of how it works out when her ex gets back. So the nail's in the coffin: no chance for a relationship. I think everything that can be done, has been done. Again, thank you everyone for your advice and support; this community never fails to impress me &lt;3"
265,vulnerability,sex,"[Male vs Female sexuality]...the differences are interesting, what do you think?",0,3ad3mp,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3ad3mp/male_vs_female_sexualitythe_differences_are/,2015-06-19 13:19:37,"Recently, I have begun to really understand what it is that attracts men vs. what it is that attracts women. This has been a major area of confusion for me for most of my life (as I think it is for most men for quite some time), but recently, I've begunt to make some real headway, and now I have an interesting thought I'm pondering. Let me tell you what I think attracts men and what I think attracts women, so that you will know where I am coming from, and therefore what my assumptions are as you read further. I believe that men are attracted primarily to women's bodies, because they are a sign of her ability to bear children. Men look for women who are youthful (not nescessarily young...there is a difference), energetic, fit, waist-to-hip ratio (hourglass figure), etc. Men also are attracted to vulnerability from women, because they are engenieered to find the most feminine woman, which is also the most attractive woman. I believe women are attracted primarily to men's behaviors, because they are a sign of their ability to keep them safe and protected, especially during the childbirth stage and afterwards, when she is caring for a child or children, and thus is more suseptible to attacks or dangers of all sorts. Women look for men who are confident, dominant, and strong, because they know these qualities will help keep them alive, if the man has these. Thus, what each sex finds attractive is really just a biological program of sorts, in order to find the most suitable mate for reproducing the most effectively with the highest chances for success....makes sense. As a man, because I am attracted to women's bodies primarily, I naturally assumed that women were attracted to men's bodies as well. Until I discovered that they actually are primarily attracted to men's behaviors and attitudes. When I discovered this, and have tried to work on myself as a man, I have become a much more secure and strong man (over a period of lots of dealing with past issues and lots of working through hard times), and often wonder to myself, ""why is this girl becoming turned on?? I'm not DOING anything!"" But such is the nature of women's attraction, it's based upon a strong, confident, and dominant personality, not upon directly doing anything to make the woman turned on. I often feel it is silly for women to be turned on by such things, and does not make much sense to me. Now, since women are attracted to men's behaviors, I would IMAGINE that women assume (at first) that men are attracted to women's behaviors as well, and thus feel equally silly when they learn that their bodies actually attract men. I would imagine that most women probably do not even know what it is about their body that turns men on, and thus see the rating scale as kind of a misnomer, because they don't see why one leg would be any ""sexier"" than another one...they are just legs. I know women figure out that it's their bodies men are attracted to much earlier and easier than men find out that it's their personalities that women are attracted to, but I still wonder if women, even when they are aware it's their bodies that attract men, still feel it is silly that wearing lingere or short shorts would turn men on, because they are not DOING anything with their personalities or behaviors to attract men. Ladies, please tell me if I'm right or wrong in my assumptions. Or men, who have been with ladies (as I have, and witnessed how silly ladies behave when they see us becoming turned on by their bodies), feel free to comment too. I hope to shed some light on male &amp; female sexuality with this one, and really help us both understand each other a little better."
266,vulnerability,sex,[Advice] Does anybody know an accurate depiction of sex?,0,34xu2n,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/34xu2n/advice_does_anybody_know_an_accurate_depiction_of/,2015-05-05 23:35:42,"Seriously, every time when I ask a genuine question about sex online, people automatically tend to assume that I haven't had sex before... or if I did have sex, I probably wasn't doing it right. More often the former than the latter. Oftentimes, I really have no idea what message I am sending, and I get bewildered when people make assumptions about my sexual experience. I am well aware that sex scenes in novels are quite difficult to write about, because they are very personal and very easy to mess up on the tiny details, making the sex scene seem fake, unreal, or out-of-character. I am starting to think that the reason why people assume that I am sexually inexperienced is that I struggle with writing sex scenes... and struggle with comprehending them too, and my rudimentary sexual knowledge shows in my posts. Reddit is by far most explicit and helpful in providing that sexual knowledge, and I really appreciate that. Anyway, I don't want people to think that I am joking or not being serious in my inquiries. As a matter of fact, my questions on here are serious and intentional, and I don't really want to ask my questions about sex in person either, because, again, they will likely assume about my sexual experience. I have been thinking about having phone sex, but I don't know any sex workers (prostitution is illegal in my state), and having explicit sexual talks with my peers will just be weird or grossly inappropriate. I need advice. Does anybody know an ACCURATE depiction of sex? Since pornography and romance novels seek to make money, and prostitution is illegal in my jurisdiction, and explicitly asking people to have sex with me may be dangerous or scandalous, weird or offensive, embarrassing or shameful (goes with the vulnerability idea on this Wiki), is there a way to find an accurate depiction of sex safely that does not involve paying a sex therapist? I have been searching for vaginal missionary sex on free pornographic websites, but it seems that most of them tend to start with oral sex and sometimes include anal sex. I've read a scientific study about how Chinese couples have sex or make love to each other, and more than half surveyed actually do not report oral sex, giving the impression that oral sex is not really a requirement for the sexual stimulation. So, I am left to conclude that sexual intercourse is largely a subjective experience and varies wildly from couple to couple. An explicit, accurate pictorial example of heterosexual vaginal missionary sex would still be nice, though. "

One day you're sexually deviant as all heck, and the next you're terrified and dumping someone because they got too close to you. Quick back story: the SO who raped me took my virginity while I kicked his stomach asking him to please just stop as I wasn't ready. He finished, we never spoke again. The next time I hear about him, it is from a friend who called me to inform me that he is telling everyone that my vagina is gross and loose. I was sixteen years old at the time. I am very self conscious of my vagina ever since, given that my lips are somewhat uneven and I think one of them is too large for my liking. Plus, I have very sensitive skin and no matter what, I always get some form of razor burn. It paralyzes me in insecurity. I can't put it into words how much I am ashamed and disgusted by my own vagina. How scared I am to let people see it, how afraid I am of them telling others about it. I have wanted labiaplasty/gynoplasty for years, and still intend to have this surgery. Ever since then, I have very rarely let people go down on me. It wasn't until I was nineteen that I let someone else get a good look at my vagina. It took almost a year of high communication, reassurance, and flattery before I let him try. He was incredible at reassuring me that I'm fine - and I slowly would open up enough to let myself enjoy oral sex. In fact, I really enjoy it if I can past my mental block that said person isn't going to go tell all their friends how disgusting I am. My last boyfriend (when I was 22) would get me extremely turned on and go for it, and whenever I protested, he'd tell me that he loved doing it and he wanted to. He'd just go for it and again reassure me. He knew I needed the encouragement because he knew behind my mental block, I really do love it. These two were very understanding of my past as a child, and they took things slowly with me. They also told me never to get surgery, and that I really have a fine vagina. Now, I am in a relationship with a new man who is a lot less experienced than me sexually. He's never gone down on a girl, really. Everything we've done has been new to him. We were best friends previous to ever considering dating, and were very close. He knows about my past. He knows my biggest insecurity is my vagina, as it literally is, one of my only insecurities. He's been wanting to try going down on me, and has asked. I told him I was very nervous to let him, and he has tried to encourage me that I will be fine and okay. He also warned me that he is nervous because he's never done it before really. He told me to just direct him, and I don't have any problems with speaking up about my needs. Anyway, every time he has tried to go down on me when I have finally allowed him (because I feel adequately showered and shaved), he only has stayed down there for a few seconds. I get nervous too and don't mind him pulling back up. Any sign of uncomfortableness can make me really nervous or upset, so I've asked him to stop before. While today we were having amazing sex. Very passionate, kinky, lingerie on, and a lot of dirty talking. He wants to try 69 but I tell him I'd be more comfortable if he just went down on me first (He'd gotten off 2 times already, and the goal was to now get me off). As he is down there, I gave him a bit of direction as he asked and I'm finally getting a little more comfortable. At which point, he tries to stop again after maybe a minute. I ask him if he's grossed out, and he goes ""yeah, I am kind of."" I pull him up from between my legs and he tries to keep things going (penetrative). I stop him and just say that I think I'm done for the night. He can tell that I'm upset, and backs off immediately. I put clothes on, and he asks if I am mad. I tell him that I'm not mad, and he keeps sort of asking. I'm not mad at all, just really sad and feel like I'm back to square one. I start to cry and just tell him that he knows it is my biggest insecurity. It takes me so much trust to build up, and to hear it grosses someone out just makes me feel like I have every reason to feel as shitty about myself as I do. He tries to tell me that he didn't hear what I said, but I told him I know he's just lying to make me feel better. He agrees and tries a few other ways to remedy the situation like: saying it's like popping a pimple, gross but satisfying or that if I liked it then he would continue to do it. Sadly, I don't think I can enjoy oral ever again if I'm thinking he's only down there because I want it. I don't want him to hate his life while he is down there. What if the other guys felt this way too and I've been basically torturing them? I feel like I'm a big baby but I am on the brink of breaking down. I've been crying all night. I feel so hurt. He is a wonderful boyfriend in every other way. He reminds me constantly, even without make-up, that I am beautiful, smart, and funny. He takes me on dates, he listens when I have a problem, supports me in everything. I have limited, if any, complaints about him. On the large scale, he's treated me a lot better than most people I've been with. I care about him a lot. I understand that I can't expect everyone to like giving oral. He asks me for head all the time. I guess this is where the sexual abuse comes in (the wishy washy feelings); despite being very insecure, when I am comfortable, I would describe being eaten out as one of my favourite things. With this incident though, I don't want him to even look at my vagina again. I do not want to gross him out. I'm scared to be naked in front of him now. How do I move past this? How do I get over my now even greater insecurity and vulnerability? How do I enjoy sex again when all I can think is that my vagina grosses him out? I know it was probably just him not thinking, and he may really not be so grossed out when he's more comfortable with his own skills, but I don't think I can ever let him get close to it again. It's really bad and I feel dramatic, but I feel like I'm just a human fleshlight then. I pleasure him with oral, and if I hated it, I wouldn't say it was gross to him! I have a bad tendency to run away from men if I feel threatened or hurt (I've been working on it) and I can already feel myself wanting to just not speak again. It's ridiculous, and unfair to him. Help me? How can I bring myself to get over it? How can I forget that my vagina was just said to gross out yet another person? EDIT: I care about this boy a lot, and I don't think he meant it to feel as insulting as it did. He has no other relationship ""vices"" to date. I am aware that he may just not like giving oral sex and that is okay. I can respect preferences. However, due to my history of issues related to my sexuality, being told he was grossed has left a bit of damage because I am so highly sensitive. He can back peddle it, remedy it, or excuse it any way he wants but the fact of the matter is, it is burned in my head. It won't leave. I don't think this merits a break up, despite the urge to run away and protect myself from hurt feelings. We all make mistakes, but I need to find a way to feel secure again. I need to find a way to be naked in front of him again without feeling judged, like he's hating his life or like I can't turn him on. EDIT 2: Thank you so much for all your love, kind words and support. I just wanted to say, I am in therapy. I'm not going to focus on accepting that all vaginas are different and each pleasant in their own way because I am aware of this. I am aware that people have different preferences. My reality is how do I overcome that my vagina itself has been called gross twice now? How do you think I can communicate or put in strategies to allow me to not hold a mistake against my boyfriend? TL/DR: My inexperienced boyfriend went down on me for the 3rd time tonight. He's always seemed sort of avoidant, although he is the one asking to do it. When asked if he was grossed out, he replied with yes while he was still between my legs. Being a victim of sexual abuse, I am extremely and paralyzingly self-conscious of my vagina and have only let a handful of people go down on me. I don't know if I can move past this and let him ever see me naked again even. "

I definitely identify as dominant but it's making me feel really unappreciated. Showing these girls a lot of desire (usually more than I actually feel) makes them go wild but the problem is that it takes a lot of mental effort to be so attuned to my partner and when they're enjoying it leaps and bounds more than me, I feel used. I want to act truer to my feelings but if the sex is bad it's my fault as the guy and there's a lot of shame associated with that :( I know communication is usually the answer but say I'm taking a girl home from a party, I can't have a sexual compatibility talk with her, it's just too early in our relationship for that kind of vulnerability. I'm stuck in this weird situation where even flirting with this pretty girl at a party will make me feel sad because I know that if anything happens I'll always be wanting to show her a good time, even at the expense of my own pleasure. Even dom activities that are supposed to be about me ""using"" her for my pleasure doesn't do anything for me mentally because she wasn't inspired by her own desire to do that to me.

Because you don't want to show that part of yourself, to be exposed? I'm a girl, and personally, if I feel depressed and vulnerable I don't not want to have sex. Because that deep connection and revealing of myself is healing for me. It can help show me that I'm safe. So sadness doesn't turn me off, but sometimes makes me crave it more. Especially with the right person. Currently my boyfriend has an aversion to sex because he's depressed and it makes him feel pretty terrified to think of being vulnerable like that right now.

It causes so many problems and there are so many hoops to jump through. * I'm physically attracted to only a very tiny percentage of people, and have felt romantic attraction to maybe 3 people in my entire lifetime. * I am have no game and only a moderate amount of sexual experience. * I have herpes which pretty much rules out any form of casual sex because 1) that's not really something that's socially acceptable to talk about with someone you don't know well, it's way too personal and 2) nobody's going to hook up with a positive person anyway. Putting yourself through the soul crushing wringer of rejection is not worth getting laid to me. Having the ""talk"" pretty much ruins any fun aspect of sex anyway. It puts me in the position of being the desperate one who is begging for sex which is a real confidence killer. The whole time I worry about transmission in the back of my mind and sometimes I cry afterwards because I'm so worried. I have a long history with hypochondriasis and these medical worries are inescapable. * I have vaginismus that appears to be related to how much I trust someone and how much social anxiety I feel around them, my vagina literally closes off to people I don't know or trust well and it's horribly painful. When the muscles are relaxed enough that the vaginismus goes away, I still feel two distinct other types of vaginal pain, even when I'm alone. The very opening part feels like it's too small and my crotch skin is being stretched too tightly, and then there is some other type of pain that appears on irregular spots within the vaginal walls. It's less a true pain than a very disturbing sensation; the closest thing I can compare it to is having your cavities drilled at the dentist. I also feel like I need to pee since the dick is hitting me in the bladder unless it's thin and perfectly straight. * I have never had a boyfriend. Every guy I have had a sexual relationship with ended up rejecting me and fading away from our relationship/friendship. In a couple of these situations I had feelings for the guy and felt heart broken. In a couple others I thought we were genuine friends and after the sex went away, they stopped making an effort into our friendship(or worse, become mean) which is a kick to the self esteem--realizing the only reason that people want to be my friend is pussy. This has happened over and over to the point that I expect it to happen and I don't really trust getting close to any guy because of how shitty it feels getting rejected. But again because of the herpes, I'm forced to form these risky emotional attachments with people since casual sex is off the table. It just seems like sex comes with a pile of negative consequences: uncomfortable vulnerability, physical pain, disease, guilt, anxiety, rejection. But I am really really horny and it's starting to distract me from sleep, schoolwork etc. I have more and more trouble getting off by myself the longer I go with out sex, probably party due to SSRIs. I don't know what to do because my body and mind are in disagreement about this. "

This resulted in a new found appreciation for the things women do in bed to please us, men.",649,32p2zx,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/32p2zx/personal_experience_how_a_visit_to_a_dominatrix/,2015-04-16 01:54:24,"**New edit below** Disclaimer: What may appear to be a wall of text took me some time to write and is something which I did put a lot of thought into, so please don't be frightened by the length. I am a straight, twenty-something male. Much like everyone I watch porn and have a wide range of fetishes which I thoroughly enjoy. The list is quite extensive. As far as my porn preference go, I enjoy everything from soft to hardcore. As far as fetishes go, feet, anal, strapon, lesbian, hard anal, painal, femdom, lezdom, squirting, etc. Not long ago, I decided to see what it would be like to visit a Dominatrix. I did some thorough online searching, contacted a few ladies and settled on one Mistress which I found myself to be attracted to and one which seemed to me to be a more suitable Dominatrix for me. I did this for a rather simple reason, I wanted to act out and experience what it would be like to take on a role of a female pornstar in a somewhat semi-hardcore porno. I wanted to experience what it would feel like to act out what I myself love to watch in porn. Now before I go any further, I must mention that prior to this I had experienced being penetrated with a strapon by several different women and found the experience to be very pleasurable on every occasion, so her wearing a strapon throughout the session was the key to me taking on the role of the receiving ""pornstar"". I made it clear to her that the session was to include two scenarios and what my limits were. Everything that took place I wholeheartedly consented to. The nice one: her dressing me in feminine lingerie and high heels, her giving me a quick lesson on how to walk in a sexy and feminine manner, he complementing me on how sexy and desirable I look. Basically her making me feel sexy and adored. The ""nasty"" one: her forcing me to crawl around on my knees for her, her forcing me to perform oral on her strapon, her making me deep throat and gag on her strapon, being spat on, being called horrible names and being insulted, being slapped on the face with her hand and the strapon and finally being drilled with the strapon in an array of positions ranging from doggy style to missionary to being bent over objects to being clamped with legs spread wide in the air in a contraption which she had in her dungeon. The session was to complete with her forcing me to eat my own cum. So pretty much the full package, the limit of what I enjoy seeing women do in porn. And now if you will allow me, let me go into a bit of detail on how some of the different experiences felt and my afterthoughts. Arriving and the dungeon and submitting myself to my Mistress: After our initial discussion and after clearing up some of the details of the session I was asked to undress and to let her take control of the situation. After getting undressed and standing before this dominant figure dressed in leather, lace and incredibly high heels, wearing a rather impressively sized strapon I suddenly started to feel incredibly vulnerable. But the sensation of this vulnerability brought on an incredible wave of arousal. I felt a little bit frightened, I felt naughty but overall I felt very good. As she began to dress me in my outfit and high heels the excitement level continued to climb. Her praise and complements as I circled the room like a catwalk model made me feel happy, made me feel sexy and desired. I loved it! That was followed by the ""nasty"" part. The mood rather suddenly changed as the Mistress went from being warm and kind to me the complete opposite. As I was told to crawl behind her as she circled the room, my knees started to ache somewhat from the hard wooden floor but that didn't really matter. I was hard as a rock and was enjoying being told what to do. After completing a few laps I was instructed to stand on my knees and to open my ""slutty mouth"". At that moment I thought to myself, okay, here come the insults. As she grabbed me by the hair and demanded that I spit on ""her cock"" I knew for certain that the nice part was over. I began to do my best at working her cock while hearing her drop every textbook insult on me from above. After what seemed like couple of minutes she started to go for the deep throat. Now I'd like to point out that I, as a man, absolutely love being deep throated in real life and I love seeing it in porn. While I realize that different people have different gag reflexes, I found this to be very god damn difficult! At first as she toyed with me by pushing the head of the strapon just behind the back of my tongue I thought that I was doing fine. But as she progressively began to force it deeper and deeper I began to realize just what it takes to take something down my throat. And my appreciation for the skills of my favorite pornstars and my previous sexual partners immediately began to skyrocket! As my eyes started to water from the gagging and with her still demanding that I deep throat her cock, I couldn't keep swallowing the whole thing and instead of taking it into my throat I thought that I would be clever and instead took the strapon in behind my cheek while pretending to actually swallow it. The Mistress caught on to what I was doing very quickly and immediately pulled out, slapped me across the face, spat on me and started swearing at me for being lazy and not doing my job properly. It's one thing to love having a girl deep throat your cock, but being forced to do it made me realize just how difficult it is to do, and how that sexy gagging sound which women make when giving head is not very nice to the giver. Teary eyes, saliva running down both corners of the mouth and being a breath away from throwing up is rather difficult to enjoy. Now as for being spat on and called horrible names, I gotta say, I found that to be very very enjoyable. Having her force me to admit just what a ""nasty little whore"" I am, that made me hard. And now to the strapon. After she removed the little butt plug which she inserted inside me at the start of the session in order to ""get me ready"", as she put it, she began to go to town. She started with a 6 inch attachment which she was already wearing and was rather gentle at first. I was placed in the doggy style position and was rather gently fucked by her as she made verbal remarks about how slutty I was which I found to be rather enjoyable. Shortly after, she demanded that I pick up a large dildo which she had placed before me and demanded that I start sucking it so she can watch me in the mirror which was hanging before the bench on which I was positioned as she fucked me. Once again, her fucking me felt great, me having to suck onto something while doing it, not so much let along having to pretend to enjoy sucking it as she demanded. Then as I was placed in a missionary position the Mistress upgraded her strapon to a 7 inch attachment of a considerably bigger girth. She then ripped off the panties which I was wearing and shoved them in my mouth demanding that I keep them there. This was followed by a shower of spit from her mouth. The spit was raining on my face, on my chest and on my cock. This too I found to be very pleasant and arousing right up to the point when she slid her new attachment inside me. The difference in girth was felt immediately. She was kind enough to go easy on me for a little while but soon picked up the pace and began to simply pound me into oblivion, the sensation kept drifting between pleasure to pain and to pleasure again all while being showered with insults and accusations of being a horrible dirty slut all while she demanded that I confess to her how much I love it. This part, I was 50/50 about. While the insults felt great, being penetrated so thoroughly with something of that size and it feeling fantastic one second and painful the next made me remember all those times when I was penetrating my partners anally and having them complain of being in pain, which only made me harder and turned me on that little bit more. After 4 to 8 minutes of this, another attachment change took place. Mistress made sure to show me the attachment by forcing me to suck it prior to inserting it inside me. This bad boy was somewhere around 8 inches but the girth was incredibly intimidating! I could barely get my mouth around it. But given the size and luckily for me, Mistress was rather gentle once she was inside me. Once it was inserted her thrusts were very gentle, which made it clear that she was using the attachment purely to stretch me that extra bit, not to deliberately hurt me. As she continued to gently thrust me while stroking my cock, and I must say that her stroking skills were exquisite, I continued to confess just how much of a nasty, dirty slut I was. Then finally enough I came! As I came my cock was intentionally directed by my Mistress in a way which assured that my cum hit my stomach and a part of my chest. While still inside me she instructed me to quickly open my mouth and after collecting what seemed every last drop with her glove covered fingers she transferred it all into my mouth, at which point I was instructed to play with it with my tongue before finally being instructed to swallow it. Now this part I absolutely hated! The way my cum felt in my mouth, the way it cooled down so quickly and went from being all warm to disgustingly cool in my mouth was really quite revolting. It felt like swallowing snot. And yes, I know that generally mediately after a man cums his arousal levels plummet and any thoughts or willingness of performing such acts disappears mediately, but I soldiered on and went through with it. But man, was it hard and unpleasant. The amount of times I jerked off to bukakke videos whispering about how hot it was that the woman's face was covered in cum and how much I loved seeing it pour into her mouth, I immediately thought ""How the hell can you stand this?!"". My own cum was unpleasant. I can't imagine how horrible it would feel to stand there on your knees for 10 minutes while having one load after another deposited on your face while somehow retaining a smile. I really do not know how they do it! Overall, there were some aspects which I enjoyed and others which I didn't. After the session the Mistress and I had a rather long chat as she had some time to kill before her next client and I was able to share my thoughts and feelings with her about what had just taken place. After this experience, I have found a new level of appreciation and respect for the female pornstars whom I enjoy watching so much. Some of the acts which they perform, while looking incredibly hot and sexy in my eyes and actually quite difficult to pull off! Yes, I know that things become easier with experience for them but none the less, what they do is hard! In addition, it has made me think twice about what I ""expect"" and ""demand"" my future sexual partners to do. The obligatory deep throating, cum swallowing and anal poundings just may be replaced with ""hey baby, do you think that you may be comfortable with [insert act]?"" And not being all shitty upset if it is met with an ""I'm not sure"" or a straight out ""No!"". It's one thing to be the one doing it and a completely different thing to have it performed on you! It turns out that something which in my eyes ""was a given"" is in fact a gift of sorts. What some women do to please us men, especially in this day and age where everything is saturated with pornography, at times takes them far outside their comfort zones, and this effort will now be thoroughly appreciated. TL;DR, I (straight male) went to a female Dominatrix and had her fuck me like a pornstar with a strapon performing those acts on me which I enjoy seeing women do in porn. This resulted in a new found appreciation for pornstars and the things women do in bed with us and for us. Have any of you had similar experiences? Have anything to add or discuss? **Edit** Firstly, I would like to say that I did not expect for my post to get this much attention, I therefore did not rush to log back in to check up on how it was doing. Secondly, in response to some of the commenters accusing me of white knighting, I assure you that I had no such intentions when writing my post. As I specified, I simply wanted to share my experience with others and there is no hidden agenda. I quite simply wanted to put my experience down in writing as I believe it will help me reflect on what took place. And thirdly, and most importantly I'd like to address some of the comments which spoke of my lack of empathy. After re-reading my post and thoroughly reading through the comments I must admit, I should have read through the text once more before sharing it, as my word choice in some segments was rather poor. Particularly in sections where I spoke of gagging, it being a given and where it appeared that I took pleasure in the pain or discomfort of my partners. I'd like to clarify that at no point in my life did I take part in any sexual act or an element of one which wasn't consensual and at no point in my life have I received pleasure from the pain of another person, particularly a person who I was in bed with. Me enjoying seeing it on film does not imply that I require for it to be reenacted with my sexual partner, especially against her will. A clear separation between pornography and real life sex must be maintained and I'd like to assure you that I am fully aware of it. My experience during that session was about taking on the role of someone on the other side of the divide between pornography and reality which allowed me the opportunity to learn some lessons along the way."

I've been married for three years now and sex has become difficult and is full of anxiety for me for six months. These are the issues I've narrowed down. She likes spending money, when she's sad she spends more money, when she's broke she makes herself feel better by spending money. I don't like being in debt and this stresses me out as I have to work more and harder. She fights dirty. She uses any vulnerability she can when we fight to come after me with. I don't expose myself anymore or give her new fodder since she'll use it against me. I can't look into her eyes during sex as I am seeing someone who will hurt me given the chance. She's unhealthy and is gaining a lot of weight. I've tried many ways to help but at this point she'd just rather eat ice-cream. The weight doesn't bother me as much as the unhealthiness and knowing that she'll just get heavier and heavier with her habits. We used to have a lot of sex and I could easily bring her many orgasms. But the longer we've been married I've realized that our sex has always been about her and I haven't focused on myself or my own pleasure. She also likes aggressive sex and it seems impersonal. I would like to be able to work more on exploring my own pleasure in sex but I am not attracted to her and I do not trust her making exploring ""love making"" a frightening concept. Sex with her makes me anxious and most of the time I do not orgasm. I feel like I must live up to the sex I used to give her, giving her many orgasms. I thought my sex drive was getting low but I am still attracted to others and have normal erections throughout the day. I know I have many relationship issues and I am working on them, but I am here to gain insight on sex in these situations by people with knowledge and experience. How do you get back into having sex with people that you have had many issues with and are not really attracted to? Am I looking at this the wrong way? I am always so in my head now and developing issues that I never had with other partners. "

There are so many things going on and so many thoughts I am having that i dont know where to begin. There are two problems: *I am not having very good sex with my boyfriend *It might be because I am a fucking pervert I (23) have only come three times in presence of my boyfriend (35) in the 2.5 years that we have been together. All those times have been when I can touched myself and he has been lying next to me caressing my boobs and kissing me. Intercourse feels a different kind of good and sometimes feel like I could come from it but the feeling is too intense for me to actually be able to come. I like sex, I like pleasing my boyfriend but I am getting getting really frustrated. I tell myself that he is a wonderful man, that sex is a small part of a relationship and its ok that I dont come but there are times like this where I just feel intensely overwhelmed with hurt. He is my first and hopefully only boyfriend and I feel like I should be having intense passionate sex with him. I want what people in movies and books have. Are they all fake? Do women actually like sex? I tell myself that maybe sex isnt really geared for women. I also resent my boyfriend for not turning me on. When hes turned on, he will get on top of me and we kiss and we keep kissing until I tell him to put it inside me. We fuck and he comes and collapses on top of me and I kiss and caress him whispering that I love him. I do, I feel a lot of love and emotion after he comes. It feels good. But what about me. Should he not be turning me on and helping me have more fun? He has gone down on me twice and I doesn't feel great when he does that. Also, both times he has done that, I have ended up getting some sort of pimple down there. When he touches me with his hand, it feels like he doesnt know what a vagina looks like. He just touches wherever. I know I should help him and show him where it feels good but thats not me. Its not a turn on if I have to teach him like hes inexperienced. He has had other girlfriends before. I was attracted to him because of his age and because I thought he would be so much more experienced. When I think about teaching him, I am turned off completely and I dont know where feels good anymore. its pointless. I need him to know more to be more confident and I have told him this and he goes and reads some books about what feels good for women but I dont see the results. On to my second problem; I can come from touching myself really easily when watching porn. I think that maybe the type of porn I like isnt healthy and causing problem for us. I like porn where the girls are vulnerable or are made to feel vulnerable. I love it and it turns me on so much to watch porn where the actress is touched and made to feel like a pervert for wanting to be touched or for feeling good from being touched, or when they are touched supposedly in an non-sexual manner but the girls are getting off that. I can get off normal girl guy porn where they seem to be on an equal footing, a partnership but my mind goes wild when I watch porn where there is that element of vulnerability. I have to admit something disgusting here too. I wonder if I might actually be a pedo. I sometimes look at anime comic porn also and I always go for incestous porn between father and daughter. I dont think I will ever look at real life adult child porn, that makes me sick to my stomach, but with anime I dont feel wrong for watching it. I have thought about this a lot but anime removes all the hurt and fucked up-ness of sexual relations between child and adult. I am aware of all that and I dont think I could ever be turned on watching that happen between real humans. I think again, its the element of vulnerability that draws me to that. Even more fucked up is that I might be curious to touch a girl and be touched by a girl. I think that because I think they will know what feels good and I know what feels good wed be great sexual partners? I dont know. I know that when I first discovered porn, I was more excited by the sight of pussies and boobs than dicks. Actually, seeing a naked man freaked me out a little and made me feel uncomfortable. I definitely like penises though. I am just a little bit curious about what its like to be with a girl. Another side of this is that sometimes I fantasise about having a penis. I want to feel what a pussy feels like. What the fuck is wrong with me? I am definitely not normal and I dont know what the fuck to do. Help."
275,vulnerability,sex,The Possible Underlying Reason Men Enjoy Intercourse,0,2uis98,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2uis98/the_possible_underlying_reason_men_enjoy/,2015-02-03 02:09:21,"Hello everyone, today I come at you with one of my own personal revelations. Friends, I've been thinking, why do men love to part-take in sex? Could it be for the carnal/nerve stimulating effect? Possibly, but I would submit a different idea. I know we all are aware of the global stereotype of men constantly wanting sex and how we can be pigs. Though, what I believe is the truth, that both men and women get wrong is that it's not sex itself, but physical intimacy. Now you're probably wondering what the difference is between sex and P.I. Look around and observe, men have barely any significant outlets for affection. Observe, however, that what men lack women have in abundance. Women are for the most part showered, supported, validated, and given said affection. Women are able to easily get this 'stimulation' from friends and family of both gender groups. Men on the other hand, receive very little affection, save from our own mothers, sisters, and lovers. The women have an entire support network to keep them jovial. People, I submit that maybe the reason men enjoy sex so much is that it is one of the only, if not the only major avenue for men to find respite, since men carry some form of stoicism. We men do not vent as much, we do not embrace as much, and we certainly do not pour out our hearts as much, as the female gender. This may be why so many women are overwhelmed by their partners libido, sexual nature, or the 'male sexuality'. In truth, I feel this is why men confuse women so much with our sex drives, women may fail to realize what they have, as befalls human nature (this is not a personal attack). It's just that it's been this way for a long time. Note the case of widows and widowers; I have read and studied an article (which I do not have, sorry) that says male survivors tend to more quickly than the widow. Why? I have read form others how it is because the widows have other sources of intimacy and venting. If you lost the only person who you felt comfortable around both physically and emotionally you to may desire a quicker death. Fellow Redditors, I end this thought asking you to consider is it any wonder why men enjoy sex? Sometimes we can only seem to connect with the partner we have settled down with, because we have chosen them to be entrusted with what vulnerability we can muster up. You might just be our only source of validation, please keep this in mind ladies when we desire your time. Thank you and please share your opinions cordially. TL;DR - Men have few outlets other than our partners. "

I recently got involved with a friend. We are just fooling around, and I've given him oral, he's fingered me, but nothing past that. I'm staunchly waiting on sex for marriage and he knows of and accepts my decision. He's far more sexually experienced than I am. In fact, this is the most sexual I've ever been in my entire life by far. He's a nice guy and wants me to communicate with him about what I want out of fooling around with him, whether there's anything I want him to do, etc. He knows I have a ridiculously low sex drive. I'm having fun exploring taking him in my mouth, swallowing, having him cum on me, all new things. But I'm afraid to have a conversation with him about what I want for a couple of reasons. First, I don't like being vulnerable. I don't like the feeling of vulnerability, embarrassment, and even a little shame I get when I talk about stuff like that. Second, I truly don't know what I want. All of this is new. I've never orgasmed before. I don't know what feels good. I like hardcore BDSM porn but I can count the number of times I've masturbated on one hand. I've never been good at relaxing. What do, sexxit?"

(21,F)",6,2sgb9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2sgb9c/any_advice_possible_sex_addiction_and_how_to_cope/,2015-01-15 09:53:49,"I've been wanting to get help for awhile now, but have always been ashamed and embarrassed by the possibility of having a sex addiction. I'm a 21 year old female, married with no kids. For as long as I remember, I have been obsessed with the idea of having sex. I started masturbating at an early age, and do so almost everyday when I get the chance. I've been in several relationships before my marriage, and was sexually active with most of them. My husband knows this, and is completely accepting of it. Up till I met my husband, I've only had one other partner that could get me to orgasm. However, bad sex has never deterred me and I would still participate even if it means I know I wouldn't get off. Prior to my marriage, I was in a horrible and abusive relationship (physically and mentally), I never had an orgasm throughout the relationship, but was happy to do it as long as he did. My husband is a very understanding man, loves me the way I am, and knows everything about me. We've talked about my possible addiction before but he knows he cannot diagnose me or give me any real advice and refuses to even guess because he is afraid that he would hurt my feelings or trouble me even more which I am completely grateful for. My ""addiction"" does not limit to just vanilla sex, I have a few fetishes as well but nothing illegal of course. The thing is that, I get turned on very often, and usually get extremely upset if there are any unfortunate circumstances that prevents us from having intercourse. I don't throw a temper tantrum, but sometimes I will get so upset that I even feel like crying. My husband can read me like a book, and will apologize, and even when I attempt to assure him that it's not his fault and that I'm okay, he never believes it and neither do I. At this point, I am aware that I sound like a bratty, entitled and bratty wife and that my husband should leave me immediately but I assure you that it is not a case. I do admit that my husband spoils me, sometimes too much, but I have never taken advantage of that and have only ever ""demanded"" for sex. And maybe for him to pick up after our dog because he ""doesn't see"" it sometimes. Aside from getting extremely upset to the point of bursting into tears (privately, I'm not a girl that likes to show vulnerability in any circumstance), I also get extremely horny within minutes after intercourse and am raging to go again. Of course in the real world, this is impossible, and the only thing I can think of is what to do to pass the time till my husband can go again. This really bugs me, and I'm also afraid that it may make my husband feel inadequate. He is quite literally the furthest thing from inadequate, and he knows that he gets me off very well but it still bothers me that it might ever be a thought I his mind. If my husband falls asleep after, I usually lay next to him and masturbate to our videos, or porn. As I type this, I am already thinking of when is a good time to wake him up for our next session. The last was 6 hours ago. I have already masturbated an hour before this. I truly feel ashamed and even dirty for being this way. (I had to fight back tears, and stop typing periodically because I was extremely overwhelmed by this feeling of guilt), and think I really need some advice. Also, tonight we tried and succeeded in anal sex and I now feel an impending addiction to that too. It took me a tremendous amount of courage to type this, so please no trolling or condescending replies. I am a woman who needs sexual advice, and am not here to be condemned. Thank you for reading this! I hope I didn't bore or waste anyone's time. I just need to know I'm not crazy, or find out early, if I am. "

I feel like a virgin but with x38734 hang ups from a past relationship. I once had a very enjoyable sex life but unfortunately, a very unhealthy relationship with my first and only partner led to me associating sex with vulnerability and being used. It's been several months since I had any intimate contact (including masturbation) and I want to create some new memories, and have new experiences. I feel an added pressure because I have been in a LTR before, and had sex, so I feel like I should already be very comfortable and know what I want sexually, but I don't. Having only been with one person before, I have some questions: 1) What if there's something wrong or weird about my body? 2) What if I can't remember how to be 'good' at it? What if I'm doing it 'wrong'? I tried to communicate with my previous partner when I was with him but he did not give much feedback. 3) I have never had an orgasm, how do I explain to someone that it's still very enjoyable to me without the ""finish""? My inability put a lot of pressure on me before, I feel that my partner felt let down in contrast to what he had experienced before or seen in porn.

In between of not having exclusive relationships sometimes I hook up with someone I've known for a short while without wanting anything further. I figured before I hit say...15 partners I'd expect to have gotten married and begin having children. But that would be most in my life time because I've approached getting partners like new friends. They're people with their own sex lives, wants, needs, and preferences, so intimacy is sharing a piece of myself that's not normally seen. To do this 20, 30, 40 times feels like to me would mean there was no time to value the person, maybe even disregarding their attachment to what sex could mean for them. Not only that, how can someone not feel so shattered into a million pieces by letting that many people have a piece of them. Is it a form of a disorder? Do partners of those with 20+ other sex partners feel differently towards the person after they find out, generally? What's different about the attitude towards sharing your genitals then others who think it's more private? What are the real encounters with stds that this has caused in your lives? Does pregnancy and abortion create reality checks ? For men, do you think about who you choose to hook up with could potentially be the mother of your child and be apart of your life forever? Those who can't have the ability to have children, and use protection completely 100% of the time, why do you choose random sex partners over commitment or possibly use masturbation when the urge hits you instead? Some Clarifications about my questions: I wouldn't think it's a disorder. I was curious if anyone had diagnosed themselves or found similarities in their experiences with what could be classified as anything. Other than anything I specifically said was my preference for myself was completely passive to any opinions. I shared something about myself so as to contribute to a topic I began. I have learned that for most of you having sex doesn't mean you give anything to another person. There's infinite amount of ""pieces"" in my analogy, like copy/paste. I feel like I have to explain that nudity and my sexual wants has always been private to only share with sexual partners. It's a trust exercise in them that they won't use my vulnerability against me in the future. I am not naive, I've just been hurt and that trust was violated, but that's my cross to bare so to speak. When I say shattered, it just meant one more ""piece"" is now in the metaphorical hands of your partner to do with as they will. That's allot of trust and optimism in your fellow man. More people more pieces,like cracks in a mirror though it is still whole. My question about commitment was an assumption that ultimately humans would like companions to share emotional, intimate, and life long struggles without repeating that same openness multiple times. For that I am sorry. Also, I learned that there is a large number that only think of their own sex and sexual partners, but there isn't a regard for who they choose to have sex with. I question at what percentage of those would have no remorse for those who regret sleeping with them. Thus this is why I believe the questions regarding others have been skipped over. "

I wouldn't say I am honestly 100% over the break up however I would never take her back at least not anytime soon. In case you are wondering, no cheating was involved or anything of the sort. The break up was due to lack of understanding of each other and unfortunately she thought it was necessary to end the relationship. We were together for 4 years. We graduated high school together and have been through a lot. But one of the biggest was our sexual experience. I trusted her with some of my biggest fantasies and we explored a lot of hers too. We had a very good sex life for the most part. Except when she was constantly swapping birth control. But when she finally got one she liked. We experimented with a lot of different ideas. Such as outfits, positions, role play, hell almost once a week she would be my BDSM submissive for a day. That's when we did a lot of crazy things. But now that the relationship is over, my sex drive at night makes me think of our past experiences and either I have to distract myself or even worse I end up masturbating. I also have a bunch of wild fantasies I want to pursue as well but when I end up thinking about those she ends up popping up in my mind. Also she was exactly my type. Long blonde hair, thick body, big breasts, basically the whole nine yards so that doesn't help either. When ever I think of her know I just immediately try to distract myself but when I have to go to bed so I can get ready for the morning, I have to go to sleep. So I try to watch porn and focus on only that but I don't think it is helping. I'm also working for a Staffing agency so I sometimes I may not work for awhile which gives my lots of spare/alone time. What I mostly do is just school work for college. As well as hacking projects to future my education in Cybersecurity. (Hints the name LUL). And occasional gaming with friends. I really would appreciate some help with this. I really want to keep her out of mind especially when I end up getting riled up. "
