Some sort of Ancient dino ( or a weird DynoLamperflora hybrid made by the dragonkin) But different from other bosses in the game: Should make other skills help with the kill bgh-like Here some ideas: Woodcutting(95): Add ""Ancient trees"" (like a tier above elders) give ""ancient logs"". only in that instance and non-tradable outside of it. \[The logs could be got also by dodging a certain attack of the boss near a tree so u trick him to destroy it\] Hunter(95): If the party has ancient logs, someone with lvl 95 hunter can set a trap that will stun the monster for 10 seconds. ( the tank must lure the monster in)\[but a fisherlvl 90 could get an ""ancient fish"" to use as bait\] Fletching (92): Allows to make darts from the ancient logs these dart apply vulnerability during a few seconds. Herblore(85) : getting poison from frogs to apply to darts or apply to the trap. on darts extend vulnerability. on trap extend the stun for 10 seconds more(can only be done once) Firemaking(90): if the party has firemaker, the logs in the trap can be lighted to apply a damage overtime effect to the creature. Mining(95): Miners can transform a certain rocky location in the arena so if the monster steps in take some dmg, and also unlock a spot for runecrafters and divinators. ( the tank must lure the monster in)\[but a fisher lvl 90 could get an ""ancient fish"" to use as bait\] Crafting(85): the zone prepared by the miners can be further improved so it has a +1 tier effect (stacks with construction) Construction(85): the zone prepared by the miners can be further improved so it has a +1 tier effect (stacks with crafting) Runecrafting (92): the zone prepared by the miners can be imbued with energy so it increases the dmg input of the monster Divination (92): the zone prepared by the miners can be imbued with energy so it reduces the dmg output of the monster &amp;#x200B; Thieving(98): when the monster is stunned in the trap, someone in the party can try to steal from it, if succeeds everyone gets an extra drop when it's done.\[Agility lvl increases the chance of succeed\] **None of the skills is mandatory but gives some benefits. So experienced pvms would feel motivated taking ""skillers with high combat lvls"" to learn bossing and both parts benefit from it.** **Players could just combat it. no other skills involved.** About the effect of the boots: 1: double dazzling shot stacks per hit and ability to use with dw 2: bladed dive when ranging 3: rapid fire behaves like asphyxiate 4: any more ideas?"

First things first, i calculated using 4 minute kills, sometimes you get 3:30's sometimes when you fuck up a blood phase it can get up to 4:50's, so for the sake of this calculation i used 4 minute kills. The gear im using is: Full pernix + eldritch crossbow Scrimshaw of cruelty Nightmare gauntlets Ruby bakriminel (e) bolts for phases 1 / 2 / 3 Dragonstone bakriminel (e) bolts for phase 4 The inventory setup : Elder overloads Super prayer renewal Rune pouch with vuln runes A shieldswitch Adrenaline potion planted feet switch 3 Saradomin brew flasks Magic notepapers in case of Brews/restore drop Ring of vigour Enhanced excalibur 3 prayer flasks 13 blue blubberfishes The calculation (assuming 4 minute kills + banking time lets say 12 kills/h) Nex instance cost for 1 kill = 600k / 12 : 50k Frozen key charge = 10k Shadow nihil (4 minutes) 223.890 gp (at this moment) / 60 \* 4 = 14.926 gp Charge cost (8 per hour) 113.659 gp ea (at this moment) \* 8 / 60 \* 4 = 60.618 gp Scrimshaw of cruelty (180 minutes). 4.444.107 (at this moment) / 180 \* 4 = 98.758 gp Sara brew flasks (usually around 16 sips) : 38.789 per flask / 6 : 6464 per dose \* 16 = 103.437 gp Prayer flasks (usually 5 sips) 12.939 per flask / 6 : 2157 per sip \* 5 = 10.783 gp 13 blubbers in inventory setup but I usually use 12 7274 per blubber \* 12 = 87.288 GP Adrenaline potion (1 sip per kill) 11.746 per potion / 4 = 2937 Elder overload (1 sip per kill) 231.428 / 6 = 38.571 GP Super prayer renewal (1 sip per kill) 20.835 / 6 = 3473 GP Vulnerability (twice per kill) 1.640 per cast \* 2 = 3280 GP Nightmare gauntlets (0,5 % per kill) 300.000 for full repair / 100 / 2 = 1500 GP Ruby bakriminel bolts (e) (about 8 per kill) 4.365 \* 8 = 34.920 GP Dragonstone bakriminel bolts (e) (about 2 per kill) 4.466 \* 2 = 8932 GP Reaper necklace (0.1% per kill) 1 cut onyx repairs 50% 1 onyx costs : 2.314.362 \* 2 = 4.628.724 for 100% 4.628.724 / 100 / 10 = 4.629 GP ***So if you add all of these costs up you end up with a cost of :*** ***534.034 GP !!!!!!!!*** ***The phasmatite stone spirit drop at the moment is worth : 12.460 gp*** ***534.034 - 12.460 = 521.574 GP lost per nex kill when you get this drop*** The point im trying to make with this post is : the cost of PVM is getting ridiculous with archeology's release charges are way too expensive. and with the new 120 herblore saradomin brews are way to expensive. There need to be more ways to make charges so they become cheaper and sara brews need to be more common because the cost is just way too much.

4,vulnerability,runescape,Spellbook rework,1,hnqruu,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/hnqruu/spellbook_rework/,2020-07-09 08:11:47,"There was talk of reworking the ancient, lunar, and seren spellbook. Recently discussed this with clan members and came up with the following ideas: # ANCIENTS **Blood spells -** They are fine in their current state, the sustain is extremely useful in most scenarios and all around useful **Ice spells -** Also fine in their current state, the bind is great for telos and places where bosses can be bound for ice wracking. **Shadow spells -** Realistically, damage mitigation is pretty much a nonfactor in 2020 pvm. Soulsplit flicking is more than enough sustain for any style and pretty much any boss. An armour debuff similar to how blackstone arrows would add great utility and diversity to spells. Having to maintain the debuff stacks would add value to the whole ""spellcasting and utility"" of magic. **Smoke spells -** Again, damage reduction is not important in almost any situation at the moment, especially when it doesnt apply to rago pushback on p5, so this effect doesn't get utilized ever. Giving either addition crit chance, or chance to increase adrenaline rewarded similar to inspiration or invigorating would be a great way to add value to the smoke spells. &amp;#x200B; # SEREN SPELLS Seren spells were a great concept that never really delivered on their value. Prisms have a lot of potential for raising skill ceiling for individuals and team strategies. Same to aurora spells. &amp;#x200B; **Prism of Reduction -** Something that hasnt really been looked at yet in RS3 is cooldown reduction. Having a similar 6x6 tile radius where people standing inside it would receive 5% ability cooldown reduction would make having a Mager on a team a necessity and takes on the role of utility. Have an added passive for only ONE prism to be placed in an instance at a time to prevent power creep of having multiple different prisms. Also add a cooldown to how often you can cast the Prism spell (1 cast per minute). &amp;#x200B; **Prism of Restoration -** Similar 6x6 tile radius, granting all players within the radius 20% increased familiar effects (active specials deal 20% more damage, passives like ripper demons would grant up to 6% passive damage based on opponents missing health). &amp;#x200B; **Prism of Energy -** Ability to store adrenaline up to 200% while in combat and anyone can""withdraw"" adrenaline. (Functions similar to adrenaline crystals in wars retreat, 25% adrenaline per tick going in and out. Ideally, interaction would not prevent you attacking like seren spirits don't cancel any skilling action) Why would this be useful? Relentless. With the new relentless perk, you can drop your sunshine and bust out all your thresholds, and still have left over adrenaline. Ultimate abilities are equal, if not, less damage than most thresholds. Procing Relentless on a Sunshine or DS and sometimes even Zerk can be unrewarding when you cant use the adrenaline. &amp;#x200B; **Ruby Aurora -** I love the ruby aurora spell as it currently is, I use it at aod a lot because it makes me feel important even though magic contributes like no damage at all. Giving Ruby aurora t92 scaling would be very nice, as well as either increasing the damage ramping from 3% to 4%, or letting the passive affect apply to the caster as well. &amp;#x200B; **Opal Aurora** \- Keep this the same. If you give Prism spells cooldowns, and make them actually useful, people will be diligent about maintaining their prism spells with opal aurora. It then becomes on the caster to be able to swap between ruby aurora spells and opal aurora spells based on what is needed for their team. &amp;#x200B; **Emerald Aurora -** Increased armor penetration for the caster. This spell would be less useful at bosses like aod where its always hammered, but would be valuable at places like telos or rago. Hammering *everywhere* is becoming way too much of a necessity. Having armour penetration for solo bosses would be a great QOL for casual players solo bossers that dont want to bring so many swaps. &amp;#x200B; **Sapphire Aurora** **-** Increases armour rating to surrounding players similar to ruby aurora. While damage mitigation isnt a necessity right now, its important to keep it as an option for players and it does have its place. For all the relic juicers out there, having an increased armour rating when youre 1000 hp on p4 aod is beneficial to not just topple over. Alternative solution: all players within 6x6 tile of the caster will be healed for 10% of the damage dealt TO the caster. Essentially the caster would become like an Ice Asylum ability. (example, caster gets hit for a 2100; all players within 6x6 tiles are healed for 210.) &amp;#x200B; Passives of all 4 aurora spells *SHOULD* be able to stacked with eachother. Raise the skill ceiling for mages in the game. Being able to juggle all buffs should be a challenge and a reward. # LUNARS To be honest, the lunar spellbook gets overlooked for its value. Heal other, cure poison, etc. are quite niche but I use them occasionally and it can save lives. Having lunars act as the ""healers"" spellbook is perfectly fine. Pure utility and no damage. Spells that are currently from lunars are fine how they are (vengeance, disruption shield). Giving it some new additions to the combat circle would give utility to the mage role. &amp;#x200B; I actually dont have any ideas currently but if you have any please leave them in the comments. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # NORMALS There is really just one spell I think needs some love, vulnerability. Mage took a pretty big hit when vuln bombs were released and I think they are a great addition to the game. However, there is literally no benefit to casting vuln from the mage spell book ([For reference](URL on why). So my suggestion is &amp;#x200B; T95 spell **Incapacitate -** applies Vuln, Enfeeble, and Stagger effects on cast. Ideally it would apply 12% increased damage instead of the 10% that vuln currently applies but that may be a bit biased and unbalanced so let me know what you think. &amp;#x200B; Additional note: *Please* make prism spells exclusive to mages. Melee and range should not be able to cast prisms. If mage will ever become the utility role, you cannot keep giving all styles the ability to cast it as well."
5,vulnerability,runescape,Change the special attacks on the Saradomin and Zamorak god staves to bring them up to par with Guthix's,0,hr5uf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/hr5uf1/change_the_special_attacks_on_the_saradomin_and/,2020-07-15 03:31:28,"As it is right now, the Guthix staff is objectively better than its two alternatives, with uses all the way until the late game because of its special attack lowering the enemy's defence and increasing their affinity. It is pretty much indisputably the correct choice of staff from that minigame, and I would like to see the other staves brought up to speed. Their current special attacks aren't *useless* per se, but their uses are very niche and unsuitable for PvM. My initial idea was for Saradomin's staff to reduce the enemy's accuracy or damage dealt, and for Zamorak's to increase their damage taken, but that overlaps with the existing spells Enfeeble, Stagger and Vulnerability. An alternative would be for Saradomin's staff to cause a recoil effect on the enemy, causing them to take damage according to their own damage dealt. Zamorak's could cause a DoT/snare effect, rooting enemies and dealing bleed/poison damage to them. Yet another option would be for Saradomin's staff to place a debuff on enemies that causes them to take increased damage the higher their health is, while Zamorak's would do the opposite and cause them to take more damage as their health gets lower. I must admit that I'm not too inventive with game mechanics, but I'm sure more experienced players could come up with something good and balanced; there are good ideas out there, and items that need updating to get out of the content graveyard. I just want to use a Zamorak staff again..."
6,vulnerability,runescape,Possible ways to make vuln bombs a bit less clunky to utilize?,69,huickd,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/huickd/possible_ways_to_make_vuln_bombs_a_bit_less/,2020-07-20 19:30:56,"Vulnerability bombs still feel somewhat clunky to use. I compiled some suggestions to make them a bit more user-friendly. Not all of these are necessary, they're all workarounds/fixes for a similar issue. 1. Similarly to bladed dive, let vuln bombs ignore player interactions while outside of the wilderness. Currently, it's pretty annoying as u have to right click under people to throw bombs on those tiles. Having bombs ignore players in a similar manner to the bladed dive ability would help as it becomes less of a struggle to throw bombs on the right tile. 2. If throwing a bomb on a boss that is blocking tiles (i.e. you cannot walk on those tiles), you currently have to manually find a good spot to throw these at. This can also be a struggle, especially for those who aren't familiar with the 'true center' of NPC's. I don't know if it's possible, but could this be changed so that throwing a vuln bomb on a blocking NPC (like Yaka, just to give a random example) actually throws the bomb in a good tile rather than just telling you you can't throw a bomb there? 3. Some other kind of suggestion that I've seen pop up a lot but isn't really related to the issue that these other 2 suggestions lean towards. A possible option to throw bombs from the invent rather than the action bar? It's not optimal but I've seen a lot of people requesting it and it doesn't sound like a bad change regardless. Thoughts?"

10,vulnerability,runescape,Someone managed to bypass my authenticator and get into my account without turning it off?,1,ghjo5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/ghjo5n/someone_managed_to_bypass_my_authenticator_and/,2020-05-11 18:26:10,"So I had been taking a break for a few months now on Runescape, I had got burnt out. I forget aboooout when it was I started taking a break, but it was around the time the dino island came out. Anyways that's not important. So I was unaware for like a few months until today when a friend who plays rs messaged me thinking I was on, as he got a notification of me hitting 100m ranged xp. Was like 'what the hell?' and I logged into my account, and yep there it is someone's been on my account and for some reason specifically just to level ranged through I guess an automated bot as I saw I have two offences with 'bot busting' and macroing. By the time I had noticed, those bans had already run it's course. This isn't about appealing those, doesn't really matter. I changed my password and decided to make the best of the bad situation and use the money it grinded to buy a bond and get back into RS. My main concern here however, is that who ever this was who managed to get into my account was able to bypass the authenticator. During this time.. or at least I think, I don't know how long they've been on my account, but the past 3 months I had been watching my email very closely (long story short, during the time my boyfriend was in a situation of only being able to send me letters someone else scanned and emailed to me once a week.) so I would have seen any request to turn off my authenticator so I know my email wasn't also compromised. Even if they somehow were able to, I don't understand why they'd turn it off to get in and then turn it back on, since it was on when I went to log in. *I* actually had to turn it off myself and back on today, since I never got the authenticator on my new phone just on my dead one I still have in here so I could get the authenticator to my new phone. Honestly there is a lot very strange about the whole thing, like they hijacked my account but never changed my password. They didn't fuck around much with my bank, and yeah I know I should have put a pin for extra security.. I am lucky I didn't get it worse. Anyways the only thing in my bank messed with is my melee armour, a bandos set, is gone and I guess they sold it and the rune stockpile I had is really low now. My bank is quite the mess, so there might have been less important stuff missing too and I will never know since it's well.. been a few months since I have been actually on it and have forgotten the importance of a bunch of stuff I have been saving. Anyways back to the point, I am sorry for going on tangents here. I probably shouldn't have written this while tired as I just go off overexplaining everything. I am worried there might be a security vulnerability allowing someone to pass by the authenticator, considering it seemed to have been untouched by whoever hijacked into my account."

13,vulnerability,runescape,Why mage vulning should be 100% accuracy,1,gviplu,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/gviplu/why_mage_vulning_should_be_100_accuracy/,2020-06-03 09:41:04,"&amp;#x200B; # Vuln Bombs **** **Basically 100% accurate**. (yes, it is based off hit chance but it applies it multiple times per throw making it highly unlikely to splash) ** Lossless.** You can throw a vuln bomb and it does not delay your abilities or auto-attacks whatsoever. ** AOE.** You can apply it to multiple targets with one throw at a cost of 10.7k GE value per throw ** It does not cancel detonate to throw it.** **** **It is works with all combat styles.** Vuln was exclusive to magic without IOTH swapping before vuln bombs, now all styles have the ability to use them. **** **10.7k GE value.** Granted, they are more expensive than casting magic vuln, however, it does apply to multiple targets. &amp;#x200B; # Mage vulning **** **Splashes a lot.** One cast is one cast. If it splashes you have to cast it again, and again, and again, and again until it lands. **** **Extremely clunky with spell book swap**. This is the main reason mage vulning is difficult. One misplaced staff auto and you are stuck on lunars for 4 seconds and die **** **Counts as an autoattack**. Unlike vuln bombs, it has a 1 tick cast time. **** **Does not reward 2% adrenaline??** Despite having a cast time and behaving exactly like an autoattack, you do not receive the adrenaline as you have casted an autoattack?? **** **Costly.** Mage vuln costs \~2.6k to cast, and \~6.7k to cast with spellbook swap. Yes, this is less than the value of a vuln bomb at 10.7k, but vuln bomb applies to multiple targets. Most people use borrowed power to cast their vuln, which requires livid points which can be tedious to get as well. &amp;#x200B; Why continue to use mage vulns? Its a preference built on using it for years of playing the game. Having rotations built around the cast delay of using vulnerability is something players just don't want to change. There are better rotations that exist because of vuln bombs, and that is fine. But there should be compromise for players that continue to use mage vulning. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I have no problem with vuln bombs, they were a great addition to the game along with sticky bombs. The problem is when new technology like vuln bombs are introduced, it makes things like mage vulning obsolete. Old content should not become useless just because new releases. It should be balanced around what already exists, or the older content needs to be balanced to compete with new content. Which is why mage vulns should be 100% accurate. There is literally no benefit for choosing to use the spell. In fact, its disadvantageous to cast the spell."

Longspears/orb would also be attuneable to an element prior to or after creation giving it elemental attributes like many staves, see creation for more information. Further unlike traditonal 2h weapons these weapons with melee would have halberd range and 2h abilities BUT use dual wield for range/mage abilities due to the fact players are holding a one handed crossbow and orb \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Creation** As a mix of melee/range melee/mage these weapons would have a hybrid process for creation, all base parts however would begin at a forge Base long spear - all base longspears require a ""case"" metal, and an interior metal to be encased to make them light enough to wield in the field with another weapon occupying your offhand slot, as a result, these spears are all hybrid metals requiring a light alloy metal + stronger ""case"" metal to be functional. All longspears and orbs are equivalent to a max upgrade M/S 2h weapon/1h offhand of its respective metal type, and may only be equipped once paired with a repeater or orb. * Necronium - 5x necro bars + 5x silver bars * Banite - 10x banite bars + 5 mithril bars * Elder rune - 15x elder rune bars + 5 silverith bars &amp;#x200B; Orb - the orbs are all made out of similar materials and forged along side their metal counterpart, to create an orb shell you need the following. * necronium - 3x necro bars + 5 spider silk * Bane - 6x bane bars + 5 batwing * Elder rune - 9x elder rune bars + 15 mystic cloth Orbs can then be either paired with a compatible longspear immediately after completion, or taken to an elemental altar to empower the orb with that elemental ability creating a ""longspear and orb (element here). Elemental affinity lasts for 500 casts or 250 casts if players chose to make a combination orb (requires 2 rune talismans to create like normal combo runes). orb is bound only to longspears and may not be equipped, only combined with a longspear. Attuned orbs paired with a longspear will be named ""Longspear of (element)"" to denote what element they are attuned with, further attuning an orb to an element requires the proper runecrafting level to produce that rune type + a talisman to access and create to begin with, Tali's are consumed when attuning an orb. &amp;#x200B; Crossbow (repeater) - Crossbows are a little different than their orb counterparts, requiring additional parts to create but naturally ending the creative process at the forge like the orb. * Necro - 3x necro bars (limbs) + 1x yew stock (combine off of forge) + 1x cbow string * To combine string and limbs click on an anvil and a new combine option will appear * Bane - 6x bane bars + 1x magic stock, same combination process * Elder rune - 9x elder rune bars + 1 elder stock + 1x cbow string * ""boltless"" enchantment - 500x crossbow bolts (t70/80/90) + unenchanted necro/bane/elder rune cbow + enchant level 4/5/6 depending on crossbow tier being enchanted upon completion repeaters may be immediately paired with completed longspear but may not be used without a longspear, like a traditional cbow however, it consumes bolts if not enchanted. If enchanted it can no longer use bolts keep in mind, but works like a chargebow. longspears that have an enchanted repeater will be specified like the following ""Necronium longspear (e)"" to denote the paired crossbow is enchanted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Proposed drawbacks and advantages** So far sounds pretty overpowered right? Well with great MMO power and flexibility comes staggering drawbacks to ensure it doesn't collapse the pvm/boss economy as we know it. *Drawbacks* * Extremely short duration of use, due to the nature of being an aloy metal and said alloys not being good friends/the instability of t70+ metals to begin with, these paired weapons only last 2 hours before breaking * high input material costs, over 30 bars worth for elder rune + misc items like spider silk and stocks * Forging both items is like forging a level 4-5 (or 3-4 whatever max is for the tier) item for off/mh * magic/range accuracy is only set by the offhand, meaning your ranged/mage abilities are only doing half of what pure dual wield mage/range could do * average attack speed in both forms * unable to shield swap without completely equipping the weapon * hybrid armor or mixed sets are required to properly utilize the weapon due to its nature as a hybrid weapon * mining/smithing equipment, meaning a longspear while equivalent to max upgrade of its respective tier, is statistically inferior to at level pvm sourced gear * t90 gear requires use of Silverith metal requiring acquisition of the metal (which has quest requirements) and prior forging steps to actually making the longspear * enchantment could be theoretically quite pricey due to the requirement of 500 of an equivalent tier bolt, of which options may be very limited (i think bakrimel's are the only normal t80 cbow bolt for example) or very pricey depending on tier, plus access to equivalent level enchantment may make this process unfeasible for many ironmen/pures/self reliant productions * crossbow strings, enough said about trying to buy one of those things, even more so with PoF and RooT spiking the prices of 99% of viable meats up pretty heavily (presuming you're too lazy to go get it yourself or go to an npc store ofc) * weapons are converted like dyed gear/t90 gear to a set amount of coins or salvage (i'm thinking salvage) upon unsafe pvp death * unaugmentable due to being M/S produced equipment * Longspears must be fully charged AND recharged in terms of elemental attunement to be traded ie. a fully recharged (Degradation) longspear that is attuned to air must also be recharged to max 500 casts of air spells to be traded player to player or put back on the G.E. * Elemental attunement requires sacrifice of one or two (depending if a combo attunement or just basic elemental) talismans per attunement, a potentially expensive recharge depending on the markets, more so considering most pure pvm dedicated players do not invest in skilling which may further restrict the flow of attuned spears into the game due to the requirements in runecrafting to make some rune types (like combo runes). *Advantages* * combat style swapping is theoretically only one ability bar switch away * allows melee to use spells like vulnerability or ice barrage making targets easier, to slay especially if they like to run * halberd reach with all variants in melee form, enabling effective use of the alternate style as you can simply keep out of range at all times while enjoying the benefits that 2h melee offers * mining/smithing gear, making it highly accessable * enchanted forms while losing access to bolts have infinite ammo, perfect for players who like to use lunar magic to support. * the ability to theoretically switch between all 3 combat styles would allow players (if using hybrid builds/armor) to theoretically only need 2-3 inventory slots max to completely change combat dynamic ie. two void helmets (presuming use of hybrid boots) and the alternate longspear. * can be repaired with unpaired longspear's/orbs/crossbows at 50% per item, or a used/new longspear may be used to charge another * both a con and a pro, All weapons have m/s bars as their base materials, allowing for relatively easy replacement should one lose one for good. * Longspears attuned to a magical element have two separate degradation mechanics, rune charge and overall weapon charge, meaning you can use a spear set to say, earth, for casting vengeance, and only use charges when using the vengeance spell, and so on, making these a valuable way to keep extra runes, without giving up inventory space or runepouch slots. &amp;#x200B; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Conclusion** The longspear would be a slayer's best friend and quite helpful to players just starting to attempt end game pvm/mid game bosses they may require one or more styles to defeat effectively. It would boast impressive capabilities but be somewhat akin to a ""glass cannon"" type of weapon, strong and effective, but fragile and unsuitable for sustained combat outside of brief skirmishes/a handful of encounters. But, in the right hands a potentially devastating new kind of weapon and perhaps the first step towards truly diversifying combat in runescape, with the introduction of the first true hybrid weapons since pre evolution of combat nearly ten years ago."
16,vulnerability,runescape,Content update; Fire barrels and combination throwable bombs,1,f6zbif,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/f6zbif/content_update_fire_barrels_and_combination/,2020-02-21 07:38:39,"I feel bombs are so underutilized, they're one of the single best updates to herblore i think RS3 has ever received being a massive inventory saver and allowing players to use more useful spells like disruption shield without giving up access to vital spells like vulnerability. But i feel they're so under developed compared to the rest of what 120 herb had to offer so, may i present several ideas, a deployable bomb + combo throwable bombs. &amp;#x200B; \*note one new ingredient would be needed to be added to PoF from dragons, dragonfire glands to make one of the new bombs. &amp;#x200B; # New proposed bombs and barrel bombs. \*note all barrel type explosives would be capable of damaging/inflicting damage or negative effects on the user as well as enemy targets. **Fire barrel (110 herblore)** 1x barrel + 10x bomb vials + 5 sulpher + 2 Nitroglycerine + 5 primal extract +1 spark chitin Upon deployment these barrels will count down from 5, upon hitting 0 the bomb will detonate in a 4x4 area dealing 5000(1000 pvp) typeless damage, and leaving a slow burn effect that will deal 50 damage a tick for 5 ticks before dissipating. Due to the untradeable nature of the materials used in the bulk of this items creation it would not be tradeable. **Poison Barrel (100 herblore)** 1x barrel + 10x bomb vials + 5 sulpher + 15 poison slime + 3 primal extract + 1 spark chitin + 1 Poison+++ Poison barrels would be a one time use bomb that like fire barrels tick down from 5 before detonating dealing 2500 (1000 pvp) poison damage and inflicting poison +++. Unlike fire barrels no AOE DoT effect is left over after detonation but, it leaves a ""poisoned ground"" effect that would increase poison damage by 15% while targets remain inside the area, making this a perfect bomb to pair with sticky bombs or similar bind effects. as with the fire barrel, this bomb is untradeable **Fire Bomb (105 herblore)** Fire bombs are the weaker but more versatile cousin of fire barrels, they would be designed primarily around DoT instead of outright damage on detonation they'd be focused on doing high damage in a small but short lived 2x2 area. Suggested damage; 800 per tick over 5 seconds, targets leaving the burned area will also have a dot applied for 3 seconds doing 50 damage a tick. 1x bomb vial + 100 fire runes + 3 primal extracts + 1 beak snot **Dragonfire Bomb (118 herblore)** Dragonfire Bombs are the bigger, more dangerous version of fire bombs, made with crushed dragonstone, sticky beak snot, and a firegland these bombs are different from normal firebombs, they're single target, but inflict a massive burst of dragonfire damage, that even dragons wouldn't be completely immune to. This devastating bomb would deal 3000 (1200 in pvp or 575 with super antifire) damage and once thrown damage a single target before leaving a slow burn Dot effect dealing 100 damage a tick for 5 ticks. due to the nature of these bombs, you will receive a 2 minuet cool down upon throwing one. 1x bomb vial + 10x cosmic runes + 5 primal extract + 1x dragonfire gland + 1x beak snot \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Combo items. **Sticky poison bomb (106 herblore)** Like it says on the tin a mix of the sticky and poison bombs, nothing more. 1x bomb vial + 1x sticky bomb + 1x poison bomb + 2 primal extracts **Sinister bomb (112) herblore** Sinister bombs would be a mix of vulnerability and poison 1x bomb vial + 1x Poison bomb + 1x vulnribility bomb + 1 beak snot + 1 primal extract **Anti mobility bomb (115 herblore)** Anti mobility bombs would be a mix of fire and sticky bombs 1x bomb vial + 1x fire bomb + 1x sticky bomb + 3 spark chitin **Cascade bomb (118 herblore)** A mixture of vulnerability and dragonfire bombs increasing the lethality of the dragonfire by 5% 1x bomb vial + 1x dragonfire bomb + 1x vulnerability bomb + 3 bottled dinosaur roar **Powerburst bomb (120 herblore)** a mixture of the fire bomb and powerburst of vitality, allows players to give the effect of the powerburst of vitality for 3 seconds without triggering the other players cooldown (but triggering your own). 1x bomb vial + 1x powerburst of vitality + 1x dragonfire Firebomb + 5x spark chitin + 1x primal extract \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ And that's about it, a few more bombs to flesh out herblore 120's great but very small bomb register.

1x cave eel and 1x sanfew serum dose, this would apply the effects of sanfew, heal about 1200 hp and add an added benefit of lowering tolerance time in pvm, making these useful for extended trips in decidedly hostile places like living wyvern. these may stack up to 6 per inventory slot * Zogre - 1x searing or tortured ashes + any big game hunter meat. increases the chance of receiving a PoF animal of that big game hunters meat type (ie if you use bagrada rex meat you have a higher chance to get the rex and it would read bagrada rex offering or something like that). lasts 30 minuets per offering. * Gorilla - 1x super strength and 1x desert sole, heals around 1400 hp while providing a flat + 16 strength boost putting it nearly on par with extreme strength however, these do not stack making potions more effective outside of short runs/healing items. * ninja - sacred oil + adrenaline + guthix rest, provides a special damage reduction buff that increases your armor rating for 10 minuets, players may only use one per 15 minuets (i cant decide how much the buff should be) this requires a 4 dose of each + bones also. due to the use of adren potions this bone type is untradeable. * skeleton monkey - beltfish and super antipoison, these bones will heal as much as a beltfish and provide a whopping 18 minuets of antipoison, at the cost you can only apply 1 dose per 18 min, these would stack up to 5 per outside of bank stack. also players redose timer will not decrease if your poison resistance is eroded. * Fayrg -

1x overload dose + 1x sailfish soup + 1x stamina potion + 1x consicrated ninja monkey bones, provides an overload effect while also benifiting from the effects of ninja bones AND healing 3k hp or boosting max hp to 12k hp if at full hp, making this a top but hard to create healing item, these may not be traded + the effect of monkey (1 per 15 minuet) applies as well making this a useful but costly item to create, further a cooking level of 104 is required requiring extreme cooking to create as well * Graardor - based off the new bomb types, players may combine 1x poison bomb and 1x vulnerability bomb to make Bandosian bone bombs, these combine the effects of both bombs AND add a bleed effect to the target. you may throw a maximum of three of these every two minuets. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Skill restrictions/limitations so this sounds pretty OP right? well here's the bad news, for balance reasons, there needs to be an additon called ""spiritual sickness"" a debuff that prevents you from burying any more consicrated bones and gaining their benefits for a time period (if the bones of choice dont have a pre built in restriction already) so here's what im thinking **base useage limitations** there should be a base limiting factor of some sort, say a % gauge, basic bones count for 1% each, then more advanced bones count for say 5% scaling until you hit Reinforced/sailfish which count for maybe about 30% each severely limiting how many can be used in short time periods (say per 6 minuets?) &amp;#x200B; **Unlocking consecration** now sucking the spirtiual energy out of offerings to the dead is.. unnatural to say the least, as a result, i'd like basic consecration to be tied to Restless ghost, and special bones tied to dimension of disaster or Children of mah given how strong special are proposed to be. that being said, using any tradeable consecrated bones would not require any quests, just skills. &amp;#x200B; **Skill requirements** as a result of how strong these could potentially be * you must have +5 cooking to all but sailfish and rocktail (which requires 99) * \+ 5 the base herblore requirement of the potions being used * an associated prayer level starting at 5 for basic bones, requiring + 10 levels for every bone type to 99 for reinforced to create them * no prayer herb or cooking requirement to use ones you or others create * Players ability to bury will be directly influenced by prayer, ie, if you have 99 prayer you can bury say 4 max consecrated sailfish before entering cool down, but someone at level 10 prayer couldnt even bury one, i'll leave the ratios of what per level sounds fair but this absolutely must be a thing. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # suggested xp curve as a result of the large list of items even the basic bones require all bones should grant 2x burial xp, 50% of cooking xp for the primary fish used, and 50% of completed potion xp of the potions used in each step.

If I came across as being dismissive last time, that's my bad. I'm sorry about that. What I meant though, is that it's an important part of how players express themselves through the avatar in Runescape and it adds to the vibrancy of the world. I would like to see more cosmetics in the game just delivered in a way players are happy with.) &gt; ^(That's also what alot of players have been saying. So there's a bit of a conflict if we're saying we want more cosmetics, whether its more cosmetics on TH/SGS but at the same time asking whether it's possible to turn them off is a bit of a conflict there. So it's not something we are pursuing at the moment. I didn't want to be dismissive about it because a lot of players have asked about it in the past and a lot of people have suggested it in the past.) **Milking Players - ""Other Companies are worse than us""** &gt; ^(I think the thing about being better than other companies or not as bad as other companies is a bad a way to put it. So my hands up there. I think what I was trying to say, I think I do want us to take a more of a responsible position on it and to be a kind of leader rather than just following what other companies do. So we try and keep track of what's going on in others areas of the industry. We work really closely with Ukie, the trade organizations for games in the UK. And we work with them to make sure we are following their recommendations and what they would advice.

24,vulnerability,runescape,Spitballing some new Special Attack ideas for high-level weapons.,25,dhsd0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/dhsd0w/spitballing_some_new_special_attack_ideas_for/,2019-10-15 02:43:25,"So with the dumpster fire that was weapon diversity recently being extinguished, I've been thinking about ways to promote weapon diversity without just dumping a ton of free power creep and switchscape on us, and I think one potential way to explore doing that is with special attacks. So because I'm bored and have literally nothing better to do with my time right now, I decided to come up with some ideas for special attacks for high level weapons (T85+) that currently lack them. I tried to avoid effects that would result in unnecessary power creep, and instead focus on effects that are more niche and might only be useful in certain circumstances (but would be very useful in those circumstances). I also tried to keep them thematically consistent. The special attacks are often based on attacks from the monster that drops them, or in the case of ports weapons, tend to be defensive effects to match the defensive nature of Ports armor. They tend to have 60 second cooldowns and their effects usually end early if the weapon is removed, not only to limit power creep but also to limit the amount of switches you'd have to perform to get optimal usage out of them. The specs could also require the appropriate offhand in the case of one-handed weapons, but I seem to remember there being a technical issue that made this difficult to do. On the other hand, it was done with Dragon Claws somehow. **Blightbound Crossbow:** Name: *Blight Bond* Costs 25% Adrenaline. For 10 seconds, 50% of all Ranged damage you deal will be converted to Blight damage. For example, if a Ranged ability would have done 2000 damage, it will instead deal 1000 Ranged damage and 1000 Blight damage. This would be useful for bypassing soft caps and could see some use in PvP, but overall isn't amazingly useful as Ranged already has a couple of great high level spec weapons in the Eldritch Crossbow and Seren Godbow. **Praesul Wand** Name: *Power of the Elements* Costs 50% Adrenaline. Could possibly be more if deemed necessary. Has a 60 second cooldown. Fire a magical blast that deals up to 220% weapon damage, and randomly applies one of 4 Ancient Magic effects. If the Blood effect is chosen, 10% of the damage dealt is returned as health. If the Ice effect is chosen, the target is stunned for 4 ticks (2.4 seconds) and bound for 10 ticks (6 seconds). If the Shadow or Smoke effects are chosen, the corresponding Enfeeble/Stagger (10% debuff) effect is applied for 15 seconds. If the random nature of the effect is undesirable, perhaps it could be based on what spell you have set when you use the spec (Fire/Blood causes Blood effect, Water/Ice causes Ice effect, etc.). The high adrenaline cost of this special attack for relatively mediocre damage output makes me think it would probably only be used at places where adrenaline isn't really a concern, such as Telos while standing in the green beam. **Khopesh of Tumeken** Name: I have no idea. (Sun's Reach? Light of Tumeken?) Costs 25% Adrenaline. Has a 60 second cooldown. Could possibly share this cooldown with Zaros Godsword and Ripper Claws's specs? For 15 seconds, your Melee attacks have a range of 8 squares. This could be visualized as your attacks firing waves of light that deal Melee damage at a range. This effect ends instantly if you remove the Khopesh of Tumeken. Being able to use melee from a distance is quite a powerful effect in many circumstances and would have a good few niche uses, such as being able to use Onslaught with melee at phase 5 Vorago, but it's also not direct power creep in most circumstances. **Death Lotus Dart &amp; Superior Death Lotus Dart** Name: No idea (Blinding Strike? No really, I legit don't know for this one lol). Costs 20% Adrenaline. For 15 seconds, every successful Ranged attack will apply a stack of Blindness to the target, and refresh the duration of any existing stacks of Blindness. Each stack of Blindness will reduce the target's hitchance by 1%, and up to 15 stacks can be applied. Blindness stacks will last for 30 seconds after the last stack was applied, after which they will all be removed at once. The effects of this special attack end instantly if you remove the Death Lotus Dart, but the stacks of Blindness persist until they would normally fade. **Seasinger Kiba &amp; Superior Seasinger Kiba** Name: ... I'm not good with names, okay? (Ocean's Resolution, maybe?) Costs 100% Adrenaline. Has a 60 second cooldown. For 15 seconds, you are immune to all debuffs, including stuns, binds, and Vulnerability/Enfeeble/Stagger effects. Bosses that apply enrage/damage stacks (Beastmaster Durzag, Yakamaru, and Nex: Angel of Death) will not apply any new stacks during this period, but any existing stacks will still take effect. This effect ends instantly if you remove the Seasinger Kiba/Superior Seasinger Kiba. **Tetsu Katana &amp; Superior Tetsu Katana** Name: *Honorbound* Costs 50% Adrenaline. Has a 120 second cooldown. For 15 seconds, your target inflicts 50% less damage on you if you are in front of them (I.E. in a position where you would not be affected by the Flanking perk). If you are not in front of them, they inflict 50% more damage. The Tetsu Katana *cannot* be unequipped during this period. **Wyvern Crossbow** Name: *Wyvern Venom* Costs 50% Adrenaline. Has a 60 second cooldown. Fire an attack that deals up to 188% weapon damage. If it successfully hits, the target's immunity to poison (if it has any) is lifted for 15 seconds and poison is inflicted. Ideally, this should affect bosses if possible. Perhaps bosses could take reduced damage from the poison. **Camel Staff:** Name: *Sandstorm* Costs 30% Adrenaline. Has a 60 second cooldown. Summon a whirlwind that deals up to 220% weapon damage over the course of 6 seconds. Similar to a Camel Warrior's whirlwind, the damage should start low and ramp up over time, and the target moving away from the whirlwind should instantly end its effects. **Ripper Claw:** Name: *Rip and Tear* (or like Ripper's Fury or something if that's a copyright issue lol) Costs 50% Adrenaline. Has a 60 second cooldown, which is shared with the Zaros Godsword's spec (and possibly the Khopesh of Tumeken as well). For 15 seconds, Bladed Dive's cooldown is reduced by 50% (should stack with Mobile), and all melee attacks are converted to 3 hits, each dealing 40% of the original damage (resulting in a net 20% damage boost, potentially more against opponents with a damage cap). Bleed abilities are unaffected by this effect. Removing the Ripper Claw or using the Berserk ability will instantly end the effect. This serves as a cheaper but more limited alternative to the Zaros Godsword, but shares a cooldown with it to prevent unnecessary power creep. Also mandatory DOOM reference. Anyways, this post is more or less just for fun, and to explore the idea of new weapon special attacks to promote weapon diversity and give currently useless/undesirable weapons a valid niche. I'd be interested in not only your opinions on these specific effects but also your opinions on the entire concept in general."
25,vulnerability,runescape,Greater/mutated versions of Magic Spells (like greater abilities),4,dpc3r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/dpc3r9/greatermutated_versions_of_magic_spells_like/,2019-10-31 07:12:31,"We've seen melee and ranged combat get a few 'greater' ability codices, bumping up the power of some standard abilities, while mage has languished on its dusty throne with minor gifts here and there like blast diffusion boots. But that's not the point here. I'm thinking that this is the opportunity to step in and help the direction of magic by providing straight up buffs/changes to some of the spells themselves, abilities aside. There is room for Greater versions of spells, essentially. Here are some examples, focusing on the Lunar spellbook: Boost Potion Share: currently shares the effects of a handful of lesser potions, but cant share untradable boosts like overloads. A Greater Boost Potion Share spell would be able to share a dose of overloads. Perhaps the advanced overloads cant be shared unless the recipients have also unlocked the recipe to make them themselves. Heal Other: It currently interrupts someone channeling Onslaught. A Greater Heal Other would not. You might unlock this spell by also unlocking Onslaught yourself. Spiritualise Food: Can only be used once per familiar. An enhanced version would be to remove this singular use limit, allowing for a more continuous buffing of summoned creatures. This greater version might be unlocked with the purchase of the Spirit Cape, for example, or gotten through Temple Trekking (read: ouroboros pouch). Finally, bring back Energy Transfer (simply limit it to non PvP). And maybe add in a new spell for sharing non-stat buff potions, such as poison and adrenaline? These sort of changes could serve to increase the Lunar Spellbooks vision as a support style spellbook. You could do a similar thing with the standard spellbook: Greater Bones to Bananas spells, extended duration for Greater Vulnerability the idea is to make small tweaks that have little direct impact on power numbers, but give room for expanded magic utility. I'd love to hear other ideas about spells that could have a slight boost in effect with a greater version. Most of my ideas are themed around removing restrictions that seem arbitrary to me (untradable potion restriction, canceling onslaught restriction, single use spiritualise food restriction, etc..), but there could also be real modifications to spells such as Teleport Group affecting everyone in a 9x9 square instead of 3x3."

29,vulnerability,runescape,Question for PKers: highly successful wins from a PKer with high DPS. normal or strange?,0,ctht7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/ctht7u/question_for_pkers_highly_successful_wins_from_a/,2019-08-22 00:41:52,The other day I had a dual was another player that was highly successful in a number of wins. One of their tactics was to be in the same spot where the other player was and then start attacking with abilities that stun the player then cast vulnerability spell. He was wearing high tier mage outfit with the highest tier mage staff and switch to a shield between attacks. I found that the players DPS was unusually high but they were also using curses to lower the other players defenses. I wanted to get an analysis and opinion from other PKers. What they think of this situation and also to give advice for those that are not Into PKing what they can learn to be more successful in PKing.

Other styles have been buffed to make them easily outclass magic in most cases at most bosses. Spellbook swap and pouches have made most of the utility magic users had are also available to range and melee users, even ingenuity helps with vulnerability. The few things magic does have are ancient spells utility, being aoe or secondary effects (pretty much only at telos tho lol). Magic, even with 4ticking, is barely on par with what range and melee are able to output nowadays. This is not a post asking for magic buffs, but more to stop with this ""magic is overpowered"" nonsense that keeps going on."

(As in, when you use a new challenge token, not when activating the ballistas) * Poison frog elimination effects are cancelled (From frog repellant, hunter lodge 3). * Added detection time cancelled (from hunter lodge 2). * The challenge token is consumed upon use, so no retries. For the following benefits: * Always gives intact dinosaur hides. * 3x the drops on every dinosaur, but disables multiple dino bonus. (Also doesn't apply to dino hide, bones and meat, as to prevent overloading the inventory) * For unique drops, gives 3x the chance of receiving the drop instead of number of drops (ex. no triple totem or maul pieces). * And of course giving higher number of dinosaurs is a bonus in itself for achievement hunters and people looking for a challenge. &amp;#x200B; Of course this is all subject to change."

33,vulnerability,runescape,Weapon Diversity should not just be flat DPS increases,37,cml292,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/cml292/weapon_diversity_should_not_just_be_flat_dps/,2019-08-06 13:00:48,"Things like Fire Spells in the current state of weapon diversity are just flat DPS increases in every single scenario they are used. How is this adding a niche? It's not, it just adds DPS always. Here are a few ideas: **Fire Spells:** I should be clear that these effects should only occur with auto attacks, just like ancients - The bleed effect of Fire Spells can spread from the main target to others on nearby tiles, without bleeding the main target **Air Spells:** Air Spells can bind bindable targets. Only for a single tick, but have no cooldown to their usage. This might be worth being different in PVP **Water Spells:** The current effect in essence is fine, but it's just so convoluted. How about instead, Water Spells heal and they heal more the closer you are to your opponent. **Earth Spells:** Earth spells stun (even at Yakamaru) but on a cooldown, say every 10 seconds. **Wand/Orb:** Genuinely not sure if this is already the effect, but a perfect one for Wand/Orb would be the ability to apply 3 tick debuffs like Vulnerability. **Staff:** Doesn't really need a niche if we're honest. But one could be that the the spell effects are stronger with the staff, like Water spells heal more, Fire spell bleeds are stronger, etc. **Crossbows:** Goddammit, they already have a niche in being able to use Bakriminel bolts. They absolutely don't need more. It would be like trying to buff Halberds with weapon diversity saying that they have no niche **Shortbows:** The current effect is dumb, stop increasing DPS directly. In this case, increase accuracy. Also, make it an exchange. Say the total upgrade is 5% when you're 1 tile away. If you're maximum tiles away, you have -5% accuracy. **Shieldbows:** It's already a shield and a bow combined. That's its niche. Please for the love of god don't add to switchscape by giving it an effect unique to certain abilities **Longbows:** They have extra range. These are just some suggestions, but you'll notice they aren't just flat dps upgrades in every situation. The other things is that melee weapons don't all need a niche. Lump them in together. Melee has Daggers, Shortswords, 2h swords, Longswords, Scimitars, Mauls, Maces (which incidentally already have a niche of having prayer bonus but whatever), Spears, Hastae, Whips, and probably more I've forgotten. Surely we can lump Shortswords, Longswords, and Scimitars with the same effects. The main thing to know is that anything requiring a switch just for certain abilities is awful, and that RNG effects are too. If this means delaying this update even for a few months, then do it. This is a HUGE update, Jagex. Don't rush a massive combat update again. Or the exact same thing will happen as last time."
34,vulnerability,runescape,An unneeded nerf to the good sigils and an untaken opportunity for the other vital spark sigils,1,cmwyf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/cmwyf7/an_unneeded_nerf_to_the_good_sigils_and_an/,2019-08-07 08:09:53,"Currently, the sigils are being turned into abilities through an ability codex system. This automatically bars legacy users from using these effects, which many can be useful for certain legacy feats, (Ingenuity of Humans), or even something general, like the golden touch sigil (which could be made reasonable to use by changing the pricing to create it), can no longer be used by legacy users. Another thing to note is that these new abilities consume a GCD on release, which automatically heavily nerfs the viability of even using the limitless sigil (essentially the strongest one), giving up an entire GCD that could have offered significant damage, such as a 188% ability during a zerk (4-15k damage ish), for literally 1.8 seconds of nothing. These 1.8 seconds, i'm assuming, also cut into the 6 seconds you had to use it, shortening the effective time you have to even use the effect. Another thing would be that some people use limitless to instantly use an ability they didn't have the adrenaline for to save them, or if their damage boosting ability is ending. Two examples could be, you have 20% adrenaline left, and 2 seconds left in your sunshine, you could use limitless sigil, then use deep impact or wild magic etc., this would no longer be possible if limitless consumed a GCD. The other example could be someone at Telos with low adrenaline could limitless then use reflect to save their life, from an incoming anima bomb etc. Having to consume an entire GCD before being able to reflect can be the difference of life or death. The Ingenuity of Humans would be severely nerfed too. Before this update, one could use an ability with dual wield equipped, activate ingenuity, wait 4 ticks, then essentially do a 4 tick vulnerability with either ranged or melee. This wasted minimal time. I used this heavily with melee, where the I can first zerk, mutated barge, use Ingenuity to apply a 4 tick vulnerability, then used an enhanced replenishment potion and take advantage of the mutated barge bleed effect right before it ended, allowing me to vulnerability and apply my mutated barge bleed. This would no longer be viable / possible since activating the ingenuity ability would consume so much time and I would likely lose the barge bleed buff before i had enough adrenaline to use a threshold, or just straight up lose time, meaning i wouldn't get off the last 188% ability during the zerk like i normally use. Yes, this can be mitigated if you get lucky and get an impatient proc, and yes it can be mitigated if you're using an aura like invigorate or inspiration, but it's still a direct nerf to Ingenuity if a GCD is left on. The other major thing to bring up is the sheer expensiveness of the other vital spark sigils for their effectiveness. The golden touch sigil seems like a low level ability noobs would use to make a little bit more GP while they're doing their shitty level 55 slayer task, and yet, even with all this time to address its expensiveness in the previous sigil scheme, you still make it cost 2000 vital sparks to create. This is ridiculous. The sigil should be made significantly cheaper to create than the limitless sigil. I would propose less than 200 vital sparks since I believe it to be more of a low level ability that one might use before they get their hands on a spring cleaner. The unsullied sigil is just too weak for its initial cost, either change its effect and/or drop the cost to less than 500 vital sparks."
35,vulnerability,runescape,Please turn all active effects into abilities,0,cn2ifm,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/cn2ifm/please_turn_all_active_effects_into_abilities/,2019-08-07 17:07:15,"Right now is RS combat a huge mess because you have: * Abilities themselves * Item-bound active effects (Excalibur, Sigils) * Weapon specials (Gstaff, SGB) * Auras * Potions * Prayers * Castable spells (vuln, binds, teleblock) * Summoning Familiars/scrolls Can we turn some of them into one package (probably abilities) and clean them up? Yes, it would affect your precious DPS but who cares since it's affecting everyone, and the new abilities will be neatly stored in one place instead of being split between 125627373 sources? &amp;#x200B; Some examples: Bind - Ability that binds/roots the target for long duration at cost of damage. Think of it like Impact that trades damage for bind duration. Vulnerability - Ability that has very short cooldown, gcd and does 0 damage. Probably best used in long encounters and group scenarios because it's short-term dps loss Excalibur - Upgrade to Rejuvenation that makes it a basic ability with 5 minute cooldown"
36,vulnerability,runescape,The PvM patch notes wishlist,7,cn88dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/cn88dp/the_pvm_patch_notes_wishlist/,2019-08-08 02:46:03,"**The PvM patch notes wishlist** Lets get PvM to a good state. Yes, some of these are going to make aspects of PvM easier, but if you ever want to level the field a little, this is a good way to do it. It'll make life easier for everyone across the board and free up a little breathing room at the top for those who are still somehow breaking records. Some will be logical enough, some might seem reaching. Some might seem broken as all hell. **Sigils**: Current sigil issue. **Buffs**: Cheeky boosts that make sense to me. I mainly mage so most of my focus is on that. **Balancing**: Shifts a little power from magic to melee and ranged. irons out some oddities with some spells. **QoL**: Fixes that do nothing but improve QoL. **Keybinds**: Giving more options when creating keybinds. Makes them far more useful. **Sigils** I like where they're going with them, but they should just refund based on charges (For vital spark based) or base cost minus repair cost for others. and make them cost the same amount to unlock. Everyone will be on the same page going forward then, and tbh, at 70m-100m seems like a reasonable cost. Since the golden touch sigil could end up in a weird spot with no activation cost, perhaps that one will need some fine-tuning. If you still want some cost of using these abilities, maybe we add them to the 'toolbelt', and using them has a small charge cost. Merge the slayer sigils into the same ability. Might simplify keybinds, which are already at a premium. Maybe make this optional (AKA 4 abilities, 1 each and a 4th that tries to run all 3) Others have said it... Remove the GDC from them. They've been used up to now with that in mind, kinda throws using them off a little. **Buffs** Let us augment the Guthix staff, and any other useful spec weapons that are below level 70. It'd be nice to have AS3 not fall off, and the cost of another AS3/P4E2 setup isn't cheap. It IS possible to use a Guthix Staff spec without losing the stacks, but I'd argue it's a glitch. Since the G. Staff can already be used quick enough to keep your Aftershock status, I'd assume it also benefits from your other perk, meaning this would be a bug fix for high end, and a small buff for those who aren't quite as good. Let us activate spec weapons without weapon switching. This would reduce another switch, and let the weapons function as they're used, only for specials. The weapons should still need to be augmented/perked so as to not drop Aftershock stacks, and its damage should be as if the weapon WAS equipped and used. Would also benefit from a suggestion down in the Keybinds bit, AKA specifying which option is used on the keybind. Weapon that come to mind for this are Dragon Battleaxe, Guthix Staff, Seren Godbow (although most of us probably don't have one just for specs) Function-only convert options. This is specifically for stuff like Excalibur where it can be wielded for Bladed Dive, but most of us just want to heal with it. Could also work well with the above RE. Spec weapons. Let spell effects last a little longer, to allow them to be juggled. I'd personally start rotating my 4TAA auto spell more if they lasted long enough (The useful ones that come to mind INCLUDING the beta ones are Air, Smoke and Shadow, since they only last 10 seconds. Aurora spells already last 24 seconds) Convert the Ruby Aurora effect to just increase damage that the monster takes, or increase its range. At the moment you have to be within a 5x5 square of the caster using it, and the caster cannot benefit from it. The larger the team size gets, the less impactful this is. (In a duo it'd double how many people benefit, in a 10 man it would move 8 to 10, assuming the tank is turning the boss away) Streamline spellbook swap. If I'm on ancients, and I cast Vulnerability, let it cast if I have the spellbook swap runes. Same for Lunar spells. Hell, you could even merge the lot and just add stuff to a new, megabook... So... Maybe convert the spellbook into a megabook? Be done with SBS? **Balancing** Split out the core debuff spells, either across the classes or as abilites in either the constitution or defensives book. That could be used to encourage team diversity, if different classes can use different debuffs effectively, or just mean that other classes have access to this without switches/IotH. You could also convert them to abilities, but as autos they make more sense. IotH might then become primarally for making sore Give us a generic auto-attack button, so all classes can function correctly since 4taa is here to stay. Buff Aurora spells to have a base damage that scales up to T92. The other high level ancient spells do this, and so do normal spells. Ranged has tipped T92 ammo, so there's no reason to not allow this. Allow players to dump HP faster into a Ruby Prism, or at least stop it interfering with combat so invasively. It could be fun if it was viable. Allow prisms to be placed, much like Bladed Dive lets you pick a destination. **QoL** Make the pocket slot only degrade when active AND in current use. One less thing to worry about. I can't think of a single scenario where this would cause an issue. Expand how many runes can be stored in the rune pouches, or allow them to auto topup? 16k runs out more than you might think. (To clarify, I'm on about the number of each rune, not more rune types. As much as we'd all love it if a single rune pouch stored 12 types of rune, well...) Merge SBS to one mega-book. It makes sense really. It could cause some odd issues since the 'new' book would have your usual spells in it, but I guess make it so it doesn't cancel SBS if you use what's already in your book? Quiver; store bolts AND arrows. I don't range enough to talk about the thought of different bolt switches, but if I approach ranged like I do magic, I'd need both ammos for nox/Ascensions, unless I could afford elderich. Give rangers some sort of option to switch ammo, maybe combined with the above, making the quiver hold 3/4 ammo types at a time. Maybe a keybind with an ammo type sets which bolts you're using if multiple are in the quiver. Let us toolbelt the Holy Wrench. The actual impact is super minimal, but would be really nice to have. Let us toolbelt any other small bits like this. Making the player slightly stronger through this sort of thing is not a bad thing. our weapons improve so why can't we? Make familiars a little clearer, when it comes to allocating special timings and the like. The current right-click options specifying how often they'll spec is confusing. Anacronia has the player lodge which gives a great perk, the skillcape stand. This would be the perfect time to introduce the Ring stand, letting us move a ring effect to the player rather than the ring. With 4 ideal rings kicking about (Asylum, vigour, death and LotD/HSR) this could be nice. **Keybinds** Give us a way to keybind things that aren't the first option to appear. I'd love to have 2 Excalibur keybinds, 1 where it equips for Bladed Dive and the other where it activates for the healing for when I onslaught. Toggle to prevent keybinds UNEQUIPPING gear. Augmented stuff is fine, but things where the only other keybind is 'Remove' make them difficult to manage since pressing again removes it. (I'm looking at you, Vigour and ASR! RoD, we cool.) Give us 1 or 2 more keybind bars, or a load more behind-the-scenes ones. I've used every slot on my action bars, and still have a tonne of stuff to assign like different spells. I read somewhere recently that it's to do with displaying the GCD on them being intensive, but there's alot of stuff that doesn't need a CD notification on them (Auto combat spells, weapons, armours, dreadnips, debuff spells ect) Let us assign more than 1 button to a keybind slot. It'd be really useful for stuff like ring switches or prayers, so we can have them accessible in multiple locations. Could have them on multiple keys without eating more keybind slots, which are already at a premium. (To clarify, I mean hooking up 2 different keys on the keyboard to the same action, like the Q key AND also shift+N being set to melee prayer, without taking an additional keybind slot). This could probably be done with some AHK manipulation, but I don't think anything beyond normal 1 to 1 mappings are accepted. Hence, multiple button inputs to the same keybind! A big ask here, but more generic equipment binds, and a system to let us manage it. The thought here is to reduce keybind messing when you switch styles or food. Example functionality could be... Equip my highest level shield Equip my highest level defender Equip my lowest level shield (Spirit shield if T90 and defender were also available) Eat my highest per-bite food (Rocktail, Sailfish ect) Eat my lowest per-bite food (Jellies) Eat Heal-over-time food Equip my styles 2H Equip my styles Oh Equip my styles Flanking weapon Equip my styles Lunging weapon ... This one is probably easiest to set up with some kind of serverside wildcard system. AKA you could map A to equip a shield where name like 'Kiteshield', which would equip a T90 shield if available. For things like defenders, probably where name like 'Rebounder' or 'Repriser' or 'Defender'. For people hybridding, they could still benefit from this I imagine. Maybe a style specific option on the binds as well? or follow weapon style? Because I know people have asked for it for a long time, some sort of X+Y keybind in one keypress, letting us dualbind or even tribind actions to single keys. Personally I've worked around this with shift, alt and ctrl modifiers, but it'd be FAR nicer if they were easier to keybind. So... Yeah. Final thoughts? Don't be afraid of giving the player more power (Stuff like passives). Shifting rewards straight to the player is a really, really good idea if you ask me, as inventory management gets a bit crazy by mid and high end. Moving passive utility items like the Wrench to the player is a small buff but feels good to earn. don't be afraid of making items, spells ect reasonable to use, and give the player the ability to use the tools available reasonably. The complication to combat should be knowing how to use it, not playing Guitar Hero in the space of 0.6 seconds. Bringing special weapons down from ring/switch/spec/switch/ring down to ring/spec/ring is a good thing. Stopping Spellbook swap freezing combat whilst you work out what you can cast from your current book is awkward. Stopping an accidental doublepress leaving you trying to spec a boss barehanded is annoying. Streamlining is good. Finding new buffs for your character in unexpected ways is fun. Stuff like the toolbelt and Stone of Jas are cool, same goes for Totems on the new island. As for weapon switches? Aside from what I've mentioned about specs I don't really have an opinion on them. I personally use them, but I'd certanly welcome any simplification of using them. Blocks on blocks of text over, have fun."
37,vulnerability,runescape,"Sigils....Oh Boy, Here We Go",0,cn89d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/cn89d8/sigilsoh_boy_here_we_go/,2019-08-08 02:48:16,"As someone who is probably in the top 5-ish percent of pvmers (880\~ Telos so getting there), lemme speak from a point of experience with the whole sigil rework. I use literally 3 of them, and I own 4. In order of priority, Undead Slayer Sigil, Dragon Slayer Sigil, Limitless Sigil and Ingenuity of Humans Sigil (which sits in my bank collecting dust). Given their maintenance costs, their uses are EXTREMELY niche. Elite Dungeon 2, 3, Telos Phase 4 and Araxxor Phase 4 are the most prevalent use cases for me, since I don't do a ton of large-group bossing like Angel of Death, Raids or Vorago, but really only the Limitless is even remotely useful at those places, and again is extremely niche and uber-sweaty. Part of their niche-ness is because of how short-lived the effects are for the money spent. Removing the cost-per-use is actually great for PVM, as long as GCD doesn't change. I'll use Ingenuity and Limitless a lot more this way. 10 seconds for Slayer variants, 6 Seconds for Limitless, and your next attack with Ingenuity is a 100% hit, so basically only useful for guaranteed Vulnerability, Statius Warhammer Spec, and other stuff you really REALLY don't want to miss. Putting these short effects on GCD would be a problem, but it looks like that's up in the air for now. Personally, let them behave like Surge and Provoke, off GCD. Their functionality shouldn't change, period. One problem I have with them becoming abilities is that because I'm one of those people who actually fills 5 bars with stuff I regularly use, this doesn't leave me a lot of space to work with if they're going to take yet another ability slot. I don't like clicking through my inventory when I can keybind, and I don't like having to scan a prayer or magic book interface if I don't have to, so this is a bit of a pain in the neck for me. I'd rather have a setup of the best abilities I can use in near-universal cases, and I don't want to have to switch around abilites constantly just to get easier access to them. It's a core problem of the game right now, and Idk how they plan to address that, but some kind of solution here would go great lengths to simplify the game for all players. Obtaining them is a bit trickier. In current state, players will get refunded their sigils and have to use double the resources to unlock the ability. Ok, so I need another alchemical, some vital sparks, both of which I can afford relatively easily, being an upper-tier PVMer. The one I'm less crazy about is the metric ton of time-locked ports materials for the slayer sigils. Now, as a main who isn't an Iron, this still isn't too bad. I can buy the ports tank gear and level it up, diss for parts in maybe a few hours, easy clap. For Ironmen tho, this is a massive dick move. Especially when those slayer sigils are probably the most useful of the ones that are available, since ED2/3 give them really strong use cases. It takes AGES to gather those materials from ports, and that's their only option. So basically they're saying ""Hey, you know that sigil you waited months to get? We made it better! But, you can only have it back after a few more months."" Ouch. And last but not least, my chief gripe: **They're not really doing what they set out to do**, which was make the game less confusing for new and mid-level players, or returning players who've been on break. This does NOTHING to accomplish that. It just makes the top level Sigil use more intuitive (with some inconvenience for re-obtaining the ability), and it's still a big ol' question mark for newbies. Combat is still overcomplex and clunky, switchscape is still very much real, dead clicks and 4-ticks, Revo or Manual, 5 action bars and 4-5 additional interfaces on screen at all times, etc, etc. This helps exactly none of that. **TL;DR:** IDC about the rework *too* much as a PVMer. It's an intuitive change with a temporary inconvenience, but it's also not the real problem, which is that combat is massively, stupidly overcomplex, and Jagex is backing themselves into a developmental corner trying to fix it."

39,vulnerability,runescape,With Weapon Diversity Being a Topic Lets Talk About Some Broader Combat Changes.,0,c1bnux,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/c1bnux/with_weapon_diversity_being_a_topic_lets_talk/,2019-06-17 02:18:01," The issue with 4TAA is that it is such a great DPS increase that it forces players to play at a very high APM rate, for hours on end, and is completely unnecessary. High APM in short bursts is great for skill expression. High APM sustained over long periods is bad for the game and ultimately player health, (Carpal Tunnel) The suggestion to combat change is to make ""Basic Attack"" and ""Cast Spell"" abilities. Melee and range use the first and magic uses the second. These abilities DO NOT use the global cool down, and revolution will only cast them once on the first click of a target, or again if no other abilities are ready to be cast, characters will also auto attack on cooldown if no inputs were being made recently. (so afk one hitting with autos still works, although you should probably be in legacy for that) These abilities cool downs are based on the weapons speed. Dual wielding yields a shorter cooldown, but the attack dont his as hard as 2 handing. Swapping weapons puts basic on attack on a 3 second cooldown, per style. So swapping to melee for a bladed dive, and then back to magic wont interrupt auto attacks, but swapping from wand/orb to Guthix staff spec will. **Dual Wield weapons** Dont hit as hard, but hit more often. Melee weapons alternate what weapon does the attack, meaning if you mix what you are holding and those weapons have effects you could get both at a lesser level, or if you wield the same weapons you get a greater effect. Ranged dual wielding has 2 basic attacks a main and offhand, and each can use a different bolt for different effects or the same bolt, configured by right clicking the weapon and selection ""choose bolt"" Each hand has a long cooldown, but since you have 2 you can chose when to use each, can both be fired at once for increased damage, at the loss of accuracy. This also means one hand can use a bolt you may only want to fire sometimes, and the other a different one. Or both the same. If only one ammo type is equipped both will default to that one ammo type. This change requires the quiver slot be able to hold 2 types of ammo at once. Magic does not have basic attack, and instead uses cast spell, each hand can be tuned to a different spell, or the same spell and works like range dual wielding. This would for example allow the main hand spell to be blood barrage, while the offhand could be ice barrage for the stun effect. Or the offhand could be a straight up stun spell, vulnerability, etc. **Two Handed Weapons** The big difference between the two styles needs to be that since players who are 2 handing cant auto attack as much, the auto needs to do more damage and/or have enhanced effects. Melee Weapons that are 2H need strong effects, like the halberd range to avoid going melee distance all the time, or the suggested weapon diversity maul change where accuracy is reduced for more oomph in the smash. Ranged 2 Handed weapons need more power to their shots/ greater accuracy on the auto attacks as opposed to firing both of dual wields at once, increased bolt effects, Longer lasting Effects, potential stuns from 2 handed crossbows etc. Magic 2 Handed only gets to cast one spell instead of 2, so it gets increased benefits, longer stuns, more healing off blood barrage etc. **Equipping** When you add an item to your hotbar that can be equipped you can right click ""add more"" to the button and add other items that will equip. **Overall the changes would** 1- reduce the need for extremely high sustained APM and use of macros by some players who physically cannot do it. 2- add skill expression to combat in using basics at the correct times as to not break abilities but still weave them into the rotation. Keeping the distinction between full manual and revolution in tact 3- adds diversity in that each style offers something you cannot do with the other variant. dual wield mage can cast stuns or vuln outside of global cooldown. 2H cant, but it can hit like a truck and get big heals."

Nowadays it's just a shitty passive boost you barely feel or interact with the thing you summon and there is absolutely nothing special about them anymore. They are practically gear now. Dont need terrorbirds. Don't need them for skilling. Jagex is afraid of adding familiars with strong effects nothing is fun anymore in the summoning branch. It's like Jagex decided on a meta and nerfed everything else to the ground. I haven't seen a single person use the unicorn familiar in like forever. Everything is either steel titan yak nihil or mammoth. Thats it. Their autoattacks have been closely calculated into every new boss. The devs just instantly offset any dps familiar by just adding a chunk of hp to the boss or give him phases. Their rightclick options once strong and potent effects, now completly without value? But for some reason everyone is running around with vulnerability, shield dom and dispersion shield. So the 'op and unfair' features are clearly there and ready to be used they are just not integrated into the summoning skill. no debuffer familiar no dreadnips+. Could make the materials for some familiars rare boss drops and untradable but therefore stronger. It's really no rocket science but nobody ever takes in the effort. What was the last gathering familiar they added it was for divination was it not? Why not a fishing familiar that charges up as you fish and then provides a ressource node of similiar nature you can afk fish from. Why not add a familiar with a house portal.

Staff of Armadyl + Storm of Armadyl: Increases damage of all types towards enemy by 2% per successful attack for 60 seconds, stacking at 14%.

43,vulnerability,runescape,Replace Splashing with Soaking (detailed explanation),0,apjplb,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/apjplb/replace_splashing_with_soaking_detailed/,2019-02-12 06:08:34,"Missing hits or splashing has been a part of RuneScape since its inception. Weve all taken it for granted for years but I think its high time that it gets removed and replaced. Im more than aware that this is not a unique or new idea, but I think I have a solution that can satisfy nearly everyones complaints. The main idea is that player would no longer splash their hits, but instead have their damage reduced or soaked by the exact percentage that you would have splashed previously. For example, if you have 80% hit-chance on Vorago pre-update, you will now hit for 80% damage but will never actually splash your hit. **Why do we need this?** The main complaint that I and many others have about splashing relates to what Ill call on-hit effects. The main on-hit effects that matter to players are stuns and debilitate. While most bosses in RuneScape are stun-immune, the few bosses that arent are very reliant on having your stuns hit. Most players who have killed Telos have experienced missing their stuns and potentially dying or tanking huge hits because of it. This is problematic because ultimately these players have done nothing wrong to justify tanking these hits. Naysayers will claim that these players should have brought a nihil, better gear, or less brews, but ultimately these stuns missing comes down to RNG. While RNG can be a rewarding and exciting mechanic when it comes to drops, I and many others feel that RNG should be reduced where possible when it comes to PvE mechanics. Trying to stun a boss and missing, resulting in tanking a SMP or another mechanic, simply feels bad and doesnt make a whole lot of sense. Debilitate lies in a very similar situation, where you can perform a mechanic correctly (debilitating a small anima bomb for example) but fail and die simply due to RNG. I would argue that this feels even worse when you have done everything within reason to maximize your hit-chance but still splash and fail. The other component is simply just that splashing during your DPS rotation is annoying. Splashing an auto-attack means you arent granted the adrenaline for that attack; splashing a crucial threshold or flanking means your damage rotation gets gutted; seeing those shields simply feels bad and rewards RNG hits over a consistent and calculated damage rotation. One of the biggest reasons people loved Solak on release was that you didnt splash at all with a decent gear setup. Your rotation mattered, was consistently rewarded, and couldnt get screwed over by an RNG mechanic. **How would it work exactly?** The basic premise is that hit-chance would be replaced by soaking. Instead of occasionally splashing or missing a hit, ALL of your hits would instead be reduced by an amount equal to the percentage chance that you would have splashed. This soaked amount could appear next to your hitsplat so you know exactly how much damage you are missing out on (similar to how soaking used to work in PVP) The reason this soaking mechanic is important and we cant just remove splashing with no replacement is two-fold: first, we dont want to devalue or ignore accuracy-boosting equipment and effects, and second, we dont want to require an obscene amount of rebalancing in order to implement this change. Accuracy boosting equipment and effects are an integral part of RuneScape; they have value, cost, and typically are fun/engaging to use. Nihils require you to sacrifice a beast of burden or other combat familiar, reaper necklace requires you to sacrifice the powerful amulet of souls effect, and affinity boosting items require a specific rotation and adrenaline cost. These are engaging trade-offs and we dont want to devalue them overnight. These effects will still exist after the rework and will reduce the amount that your hits are soaked. This also goes for accuracy that you gain from your high level weapons and prayers. Similar to hit-chance, these effects will cap out at 100%, meaning that these accuracy buffs will not actually buff your damage above current levels, thus avoiding any controversy regarding power-creep or re-balancing. This also means that all monsters that you are currently 100% accurate on will be completely unchanged. If you dont notice a soaked hitsplat next to your damage, you are dealing full damage and dont require any extra accuracy. However, if you are doing high-level content and you notice your hits getting soaked, you are instantly aware of how much damage you are losing out on and the ways in which you can maximize it. The other reason I believe this solution is so elegant is that it requires a minimal amount of rebalancing in order to implement. Hit-chance is converted directly into soaking percentage, meaning that HP values for most current bosses will remain exactly the same. DPS check mechanics like Vorago pushback and bring him down will remain exactly the same. The only main outliers than I can think of are Solak and Elite Dungeons. These two pieces of content were released with extremely low defence because Jagex had realized that splashing is an issue but werent sure how to go about fixing it. These are essentially band-aid fixes. I feel that, should this splashing rework go live, these pieces of content should be revisited for a couple of reasons. First, high level content like t92 weapons and t99 prayers are essentially half as valuable at these bosses because their accuracy stat has no effect whatsoever. This would be solved if they rebalanced these bosses, adding soak (aka defence) to them but also reducing their total HP. This would also mean that affinity debuffs like SWH/quake/gstaff and other accuracy mechanics would have a place at these bosses which I feel is important. The few outliers that I have not yet addressed are debuffs like vulnerability and using abilities while wearing gear of other styles. With the current system that Ive suggested, players would be 100% accurate with vuln with meleeing or 100% accurate with quake while maging. While I am not completely opposed to this, it could pose a lot of balancing problems and would completely devalue the recently-released Ingenuity of Humans. While the damage of abilities while using the incorrect style would be greatly reduced due to soaking, I think this is a glaring issue that should be addressed. I propose that for each piece of incorrectly styled gear that you are wearing, you will receive a 20% hit to your actual accuracy. This would mean that you would only have a 20% chance of hitting a quake while maging with cinderbanes or hitting a vuln while meleeing with deathtouch bracelet. Wearing all 5 pieces of incorrect gear would guarantee that your attempted debuff would not hit. Naturally, Ingenuity of Humans would ignore this penalty. Im also more than willing to hear others suggestions to fix this issue. **PVP** PvP is one aspect of the game that has always relied on heavy aspects of RNG. Between large hit variance and splashing, PvP in RuneScape practically requires large hits in order to successfully KO your opponent. Its hard to argue that replacing splashing with soaking wouldnt turn PvP into a total snooze-fest with neither party able to KO their opponent. Hits would be quite low across the board as defence in PvP tends to be quite high as soon as you put on Ports or better gear. Its entirely possible that PvP could ignore this update and continue to have splashing as a mechanic, though I dont know exactly how hard this would be to implement. This would require further discussion as well. **Why now?** Were currently at a juncture where recent content has been release with very low defence (Solak and ED1/2), which devalues high level weapons and prayers. I take issue with this band-aid fix as it only applies to future content while still recognizing that splashing is an issue that needs to be addressed in RuneScape. The other looming update is the idea of an AoD rebalance that would reduce its defence and increase its HP along with a number of other changes. Going through each boss one at a time and making these changes seems very inefficient and continues to devalue the accuracy stat coming from high-level drops. I dont this this is healthy for the game whatsoever and I think a splashing rework is well overdue. I sincerely hope this post gains some traction and opens a discussion about reworking splashing into a better and less frustrating mechanic. I would also like to thank Omids stream for sparking a lot of useful discussion and inspiring me to write this post. **Tell me what you think.** "

Typically, those inventory spaces aren't a huge deal that makes or breaks the style being good. With this in mind: magic, ranged, and melee would then all need to be similar DPS *with vulnerability* to be *actually* balanced - but this doesn't account for a gigantic portion of the audience who only look at one combat style in a vacuum vs. another style in a vacuum. If melee is 220K DPM with vuln, and 200K DPM without it and magic is 210K DPM with vuln people will often think, ""Oh, magic is better."" With all this in mind, it might make sense to make vulnerability a buff that only applies to your own damage, and only your magic damage *then add ranged and melee things that genuinely compete on power level with vulnerability.* This lets you balance across styles and each individual style. For example: **Melee basic: enrage.** You gain +X% critical strike chance on your melee hits for the next 60 seconds. This gives melee an edge in a unique way compared to vulnerability - rather than directly increasing your damage dealt it lets you critically strike more often, allowing you to interact with mechanics like meteor strike, mutated fury, etc. more consistently. **Ranged basic: precision.** When you hit a target with ranged, roll to hit them again. If the roll is successful, gain +X% adrenaline. (Does not repeat off itself). Again, gives ranged a unique edge over magic/vulnerability, lets you use unique rotations due to the additional adrenaline and so on."

Dyed Gear with the Wealth Evaluator | Yes, we can display the cost of item + dye, we will look into it. Elite Dungeons | Story mode has been made easier (2 weeks ago). There are no current plans to make new elite dungeons for mid-level combat. Future Bosses | There are plans for more bosses in 2019. Also, Elite Dungeons set a good example of how to do various difficulties. Guthix Staff Kit Augmentations | Probably not in the near future. Hiding Ironman Achievements | Will look into but not a high priority (May be a decent sized job). Mutated Dazing Shot | The duration won't be extended, but Mod Pi has made it so it resets if it splashes. Also, it no longer will heal Nex. Poison Debuff Icon Issue | Not currently fixed but being looked into. Rare Drop Table | There are no plans to change it. We are also waiting to analyze it after the M&amp;S Rework/Grace of the Elves. Rare Token store Updates | It's not an immediate priority, it's on a list, if we get around to it we will say. May look into adding consumables. (provide suggestions) **Aura Rework** * Removing Auras from the Loyalty store would have knock-on-effects to the game. * As would adding them straight to the game. * Concerns around what to do with the Loyalty system or combat balancing need to be properly addressed. * Currently it's on the drawing board/team's list to do further work/progress. **Bank Rework** * Bank Placeholders - We want to do it, it's a huge technical investment (as is Mobile). * We are currently investigating bank issues still, but we have to implement these in the right way. * Make sure we can do updates down the line. * It's not easy to add bank space due to the server load. **Dailyscape** * It isn't a top priority and it's only considered when making updates currently. * It will never be tackled in one go. * We aren't tackling it mainly because it's difficult to tackle * Most ""solutions"" either turn players away from the activities or they become to OP. * The Skilling Council discussed the topic surrounding Guthixian cache being a problem. * Most dailyscape issues are only a problem because the list is so long, Guthixian Cache is more of a problem. * Players primarily only train Divination via Cache. * It was attempted to be fixed during Gamejam but the players rejected the idea. **High Intensity Skilling** * Fishing Frenzy isn't as successful as planned. * Players: Too intensive for the reward. * Use: We considered it to be intensive but worthwhile. * The two views are misaligned for a number of factors. * We need to figure out what intensity is before releasing more content. **Mining and Smithing** * Changed the Rare Drop Table the same way as other drop tables. * Metal items are replaced with Salvage - Alched/Disassemble for more than the existing counter-part. * Ores are replaced with Stone Spirits - GE value slightly under an ore (will be looked into the future if needed). * Spring Cleaner has been changed - It now will Auto-alch/disassemble items. * There are no plans for a Development Process Document. * The design process could have lasted an entire year. It's hard to define when it actual began. * Development began around 2017 Runefest and the core system was completed 3-4 weeks later. * The first beta was provided 2 months after that. * The next 8 months have been spent plugging everything into the game and making sure everything still works. * It will be released in January with time being allocated post-launch to fix any issues/address feedback. * The Beta is being left up for a longer (unknown) period of time, but there won't be anymore changes made to it. **Mobile Information** * The Mobile team are still working on it and they are slowly adding more people to the beta. * This will continue until it's released. **Quests** * There will be a lore stream next week, December 11th. * Player input is only 1 factor of all the factors we base our future quest plans on. * The Gnome and Desert quest series aren't popular based on player surveys/polls. * May be due to various issues such as recency biases. * Old quests lines build up to a massive city which is difficult on future developers/releases as it's a lot of work. * They will inherently be compared to places like Prifddinas. * There were 4 Quests in 2018. 2019 probably will meet the same amount (unlikely to have more). * We want to focus on quality not quantity. * Example: The Menaphos quests didn't go down well as some players wanted them combined. * Needles skips took a lot of work to implement the search system. * It can no be used for other future content if needed. **Other** * Players cannot trade 4 tiers of clues scrolls for a master clue scroll (that's not how rarities work) * More people have recolored Passage of the Abyss purple versus the yellow one. Only 60 yellow versions in-game. *** #Update Direction *** **Mod Pi &amp; Other Simple Fixes** * Mod Pi is familiar with the combat code, and sometimes having fresh eyes on the topic allow for issues to be completed sooner. * Mod Pi's fixes won't be out this year due to the Holidays, it will likely come out Q1 next year. * In order to fix similar issues sooner, CM will be working closer with the Ninja team to decide priority. * There has been more attempts to get feedback from players from various feedback posts. * Gamejam helped highlight updates to be added to the game, which the Ninja team will be working on early next year. * There will be 2 weeks allocated for fixes, some will be Mod Pi's some others will be more PvM based/Gamejam stuff. **Work Priority** * Everyone in the company has input which help decides update priority. * We build a release road-map based on that information. * We target updates to certain types of players since not every update relates to all players. * In 2019 we want to focus on updates moving in a certain direction and have a more modern feeling. * We have limited resources and need to be smart on how we allocate those resources in order to reach the best outcome possible.

51,vulnerability,runescape,Ingenuity of Humans issue,1,a35q4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/a35q4y/ingenuity_of_humans_issue/,2018-12-05 09:32:50,So Ive been trying out the new Ingenuity sigil and Im having problems casting vulnerability after I activate the sigil. Im spamming my vuln key and clicking the enemy but somehow it doesnt work. Im guessing its a melee auto attack that counts for the guarantee hit but Im not sure. Also always after activating the sigil revolution stops working for about ten seconds. Wondering if Im doing something wrong or if other people are having this problem. 
52,vulnerability,runescape,120 Summoning Familiar Ideas,1,9uq374,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9uq374/120_summoning_familiar_ideas/,2018-11-07 04:00:46,"This is a compilation of mine and other generic summoning familiar ideas for the possible level 120 summoning update to both fill out the 99-120 gap and some low/mid level familiars to bridge odd gaps or provide niche benefits. Not all of the ideas are really fleshed out and numbers are obviously subject to game balancing. Any suggestions to add or change current ideas are welcome and will be credited accordingly. This post is going to be split into 4 categories: combat, skilling, general, and dungeoneering familiars. I've also made a forum post for longer term discussion [here] (URL ###**Combat Familiars:** *Metal Titans: *Mithril, Adamant, Rune (Level 103, 107, 111) [Uses platebodies as tertiary similar to existing versions]: Stronger versions of Steel/Iron Titans, same spec. *Orikalkum, Necronium, Bane, Elder Rune (113, 115, 117, 120) [Uses platebodies as tertiary similar to existing versions]: Stronger versions, same spec. *Elemental Titans: *Remove Ice Titan and replace with Gale Titan, requiring only air talisman, stats and spec unchanged. *Smog Titan (94) [Tertiary: Air &amp; Earth Talisman]: Spec reduces the hit chance of the target by 5% for 15 seconds, deals moderate damage. *Blizzard Titan (99) [Tertiary: Air &amp; Water Talisman]: Spec summons a blizzard on targets location (5x5) which deals small damage once and lasts for 6 ticks, all targets within will have their run turned off and run energy reduced by 6% every 2 ticks. *Leeching Titan (104) [Tertiary: Fire &amp; Blood Talisman]: Spec deals quadruple damage and heals user by 5% of the damage dealt, auto attacks heal by 2%. *Umbral Titan (109) [Tertiary: Death &amp; Earth Talisman]: Spec summons a shadow which deals rapid damage (each hit is same damage as tian autoattack) for 5 ticks, damage dealt every tick. Shadow persists even if target moves away, titan cant use spec again while a shadow is present (can stack with other players umbral titans specs). *Minotaurs: *Orikalkum, Necronium, Bane, Elder Rune (96, 101, 106, 111) [Uses bars as tertiary similar to existing versions]: Stronger versions, same spec. *Dragons: *Green, Blue, Red, Black (112, 114, 116, 118) [Tertiary: New item, dragon scale (blue already exists)]: Spec is a dragon breath attack that places a DoT on the target that deals small-moderate damage, causes all existing DoTs on the target to refresh its duration (i.e. corruption, dismember, slaughter, tendrils, combust, frag shot, mutated barge effect etc.). This spec does nothing to targets immune to dragon fire. *Royal (120) [Tertiary: New item, royal dragon scale, uncommon drop from QBD, more common than RCB component drops]: *Frost Royal: Spec causes brittle effect on target, any CC duration lasts 20% longer (bind, stun, TB etc.) effect lasts for 10 seconds (existing CC duration does not decrease after this effect wears off). Deals high damage. *Poison Royal: Spec causes vulnerability effect on target, poison damage is increased by 20% for 20 seconds. Deals moderate damage. *Shock Royal: Spec causes AOE (5x5) shock damage that spreads the damage amongst all targets in the AOE. Deals extremely high damage. *Bronze  Rune (50-99?) [Tertiary: Metal bars]: Spec is a claw swipe or dragon breath that deals high damage. Dragon breath does not affect targets immune to dragon fire attack, but swipe does. *Orikalkum, Necronium, Bane, Elder Rune (99-120?) [Tertiary: Metal bars]: Spec blocks 50% of the damage of the next incoming damage to the player. *Crit familiars: *Crit chance familiar: Same stats as Nihils, increases crit chance of all abilities by 8%. *Crit strike familiar: Increases hard damage cap by 1000 for critical strikes only). *Equilibrium familiar: Same effect as equilibrium aura and stacks with the aura. *BoB: Higher tier bob with more space (32, 34, 36). *Miscellaneous familiars: *Curse effect that increases your damage of your next ability dealt to the target by 6%, does not get cancelled by existing DoT or other players. *Eagle familiar: Spec, mark of the eagle, marks your target and increases the accuracy of your next ability towards the target by 6%, does not get cancelled by existing DoT or other players. *Luck familiar: Increases luck similar to luck rings, stackable. *Fire familiar (melee) that has an AOE 5x5 burn area surrounding the familiar, dealing small amounts of damage every 2 ticks. Spec gives the user the same effect for 10 seconds. Can have a fungal variation for poison damage. ###**Skilling Familiars** Generally dont have ideas what the familiars will be but have ideas for specs. Each point is either a spec or passive for a separate familiar. *Agility: *Increases velocity gained on Hefin Agility Course and shortcut proc chance. *Reduce failure chance. *Cooking: Both could be under 1 familiar *Chance to cook double food, stacks with portable range. *Reduce burning chance. *Divination: *Nightmare creature (102) [New tertiary that replaces muspah spines from nightmare creature drop (didnt make sense to drop spines in the first place), lower drop rate than spins]: Highly improved chance of spawning a chronicle and has chance to split the chronicle when caught, stacks with divination outfit. *Increase chance of getting enriched memory and increases the amount of memory strand gained. *Farming: *Higher tier ent, increased proc chance, works on Tuai Leit berry plot as well. *Familiar that gives chance to double herb harvested, stacks with juju, aura. *These 3 could be under same familiar since theyre pretty weak effects: *Familiar that allows tree root to be recovered when removing tree without the need to chop the tree down. *Higher chance to get a desirable trait when rerolling trait (i.e. positive traits like spark, immune, jovial etc.). *Manure is collected into bucket in 1 tick. *Firemaking: *Chance to burn logs while woodcutting, if paired with superheat form, increases fm xp gained instead. 3 tiers, with 3rd tier having 100% chance. *Increases duration of bonfire and bonfire boost when summoned. *Herblore: *Chance to make potion+ (applies to cb pots, ovls, skilling pots, restores/prayer, juju), a stronger version of the potion that boosts levels by 1; for restores, stat restoration increased by 5%; juju pots duration increased. *Hunter: *Familiar that gives chance to loot +1 item from any trap, 3 tiers, increase proc chance. Does not increase resource gained from Arc, only speeds up depletion. *More invisible level boost familiars. *Prayer: *Increase effectiveness of prayers and curses, could be 2 separate familiars. Deals damage like a combat familiar. *Increase effectiveness of protection prayer and soul split by 15% for 15 seconds, stacks with AoS. *Allows deflect curses and other sources of reflect damage to deal damage regardless if monster is immune to reflect damage for 10 seconds. (Could combine with previous one since its kinda weak for combat familiar). *Mining: *Familiar that gives chance to mine double ores, 3 tiers, increase proc chance. Does not increase resource gained from Arc, only speeds up depletion. *More invisible level boost familiars. *Greatly increased chance to find gems. *Runecrafting: *Better versions of abyssal titan. *Chance to not consume essence when crafting runes (both runespan and normal rc). *Chance to craft 1 extra rune, each essence has its own proc chance (both runespan and normal rc). Multiple tiers? *Smithing: *Something to do with heat or smithing speed (like tinker perk)? *Thieving: *Decrease chance of being caught, increases trahaeren exoskeletons and light masks chance of not getting stunned. *Chance to double loot from stalls, safes. *Woodcutting: *Passive: Familiar that gives chance to chop double logs, 3 tiers, increase proc chance. Does not increase resource gained from Arc, only speeds up depletion. *More invisible level boost familiars. ###**General Familiars** *Abyssal voyager: 3 familiars, access normal, ancient, lunar spellbook teleports by speaking to them, allows you to use different teleports while on another spellbook. *Imp: Spec gives 5 porter charges. To create the scrolls, quaternary ingredient is necessary, sign of porters. The amount of porter required depends on the tier of porter, e.g. porter VI can create 6 scrolls (30 charges per porter) and porter I are required to make 1 scroll (5 charges per porter). ###**DG Familiars** New set of familiars, this will only work if summoning pouches were allowed to be bounded like pots. Each boss has a chance to drop a tertiary to create a familiar that is similar to the boss, chances increased in hard mode. Drops as a secondary item, will not replace armour/weapon drop if rolled. *Gluttonous Behemoth: Spec heals the player by consuming a raw fish from the players inventory. *Astea Frostweb: Increase effectiveness of prayer protection to 100%. *Icy Bones: Creates an ice prison around the target and shatters after 8 ticks dealing moderate damage. (Cant be used on bosses like Blink). *Luminescent Icefiend: Spec encases player for 3 ticks, preventing any damage taken and healing the player for 10% max hp per tick, 1 minute cd. *Plane-freezer Lakhrahnaz: The floor is ice, affects all monsters as well, slip n slide for everybody. *To'Kash the Bloodchiller: Spec applies brittle effect that increases CC duration to target by 30% for 10 seconds. *Skeletal Horde/Divine Skinweaver: Divine Skinweaver heals as much as Sachem Skinweaver, but heals every player in the room. *Hobgoblin Geomancer: ? *Bulwark Beast: Spec creates barrier around player that blocks 500 damage. 20 seconds CD. *Unholy cursebearer: Reduces targets stats. *Rammernaut: Spec charges and stuns the target for 2 ticks, dealing moderate damage. Cant stun stun immune targets. *Stomp: ? Increases your completion time by 3 minutes? *Har'Lakk the Riftsplitter: Miasma, deals poison damage to target. *Lexicus Runewright: Book barrage, deals high magic damage to a targeted area, if target leaves area, target will not take damage. *Sagittare: Spec fires 3x3 AOE bombardment, dealing moderate damage to all targets in the area. *Night-gazer Khighorahk: Increases your accuracy by 3%. *Shadow-forger Ihlakhizan: Acid spec that lowers targets defence. *Bal'lak the Pummeller: Passively increase players defence level by 10% of their defence level. *Skeletal trio: *Melee: Is immune to ranged attacks, deals melee damage. Spec is a quake like ability, dealing moderate AOE damage and increasing affinity of targets affected by 2. *Ranger: Is immune to magic attacks, deals ranged damage. Spec is a rapid fire like ability, dealing 6 autoattacks in 6 ticks, roots target. *Mage: Is immune to melee attacks, deals magic damage. Spec is an omnipower like ability, high hitting single target instant damage. *Runebound Behemoth: Spec is 4 yellow orbs that hits the targets location in succession, target can move away from the area to avoid the damage, the 1st orb always hits the target. *Gravecreeper: Spec leaves a purple cloud (1 tile size) that deals rapid damage to the target standing in the cloud, cloud persists for 15 seconds. *Necrolord: Heard you like summoning familiars so we let your summoned familiars summon familiars. Spec summons a skeleton to fight for the Necrolord that fights for you. Skeleton will draw aggro of its targeted monster. *Flesh-spoiler Haasghenahk: Spec is its eyeball attack, deals massive damage. *Yk'Lagor the Thunderous: Spec is stomping the ground dealing massive AOE damage in a 9x9 area, 45s CD. *Blink: Spec teleports Blink behind your target and deals backstab damage (5x of autoattack damage). *Warped Gulega: Spec casts a tendril at the target to deal DoT type damage. *Dreadnaut: Spec is slamming the target and increasing the targets affinity by 4 for 30 seconds, 30s CD. *Hope devourer: Each attack drains the targets combat stats by 1, no spec *World-gorger Shukarhazh: *Melee: Hurricane like ability, dealing damage to targets surrounding it in a 3x3 area. *Ranged: Fires a red projectile dealing damage to enemies surrounding the target in a 3x3 area. *Mage: Fires a high damage single target ability. *Kal'Ger the Warmonger: If the target is in melee distance, jumps in the air and slams the ground dealing high single target damage and causing a bleed effect on the target. If the target is not in melee distance, summons a flame portal that deals rapid single target damage. Posting this pretty late, so probably won't be able to reply or update much."
53,vulnerability,runescape,[Bug] Vulnerability queues too long and causes crackling to deal magic damage,1,9lihr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9lihr9/bug_vulnerability_queues_too_long_and_causes/,2018-10-05 12:44:04,"Not sure how this affects other bosses, but it happens pretty much every nex kill for me. If you spam vuln on nex it will queue to your next auto attack, even if it successfully applies. So you vuln, switch back to range, and the next auto that comes out 20s later is a vuln. While holding a bow. This happens no matter what abilities are used in-between. Another annoying part of this is that it causes crackling to deal magic damage while it is queued. This means if nex is praying deflect mage it will not work and also deal a 3k reflect back to you, while using ranged. Jagex pls"

Does this item have potential to change the meta for some bosses, or is magic still gonna be king? "
55,vulnerability,runescape,Allow the Ingenuity of Humans to work for 2s instead of next attack.,1,9me11s,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9me11s/allow_the_ingenuity_of_humans_to_work_for_2s/,2018-10-08 22:27:29,Reason being for casting vulnerability is hard enough not letting an auto attack snipe its 100% accuracy effect when selecting a new target. Its like trying to use disruption shield to block kalphite kings instakill with several minions still about - much better to devo since its extremely difficult. 
56,vulnerability,runescape,"When creating the drop table for the Shadow Reef elite dungeon, please condider the fact that 2H ranged is still badly in need of a buff",1,9mm70n,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9mm70n/when_creating_the_drop_table_for_the_shadow_reef/,2018-10-09 15:39:56,"* 2H ranged has been lacking in comparison to dual wield ranged, magic, and melee for quite some time. * Dual wield has bakriminels and mechanized chins. 2H has a sexy looking Nox with a broken spec. * Mage has 4taa, metamorphosis, strong melee resistance, gstaff, vulnerability... Mage has everything. * Melee has two of the best weapons in the game for DPS output and PvM, the Zaros Godsword and the Noxious Scythe, and the best ultimate ability, vamp scrims, blood essences, etc. * 2H ranged has a very comfortable feel to it. I really hope that with elite dungeon 2, there is a very powerful 2H-exclusive DoT bleed ability codex drop, a means to increase the duration of puncture stacks on a target, a t90 or t92 2H crossbow that can fire bakriminels, or some other reasonable buff that would make 2H ranged **significantly** better so that it is on par with other combat styles. * As a PvMer who mostly uses ranged and melee, I absolutely love the feel of 2H ranged weapons, and oh my god does SGB look amazing with shadow dye on it. I cum every time I look at my screen. Unfortunately, magic and melee have very unique perks to them, and recently so does dual-wield ranged, but on behalf of all of RuneScape's ranged-using noobs such as myself, I sincerely hope that everyone at Jagex is aware that 2H ranged has been left out of a lot of these awesome new additions to EoC and are considering a method of bringing it back into the limelight.

Their special attack, adamant bull rush, costs 6 special move points and will replace their next auto attack with a ranged hit typically, but will occasionally use a melee hit. They will run in to melee distance to attack, even while using their special attack. **Auto attacks.** 59,118 damage total over 110 hits, making the average hit 537.43 It appears to strike every 8 ticks - 4.8 seconds. This means 12.5 strikes/minute for an average of 6,717.875 DPM. For a player with 100K DPM, this represents an increase of 6.717875% over a lack of a familiar. This means that the adamant minotaur has ""Out of my way!"" was stated twice during the testing ""Hey, no-horns!"" was stated once later on while my character was idling.

While the special attack scroll *says* it stuns your opponent, it appears to only have a mild visual/audio flair with no mechanical impact and it does not even have this mild visual/audio flair every time. **Attack range:** They will run in to melee distance to attack, even while using their special attack. **Vulnerability:** Damage appears to be increased by vulnerability as they hit a 1073 and 1015 were hit after I cast vulnerability in the span of just 1 minute, while over the course of 201 hits (~16 minutes) I observed 0 hits above 1000. **Raw hits tracked - auto attacks.** - 569/949/778/969/223/294/473/990/860/612/722/258/827/465/441/624/589/807/628/647/967/412/766/462/964/525/624/330/516/856/906/436/391/519/235/199/248/512/530/512/281/686/410/311/395/364/530/689/601/275/414/702/785/649/216/876/497/906/820/848/731/941/831/309/307/742/914/488/253/246/613/425/501/507/529/985/992/230/938/259/249/963/560/850/987/744/500/302/225/931/896/691/272/776/704/483/574/910/779/372/885/551/760/580/673/263/394/410/558/647/733 **Total hits:** 111 **Total damage:** 59,317 **Average damage:** 534.387 **Highest hit:** 199 **Lowest hit:** 992 **Average of highest and lowest hits:** 595.5 **Raw hits tracked - special attacks.** - 573/414/792/840/378/523/550/940/943/672/879/463/560/838/203/236/878/325/978/906/301/972/946/683/464/414/311/273/505/350/492/538/764/627/665/236/671/658/963/947/209/443/784/893/350/296/723/818/435/386/336/773/390/557/505/305/302/475/901/275/329/963/769/741/969/777/960/707/582/776/636/917/619/294/654/431/318/711/597/815/520/598/527/288/467/436/681/874/529/880/ **Total hits:** 90 **Total damage:** 54,165 **Average damage:** 601.833 **Damage/minute:** 7522.91 **Highest hit:** 972 **Lowest hit:** 203 **Average of highest and lowest hits:** 587.5 **Damage/minute.** - **Auto attack testing (101 hit average):** 6679.8375 DPM **Auto attack testing (2 hit - highest and lowest hits average):** 7443.75 DPM **Special attack testing (90 hit average):** 7522.9125 DPM **Special attack testing (2 hit - highest and lowest hits average):** 7343.75 DPM The average damage in the auto attack testing was 534.387 with the highest/lowest hits averaging to 595.5, this suggests that I may have simply been unlucky in my hits.

Against a target with higher defenses the adamant minotaur would likely contribute almost nothing at all, if 3K wasn't already low enough for you to dismiss it in favour of using a different familiar. It has a minimum hit of around 200, and a maximum of slightly less than 1000. It benefits from vulnerability. The special attack seems to do little to nothing besides range the damage style of the attack. Overall, adamant minotaurs appear to be rather fairly rated as ""pretty much useless""."

This is overall something that has been criticized about the boss, understandably, but I think timegates *can* be a good thing, and could be even more interesting. **What we can do right now.** There are many things we still can do during this time gate currently, such as, * **Build adrenaline.** * Great for starting the next phase on 100% * Lets us use specials like the dragon battleaxe when we might not otherwise due to having better uses of our adrenaline if the boss was vulnerable * Lets us get a natural instinct going, starting the phase with some time left on natural instinct, under a damage boosting ultimate, etc. * **Debuffs such as . . .** * Spell debuffs - Vulnerability, enfeeble, stagger * Affinity debuffs - Guthix staff, statius's warhammer, quake * Stat reducing debuffs - zamorak staff, seercull **What I'd love to see.** * **Clearer insight in to how much we've debuffed an enemy.** * ""Defense lowered"" is nice and all, but I want to see exactly how much lower it is. Communicate it to me with a number. * When I lower a monster's magic level, how much am I decreasing their accuracy with magic attacks? Showing us an enemy's accuracy against us with at least their basic attacks would be awesome, and seeing that accuracy change with debuffs would feel great. * **Buff some debuffs.** * Currently it feels like people largely ignore debuffs that don't target an enemy's defense specifically, I'd love to see some of the debuffs that focus on other things be encouraged more. * Buff stat draining special attacks to also apply debuffs that avoid the ""stats can't be drained"" effect that many bosses have. Ie. make the Zamorak staff decrease your opponent's magic level by 5% but also apply a 15% decrease to their magic damage dealt for the next X amount of time."

These weapons actually have Tier 80 damage and Tier 90 accuracy, therefore, for general slayer, weapons with higher tiers of damage are usually better since you almost always have 100% accuracy during slayer task due to the huge accuracy bonus of having a slayer helmet equipped. The weapons I'm talking about include: Dragon Rider Lance, Shadow Glaives, Twin furry blades and the Cywir wand and orb.** The **Masuta's Warspear** does Tier 82 damage and accuracy and is also a halberd type weapon like the lance (increased range). Meaning, for most slayer monsters where the accuracy is totally negligible, the warspear actually doe **more** damage than the lance, while still having the extended range. Off-hand versions of these GWD2 weapons all have Tier 80 damage, and since all of your accuracy is completely determined by your mainhand weapon, then the GWD2 off-hand variants are statistically identical to other Tier 80 off-hand weapons. Meaning, an off-hand Chaotic Crossbow is statistically identical to The off-hand Shadow Glaive (when using EoC combat mode, in Legacy, it's slightly different) - **Making certain combination potion types are literally cheaper per dose than the cost per dose of the plain potion.** For example: making a holy overload potion costs an extra bit of money (a crystal flask and a prayer renewal potion) but since it is converting your 4 dose overload potion into 6 doses, each individual dose becomes cheaper. This can allow one to make more overload potion doses, and spending the same amount of money. - **""free"" xp  free xp** Time = money Just because you aren't spending any money on the XP you're earning, doesn't mean you're saving your self any time or effort. A lot of the time, the ""free"" method is horrendously slow xp, and just spending some time to make some money then training a skill in a semi-efficient manner saves you tons of hours and can be done in a low effort way. - There is an item called a **Large Rune Pouch**. It can be bought cheaply off of the Grand Exchange, it can hold 3 different types runes and be worn in your ammo slot. It is very useful for holding alch runes and you **air surge** runes if you're using magic. Or alternatively, 2 of the slots can be used for **vulnerability spell** runes and the last rune spot used for air runes to use magic for combat. Another thing people seem to not know, is the fact that spells of the same tier will do the same damage if used with the same weapon. Therefore, Air surge will do identical damage to Fire Surge. All the surge spells will do the same damage, and all the other types will do the same if they're of the same type (same type, not same element) If an enemy is weak to a certain thing, using its weakness only gives you an **affinity** bonus and does nothing to the raw damage you do to the enemy. Affinity affects the calculation for your hitchance against an enemy, meaning you're more likely to hit an enemy if you use it's weakness (your accuracy and affinity are both used in a formula to calculate your hitchance against an enemy). This is useful for some situations, but for things like slayer, where you basically have 100% hitchance, then using that specific enemies weakness is pointless, since you're always going to hit anyways. This extends to magic the most, since if an enemy is weak to fire spells, and you already have 100% hitchance, you should not waste inventory spots, or waste the extra money on the extra runes wasted when you can use your highest tier of air spell (such as air surge) since this will have identical damage as all other surge spells. One last thing to mention about magic, is the fact that the spell you use determines your damage but is capped by the tier of your staff, and the staff you use determines your accuracy. Meaning, if you use a Tier 60 staff and a surge spell (tier 90 spell), then your accuracy will be tier 60, and the staff will cap your damage to tier 60. Where as a tier 90 staff with a strike spell (tier 1 spell) will have tier 90 accuracy, but the damage will be tier 1. - their are very useful options in your **gameplay settings** , I recommend all players to look and read through all of the gameplay settings and discover what useful quality of life things you can do. Things such as instantly destroying vials after finishing potions, or destroying pie dishes after finishing pies, etc, etc. I might edit this post and add more, for people that want to extend the list, leave some suggestions and I'll look through and add.

As a high level solo player, this will often mean that you're dealing 10K-20K extra damage in place of an auto attack. It far from ends there though. In a group setting that additional damage is multiplied by each player in the group. Many would say magic needs it to have good DPS, but the reality is that melee and range can also use vulnerability. **Question 1:** Do you think vulnerability is too good? **Question 2:** Do you think making vulnerability only apply to the caster's damage would be good? **Question 3:** Do you think making vulnerability only apply to other player's damage would be good? **Question 4:** Do you think making vulnerability only apply to magic damage dealt would be good?"

You would use the first keybind to start the incantation. 2. You would then see a symbol in a small pop up window that is one of the of the other 3 keybindable abilities. 3. You then need to use the corresponding keybind to trigger the next symbol. (They would be in a random order and you would have maybe 10 seconds before you need to start over. This just gives room for people to get into it. Obviously people that are good wouldn't need to wait that long and the faster you do it the better dps you would have.) 4. You would need to do this maybe 3-4 times to be able to cast a spell. The spell you would cast are ones we already have like vulnerability (all damage done for the next 10 seconds is increased by 25&amp;#37;) but in a stronger form with the addition of this being cast off global cooldown and receive a adren buff of like 5&amp;#37; or soemthing. Example of how this could work. I have my keybinds as (1) for to start my incantation, (a) for symbol 1, (s) for symbol 2, (d) for symbol 3, and (f) for vulnerability. Now I press 1 to start it up, symbol 2 pops up I press s, symbol 1 pops up I press a, symbol 3 pops up I press d, and now I press f to cast vulnerability off global cooldown and get 5&amp;#37; adren. All of this while doing my normal ability rotation. The point of this would mix up how you do spells and make the random nature of the spells make it feel more wild and crazy. Melee - Combo Attacks Like Magic you would get 4 new bindable things to add to your bars. However unlike Magic they will not come in a random order. The attacks would be done in a combo to get different effects. The effects could range from you activating your next non-bleed/channel ability twice, to taking all basic abilities off cooldown, 50&amp;#37; of the next attack criting, their next attack misses, etc. There is a lot you could do. The basic idea is you know exactly what's going to happen next if you do your combos exactly right. It would all be fast paced and in the heat of the moment. I see there being a little box window showing the up on your screen with the order of the attack too. Maybe in the same place that you see your magic incantations and range shots(below). Range - Arrow/Bolt Switching This one is more laid back. Like Magic and Melee you would have 4 new binds but these binds would act as 4 different types of shots you could use. These shots would be the different arrow/bolt types like the enchanted onyx, ruby, etc. Switching and activating the shot type would give you a higher chance for the effect to activate and 100&amp;#37; chance of destroying the type of arrows/bolts you had. Example. I have a nox bow on and araxyte arrows in my quiver. I active the onyx shot keybind and it doesn't activate. But because I tried to use it I broke my araxyte arrow and my onyx shot. I then use my ruby keybind and it activates. It destroys the ruby shot and the araxyte arrow. To avoid spamming this I think there might need to be a cooldown or you couldn't use that type again till you use another type of shot. I got this from watching movies where archers have all these trick arrows. My hope would make it so you get the feel of controlling each effect more and doing exactly what you want when you want it. Hope that all made sense. Let me know what you think or why this would be broke or whatever. =P Cheers!"

I do have flanking 3 and use abilities in the general priority: WM&gt;Asphyxiate&gt;Deep Impact (flanking)&gt; Dragon Breath&gt; Impact (Flanking)&gt;Corruption Blast&gt;Sonic Wave&gt;Combust&gt;Chain. I'm using Guthix Rests in Sunshine, Jellyfish for the last pillar and from 600k LP-&gt;0 LP on AoD, using vulnerability on everything, etc. Please let me know if you have anything else that could be helpful!"
73,vulnerability,runescape,Duo Solak - Our method,713,8n7n44,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8n7n44/duo_solak_our_method/,2018-05-30 20:59:34,"Hey, this post is intended to be a short 'guide' to what Ghost Team and I did - I'm really busy studying for exams the next couple weeks so I hope this will clear up most questions. I will describe our exact method and some thoughts on how it could be improved. --- **Phase 1** Tank POV. DPS doesn't seem to matter a huge amount since you can very easily make up for any damage you don't do p1 during the time gated mechanic on p2. It's possible to do this phase without food if you're careful. Resonance as soon as you're low enough hp to benefit from it. Run to the green thing, reflect and/or shield dome the hit you take when the bar fills (don't resonance it, Solak will always melee you on the same tick and that hit will take priority). Use devotion and kill all the roots that spawn around the edge of the arena - aim to extend your devotion twice. When the roots spec comes, communicate with your duo partner to make sure you aren't going to hit them with yours. Use anticipation, surge when your timer hits 0. Get another resonance off of Solak, debilitate, continue DPSing till it starts attacking you at a faster rate (seems to be a few seconds after debil runs out), devotion again, resonance again if necessary. You easily soul split to full off the next part so don't worry about being low health here. Sunshine when Solak stops attacking (adren pot optional), kill the arms and legs. Aim to end on 92%+ adrenaline. Spellbook swap and vulnerability the blight core, brew up and onslaught. Repeat from the top. **Phase 2** Time gated phase, it's good to resonance off cooldown. You can choose to keep having a base/DPS role, but we just let Solak hit whoever it went on. Start by killing one of the anima eruptions on the north side of the arena, stand in the circle and click the storm. Reflect as you come down since you'll take a reasonably heavy amount of blight damage, surge south and cleanse your blight with Merethiel. Then kill one of the anima eruptions on the south side, debilitate with a shield on before you get sent up if reflect is going to be on cooldown. Kill the other northern anima eruption when you come down, then return south, cleanse your blight again, and kill the final remaining eruption. Note: The damage you deal to the storm is equal to (10 - your blight stacks)*1000 - if you take too long to kill the eruptions at one of these stages, your blight stacks will go above 10 causing you to heal the storm rather than damaging it. Pay attention to your stacks and cleanse earlier if necessary. Next you'll have to deal with bombs - again, DPS doesn't matter, so just play defensively and try to preserve food. Dodge the bombs, reflect if you think you're going to get hit by one. Have both players take nature's blessing from the north side of the arena, let one player activate the shield after Solak shouts ""The power of the grove in its purest form. Let it rain down upon you."" I will refer to this spec as 'rain' from now on. (Important - wait 3-4 seconds after he says it before activating it or your shield will run out too early) and that player can then immediately take a blessing again. Use defensives to mitigate the damage you take here - we chose to reflect, debilitate and shield dome but cade intercept is another viable way to deal with it. Cleanse your blight. Solak will then drag and stun one player after yelling ""I'll crush you like the bug you are"" (can be stopped with anticipation/freedom) and lock one of his arms in the ground. You now deal double damage - have one player meta + adren pot (onslaught could be viable?) while the other player runs up his arm. The player running up his arm will be hit for a heavy (8k-ish) melee hit as the animation ends, resonance it. You then have to deal with the rain spec again, both players should still have a blessing so make sure you only use one. Do not waste barricade or resonance, you need it to deal with the next spec. Solak will shout and start spinning very quickly, and start dealing heavy blight damage after a short delay. Resonance the first hit, then have one player barricade and intercept the other. Cleanse your blight afterwards, deal with the rain spec, then cleanse again. Another blessing will spawn, have both players claim it, deal with the rain once more. It will do the crush you spec described above - do more damage if you haven't lowered it to 1.2m yet, but either way have one player run up his arm again and res the melee hit. **Phase 3** As far as I'm aware, there are two ways to end this phase. I will describe the way we did it, which was slower but safer. I'm not sure if damaging Erethdor in Solak's mind has any impact doing this method, but we did it anyway since it didn't make a difference to speed/food usage. I will not describe when exactly we cleansed blight as we did it kinda randomly, usually when it was over 15. Pay attention to your stacks and cleanse when it is convenient for you. Have the base tank stand in one of the circles until it charges fully, then both players enter the mind using your extra action button, and attack Erethdor. It is better to have the player who wasn't tanking Solak tank Erethdor as they would be praying ranged anyway. Be high hp when leaving his mind - Solak sometimes switches targets, pay attention to this. Stun Solak when he tries to stun you on this phase to prevent the blight bleed. Repeat this process until Erethdor is low hp, and make sure Solak is at 300k hp before you charge the last circle. If you actually tried to DPS (we didn't ult at all) you should be able to get Solak to 300k with multiple circles still uncharged. At this point you can kill Erethdor to end the phase earlier, saving some time. **Phase 4** Strats: The aim is to kill Solak whilst preventing Erethdor from killing him in his mind. Make sure you start this phase on full hp + adrenaline. Have player 1 meta + adren pot on Solak, and player 2 enter Solak's mind and deal with the images. As soon as player 1 finishes their meta, they enter Solak's mind, player 2 cade + intercepts them and both players heal Solak to full whilst DPSing the images. Both players stay in Solak's mind until all the images die, with player 2 focussing on building adrenaline. Player 2 then leaves solak's mind and meta adrens - repeat the above process with the player's roles being swapped. If the player inside Solak's mind gets to low hp the other player should instantly enter the mind realm, look to devo+intercept (try to extend it off killing the images) and allow the other player to re-enter the main realm to heal up. Remember vampyrism aura, excalibur and soul split all still work inside Solak's mind, but food doesn't. Mechanics: The images appear to heal more (and hit harder on you) the longer they're alive. Try to keep track of when each one spawns and focus your damage accordingly. Solak will slowly charge an extremely powerful (~9.5k base) blight hit in the main realm. It is possible to react to this and resonance it, but if you are just exiting Solak's mind on low hp it is safer to insta-resonance and use the time to eat to 10k if you don't get hit. Solak will also periodically hit the player in the main realm with the same AoE blight attack the non-tank experiences during the rest of the kill, this is very easy to resonance or reflect. You could also reprisal it for extra damage. If you know you are going to fail this phase, take your sign of life off (or take off your max cape, drop your portent, whatever) - you will be instakilled and your sign will go on cooldown anyway. --- My apologies for the lack of structure/formatting, I kinda rushed this as I really should be studying. I hope some of you still find this helpful. I won't be around much to answer questions, but Ghost might be when he's awake. Thanks again to everyone for all the support, huge thanks to Ghost for carrying me, big thanks to Buffy (duoing with Geoso) who I was pming pretty much the whole time discussing strategies, and finally a massive thanks to Ramen and everyone that worked on Solak - incredibly well designed boss, it was a real challenge.

74,vulnerability,runescape,Solak 7-man Phase 1-3 Guide,64,8n8ogn,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8n8ogn/solak_7man_phase_13_guide/,2018-05-30 23:44:43,"First of all thank you Ramen for a God damn amazing boss, its mechanically difficult, requires precise timing and communication. This is going to be a long rambly post, so if you have a question on a specific mechanics, ask below and I'll try to answer P4 is likely going to be easier once the community figures out how to properly do it in a 7man My team, while we don't have a kill yet, we have been constantly getting to p4 on all our attempts now, so I thought I would help out and write a guide on how we do it. The major thing I noticed was teams playing way too much attention to DPSing rather than actually do the mechanics. This guide will be written from the frame of mind of the DPS, so I might miss something based on the tank --- **Phase 1** We always built to 100 to start, and started with some thresholds, about 10 seconds in the first special spawns. + *Green Bomb:*There are 6 green circles that spawn, you need to get in all 6 to avoid the ~5k hit. To combat this mechanic we had the 6 areas marked off (NW, W, SE - tank, NE, E, SE) and one person (who happened to be meleeing) as a floater. Sometimes there are really bad spawns so we reflected the damage 100% of the time. After the explosion you'll get a bar start to count up you should resonance after Solak yells to block the 8-11k hit (I have noticed some teams group up in the middle to take 8ks, but I think that's a waste) + *Roots*: After the bar fills, 8 roots will spawn,4 on each side. Again we had assigned positions with 3 DPS on each side. You should be at 100 after using resonance. Which allows you to do a sun rotation APOT, you should be able to almost kill or kill your root by the next mechanic + *Angry Roots*: After about 15 seconds your screen will shake and 3 people will get an arrow run to that arrow, and when you have 5 seconds left run to the wall where the arrow is reflect and freedom then run back to the middle. COMMUNICATE HERE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET AN ARROW ON THE SOUTH WALL Those that didn't get roots should run south and clear the final 2 roots, the base should run north so that those who aren't full can soul split the final 2 roots. If you don't get the roots minions will spawn kill them asap and devour because they wreck + *Blight Bombs:* After the roots are dead (or minions spawned, kill asap) Solak will throw out Blight Bombs at the DPS, should you get a bomb spread out and resonance it as the bar fills, if you are going to stay attack Solak, also Devo so Res doesn't get popped by an auto. He will continue to auto and then throw out a 2nd bomb, Solak will go to the middle before the 2nd bomb goes off so you can freely resonance it. If you get both bombs Reflect the second one. + *Arms and Legs*: After the 2nd blight bomb, Solak will sit down and his legs/arms become attachable. Sun rotation (ZGS if melee) to kill his arms/legs in time but make sure you are 90+% adrenaline by the end of the legs being killed. + *Orb*: Auto + Dragonsbreath + Onslaught the orb, you should be able to do ~550k damage in the time. Meleers should Zerk + Apot here. + *Auto Barrage:* This isn't an actual mechanic but its relevant to helping conserve food. There is a lull of mechanics before the cycle repeats, as you'll be low hp from onslaught it is best to resonance and build to devotion. + And repeat...the only difference in the 2nd rotation is that there is only 1 blight bomb before he does arms and legs.If done correctly the 6 DPS should use no food on p1. *TL;DR* Green Bomb -&gt; Roots -&gt; Angry Roots -&gt; Blight Bombs -&gt; Arms -&gt; Legs -&gt; Orb -&gt; Repeat --- **Phase 2** + *Phase transition* After the Orb hits 0 HP, the next phase starts, Tank goes south while all the DPS go north-east soul split can stay on until the DPS go in the light beam + *Anima Crystals* Start at the north east crystal and start building with basics, after 3 basics use resonance, you'll heal on the typeless hit. Then use 3 more abilities and use reflect + shield dome (from one of the DPSers) to combat he next blight. Go into the light beam that spawns as long as you have less than 10 stacks and spam click the orb. Shortly before you reach the bottom click on your map to go south and surge. + *Cleanse*: Assign a cleanser and he will click cleanse when everyone is near the base (who is already standing in the cleanse area). Devo + Resonance while waiting for the cleanse. Run to the south east crystal and do the same thing as the first one. + *Repeat*: Once the 2nd crystal is done, cleanse and do the 3rd crystal, this should kill the orb in the middle. Cleanse once being done with the 3rd crystal + *4th Crysta*: Kill the 4th one but do not go up. At this point everyone should meta/sun and DPS Solak as there will be a lull until the next mechanic. The Tank should bring Solak up to the north end while the DPS kill the 4th crystal + *Bomb Party*: Bombs will start coming out everywhere, run away from them, hugging the water seem to be the best, don't be afraid to use defensives here and focus on surviving rather than DPSing. + *Golden Shield*: Once the bombs are done a golden circle will spawn on the north end. 3 people will be able to grab it, they should be assigned before the kill aforementioned (Shield 1, Shield 2, Shield 3) + *Barrage of bombs*: Shortly after the golden circle spawns Solak will start a barrage. The team should group up under the base (no need to switch to melee prayer as Solak doesn't AOE) I remember it by the voiceover ""Rain down upon you"" Shield 1 should be activated shortly after he says that to get all 5 bombs in it. Everyone else should debilitate and Reflect the bombs while one person shield domes. If done correctly Most people should be taking ~250-500 per bomb. + *Climb*: After the barrage is over Solak will stun and smash someone, you need to freedom/run away if you are chosen. One person has to climb Solak (assign this before the kill and a backup) Everyone else should do a thresh rotation with souls split on. The person who climbed can also attack but it breaks the animation. The climber should use resonance shortly after the green message that says you are free. If you're worried about res running out use devo and melee protection. + *Cleanse*: After the climb and smash everyone should surge south to cleanse as stacks will be super high. Stack up on the base inside the cleanse so that you can be ready for the next barrage. + *Barrage v2*: Same rotation as the first one, however you want to end this one above 80% adrenaline. + *Tornado*: Solak spins and shoots out bombs, everyone should cade this as it lasts all 5 hits, should anyone not have adren they should call out for an intercept. Usually we also intercept the base. Ideally we would cade + cept everyone but that is not worth maybe losing a kill over. + *Base Thorns*: Solak will shoot thorns out at the base so no-one should be near him, the DPS pile should sun-apot here as it's a good time to do damage. Watch out for random aggro after the thorn attack. We place our base on the west side facing south while the DPS are all in the middle. The tank should anticipate/freedom and run away after Solak yells + *Thorny Blight Bombs*: Solak will target 3 players, they all need to run north and spread out, creating a triangle. Anticipate and resonance the bombs. Thorns will complete the triangle so make sure they won't intersect anyone + *Base Thorns*: This attack repeats, if you're one of the people walking back into the DPS pile be wary of the thorns. + *Barrage v3*: Same as the first one, however you want to finish off the phase during this golden shield as if you don't then Bomb Party will happen again on p3 which is bad, with the rotation we were doing we were constantly getting it during the 3rd barrage. DO NOT LEAVE THE GOLDEN SHIELD AFTER THE PHASE ENDS AS YOU WILL STILL BE HIT BY THE BARRAGE TL;DR Anima Crystals -&gt; Cleanse -&gt; Repeat 2 more times -&gt; 4th Crysal and DPS -&gt; Bomb Party -&gt; Barrage 1 -&gt; Climb and Smash -&gt; Cleanse -&gt; Barrage 2 -&gt; Tornado -&gt; Base Thorns -&gt; Thorny Bombs -&gt; Base Thorns -&gt; Barrage 3 ---- **Phase 3** We don't have as set of a rotation for p3, so the guide won't be as well as it can be. From what I've gathered it starts at a random part of the p3 rotation There are 3 groups of people (Tank, DPS x4, Shadow Realm x2) + *Circle Charge*: Tank should immediately stand on one of the circles to start charging up entry to the shadow realm, once its complete, the 2 Shadow Realmers should click the active button and go the shadow realm. There they can DPS down Erethdor, ideally you want the person with vulnerability to be in the shadow realm. While they are in the shadow realm DPS down Solak and Soul Split some HP back, watch out for random aggro after he stands up + *Thorny Bombs*: Thorny Bombs come out like on p2, however on this phase you need to anticipate them as you may get stunned while trying to time your resonance. + *Stun*: Everyone gets stunned and starts taking bleeds, in order to combat this, people need to stun Solak back, we found its about 4-5 different people stunning when we had 7 people alive to stop taking the bleed + *Cleanse*: Cleanse as you need to on this phase as stacks can get up quickly + *Prepping for P4*: Get Erethdor low ~20k HP make sure Solak is under 800k, everyone should be 100% Adren, 100% HP and potted up for the final phase. Charge a Circle and the 2 people that go in should basic down Erethdor. This Phase is just rinse/repeating 2 mechanics while its mostly a DPS phase, in comparison to P2 which is mostly a tank phase. ---- **Phase 4** TBA (Hopefully)"
75,vulnerability,runescape,How to Duo P4 Solak - example included!,98,8o699u,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8o699u/how_to_duo_p4_solak_example_included/,2018-06-03 14:33:05,"Hi everyone! I'm Bass. I haven't seen a guide for how to do P4 of Solak yet so I thought I'd explain the quick and easy way to do it. First off, here's the example from my stream that I'm going to explain (I found a way to get both player's perspectives on the same screen to make it easier for everyone to watch both players at the same time): URL --- **As the tank** Your job is to get a bit of damage down on Solak, then go into the shadow realm and tag all the minions that spawn and heal Solak. You start the kill outside, and use **Natural Instinct**. Build up to 100%, then use **Metamorphosis** and use an **Adrenaline Potion** as well. Using **3 basics** should get you enough adrenaline to use the 3 thresholds you need to use before you switch to the shadow realm: **Wild Magic, Shatter (both players should get Solak to 10 shard stacks from P3), and Asphyxiate.** Once in the shadow realm, you attack all the minions (there are around 10 by this time) while building to 100% adrenaline, then **Barricade.** During this time, you should be spam clicking Solak to heal him, while using abilities still on the minions. Then, once you are 50% adrenaline, use **Devotion** and by the time it's over, the kill should be finished. --- **As the DPS** Your job is to do all the damage to Solak and finish him before the tank dies. The DPS rotation I've found that kills it guaranteed (NO 4TAA REQUIRED) is as follows: * Natural Instinct, build to 100% * Sunshine * Use basics until Natural Instinct runs out (usually 3-4) * Wild Magic, Asphyxiate * I like to use Reprisal here because you will take a 4K hit from the bomb, but if you have Flanking, use Deep Impact instead (I don't xD) * Use basics until your thresholds are back * Use the second round of Wild Magic and Asphyxiate * Adrenaline Potion * Onslaught By the time your onslaught is over, you should have gotten the kill. --- Other Notes I recommend both players use a Steel Titan (summon it during the end of P3 so that you are ready) and bring at one 4-dose summoning potion. The DPS should use Vulnerability on Solak so both players do 10% more damage. That's it from me! I'll be here to answer any questions you guys have. Good luck with Solak and let me know if this helps!"

77,vulnerability,runescape,Whats the point of the fletching skill exactly if finished arrows and bolts are dropped by monsters?,13,8peckx,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8peckx/whats_the_point_of_the_fletching_skill_exactly_if/,2018-06-08 07:49:16,"I find it really weird how with most arrow and bolts theyre dropped complete by monsters (e.g. araxyte arrows) instead of needing to actually be fletched into complete arrows/bolts. This basically makes the fletching skill a bit redundant if it cant even be used for what its designed for. This also applies to weapons, where fletching is meant to also act as a way to make ranged weaponry but again it doesnt work well with that. I know this is also the case with magic where runes are dropped by monsers too, but the difference is with magic these runes get used up in bulk with other things too other than just combat and are in high demand always (e.g curses like vulnerability, lunar spells, alchemy for nature runes, skilling spells etc) so runecrafting is still a good money maker for a skill. So why is fletching the way it is?"
78,vulnerability,runescape,Ranged,1,8q8uki,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8q8uki/ranged/,2018-06-11 21:39:08,"The activation chances for bolts need to be buffedRanged is still not comparable to melee and magic. I was hoping that solak would be a boss where ranged was better to use than magic because magic is the best style to use. Ranged should be more viable. Before the bolt update, I had been posting for six months prior that the enchanted bolts were supposed to be ranges effects or special thing that would put it on par with magic and melee. HoweverIt did not do that. The bolt chances are so low that they cannot be relied upon. Vuln, stag, and enfeeble all give greater effects than any of the bolts, can be done on demand, and cost significantly less. Quake is practically free. When it was said that they were supposed to be niche Jagex(Mod Pi?) did this in the wrong way. Niche should be that you should be able to choose what bolt you want for the kind of effect you need or desire, not that there would be a best bolt to use. For example, If a boss uses magic and hits high with it, it should be at least viable to use red topaz bolts to decrease the amount of damage taken. But the activation chances are so low that there is no point in using them(Not to mention that they are too specific, they only decrease magic stats, whereas stagger and enfeeble affect all styles). The update was lackluster and did not really fix the problems ranged hasThe only way to make these bolts somewhat practical is to increase the chances to make them somewhat dependable. They should have had good chances from the beginning so that they all could have been viable, with certain bolts being better than others for particular situations. I thought the base chances of all the bolts would have been 10% and with the seers boost it would have doubled that(like it used to I think). If exceptions must be made than make them(ruby bolts), they were already made anyway. I suggest boosting all the chances of all bolts that are below 10% to 10%. Make onyx and hydrix bolts 15%( around 1/7 chances). Increase the boost from the seers task to 5%( it should have been greater than 2% from the beginning). Also, buff Red topaz bolts; they have currently have a 5%(7%) chance to decrease your opponents magic level by 2 and temporarily decrease their damage by one percent. This is laughably bad, especially since this is the only debuff bolt that ranged has. The bolts specifically reduce magic damage and nothing else, so they should have had a more powerful effect than vulnerability. It should reduce magic damage and accuracy by up to 10% and every time the bolts activates it should debuff by 2%. As mentioned before, it should be somewhat reliable. "
79,vulnerability,runescape,Can we get a less janky way of applying vulnerability and entangle?,6,8g7p8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8g7p8p/can_we_get_a_less_janky_way_of_applying/,2018-05-01 21:23:17,Vulnerability and entangle essentially take the place of an auto but because of the tick system with autos they can be very finicky to apply. This usually leads to spamming them while using other abilities. Unless you're 4 ticking and are acutely aware of when your autos are landing it is very awkward to use. Vuln especially is usually applied at the start of a kill and if an auto sneaks in before it you waste a lot of time. Perhaps make them like surge/escape where they are abilities but can be cast outside of gcd. Or even like Excalibur where you can just cast whenever.

So I recently came back to the game after a ~7 year hiatus, and I've been making money from Vindicta solos. I'm currently averaging 2:45 minute kills with magic, which seems to be slower than average since I've read about other players managing 1 minute kills. I've got the mechanics down at this point, and can easily survive the full hour without banking, so at this point I'm looking to upgrade my gear. Problem is, my supply of cash is somewhat limited, so I'm looking to invest in what would increase my kill times the most. My current set up is: Anima Core of Seren, staff of limitless air (T82), spellcaster gloves, subjugation boots, defense skillcape, asylum surgeon's ring (with a vigour swap for sunshine and a LotD for drops), dragon rider amulet, and illuminated unholy book (uncharged). Torment, soul split, holy overloads, dreadnips, vulnerability, enhanced excalibur. Access to corruption blast. Malevolent shield swap. 99 magic, defense, constitution. What I'm currently eyeing in terms of upgrades: Noxious Staff (about 20m off) Invention (I've heard that this can give up to a 20% DPS increase? But also very expensive). Supreme Overloads. Elements Scrimshaw. T90 power armor. Steel Titan/Nihil. I only have 135m to work with atm, so which combination of upgrades would help the most with improving times? Thanks!"

84,vulnerability,runescape,Some PvM changes?,0,83ikv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/83ikv3/some_pvm_changes/,2018-03-11 09:36:47," Hey RS reddit, these are some PvM related changes that I personally think would pretty awesome if they were implemented. **Blood Essence:** Change blood essence so that you can directly activate the buff from your inventory while still keeping the 1 minute cool down, if u want to get the passive bonus equip it to your pocket slot. I think this would be pretty great, as currently blood essence has become less popular as it once was, this i presume would more than likely bring the popularity back up and reduce the amount of switches necessary just to activate a one 20 second buff every minute which can be quite tedious honestly and maybe look back over some of the other blood essences and change them to make them slightly more useful? **God Books:** Changes to the god books in which the god pages give charges rather than a time per page. I personally never really understood why they would be on a timer such as scrims because most of the time your wasting this timer as the book activation can be quite far apart. The changes towards charges would make it where you would still have an active/inactive toggle, but rather the book uses charges. This would require some balancing as the clue scroll update has reduced the price of book usage by quite a bit. I also feel it's necessary to look back at some of the book special attacks because currently the guthix and ancient books are quite lack luster as the damage is quite low. **Hexes:** Currently Vulnerability/Stagger/Enfeeble are the three that comes to mind, while the inferior version are quite useless due to not being stack-able. Now currently i want to delve on vulnerability, I believe the 1 minute timer should be as is and to make it work on overload bosses, I'm mainly talking about Vorago. It's not secret that team sizes have become much smaller and this is currently the direction in which Runescape is going with PvM related bosses as skill and knowledge is more apparent than ""tank and spank"". But honestly this would be a pretty big game changer as it would make doing smaller team bosses a little easier, partically duo vorago and trio/4 man hardmode in which you are able to vuln every phase. I know this is quite niche but it would be a pretty big quality of life update that would prob breathe some life back into hardmode Vorago. Currently Stagger/Enfeeble are pretty much boarderline useless, maybe look back at these and change the rune requirements to make them require soul runes like vulnerability with the same elemental runes? But it doesn't really change the fact that both of these hexes are quite useless. I think a suggestion I once heard is to change New Stagger: Increases your weapons accuracy by 10% for 1 minute. Not to be confused with your hit chance. As i feel 10% hit chance would be a little on the strong side. New Enfeeble: You take 10% more damage but your target defense is lowered by 10% for 1 minute. I know what most of you are going to say, this is way to strong, but let me argue my point, I believe that this would be quite healthy for the game as it would encourage people to put these spells somewhere within their rotation, revive these spells from being dead content, and it would help to alleviate splashing. I feel the changes to these spells would bring a new pivotal role to the forefront ""the debuffer"" in which it's not just limited to guthix staff/vulnerability and count become part of the meta in future content. What do you guys think? Finally my last point is to change these spells to be useable off GCD entirely, also a look into putting the veng spells and disruption sheild as well. Wink Wink **Spellbook Swap:** Currently Spellbook swap is a spell within the ancient spellbook/lunar that's lets your switch to anther spellbook for 1 spells. I believe that this spell should be split into two different spells dependent on which spellbook you are on. So while you are on ancients you are able to switch to lunars/normals in 1 click. Also adding spellbook swap to the normal spellbook would be a great quality of life. An alternative to this, because I know players will say this is a waste of development time would be to give the spellbook swap interface the aura interface in which it isn't canceled while in combat. Personally I use my damage boosting ultimate abilities on 2 and I can't tell the amount of time I've personally sunshined instead of switching to lunars for disruption sheild because my game isn't super responsive or ping issues. The point I made earlier is that this would make the hexes much more worthwhile. And my final point, JMods, please don't be afraid to go back to older bosses and update really annoying glitches on older bosses in which have existed for years now. The one that come to mind include vorago's 1 hp causing random agro within nm/hm and rise of the six shadow realm in which you cannot tag karils/ahrims. I know Solak is super hype right now but please just because new content in released doesn't mean player don't like to do other bosses. Thanks! Have a great day and thanks to all who took time out of their day to read this and do tell me what you guys think! "
85,vulnerability,runescape,Why C4TAA should remain in the game as-is,0,7radoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7radoc/why_c4taa_should_remain_in_the_game_asis/,2018-01-19 02:22:12,"I'm going to advocate for a position I don't think has been adequately spoken for - that c4taa should remain in the game as-is, and that minor tweaks to damage numbers are at most what is needed. There are many good reasons for this: [1.] **Jagex and the community in general are open to having mechanical skill rewarded with higher damage output.** This much doesn't seem to be terribly controversial. It's healthy for the game to have a higher skill ceiling. It promotes player engagement beyond a repetitious skill grind. It encourages you to understand and master the game mechanics. [2.] **C4taa is an engaging system that rewards mechanical skill.** It should be fairly self-evident from many of the posted criticisms of c4taa that the vast majority of people against it don't really understand what c4taa entails, portraying it as nothing more than tedious item-switching and button-mashing. While the execution of c4taa requires both, in order to use it effectively requires a deep knowledge of the combat abilities, and the ability to construct rotations on the fly. C4taa has many intricacies that arise from the current system; I list just a few of them here: * Channeled abilities need to be canceled with a dual-wield ability before the next staff auto. * When integrating guthix's staff specials into the rotation, you have to follow up the special with a dual-wield ability before your next staff auto. * Wrack deals double damage when enemies are bound with ice barrage. Using ice barrage to waste freedom at Telos will in turn make asphyx more effective. Once muscle memory for 4-ticking has been developed, it's these larger strategic considerations, on top of managing adren/hp/prayer that come into play. C4taa adds another layer of complexity to combat, and has made the game far more engaging these past few months. [3.] **The advantage conferred by c4taa isn't a problem.** Couchy demonstrated a 7-8% increase in dps over a good rotation. A 15% increase in damage is certainly false. Having vulnerability available with ancients via arcane capacitor was a 10% dps buff, a greater dps increase over c4taa. While it was eventually removed from the game, there wasn't anywhere near as much controversy. Many people didn't see the need for its removal, even. There should really be no uproar over c4taa, if we think strictly in terms of the magnitude of the benefit conferred. Most players can gain far more than 8% dps by simply improving their normal rotations. [4.] **No proposed alternative is similarly engaging or rewarding.** The alternatives that Jagex have so far proposed to us, albeit still works in progress, are clearly unsatisfactory and half-baked. If the damage increase for c4taa is really too high, here's a very easy balance change: Slightly reduce the damage of staff auto attacks if a damage ability was done 4 ticks ago. This doesn't affect the damage output of normal manual rotations (still preserves forced auto attack damage), and still allows for there to be some benefit to c4taa. There's nothing inherently wrong with the framework of c4taa; it's a perfectly serviceable system that serves to reward mechanical skill. There's no sense in replacing c4taa with an inferior system that only serves to attempt the same thing. [5.] **The majority of people opposed to c4taa are almost completely unaffected by whether or not it stays in the game.** The two places in the game where C4taa really shine are at AOD and Telos, both of which are endgame content that most of the playerbase doesn't do. Frankly, most AOD teams are primarily concerned about getting consistent kills. Allowing c4taa gives these teams more room for error, which allows them to be more comfortable with taking learners. Same applies to raids. As for Telos, 800-999 streaking will always be viable; even fewer players are able to do this, and those who c4taa at these enrages will always be able to complete these enrages. A slightly faster kill rate by a few players would proportionally increase the rate at which t92 items come into the game, but that would serve to make these items cheaper and more accessible (by a very small, perhaps negligible margin). Indeed, keeping c4taa is *beneficial* to most people who are opposed to it: it makes it easier for them to get onto teams, and makes high-tier gear more accessible to them. However: [6.] **C4taa is vitally necessary for high enrage Telos kills to be possible.** Consider &gt;2k enrage kills which must be fonted, now that Pantheon is no longer in the game. There are a limited number of AOE abilities: dragon's breath, corruption blast, ricochet, and detonate. A substantial amount of damage onto the golems comes from barrage autos. Without these barrage casts every 4 ticks, your damage output onto the golems is reduced by far more than 8%, making it effectively impossible to font high enrages. Removal of c4taa is the same as effectively removing &gt;2k enrages from the game. It reduces the number of options available to players and restricts their choices. [7.] **Nobody is forced to c4taa.** Dailyscape complaints can be addressed in much the same fashion. If you dislike c4taa, you simply aren't forced to do it. It simply is the more efficient/effective option. But overall, having c4taa is good for the game."
86,vulnerability,runescape,Why 4taa should remain until its replacement is ready,0,7rjl6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7rjl6d/why_4taa_should_remain_until_its_replacement_is/,2018-01-20 03:43:47,"Some of the major arguments against 4taa right now are that it is a bug, people are requiring it for teams, it is mindlessly clicking 4 buttons, and it is unbalanced. In this post Im going to show why 4taa should remain as a part of combat until a polished replacement can be created while clearing up some of the major misconceptions that Ive seen written. ###It is a Bug Firstly, one of the misconceptions I've seen surrounding 4taa which makes people think its a bug. It DOES NOT allow you to use an auto attack 1 tick earlier. You'll find that ascensions allow you to auto attack on the fourth tick as well as khopesh and seismics. The actual mechanics of 4taa are based off of 3 main features as I can see it: 1. The timer before the next auto attack depends on the previous attacks weapon speed. implemented pre-eoc. 2. Being able to queue multiple actions in a single tick, like eating a rocktail and drinking brew in the same tick. implemented pre-eoc. 3. Auto attacks do not initiate a gcd. Implemented on eoc. Important because if you do not auto before your first ability in combat, you can get 0 adrenaline from that first ability. Basically, what happens in 4taa is that your last weapon that you attacked with (dual wield magic) has fastest weapon speed, so your auto attack gets put onto a 4 tick cooldown. Then, because you can queue multiple actions at the same time, you auto attack with staff and switch to dual wield magic. Finally, since auto attacks do not initiate gcd, you are able to immediately use an ability on that same tick with a fastest weapon speed. Although you can definitely consider 4taa to be an unintended mechanic, this doesnt mean that 4taa is inherently good or bad. For example, consider planted feet as it was initially released and walking bosses. Both are unintended mechanics; however, Jagex has agreed that walking had a negative impact on pvm, whereas planted feet had a positive one (Although it was removed from berserk). Since unintended mechanics arent inherently good or bad, we should instead look at the other aspects of 4taa/c4taa to see whether they should remain as is, be modified, or be removed entirely. It seems Jagex is still somewhat undecided about 4taa. On one hand they announced in RuneFest that they thought 4taa was fine when as a 7% dps boost. On the other hand, they recently decided 15% is too high of a dps boost. In addition, Jagex recently decided that their [base damage was too low](URL indicating that 15% isn't the actual dps increase from 4taa. This seems to indicate the mechanic itself is not a problem for Jagex; instead, the damage boost given by 4taa requires balancing. ###It is required in teams People argue that 4taa/c4taa is being required for pvm teams. It's hard to necessarily prove that nearly all teams don't require 4taa, but let's just look at the requirements for joining aod for a popular teaching fc. Boss School FC requires a 750k challenge gem in 5 minutes (150k dpm) to get the aod tag. This does not require 4taa. In fact [Lord Tywin I beat the challenge gem requirement using revo++ with 0 manual ability activations](URL The reason many people don't get onto teams with some of the well known pvmers is simple: if given the choice of going with someone you know vs. someone you don't, which would you choose? The top pvmers in this game know each other well, and as such often create teams together. Similarly many people dont want to take learners, not because of 4taa, but because they know that kills with more experienced people are smoother. Even then, there are public resources like boss school which do teaching lessons for all bosses. I have only seen 1 team advertised as a 4taa/c4taa only team. The people in that team wanted to attempt double melee basing (Requires very competent 4taa barragers to replace chin aoe) in order to improve their personal best times to sub 3:30. Every other team that Ive been on or have seen advertised has never required 4taa, including teams with some of the best pvmers in the game like Ghana who [Currently holds the most pvm records for speed kills](URL and Ideal Gas [who has a 2000 enrage foodless telos kill](URL as a frankly mediocre pvmer. ###C4TAA adds no depth to the game People who have never done c4taa or do c4taa rotations incorrectly say this all the time. The fact of the matter is that building a c4taa rotation is much more complex than building a normal range/mage/melee rotation. One major aspect of 4taa that differentiates it from normal manual is that it punishes mindlessly spamming ability buttons. In order to 4taa correctly, people must wait exactly one full tick after gcd finishes before pressing buttons, or theyll fail to 4taa. 4taa actually made me spam buttons less because I am now confident in my ability to time button presses to be on-tick for range/melee. In addition, damage rotations in c4taa are vastly different from normal ones. We can look at a normal magic/melee/range rotation from The Junesong's ""DPS for dummies"" series (very good introductory dps series). One thing you'll notice very quickly is that conc blast/sonic wave/needle strike/dazing shot/fury are all basically the same thing for all 3 styles, a 5 second cd basic that is decently strong, and therefore can be used almost every time it's off cooldown. An example of this rotation with dual wield magic can be found at: - URL In comparison a very good c4taa rotation can be found at: - URL As you can see, conc blast is used rarely, and only before very strong attacks like wild magic and impact, since it ranges from worse than wrack(worst magic ability without stuns) to an ok ability. For more information as to how c4taa deals with dummies, read [this comment I made] (URL Another important aspect to consider is that a missed auto attack confers no adrenaline gain, while an auto attack that hits gives 2%. This sometimes causes split-second decisions to maximize dps when a missed auto attack makes earlier thresholds impossible (without sigil). I do agree that switching between staff and dual wield every 4 ticks can be somewhat mindless, but c4taa dps itself is not mindless in any way. ###C4taa creates an imbalance in attack styles There are two parts to this argument. One is that +15% damage is too much, the other is that it makes the combat triangle unbalanced. In terms of extra damage gained, I've only seen answers ranging from 7%-14% with proof. As mentioned in the previous part, c4taa is more reliant on whether a boss is flankable/group than normal dps is. - The [14% damage claim by RexT](URL uses both flanking impact as well as corruption blast. Because bleeds like corruption blast can be overridden by others, the damage boost is only that high if the monster is both flankable and a solo encounter, which is impossible for all current bosses, thus in practice the damage difference would be slightly lower. - The [7% claim by Couchy](URL was later changed [to ~11%](URL although I do not know the specific rotations used. - The [13.5% claim by Mod Pi](URL is probably slightly higher than reality, as Mod Pi said their base damage was too low after looking at Couchys baseline non-4taa dps. Note that this assumes perfect c4taa 100% of the time, which is only true for a small minority of pvmers. 11-14% dps increase might be a bit too high, but this could be balanced more easily than trying to create and balance 2 separate abilities for mage and range and then adding a passive to melee. The combat triangle right now favors magic. However, 4taa was not the main reason that magic became meta. Simply put, magic is the most versatile style in the game. Magic has: - the longest bind(entangle is more than 2x the second longest bind) - only aoe bind (ice barrage) - only damage boosting debuff(vulnerability) - only hit chance decreasing debuff (stagger) - only chargeable ability (detonate) - strongest aoe auto attack(T90/92 2h barrage is much stronger than a chinchompa auto) - one of the strongest stuns(asphyxiate) - has spells which provide passive bonuses (smoke/shadow/blood/ice blitz/barrage. Melee has: - the strongest affinity debuff (from statius warhammer + quake) - one of the strongest stuns in game (destroy) - the highest burst damage in game (from berserk) - the best sustain (from vampyrism scrimshaw) - dps which is comparable to c4taa(if utilizing flanking, lunging, zgs spec, and berserk). Range has: - the best area of effect damage in the game (mechanized chinchompas) - accuracy boost to snipe (nightmare gauntlets) - deals slightly more damage than normal magic. Magic became the meta at telos before 4taa even became widespread. In most teams that take over 4:30 to kill aod, the 24s bind(other binds are at most 10 seconds) from entangle is extremely useful. At vorago, magic has detonate as a method to increase damage during reflects along with vulnerability to increase pushback. At raids, magic has a natural affinity advantage against Beastmaster Durzag along with debuffs which decrease the damage bosses deal. At every single solo boss which does not clear vulnerability, magic gets a free 10% damage boost. 4taa pushed magic slightly further, but it was never the edge which made magic the most versatile style. Right now melee has strong positives: the innate sustain provided by vampyrism scrimshaw along with the affinity debuffs that melee can provide means that it is very good for longer fights, berserk is extremely useful in dps dependent sections, and zgs special attack is a very good filler for when berserk is on cooldown as well as a safer option for when players take more damage than usual. Melee could easily become viable again if it were to once again be higher dps than magic. Range at its current state is only good for aoe damage, but enchanted gem bolts look like they could give range the extra options that it needs. Onyx bolts would give extra sustain, and hydrix bolts give range the opportunity to acquire adrenaline much faster than magic or melee, which can be used in situations where defensive thresholds are important or to nullify adrenaline loss from food use. Other cheaper bolts like diamond and ruby look like they will provide a good damage boost in niche situations. Having access to onyx bolts for sustainable healing or hydrix bolts for negating adrenaline loss from eating food, disruption shield to prevent being comboed to death, and an ultimate which doesnt increase damage received could make range a very strong tanking style. The addition of enchanted bolts along with a new way to make range provide competitive damage with magic would once again make range an extra option instead of a style to use only in places where magic is bad. I think a combat style where melee is high risk/high reward style, magic is low sustain/highly adaptable style, and range is high sustain/lower risk style would create the diversity that we want in different combat styles. Balancing is indeed an issue in the current meta, but 4taa is not the primary problem for it. ###Conclusion Although 4taa has its negatives, I feel taking it out of the game before a replacement is made is unnecessary. The current proposals made by Jagex seem extremely unrefined, and lack much of the charm which drew me into 4taa (requiring timing elements) in the first place, while keeping some of the elements which have made other people dislike 4taa (Too much extra button mashing).

Costume, Scan, Two new types of puzzles. * There will be no tile puzzles. * Costume clues will require mid-high level gear (such as godswords/dragon tiered equipment). * We will only reveal time consuming items for emote/item clues before the update if any. * A dragon defender (normal) will be required for a clue. * Several master clues are locked behind quest areas, however all are within Gielinor. * They will no longer be purchasable by clue points (decision made based on play-tests). * We want to keep that feeling of excitement when you get a master clue. * Master tier rewards will NOT be obtainable from the Giant Oyster. **New Reward Information** * ***Clue Scroll Pet:-*** Will be prestigious but it won't have the same RNG as the bloodhound. * This will be the only pet. * ***Clue Scroll Titles:-*** Generic titles from the reward shop * No titles for completing a certain number of a tier of a clue (lower tier titles wouldn't be used). * ***Elite Robin Hood:-*** Will degrade to a broken state (not the inferior robin hood). * ***Flaming Sword Effect:-*** can be added to any weapons (including dyed weapons) * It will also interact with overrides. * It is accessed via the wardrobe interface. * ***Ice Dye:-*** Less common than Barrows dye; More common than Blood dye. * Discussion: If it didn't turn out correctly as desired we wouldn't delay the entire update for it. * We've been experimenting with transparency effects but it hasn't come out well. * Designing dyed equipment requires a lot of work as it isn't automated yet. * ***Seeds:-*** Most likely be removed from the drop table. **Outfit Information** * Number of clue points needed: Unknown * The entire outfit isn't required in order to use individual outfit piece's effect. * The outfit passive will NOT act as a Luck of the Dwarves ring due to balancing. * Recharge Rates: (Pieces can store up to 3 charges total). * Backpack/Torso: 5 completed clues per charge * Boots: 2 completed clues per charge * Legs/Gloves: Don't require charges (passive effects). * Initial outfit effects ideas were dropped for various reasons. * May make certain pieces appear underwhelming but they make up for it by not requiring charges. * One outfit piece's effect allows you to use teleport scrolls from your bank. * No outfit piece effect will prevent poison as there are plenty of other items in the game for that. **Fun Clue Facts** * Almost every ""big"" reward from easy clues has an equal chance to be obtained. * Third-Age outfits aren't included in the treasure chest as most people will never complete those sets. * You can box them up into a set box at the GE if needed. * The 30k coin drop is a reward given if you fail to roll a prismatic star. (Hard Clue) * When you reach the 200 biscuit cap you will begin to receive purple sweets as a replacement. * The 3x3 dig range is shared among all clues with a dig options and therefore compass clues inherited it. **Other** * Specific dye designs can be made and look good in concept, but can look terrible in our engine. * Such as gilded dyes (not currently planned). * Looking into weird interactions when multiple players spawn several Double Agents at the same time. * The poll to graphically rework Third-Age outfits did not get enough player consensus to carry through. * No current plans to do a Cryptic Clue Fest for the release of the clue rework. * Dyes and other clue scroll items don't show up on Runemetrics as they aren't counted as ""drops"". * Amulet of Souls/Reaper Necklace ornaments versions will be repaired normally. *** #Jagex Focused *** ***Jagex has been nominated for MCVonline's Best Community Management of the Year.*** *** ###Mobile *** * We are working on Interface Scaling as part of Mobile, but it will work for PC as well. * All recent, current, and upcoming web projects have been designed with mobile devices in mind. *** ###Audio Team *** * Pirate music is currently being made. * Look into implementing the update version of Flute Salad into the game. *** ###TAPP *** * Mod Chaose's TAPP project worked on back in 2016 isn't complete despite being thought to be. * Chatheads need to be completed. * Dialogue for the named character in the wildy Bandit Camp. *** ###MTX *** * [Moving Textures for an upcoming piece of armor due later this year.](URL *** ###Streams *** * Discussion: What would everyone think of some RS3 Art Streams? * Process of drawing concepts, sculpting/modelling characters and animating them as well. * We can show off certain things before they are released in game without it being spoilers. * Also show off the progress of models and how 'little changes' are sometimes huge tasks. * Lootcrates from now on will have a 100% chance of providing each month's special item. * No current plans to re-do the behemoth pet. *** ###Website/Emails *** * Markup for the forums is different to the news post and sometimes problems may occur. * Emails with multiple accounts will only send a stat email for the account with the most play time. * The French Yearly stat email was a mistake on selecting the English list of players when sending it. * Recent work on account creation/recovery is just the start of improving mobile friendly website interaction. * The site will slowly become more mobile friendly as changes are made. * The forum rework is wanted but there are other priorities. * A web-page tracking boss logs and other statistics are requested but there are other priorities currently. *** #Discussion *** ###Combat *** **General** * [Boss Collection Log](URL * The combat council is looking into 2h range, as the bolt update is overshadowing Seren God Bow. * There are no current known plans to buff the KBD or his drop table. * Invisible golems under Telos issue is being improved. * Made it so Immortality doesn't lock the player in place for an additional second. * T90 armor repairs since level 20 perks is currently being worked on but it is a huge job. **4TAA Issue - General** * Update post ideas were meant to gather feedback and be improved, not to be the final design. * Existing data ran prior to the post supported 15% increase (Pi's calculations coming at 13.5%). * % is being recalculating base values as the base for testing may have been too low. * Going over feedback from the 4taa update post, and re-running numbers that have been questioned. * The new additions need some work/improvement, so please provide feedback and ideas. * C4t was always going to be removed eventually. * It relies too heavily on a heavily obscure nuance of the combat system/bug. * We've recently accelerated addressing it as it is clear the longer it stays the more damage it will cause. * This is also partially due to the community chatter. * Proposed additions not low level friendly and are designed with the high-level community in mind. **4TAA Solution - Discussion** * To prevent the new abilities from being buggy/exploitable on release, we will QA test them. * The time length between the 4TAA nerf and it's replacement is based on how long it takes to design a solution with the community and implement it. * Stabbing weapon passive will roll the passive 1 ability early.

89,vulnerability,runescape,The current state of the combat triangle is the most unbalance it has been since the release of EoC.,347,7q0ck6,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7q0ck6/the_current_state_of_the_combat_triangle_is_the/,2018-01-13 09:38:29,"This post is going to be about the problem that four tick auto attacking (4taa) and continuous four tick auto attacking (c4taa or c4t/4t) has brought into our game. **What Is 4taa?** To explain it as briefly as possible, in around May of 2017 people started discovering a method to get significantly more dps through the magic style using the method known as four tick auto attacking. This involves using a pseudo bug where you put the spell you are casting on your bar and manually casting it alongside your abilities. Doing this allows you to cast auto attacks one tick faster than when they'd naturally go off. The 4taa cycle starts by using an ability with a wand+orb, swapping to a staff waiting the four ticks and then casting an auto attack from your bar and in the same tick using an ability. This in a roundabout way gives you the auto attack damage of a staff at the speed of using a wand. I'd rather not spend a few more paragraphs making a guide of 4taa &amp; c4t but this will hopefully help with getting the gist of how this works. If reading this was confusing and you'd rather be better educated on the topic The Junesong made an excellent video guide which you can watch [here] (URL **Pros/Cons** At its core I am actually in favor of 4taa, it rewards players for micromanaging their dps rotations giving a boost of something in the ballpark of 15% dps for a 270% increase in actions per minutes (c4t). I believe that prior this method being introduced combat ability rotations were slow and didn't have much room for people to implement skill. The problem arises when magic is being left in the game as the style that reigns king over the two for an extended period of time with no fix in sight. **Where Are We Now Jagex?** Back in September of 2017 Mod Pi (/u/JagexPi) touched on this topic during his combat talk at RuneFest. And when I say touched I really do mean just touched, in a one minute segment he states that they know what the bug is but don't plan on removing it until they implement a balanced higher apm system that works for all combat styles. If you'd like to listen to that segment you can [here](URL Later in the [Q&amp;A section](URL it is revealed that the new system is only at the brainstorming stage. Since September we have not had any update on where we are with this proposed new system. One thing I'd like to ask you Pi and other combat council mods is where are we now? You said in the Q&amp;A you would let us know about this new system before you implement it. I'd very much like to know if there has been any progress and am hopeful that this issue isn't on the backlog. Hopefully this thread can help with ideas for this new system to get the ball rolling. **Problems that WILL arise** When I first started playing around with 4taa I was very happy that there was a new toy to play with that gives an edge over people who don't want to put in the extra effort. As time went on, more players adapted to the new combat meta and having one style be much stronger than the others has caused problems. The obvious problem that stands is that range and melee have become sub par combat styles. This makes their gear and weapons cheaper, a lot of items generally useless, various pieces of content dead and worst of all kills hype for future content and makes them dead on arrival. I'm not saying the combat triangle was perfectly balanced prior to 4taa catching on but we're at a point now that for every group pvm encounter the dps role is filled solely by magers. If you have somebody who's willing to spend the money on a statius warhammer on a team you have one person hammering, maybe have one person using range to chin (and really only at aod and rots) and everybody else is using magic. If nothing is changed all future content revolving around melee or range is not going to be interacted with as much nor are the rewards going to be as sought after. Look at the prices of all t90/t92 weapons and you'll see that the mage variants (apart from the noxious scythe and that's a special case) are far and above the most expensive ones. I know there are many other factors here but this comes at least in part from a place of supply and demand, there is a much lower demand for range and melee gear as it is less useful. This spells trouble for future updates, from small things like the bakriminel bolts that are coming out to major pieces of content like Solak. I'd hate nothing more than for Solak to come out and after a few months it turn into a boss that not very many people do as the demand for its drops (the main drop being t92 crossbows) have been met and Telos and AoD are much superior money makers. **Possible Solutions** To reiterate the problem that are currently facing isn't that 4taa is a bad thing in and of itself, it's that it has caused an even more unbalanced combat triangle. It's pretty clear from the people who do use 4taa and from the combat talk that more interactive combat is a good thing for the game. The standard method of using one ability every 1.8 seconds is pretty slow and uninteresting and has a lot of room for improvement. What 4taa did was make it so players have something to do during the global cool down to increase their DPS. The best case solution in my opinion is the vaguely proposed one from RuneFest where a new system is implemented that works with all three styles. I will include some ideas for this system later in my post. I know this will take a lot of development time and probably a few future updates making content specifically for the purpose giving you things to do during the global cool down. With that I only see two possible solutions that can be implemented in a reasonable amount of time and they are: **A.** Make your auto attack in general something that you can put on your action bar and keybind. This will make it so you can 4taa with all styles and balances the triangle as much as it is without the 15% dps increase to magic while allowing players who want to put in more effort the ability to do so. I personally would much rather see this come into the game for the time being until the new system is implemented than option B. **B.** Nerf 4taa and make it so its not worth doing. This can be done through various means, lower the damage of auto attacks when not on legacy mode. Make it so auto attacks take 5 ticks when used off a bar instead of 4. Make it so your auto attack speed is based off the last weapon you auto attacked with rather than the last weapon you did an ability with. The pvm community is split on whether or not this is a good path to go down because it will re balance the combat triangle but take us back to the old one ability every 1.8 seconds system which in my opinion isn't as much fun. I however think that if Jagex isn't willing to implement a ""bug"" further into the combat system to the other styles then this would be better then leaving it the way it is. **Ideas For the New System** Now to finish off my post I'd like to also include some ideas for the future system that would replace 4taa and balance the combat triangle further. **1.** The idea here is be able do things while the global cool down is active so an obvious thing would be to come out with some abilities that you are able to do during the global cool down. Maybe make them have some special effects with a high cool down so they're not overpowered. **2.** Something I've been toying with the idea of would be combo attacks. Use some current abilities and some new abilities and make combo attacks that ignore global cool down, at RuneFest you mentioned the idea of ""spell weaving"" so you could also make auto attacks part of these combo attacks. Imagine if when you did the sonic wave ability dragonbreath ignored global cool down. Imagine if when doing concentrated blast you could cast an auto attack along with each hit of the concentrated blast (with lower damage output then currently). Imagine if there was a new ability that made it so all stuns ignored global cooldown and then impact would let you use a detonate that charged in half the time. These are just a few examples off the top of my head but you could incorporate these ideas into all styles. **3.** This is not really about a 4taa replacement but I think a good way to balance the combat triangle especially in group encounters would be to make it so one combat style does things that buff other combat styles. A very basic version of this would be if they made a new version vulnerability that only buffed melee damage and then melee had a vulnerability that buffed ranged and ranged would have one that buffs mage. What if salt in the wound was a melee threshold but mutated dazing shot was a ranged basic. If there were a few of these kinds of buffs for each style and they lasted a short period of time (think 3-5 seconds) it would encourage a somewhat even split of combat styles going into a group pvm fight. And due to the short nature of the buffs you'd want to bring an even amount of players with each style to reapply them as often as possible whereas currently you only need one mager to vuln a boss for an entire encounter. In conclusion I really like the direction 4taa took RuneScape, I just think the problems that came with it need to be addressed as soon as possible. Thank you for taking the time to read this post, sorry I made it as long winded as I did, I just wanted to make sure my points were conveyed as clearly as possible. **Edit:** I'd like to include some more ideas I saw in the comments for this new system. **4. by /u/EvilLucario** A very radical idea I have been tossing in my head during my break from the game is variable GCDs with abilities and variable adrenaline gains and costs. For example, Ranged getting a base GCD of 1.2 seconds while Magic gets 2.4 seconds and Melee stays as 1.8 seconds immediately changes how you use the styles already. (I [OP] personally don't know how much I like this part.) Then you completely overhaul the basic/threshold/ultimate system where it's no longer a static +8%/-15%/-100% net gain, so all abilities break free of that restriction and allow easier balancing. Then you can go further and add a variable GCD for different abilities. Think Transfigure where that puts you on a ""longer GCD"" when you use it, except applied to far more abilities and you can still move. **5. by /u/Legal_Evil** Another suggestion is to make a secondary set of abilities that have a separate global cooldown than current abilities, which would be called primary abilities. Secondary abilities should contribute no more than 15% of your dps, the same as C4TAA. Each combat style should have their own set of secondary abilities but with a smaller variety than primary abilities as the latter should be the main source of your dps. **6. by /u/Elf_of_Seren** My only opinions are that Mage range, needs shortened to 5-6 spaces, melee needs fixed for bosses, and ranged gear needs to be made worthwhile. I (OP) think that making range have a longer distance (think 12 squares) would be a better alternative but this could be an interesting change as well."
90,vulnerability,runescape,Next 120 Skill: Summoning,76,7euuis,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7euuis/next_120_skill_summoning/,2017-11-23 09:25:30,"A few ideas here of new pouches, new skills which could be affected by Summoning (a lot already are - that's why its a good candidate for the next 120), new ways of making pouches and new training methods. Please try to look past the disappointment of Slayer and imagine what 120 Summoning could look like without assuming it will be as lackluster as Slayer. I don't think in its current state it should be a 120 skill. I am not suggesting you should grind inventory after inventory of pouches. New ways of gaining XP by *using* familiars will be discussed. #**Why Summoning?** Summoning already affects many activities in-game, e.g. Gatherer skills and Combat in particular. Some other activities are aided by using a beast of burden, or familiar's abilities like the Giant Ent providing more fruit from fruit trees and the teleports available on familiars such as the Spirit Kyatt. Expanding on these benefits would mean an increase to 120 for Summoning could be useful to a huge portion of the playerbase, and allowing you to gain good Summoning XP by using different familiars in all kinds of situations - rather than grinding pouch-making - would make the skill as easy to gain XP in as Invention. If the next 120 skill added were to be Mining or Fishing, it might not make sense without partner skills such as Smithing or Cooking respectively; but Summoning arguably already has its ""partner"" skill Slayer already to 120. Players with high Slayer level are likely to have either a high Summoning level, or a large surplus of charms. Summoning is also a nice item sink via tertiary ingredients, and a gold sink via shards. #**New training methods** * Buff the XP from using scrolls * Award Summoning XP when non-combat familiars perform their passive effect (see below in New Skilling Familiars) * Award Summoning XP for damage dealt by combat familiars * Award a chunk of Summoning XP when a familiar is dismissed or its timer runs out, based on some quantifiable level of performance * Allow familiars to be ""levelled up"" so that repeated use of a particular familiar grants you various perks for that familiar. **Move the XP gain away from pouch-making somewhat, and more towards using familiars themselves** In addition to this, perhaps some other changes to making pouches such as: **Charging Summoning obelisks** * Consumes charms/shards for XP, requiring no tertiaries and producing no pouches. * For a period of time would impart perhaps a buff to the obelisk it is done upon on that world. * Small buff to XP and a small chance to send extra pouches to the bank * Would stack for each player who charges that same obelisk on that world (up to a point). Would encourage social training. #**New Combat Familiars** Obviously there would be balancing issues if trying to add a beast of burden which holds more items than a Pack Mammoth, or more powerful combat familiars than the Steel Titan and Nihils as this could make popular existing familiars dead content and/or give the player too much power. To overcome this, familiars which have totally new effects could be made, and for straight upgrades of existing familiars players could add items to these existing pouches such as charms, shards or some other (tradeable) item dropped by monsters or obtained whilst creating pouches. The newly crafted pouches would then be untradeable. Again, the specifics are just ideas of how to make players *want* to actually invest in making and using them. A few suggestions for new familiars. Obviously not limited to these. Just a few new concepts besides the usual damage or BoB type combat familiars.

Various existing pouches across all level ranges could be made upgradeable, at slightly higher level than the regular pouch. E.g. Yak is at 96, some upgrade to the Yak could come 20 levels higher at 116. The upgrade could be something like if you take a hit of over 2000 then it activates a damage reduction on you for a short period of time, or retaliates with a hit of its own. #**New Skilling Familiars** Skilling familiars already exist for some skills at mid-level which could be improved upon, like the Pyrelord or Granite Lobster. Some skills currently have no familiar which directly assists that skill. The following skills could receive a familiar, spread across levels 100-120 and would all be untradeable. Some like the Firemaking familiar could be an elite version of the Pyrelord, to which an item like a magic log or pyre log would be added whereas others like the Invention familiar would be a totally new addition requiring a new tertiary ingredient like a gizmo or junk refiner. Skill|Effect :--|:--| Farming|Increased herb yield, invisible +5 boost Herblore|Chance to create 4-dose potions instead of 3-dose Firemaking|Chance to burn 5 logs per action rather than 1 and can store up to 30 logs (can only be given logs, like how Abyssal familiars can only be given essence) Cooking|Small chance of producing an elite version of the food you cook which could either heal more, or be eaten in the same tick as other food, or have a smaller reduction on adrenaline when eaten Fishing|Invisible +7 boost, increased prawn ball rate Woodcutting|Invisible +5 boost, increased bird nests/crystal geodes, increased special logs from Teak/Mahogany Invention|Chance to obtain components when creating items with artisan skills (does not consume the items created, think of it as the Scavenging perk for skilling) Fletching|Chance to create strung bows when making unstrung bows from logs, and headless arrows when making arrow shafts from logs Some of the passive effects of these familiars could increase with the more players in your vicinity that have the same familiar summoned, encouraging social skilling. #**Other ideas for familiars** * Familiar that in general increases the speed of actions for any artisan skill * Familiar that offers teleports to a wide range of high level skilling locations - would need to be cheap to use, or have its own skilling benefits. Travel is relatively easy in the modern game. It could be instantly dismissed upon arrival for a more useful familiar, but perhaps simply *going there* with the teleport from that familiar offers a buff for a while, like if you go to a Runecrafting altar using the Abyss. #**Creating these new pouches** Tertiary ingredients required for new standalone pouches should make use of items which need a sink and which are not stackable to prevent mass-production at an obelisk. A good example would be Battlestaves. For pouches upgraded from existing pouches, any of the following could be added to that existing pouch: * Charms * Spirit shards * Items related to the skill the familiar relates to * New items obtained by training the skill the familiar relates to, and/or obtained by training Summoning **TL;DR** - Summoning has potential to give buffs to all sorts of activities: combat, skilling and other. It already does but there is potential for more variety. Overload-style upgrades to existing pouches, new unique support type familiars, wider range of skilling familiars (not just gatherer). Importantly, new ways of training the skill that don't just involve repeatedly running to an obelisk and back. "

94,vulnerability,runescape,Borrowed Power is still (mostly) useless,39,7898ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7898ox/borrowed_power_is_still_mostly_useless/,2017-10-24 04:16:57,"**Problems/Limitations:** - Still has a limited movepool of spells - Still has an Astral rune cost to every spell you do (though, this doesn't need to be a problem if the spell is good in the first place) - Damage is still capped to T80 due to limited to Wave spells, can't go up to T92/T99 - Still only allows 1000 casts - Still requires 18,000 Produce from Livid Farm to charge again **Bug:** - If you don't have the appropriate runes in your inventory, it still appears as unable to be cast, even though you can. URL Basically, the only difference is that the arcane capacitor is no longer needed to use Borrowed Power. Good first step, but Borrowed Power is still extremely useless. There's only one way you'll ever get use out of Borrowed Power: charge for Air Wave, then use that as a pinch if you walk into something like Telos on Lunars. **Solution to make Borrowed Power more useful in general:** - Borrowed Power is now available on Standards. (Not Ancients. Vulnerability + Ancients is far too strong in today's meta) - Borrowed Power can now grab any one spell from either Standards or Lunars, allowing the other spellbook to use it at will. In other words: when using Standards, you can grab either Disruption Shield or Group Vengeance or NPC Contact or whatever. When using Lunars, you can grab a Surge spell while using Disruption Shield and Group Vengeance and whatever you want from Lunars. - Increase to 16,000 casts. - Change Produce costs to 2,000 Produce per 500 casts of a spell. (Numbers may need tweaking here, but the point is to only require a small bit of Livid Farm to upkeep, but not overwhelming like it is now) - Keep Astral rune cost."
95,vulnerability,runescape,Borrowed Power is Buggy,7,7aqjmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7aqjmh/borrowed_power_is_buggy/,2017-11-05 00:11:25,"Theres 3 things thats wrong with the Borrowed Power update: &amp;nbsp; 1. When you have a set spell (I had Vulnerability), and try to use the Borrowed Power spell, it would still use up 3 Astral Runes when I dont even have a target. Charges wont be used, but Runes are used up when I havent even cast anything. 2. If your Magic stats are drained (like from Saradomin Brews), and you try to use the Borrowed Power spell, it would also use up 3 Astral Runes. Again, no charges are used but you waste Runes when nothing has been cast. 3. Before the Borrowed Power change, we were allowed to charge the Amulet when our Magic stats were boosted and then use that Amulet anywhere without continuing to boost your Magic level to 99. This was very useful for PvP Builds, especially in Legacy Pking when you can cast Vulnerability in a Melee set up and still had the freedom to use Vengeance. **Solution:** The player must have 99 Magic to charge the spell, but can cast it with the Magic level of that charged spell. (Example: Can cast the stored Vulnerability spell with its 66 Magic level requirement instead of 99.)"

105,vulnerability,runescape,(Ability Suggestion) Arcane Blast,87,6jek8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/6jek8u/ability_suggestion_arcane_blast/,2017-06-26 00:23:28," - 100% ability damage - Unlocked by finishing livid farm - 15 second cooldown - Basic ability - Magic ability The ability can be charged with various affects such as; - Vulnerability - Blood spells (heal 5% from damage dealt) - Ice spells (freeze opponent for 5 seconds) - Smoke spells - Shadow spells - Entangle - Aurora affects The idea is that, you charge the ability with runes and when you cast the ability IF IT SUCCESSFULLY hits it will grant the affect it is charged with. Example: Charged with vulnerability, cast arcane blast, if it succesfully hits, the npc will have vulnerability on him. If arcane blast is charged with entangle, than the boss/npc will have entangle cast on him and so on... Up for debate - Can you use vulnerability while on ancients? I think to stay with the theme of arcane capacitor, if you have the ability charged with vulnerability but you are currently on ancients, it will just be another ability but it won't cast vulnerability."
106,vulnerability,runescape,On things that need to be fixed: Magescape,55,6li55q,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/6li55q/on_things_that_need_to_be_fixed_magescape/,2017-07-06 10:24:01,"Why does Mage have all the advantages in game, and why is it so OP and versatile? Examples: - Mage has OP Debuffs, Vulnerability, Curse, etc. Range has no equivalent or anything even similar. These provide a significant boost at all bosses at the cost of a few runes. Offensive boost, and there are even defensive variants. - Mage has a dirt cheap Staff of Guthix/Claw of Guthix special, which lowers defence. Range has no equivalent to this, meanwhile Melee's equivalent (Statius Warhammer) is very pricey and degrades. - Mage has several different spellbooks with several different spells for a variety of situations, from standard spells, to stuns, to blood healing, to ice spells, etc. Range - before EoC - had something similar in a variety of different enchanted bolts which people used in PVM (Diamond (e) and Ruby (e)) particularly, but they are not viable anymore. - Mage is the only style for which the T92 2H variant (SoS) is completely superior to the T90 2H weapon (Nox Staff). Zaros Godsword has doesn't have Scythe's 5x5 reach, Seren's Godbow has a range of 7 to Nox's 9. - For Mage, both wands and staves have a range of 8, meanwhile for range, DW and 2h have attack ranges of 7 and 9, respectively. - For Mage, all of its ultimates can be accessed by DW and 2H weapons, meanwhile for Range and Melee, their Ultimates are divided into 2H and DW. - Mage has *two* items that store ammo (multiple ammo) - one of which is purchasable from GE outright for a paltry sum (Large Rune Pouch), meanwhile Range only has the Tiranwyn Quiver - which can only hold one ammo, and is locked behind a Task set. Before EoC, Rangers had bolt pouches which could hold 255 of 4 different bolts, but bolt pouches are outdated, since 255 isn't a lot, and they are lost on death (according to Wiki), so it's useless. Rangers can't even carry 1 2H and 1 DW ammo in their Quiver, meanwhile Magers can carry all their runes or almost all of them into their pouches. Despite Rangers repeatedly asking for multi-ammo storage capability for their Quivers, Mod Daze shot this idea down, and insisted that it may only be done in the far future, and would likely be hidden behind further requirements/task sets/grind. Meanwhile anyone can pick up a Large Rune Pouch for its negligible street price. - The whole auto-attack/ability firing thing with Mage. It can't be done with Melee or Range. - The best money-making boss (Telos) - particularly at high enrage - clearly favours Mage. Mage, it seems, has everything going for it, while Range and Melee do not. I had a good laugh when people on this subreddit were whining a while back asking Jagex to make Guthix Staff augmentable, and to give a +3 prayer bonus to the Rune pouches because the Quiver has one - as if Mage doesn't already have every conceivable advantage. The whole point of EoC was to balance the 3 combat styles and make them equally plausible (those of you who played before EoC will recall Mage was completely inviable back then (it literally spashed at 99% of bosses because they had high mage defense), it was Meleescape, and Rangescape at bosses). Then EoC came and for a long time because of poor balancing, Range was utterly useless and weak DPS, so it was first Drygore/Zerkscape, then Seismicscape. But eventually (2+ years after EoC) Range was buffed and brought back into the fold. Now it seems we have gone back into OP mage territory. Why? Very loose outlines for solutions: - Give Range some sort of cheap special attack debuff weapon like Guthix Staff. Seercull Bow? Or perhaps something else. (As per /u/Slayer0590 Seercull would have to be made ammo-less, so as to not disadvantage rangers who use bows instead of crossbows). - Buff enchanted bolts and make them viable for a variety of situations, just like pre-EoC (and make enchanted arrows as well for non-crossbows). We can have bolts that heal HP (like blood spells), bolts that bind more often (like Ice spells), Bolts that lower target's accuracy/defense, something like Ruby bolts (e) were pre-EoC where both monsters/bosses and the player lose a certain percentage of total HP with the idea being that you take damage to make the monster lose more HP because it has a higher base HP. The possibilities are endless. Make it so you can add gem (diamond/Ruby/emerald, etc.) bolt tips onto ascensions bolts enchant them, instead of falling to the temptation of making lower tier bolts enchantable. This way the enchanted bolts (in addition to their special effect) retain T90 damage, just as Blood barrage and Ice Barrage (in addition to their special effect) retain top tier damage. Also allow us to enchant Arrows as well, just like you can already have Dragon Bane arrows and bolts, so that 2H Range isn't left behind. Shouldn't be too complicated, as the framework for this exists in Bane Ore bolts/arrows. * (There would have to be some way to select/change enchanted bolts during combat, just as mages can cast Vulnerability or specific spells during combat) - Make Tiranwynn Quiver hold multiple ammo - up to 5 - in anticipation of more bolts being useful. If you feel the need to lock this multi-ammo storage capacity behind something else instead of granting it outright, make it a reward for Priff Elite Diary, or make an uncommon tradable drop from Magister which people can buy and attach to their Quivers to gain multi-ammo storage capacity. So Rangers can buy this from other players, just as Mages can buy Large Rune Pouches from GE/other people. And so on. Let's get back towards a more balanced combat system where all 3 styles are equally viable for PVMing. This is not even getting into the problems of Meleescape, that's another post for another day. ~~Obligatory God Shauny signal: /u/Jagexshauny.~~ Edit: added suggestion for enchanted arrows similar to dragon bane arrows as well."

109,vulnerability,runescape,QOL changes to spell book debuffs and universal auto-attack keybind!,2,6nmhng,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/6nmhng/qol_changes_to_spell_book_debuffs_and_universal/,2017-07-17 00:41:23,"I will quickly explain what I want to change and then follow as to why I want to change them. -Make it so all combat styles will be able to use the spellbook debuffs with the accuracy from any weapon. -Add spell debuffs to the global cooldown and give them adrenalin gainz. -Add a keybind for auto-attacks. Why make it so any combat style can use any spell debuff? Well you actually already can. The only problem is you have horrible accuracy for them so they never land. You can also use them without any weapon at all. The main reason for this is to allow other combat styles to shine and not be magicscape. Currently you pretty much use magic and vulnerability everywhere. You start every boss kill with it set to be your first auto-attack. If you are not doing this you need to be because it's very powerful. Why put them on the global cooldown? This is to help with people using on Revo and to remove them from the auto-attack space. It doesn't really make sense why they would even be here because they are not auto-attacks. You should have to go out of your way for these debuffs. As for the adrenalin gainz. I am not really sure on how much you should gain, if any. I fear it could be abused somehow. I know it shouldn't work as a basic in a revo bar though. That would be easy to abuse. If I had to pick a number though I think I would pick 4-7% adrenalin gain. An auto-attack keybind. For those of you that use manual there are some really cool tricks that allow you to get some pretty nice dps boosts if you use them right. I think this is a really nice way allowing those that put in that effort to get rewarded for it. Anyways, that's my two cents. Feel free to tell me how horrible of an idea this is. =D Cheers! "

Working on figuring out a new method. Thx jagex# A few people wanted to know if I had a guide or anything explaining how to AFK Dark Beasts well... so I'm throwing one together. I've taught a few people in game and I know that their XP/GP per hour went way up as a result. The bad thing about this guide... I'm not sure how well any of this works for someone who isn't maxed. I'm currently training my old alt in order to see how a lower level holds up... but you're not going from noob to DB afk overnight. If you have 90 slayer; chances are you're fine. #Pet (all styles):# You absolutely must have a legendary pet to pick up drops. If you can, you also want to use loot area to pick up anything that the pet misses. Leg pet + loot area is almost double what leg pet will do alone. #Equipment# Basically, you want to have the highest non-degradable equipment possible. The only thing I use that degrades is the weapon, which is optional to perk. Caroming makes a huge difference with how much you can AFK. [For the haters](URL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ###Mage (best XP, AFK, and GP gainz): Mage is BY FAR the best option. The AFK is almost as good as Aggression Flasks with the Caromming perk, and you very rarely come close to dying. If you don't notice an Elite spawn, or just left the room irl, then you might die once a month or so. [Screenshot](URL - Boots and gloves have changed * Head: Slayer Helmet * Body: Anima Core Body of Seren * Legs: Anima Core Legs of Seren * Boots: Boots of subjugation * Gloves: Gloves of subjugation * Ring: Luck of the Dwarves &gt; Ring of Fortune * Neck: Demonhorn Necklace * Cape: Completionist &gt; Max &gt; Kiln * Aura: Dedicated Slayer Aura &gt; Vampyrism * Back: Tirannwn Quiver 4 * Pocket: Illuminated Book of Wisdom (don't use the ability) * Weapon: Augmented Noxious Staff * Perks: Caroming 3 + Precise 5 * Other: Charming Imp, Bonecrusher (mandatory), Seedcide. All attached if possible. ###Mage Ability Bar: [Screenshot](URL Other: Onslaught, and Detonate, is helpful for Elite DBs. *Note: My mage/rage bars are controversial because they do not follow the highest possible percentages of the recommended bars on the wiki. These bars have been created in order to maximize afk, not in order to maximize DPS. I'm also skeptical of the percentages of the bars on the wiki as they do not take something like Caroming 3 into account. Yes; it may have a higher percentage pre-invention, but now caroming is hitting an additional 3 targets each time it triggers. In a grouped NPC situation that can add a LOT of DPS. Same goes for Precise 5.* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ###Range (it's ok...): ### Range is ok, but you probably need to pay attention the most of the 3 methods. You might also want to bring Aggression Flasks. If you stand in the correct place (see below) you should be ok. No screenshot. Sold armor after 200m Range. * Head: Slayer Helmet * Body: Anima Core Body of Zamorak * Legs: Anima Core Legs of Zamorak * Boots: Armadyl boots * Gloves: Armadyl Gloves * Ring: Luck of the Dwarves &gt; Ring of Fortune * Neck: Demonhorn Necklace * Cape: Completionist &gt; Max &gt; Kiln * Aura: Vampyrism * Back: Tirannwn Quiver 4 or Bolts/Arrows * Pocket: Dedicated Slayer Aura &gt; Vampyrism * Weapon: Noxious Longbow or Ascensions (I used Ascensions) * Perks: Caroming 3 + Precise 5 (optional) * Other: Charming Imp, Bonecrusher (mandatory), Seedcide, Herbicide. ###Range Ability Bar: ### [Screenshot](URL Other: Onslaught, Snipe, and all thresholds are good for Elite Dbs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ###Melee:### Melee is probably the worst method there is. The Gp/hr and XP/hr drops a lot, plus you're burning up Aggression flasks and Scrimshaws of Vampyrism. With that said; the AFK is good because you're always healing. You should break above even for Gp gainz.

Other: Blood Tendrils are good for Elites. Meteor Strike is good for AOE. #Inventory # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ###Mage:### [Screenshot](URL Must Haves: * Air Runes * Spring Cleaner or Alchs * Helm of Darkness / Mask of Gloom &gt; Attuned Crystal Teleport Seed &gt; Crystal Teleport Seed *2x Siphon if not 200m invention ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ###Range:### Same as mage. No need for air runes. You might want Agression Flasks. Must Haves: * Spring Cleaner or Alchs * Helm of Darkness / Mask of Gloom &gt; Attuned Crystal Teleport Seed &gt; Crystal Teleport Seed *2x Siphon if not 200m invention ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ###Melee: [Screenshot](URL * Scrimshaw of Vampyrism (full) * 8x Aggression Flask (6) * Nature Runes * Fire Runes * Spring Cleaner (although you could alch everything) * Helm of Darkness / Mask of Gloom &gt; Attuned Crystal Teleport Seed &gt; Crystal Teleport Seed *2x Siphon if not 200m invention * Optional: 100 Vis Wax for extending Vampyrism Aura ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ###Optional (all styles): **Large Rune Pouch:** To hold all of your runes. I actually keep Soul, Chaos, and Fire in mine so I can cast Vulnerability on Elites... which splashes 99% of the time. **Enhanced Excalibur:** I almost call this mandatory, but you really only use it when an Elite DB spawns. **Charms:** I use these as a placeholder to keep a tidy inventory. **Magic Notepaper:** Not really needed since RoW nurf, but doesn't hurt. **Spirit Gem Bag:** Do yourself the favor and get one... It will save you from wanting to smash your screen. **Gem Bag:** For Uncut Diamonds, they drop a decent amount. **Slayer Cape:** To hop to Morvran now and then and get a task. I've burned 3k points skipping just to get 1 task... so I wouldn't recommend it. **Oldak Coil:** I had /u/amplebosoms ask me if using a Oldaks coil was worth it... I never really thought it was, but also never tested it assuming that the CB usage would outweigh the gains. I spent a few days testing it to see what the outcome was and was actually very surprised. I realize that I don't have great comparison data (see bottom), but from memory this outcome is above my average. * [Gp Change - 6-8 hours](URL * [Gp Change - Hourly](URL * [Kills and Drops - 6-8 hours](URL * [Kills and Drops - 6-8 hours](URL * [XP - Per metrics](URL Pros: * More kills per hour * More GP per hour * More xp per hour * Things will always be attacking * It makes Elites far less annoying... you can almost ignore them. * No crashers, they don't bother. Cons * More moving around to pick up drops. Legendary pet cannot keep up. * You need to be on top of replacing the coil before the 20 minutes is up. Letting it die sucks and wastes time. * You sometimes take more damage because all things are always attacking. A beast within melee distance, hiding under the cannon, can beat you up a little. * **Cannonballs. You need ~2000/hr.** I'm covering my days bringing 12k without the need to bank. So my final input is; Yes it's worth it, but no you don't need it. If you want xp/kc faster and have the time to mess with picking things up, use it. If you want to be very afk, I would go without as you will likely end up with a decayed 'cannon' and have to make a new one. #How# ###Where to stand: * Mage: [Screenshot](URL * Range: [Screenshot](URL * Melee: Anywhere (you'll be moving everywhere :P ) ###Prayers:### Protect / Deflect from Mage + Turmoil / Anguish / Torment I see a lot of people trying to soulsplit DBs and always tell them to use Deflect from Magic. Your healing is going to be done with Sacrifice and shark drops now and then. If you soulsplit and AFK, you'll Die. ###Finding a world:### This seems silly, but I have a few rules. * DONT CRASH PEOPLE EVER. Karma will get you back later. :) * Try your home world first. If someone is there; ask how many they have left. If it's not a ton, wait it out. This person may take note and not be an asshole later when he sees you camping there. * Leave False Profit and True Profit alone if you run into them at DBs :) I wouldn't ever crash you, please don't do it to me &gt;.&lt; ###Elite are annoying af:### Yes, they are. the best thing you can do is use your Excalibur's special ability, Onslaught, and cross your fingers. You'll want a few sharks in your inventory if you do this because you're going to be at low health. You can also try standing in a corner so your character doesn't run across the map when it roars, then just unload the thresholds. Your call. ###What about crashers :(### It happens... sometimes a lot, sometimes once a week. You have a few options: * Fight them. Always keep Incite on. Bring an Aggression flask if you want. Bring an Oldak coil if you really want to play hardcore. If someone drops a cannon on me... I'll take this option. * Ask nicely insisting that you were there first. Sometimes that works, if they reply with some asshole comment... see option 1. * Start world hopping. This is probably the easiest and wastes the least amount of time. * Go grab something to eat, or go outside. usually a crasher won't leave because they are doing a task. A 300 DB task only takes 20-30 mins tops.... so you can come back when they are about done. * Flash insane KC. I've actually had people say things like ""lol, respekt"" and leave after I flashed KC at them. #The Gainz# I grabbed XP and Pre-RoW Nurf from July 12, 2016... before I was 200m. This was roughly a 9 hour period. [XP Gainz](URL - Farming is from Herb/Seedicide [GP Gainz pre-RoW](URL [GP Post RoW Nurf](URL "

I feel like this can have a very strategic use in PVM, so... My suggestion is to: . **Make Book Switchers usable in combat**, with an appropriate cooldown between each use. . How this would work is: The book retains its original functions, but gains two extra options: Quick-switch and Configure. In the Configure option, you'd choose the left click option, which is between the current ""Switch Book"" and the proposed ""Quick-switch"" option. Additionally, you'd be able to select which Spellbook and/or Prayer book you want to configure as your Quick-switch. The Quick-Switch option is pretty much self explanatory. . Regarding its usefulness, case in point: Example 1: I'm fighting high(ish)-enrage telos on the normal Spellbook, as to use vulnerability for better dps. I want to use ice barrage in P4 and 5 as to make my life easier against golem spawns. I'd use my Book Switcher to immediately gain access to my Ancients Spellbook. or Example 2: I'm basing Yakamaru with my mates. Being the kind soul that I am, I am using intercept on my mates via the Ancient Spellbook throughout the kill. Now, I decide that I want to use entangle during the mirage phase as so to make dealing with jelly spawns near me less of a hassle. I'd then use my trusty Book Switcher to switch to the normal Spellbook. . Balancing: This wouldn't be used in the wild, Teleblock + Ice barrage coming from 1 person seems a little sketch for me, even though there is entangle. A cooldown should be associated with this item if it were to be reworked; this'd be separate from the Magic Skillcape perk. I believe that 15 minutes is a nice balance but idk. . **TL;DR Make Book Switchers useable in combat with a predetermined cooldown between each use** Any sort of discussion is encouraged"
122,vulnerability,runescape,Magic Fixes,0,5ymlx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/5ymlx2/magic_fixes/,2017-03-11 02:20:00,"1) Divide ancient and seren spellbooks. Every spellbook is supposed to have its niche. Normal has manually applied long debuffs. Ancients has short burst debuffs. Seren has short burst buffs. Lunar has manually applied buffs. This isn't the case currently with ancient spellbook having access to every kind of effect, and that's making ancient magic too superior to every other book and combat style. ** ** 2) Make all seren spells scale up fully except Ruby (-2). Currently they're a hodgepodge mess of 86-89 stats which should be fixed if you want players to use them consistently. Set Ruby to scale damage up to tier minus 2, because it gives teammates direct damage buffs with no cap to number of players. ** ** 3) Set stuns (entangle) and debuffs (vulnerability) to use vengeance restrictions. On the ability bar, vengeance has a couple interesting features. It's tied to GCD so you can't spam it. It applies before the ability so you can never fail to cast in manual or revolution (debuffs have this problem). It doesn't cast at all, waste runes, or incur a cooldown if the effect is already active (stuns have this problem). Making the change will improve ease of access for newer players. ** ** 4) Divide Borrowed Power into two necklaces - one off lunar spellbook which gives access to a lunar spell, and one on lunar spellbook which gives access to a non lunar spell. This still gives livid a nice final reward (group vengeance is really under-utilized and barrage+lunar can have its own niche use) without the reward being as one-sided OP as pre-nerf ancient+vuln Borrowed Power. ** ** 5) Seren spell fixes. Make prism of loyalty right click to instantly give various amounts of HP and make it release under 20% HP rather than 75%. Make opal aurora increase nearby emerald and ruby effect durations. Make sapphire aurora increase nearby emerald and ruby stacks up to the cap. ** ** 6) Scale spells by sets of 10, so it's consistent with Melee and Range. Right now in magic, you have spells spread out randomly like levels 3/5/9/13/17/23/29/35, spells [scale up in damage](URL to the next tier, get capped to the tier of the weapon, and some of the spells have their own artificial caps unrelated to the spell unlock levels. It's all madly complicated and redundant. If we set spells to, let's say, 1-strike/10-bolt/20-blast/30-rush/40-burst/50-wave/60-blitz/70-channel/80-barrage/90-storm/92-aurora/99-sunder (dg) and all spellbooks have the spells of those tiers like air/water/smoke/ice/opal/sapphire and lunar spellbook could have ethereal/suqahn/arctic/nightmare, we can get a bit of consistency between the three combat styles while allowing for players to use lower cost/tier spells as needed. This'll also give value back to lunar spellbook which will have basic spells, veng, stat spy (which needs its own rework but that's another story), disruption shield, and the capacitator benefit from above. ** ** 7) Minor magic bug fixes. Stop displaying low tier debuff icon (curse) when high tier debuff is active (vuln). Remove the delay before Weaken, Enfeeble, and Shadow spell effects become active in PvP. "
123,vulnerability,runescape,Pretty nooby questions about storm shards at telos,2,5rz1aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/5rz1aa/pretty_nooby_questions_about_storm_shards_at_telos/,2017-02-04 16:38:04,"Recently getting back into telos and trying to push for higher enrage. As is the problem for most people p5 is the real struggling point, and in line with Evil Lucarios recent video I am going for the fast 0-1 font kills rather than having to bother with minions too much, and was wondering whether storm shards might be useful to increase p5 dps. I'd imagine getting 8 stacks of SS would be fairly easy by p5, at which point Rswiki suggests telos halves the stacks, leaving ~4 going into p5. After doing the normal rotation, you could stack another shard as he charges the insta kill giving 5. My questions are as follows: 1) would the 5th stack be subject to the damage reduction that telos has whilst charging the IK attack? 2) Could you shatter during the IK attack for full damage? 3) would using vulnerability (or affliction?) increase the damage of shatter, even if it was not used when SS was cast . 4) approx what hits would I be seeing from 5 stacks with full/perked t90? 4) Apart from losing overall dps throughout the kill, is there any reason this is a bad idea, or any strategies to make it more viable? Thanks in advance, and apologies for the lack of brevity."

I go into ancients since the main use of this thing is to use vulnerability with ancients and whatnot, and for some reason it tells me I need chaos runes to be able to use it? Did I not charge it with these runes? Second of all, all I needed to do was bring chaos runes in my inventory while my rune pouch held soul runes, among other runes I needed at Telos. It made the necklace work and I could use vulnerability, but the charges don't go down. Sorry if this is normal to any of you but it's really confusing me on how this thing actually works and I hope I can get a better understanding of it. The fact that I still need runes even though it took 1k casts worth of runes from me and the fact that I need the runes on hand but it also doesn't take away the charges on it doesn't seem to make any sense"

There was nothing of this much of an outcry when affinity drain was knocked from 10 to 5 (which *is* a significant amount of hit chance loss), as compared to when they basically cost players a lot of money. I will be basing this around Yakamaru - and only considering affinity drain (as most bosses regenerate stats). Using a typical setup, we can except a hit chance of 70% against Yakamaru at the normal affinity of 55. Affinity: 55 - Hit Chance: 70% Now if we statius hammer, we get Affinity: 60 - Hit Chance: 77.3% What I am suggesting is a revision to the previous 10 affinity drain, for the following - Affinity: 65 - Hit Chance: 83.7% Now, assuming the player has a decent ability rotation, with a DPM output of 150,000 DPM on a target with 100% hit chance, we can apply this to the following values: 150000\*70%=105k DPM 150000\*77.3%=116k DPM 150000\*83.7%=125k DPM Total DPM increase: 20k (a steel titan is 38k DPM increase against a target at 100% hit chance with summoning potions) That's 20k, spread across 10 players. Not really including the base tank, we get 20k*9=180K DPM increase. This is basically an extra 1.6 players in terms of DPS. Mind you, using the *exact* same numbers, vulnerability (which isn't even 1k per cast) increase damage by 10% per minute. Even at 70% hit chance, with our 105k DPM value, we can expect 9*10.5K extra damage per minute, or 94.5K extra DPM. Vulnerability is essentially half as effective - for ~0.001 the cost. Obligatory Mention: Guthix staff (73.4% hit chance)=110k DPM=45K dpm increase FREE Even going as low as dreadnips, if all 10 players use them at once, we get an additional 30k DPM increase. If we combine vulnerability with guthix staff and dreadnips (all negligible in terms of cost), we get a 19K dpm increase per player, or **171 THOUSAND** damage increase **nearly entirely cost-free.** This, of course, only applies to group content. Solo content will have less drastic effects. My proposal: Extend Statius' Warhammer's affinity drain back to 10, but reduce the defence drain to 15%. As for terms of cost, I do not agree with ~2k per spec as it was before, and obviously it is up to jagex to try to balance their game accordingly. However, the weapon before the buff was used almost exclusively for speedkills, or the cost split between teams for a quicker time (not very expensive when split 10 ways). If these changes were made - to allow for broader use &amp; speedkills again, I believe 200 special attacks would definitely be worth the price (given it at least drops off to about 100M per hammer). Remember - Jagex can't make statius warhammer good for casual solo PvM (in terms of cost) without having it become **ridiculously** overpowered in group content."

This only covers Magic and Melee since I've only done those two so far (and I don't plan on ranging in the future b/c magic and melee work). Also Magic and Melee have access to debuffs. Remember that this is a guide for the fastest kill (a.k.a sub 8) possible. You can shift gears into tank armor or shield camp if you're just looking for a loot kill. [Link to video of me doing a melee kill sub 8](URL ----------- **Gear** * Nox &gt; Dual Wield Variants * Power Armor * Power Boots * Dominion Tower Gloves &gt; Power Gloves * Reaper Necklace * Best in slot Cape * Asylum Surgeon &gt; Ring of Death &gt; Sixth-age Circuit &gt; Other variants * Preferably supreme accuracy aura * Charged Illuminated Saradomin God Book &gt; Damage Scrimshaw &gt; Sign of Death/Life *not recommended seeing as how important scrimshaws/god books are* * Shield, Shieldbow, or Defender switch *use melee/magic accordingly* Basically bring the best stuff you can. Tank armor is not needed. Dominion Tower gloves because you can debuff Nomad even further. I was using my supreme runic accuracy aura, and I didn't have an accuracy scrimshaw or a reaper neck when I did my sub 8 kill. However, I was still missing a noticeable amount, so that's why I recommend both the reaper neck + accuracy scrimshaw. Additionally, perks help a lot. You can reddit search for optimal PvM perks and such on your armors and weapons. **Inventory and BoB** * Supreme Overloads * Super Prayer Renewal and Super Restores * Ring of Vigour + Planted Feet Switch (if available) * Enhanced Excalibur &gt; Excalibur variants * Weapon Poison++ * Dreadnips * Replenishment Potion &gt; Adrenaline Potion * At least 5 Sara Brew Flasks * Your shield, shieldbow, or defender switch * The rest is sharks/rocktails * *Optional: Portents of Restoration (highest tier you available)* If using magic, bring guthix staff/vulnerability runes for some dank debuff specs. If using melee, remember to quake and use stat warhammer if you're dice. For your Pack Yak, simply fill it up with sharks or rocktails. The brews in your inventory should suffice. You might be able to get away with no brews at all, but seeing as how you can 1 tick a fish+brew, it's not worth skipping out on brews especially if you just want to grab your sub 8 min kill. Poison from Weapon Poison and Dreadnips do rack up a lot of damage over time, so make sure you have those. [Here is what I did for my sub 8 min kills with a Magic setup](URL **Currently, I do average a faster kill rate with Melee (using scythe), but it is more mechanically harder simply because of the many other things you have to juggle with during the kill. Stick with what works, which is magic.** ----------- **The Fight** Hardmode Nomad is pretty much the same as the one you fought during the Nomad's Elegy quest, except now he deals more damage. You don't need to play as the other characters for this version. Stuff you need to remember: * When a phase is transitioning, you can still get hit by Gielinor's if you killed Nomad when Gielinor launched an attack. So just safe up lul literally no counter to this * Use your Sunshine/Berserk whenever you can. This is crucial to doing max deeps. * Move Nomad whenever you use Bleeds on him to get 2x/3x damage. * Protect Melee all phases * You regain all your health after each phase * Stuns work on Nomad!! * Keep applying Dreadnips! You move around a lot in this fight so it is crucial to keep reapplying Dreadnips on Nomad. * Throughout all phases (minus half of phase 3 I believe), Gielinor in the background will be launching special attacks of his own, so be wary of that. You can look up the Nomad Elegy's fight on RS Wikia to get a better sense of what Gielinor does, as I will not be explaining in too much detail for this guide. **Ability Rotations are very crucial to your DPS!** For both magic and melee, I recommend the optimal revolution bars from RS Wikia if you're not too familiar with full manual. The following steps are instructions for when you do build into your ultimate. * Ring of Vigour + Planted Feet into Sunshine/Berserk. * Drink Adrenaline potion * Build up to 50% Adrenaline * *Magic*: Wild Magic -&gt; Build to 50% -&gt; Asphyxiate -&gt; Build to 50% -&gt; Smoke Tendrils -&gt; Repeat * *Melee*: Quake -&gt; Build to 50% -&gt; Hurricane -&gt; Build to 50% -&gt; Assault (be careful if you get teleported) -&gt; Build to 50% -&gt; Blood Tendrils Lastly, remember to adapt to your situation. You might not always be able to pull off a perfect rotation. ----------- **Phase 1:** You will be getting hit for a lot of typeless damage that you cannot block (1,000 damage~). **Don't use soulsplit**, it causes Nomad to heal for a lot every couple of seconds. The first special used here is **witness the power of Gielinor**. Nomad teleports you to the middle and Gielinor will smash his hand on a location. Simply surge/escape out of this. Protect from Melee will reduce the damage of the hand. There will also be black spots that appear on the ground. Fireballs will travel towards there and hit that area for 2,000 magic damage *that cannot be blocked by devotion*. Simply run out of the black spots. There will also be a ""purple"" attack that Gielinor shoots out. You can lower that damage by turning on Protect from Magic. ----------- **Phase 2:** Nomad gains a new special attack, in addition to the ones he had in Phase 1. This special attack is **face my wrath**. Nomad will teleport you to one of the ends and use this special. This attack can deal 7,500 or 9,000 typeless damage depending on a choice you made during Dishonour Among Thieves. You can use **Resonance** to completely block the attack, or use **Debilitate** to halve the attack. Alternatively, you can run behind a pillar after he teleports you, or use Barricade (or immortality in case you are under 9k or 7.5k hitpoints). However, barricading is not recommended as you waste all of your adrenaline. ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE is to just eat to full HP if you really have no other options. When Nomad teleports you for the **face my wrath** special attack, you have about a 2-3 second window to do some more stuff. You can get about 3 more abilities in before you need to activate your resonance or debilitate. *You could stretch it even further, as the damage dealt from soul blast goes off only when the animation actually hits your character.* Remember that Gielinor's attacks still go on in the background. Simply run out of Gielinor's attacks. ----------- **Phase 3:** In addition to his specials from phase 1 and 2, Nomad gains yet another special! This time, at **half HP**, Nomad will form a clone; there will be a Nomad in the middle of the bridge and a Nomad on the side of the bridge. When the clone is out, Nomad will not use his Phase 1 and 2 specials, but Gielinor will still attack. If you kill the real one, the phase will move on. If you kill the fake, you will also have to kill the real one, wasting a lot of time. **Much of this is RNG.**. ----------- **Phase 4:** On this phase, Nomad does not use any of his specials. Instead, he will **attack rapidly with Melee**. He will constantly turn off your prayer when he says **you are alone in here**, much like Nex. So wait a couple of seconds and turn Protect from Melee back on if that happens. Remember to Devotion/Debilitate if necessary. **It is important to use your bleeds in this phase for optimal DPS because Nomad will ALWAYS melee you. You can walk him very easily here.** Gielinor will continue attacking at this phase as well. ----------- **TL;DR:** * Look at the gear/inventory section * Run from Gielinor attacks * Use Protect Melee for all phases * Pray to RNG Gods for the correct Nomad on Phase 3 * Use Sunshine/Berserk whenever possible. Walk the bleeds. Look at ability rotations section for more info on doing damage. * Resonance or Debilitate the **face my wrath** special. * Eat food"

Oh well, better keep slaying... wait, ""you need to select a spell to cast in your magic book to use magic""?* **Failing to cast ANY spell due to not having runes will cancel your autocast.** Please change it so that trying to cast a **non-combat spell** without runes will not disrupt combat. For the sake of this suggestion I am defining ""combat spell"" as any spell that **does damage** and **can autocast**. For example, Air surge and Ice barrage are combat spells, but High alch, Vulnerability, and Entangle are not. It's not uncommon to forget runes for a debuff, and losing a few seconds trying to turn autocast back on can be pretty damaging in PVM."

But from the pros.. do you use air surge with vulnerability + guthix staff? Or (what im currently using) blood barrage only + guthix staff. Is the 1k per cast more really worth it? I know it helps p4+5 with minions clearing out. But if i cant use vulnerability am i losing out on extra dps?

I have never used the debuffs in the magic book until I bought a nox staff and decided to try them out. I then realized the rune req for Vulnerability is very low and I can cast it without a magic weapon! I tried to use Vulnerability with melee gear while fighting Vindicta but the debuff wouldn't apply. Do I have to be using magic gear to be able to use vulnerability? Can/should I be trying to use it on solo bosses?"

I only used magic because It was my only t90 other than drygores and well I hate melee. So i recently save up for a nox long bow and tested it out at QBD. I use the same gear for both styles arma/subj, slouls, vigour, nox weapon, skill cape everything is the same. I can't help notice that now I'm using range her auto attaches are hitting more often? Like 3 times in a row this didn't happen when I used magic. I though I would be getting hit less with the combat triangle with magic being weaker to range. I also noticed that I splash a lot less with range even using the same tier auras to boost accuracy. I'm still in the testing phase of using range and getting sub par 2:00 kills this is still good but when using magic I get 1:30 kill probs cause I know my rotations and things. Other things to mention When using magic I use vulnerability would this make that much of a diff in speed and healing from ss? Both nox bow and now staff are augmented with crackling dragon slayer and and impatient although my nox staff does also have precise on it. So I'm just asking how can I speed up my range kills and why are her auto attacked hitting more often? I also noticed when using rage she is venerable to magic way more often and vise versa is this just a mechanic?"
140,vulnerability,runescape,Why does my raid team fail? A guide on how fail less at raids,53,4tppn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4tppn7/why_does_my_raid_team_fail_a_guide_on_how_fail/,2016-07-20 15:48:36,"**Why does my raid team fail? A guide on how to fail less at raids** &gt; &gt; *Hi, my name is Harry b0tt3r. I consider myself to be a decent raider with 200+ KC in both bosses and daredevil title. However I fail raids - A LOT! I have decided to share my experiences and shed some light on some situations that you may encounter which could cause your team to fail. It's important to know how to cope in these situations. This may seem like a lot to take in, but if you try one or two things at a time, I'm sure this guide will help!* **VOICE CHAT** &gt; Good communication is very important. Using voice chat makes it easier to co-ordinate stuns and vokes, remind someone if they forgot planks or cpr, calling the location of the poison, letting the team know when the third pet is out etc, making important calls for learners and reassigning roles if someone dies. It is very hard to type while trying to eat, dps, move etc. It's also easy to miss typed calls when you are focused on the fight. To ensure the kill goes as smoothly as possible, get everyone on teamspeak, discord, skype or ventrilo. It's free, and it will make it a lot easier. It doesn't matter if you don't have a mic or are shy to use it. The host will usually make calls, so just listen in. **GEAR** &gt; Yes, you may have done a successful kill using a tortoise, death lotus, vampyrism and a sign of life before, but it's not a good practice. Teams with this loadout are set up to fail. Your gear should be oriented towards dealing damage, not taking damage. This is similar to a 1DEF 99ATT vs 99DEF 1ATT fight. The 99ATT will always win because although the 99DEF can tank a few hits, he won't be able to deal enough damage, while conversely the 99ATT will be able to quickly DPS him down, taking hardly any damage. Offense is the best defence! &gt; &gt; Gear is important. As a DPS, you should barely take any damage during the whole fight. This means there is absolutely no reason to use tank gear. Bringing the best DPS gear you can will speed the kill up a lot, reducing the amount of special attacks and auto attacks you have to deal with, meaning your team will take less damage overall compared to being in tank gear. Although BM regenerates his stats, Dominion tower gloves are still good at Yakamaru and should still be used. **AURA** &gt; &gt; &gt; Vampyrism sucks. Even more so if everyone on the team is using it. Ideally everyone should bring sharpshooter or runic accuracy. If those aren't available, reckless or maniacal can be used at the cost of more damage taken, or dark magic. This makes a huge difference. If you see people on your team with vampyrism or no aura, this is a big red flag. Ask them if they have a DPS aura, and if they don't, consider asking them to join another team. Another sign your team will fail is when people say ""It's just BM"". This shows they don't care and aren't really willing to contribute to the team. **POCKET SLOT** &gt; &gt; As your goal is to DPS as much as possible, a scrimshaw, attackers insignia, blood essence or illuminated god book should be used. Signs of life do not contribute in any way. If you are wearing a sign, you are planning to get wrecked. Portents of life should be used instead. Your pocket slot item should be relied on for more DPS and you should try to mitigate damage taken by positioning yourself correctly instead of relying on a sign of life. **FAMILIAR** &gt; Because you only take a tiny amount of damage being a DPS or pet tank, bringing a beast of burden is completely unnecessary. A DPS familiar such as a nihil or a steel titan is recommended to ensure you deal as much damage as possible, once again speeding up the kill and reducing the amount of special attacks and auto attacks you have to deal with. The steel titan special attack and a couple summoning potions can make a huge difference in DPS. If the whole team uses steel titans, it can be comparable to having a couple extra people on the team. Using a pack yak at Yakamaru is acceptable, but at BM, even if your team makes a lot of mistakes, soul split plus an inventory of rocktails and saradomin brews should be more than enough healing. If the team has a high enough damage output, the base tank won't need to touch a yak, and if the teams damage output is exceptional, a backup base won't be needed. **INVENTORY** Dreadnips are still good. The nerf a while back stopped them from ignoring temporary stun immunity, but they are still good. Bring them. Elite enhanced excalibur will provide an ice asylum effect, healing you over time and buffing your defense without using adrenaline! Guthix staff spec increases your affinity which helps with accuracy. Debuffs such as vulnerability and enfeeble can be used to help the team deal more damage and make BM weaker. These also work on pets. Some people also opt for group vengeance runes, adding a bit more to the overall damage output of the team. A ring of vigour switch can be brought to save adrenaline while using deaths swiftness / sunshine. Saradomin brews heal 6000 hp per inventory slot and don't use adrenaline. They drain your stats, but this can be countered with overload potions and super restore flasks. You should never run out of food with saradomin brews. There should also never be a reason to camp low HP, because you can brew-restore without losing adrenaline. Safe up! **PET TANKS** &gt; &gt; Pet tanks should not be seen as tanks. A pet tank should essentially be a DPS that vokes a pet. Tank gear and beasts of burden should NOT be used. Your goal should be to DPS as hard as you can. The devotion and debilitate abilities should be used, and you should hardly switch to a shield except to use resonance or the occasional defensive if you are getting wrecked. It is possible to flick between protection prayers and soul split and not use a single bit of food. Freedom if you get bitten. Switch to melee prayer if the pet is in your face. It is important to know that Durzags accuracy is increased if the pets are closer, so you should voke your pet into one of the far corners to keep them as far away as possible. This helps the base tank take less damage, allowing him to focus more on DPS. You can check the accuracy underneath Durzags health bar. If your pet is low hp, you can position yourself in a way that you can DPS BM but ensure that the pet is facing away from the DPS pile. Make sure to let your team know when the pets are low HP. **MECHANICS** Not knowing mechanics or incorrectly dealing with mechanics is the number one cause of failure. Here are a few things that have caused kills to fail: &gt; &gt; It's important to know that killing the chargers at the start of BM kill will cause the airuts to spawn at the same time as the first pet. If people are unaware, and stay on the pet instead of stunning and killing the airuts, this can result in fast deaths due to the airut melee special attack. You should try to stay out of melee distance at all times, and if you find yourself being chased, the devotion ability will block 100% of the damage. Prioritize airuts at all times. &gt; &gt; Killing the pets before Durzag reaches 750K HP will result in him getting a damage buff. So don't kill them until 750K unless the base tank is warned and prepared. &gt; &gt; People clearing charger cages should take them south west and kill them with corruption, red chins and a scythe switch for hurricane and quake. You still hit with a scythe using the wrong armour. Pray melee and use devotion so you don't take any damage. Chargers aren't scary. Just AOE them. &gt; &gt; Defuse the bombs. Eat up to full HP and defuse as many as you can. If you run away, one might hit the base tank. This is very bad because bombs cancel defensive abilities which means the base could die in 2 hits. If there are chargers on the base tank, use AOE abilities on BM but don't switch your focus off of him. &gt; &gt; If a pet jumps to you, switch to melee prayer, use freedom, move away and switch prayer accordingly. &gt; **YAKAMARU** &gt; &gt; The poison always spawns around 100K. The closer together your team is, the closer the poison should spawn. &gt; &gt; Ice asylum, heal other and barricade shouldn't be used. It sounds crazy, but you lose so much DPS that you'll probably end up taking more damage due to the fight taking forever! &gt; &gt; Make sure to freedom whenever you get drenched to mitigate damage. &gt; &gt; Bring a shield or dark bow switch. This comes in handy when the jellies spawn. If you click a jelly, run to the black dot, put on your shield and use resonance you will heal yourself and deal 10,000 damage to the jelly. Yakamaru will not attack you if you have tagged the jelly, so you won't have to worry about him sniping your resonance. This means you can also soulsplit the jelly. Jellies can also be stunned! &gt; &gt; DPS the middle pool as hard as possible to go into the next phase except for when you are about to go into sand phase and mirage. Pre-sand and pre-mirage you should kill all the jellies. **TENDRIL** &gt; &gt; Don't tag the tendril pool until the base tank does. If you tag it first and you are standing in the DPS pile, he may tendril the whole team. The tendril always happens 5 attacks after someone turns blue. Make sure to tell the base tank as soon as someone is blue so he's ready to move or barricade. &gt; **SHARK** &gt; &gt; Stand on the safe spot and spam click it when Yaka does the shark special attack. If fo some reason you aren't in the safe spot, don't run into it late because you will bring sharks into the DPS pile. If you're in the safe spot and someone brings a shark to it, click it to kick it away. The poison tank should have barricade ready in case he needs to tank the shark spec at 100K. **SAND** &gt; &gt; You should deal with the jellies before phasing into sand. This is to avoid getting wrecked by jellies when you are sanded. Stay in the DPS pile, close to the sand pool. When you get sanded, spam click the nearest person to you, so you don't waste time once you're free. Many people die because they think they can't eat or stun the jellies when they are sanded. You can. If you are too far out, your team may not be able to reach you in time to free you. The sand special always happens 5 attacks after the jelly spawns. so time your DPS before getting yaka to 100K so you don't get a poison spawn when everyone is sanded. Getting off at around 150K is a good practice. The best time to use sunshine or deaths swiftness is right after everyone is freed. This means there's less of a chance of someone being not being freed due to being hidden in the ulti animation. **STUN** &gt; &gt; Don't stun. You shouldn't have stuns on your action bar anyway because it's bad DPS, with the exception of asphyxiate, but using asphyx on the stun pool is a sure way to kill your whole team. It's important to have the main stun and the backup stun on teamspeak so they don't double stun or waste time waiting for the other to stun. It's best to deal with the jelly before stunning. Onslaught is OP on this pool. If the stun pool isn't the first pool of the fight, its a good idea to have 2 people take the poison on the sand pool so you don't have to get it on the stun pool, allowing your team to do faster DPS. **MIRAGE** &gt; &gt; DPSers should always start on shark. The sand tank should voke the stun pool as well as sand. It's acceptable to have an extra DPS without planks on the stun pool if your team is lacking in deeps. After killing the stun pool, run east around the middle pool so you don't get the sand tank sanded. One person should wrangle jellies around the middle pool or take them all the way south so the DPS don't get wrecked or panic and can focus on getting the mirage pools down. If the base tank gets choked, he can DPS himself out of it but sometimes he might need a hand, so be aware and be ready to free him. **ROLES** &gt; &gt; Knowing more than one role is good because if someone dies, you may need to take their role. Having a shield switch is important in case you need to back up a tanking role. It's entirely possible to tank using DPS gear as long as you have a shield. Barricade and devotion will make you take no damage for 20 seconds. Don't be scared! If the base tank is maging, he should also bring debuffs. ** **LINKS** If you want to know more about the mechanics, check out the wiki below: [Mechanics - Durzag (wiki)](URL [Mechanics - Yakamaru (wiki)](URL Feel free to join the RS Unity clan chat if you have any questions! #stillbad2016"
141,vulnerability,runescape,Seren spell improvements review,50,4ts87g,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4ts87g/seren_spell_improvements_review/,2016-07-21 03:17:13,"**Auroras** [For some odd reason they deal less damage than expected from t88 (opal/sapphire) and t90 (emerald/ruby) damage values.](URL - (image by /u/kakamile) This should be removed as the aurora effects aren't that useful to have such a penalty when zaros spells are generally more useful and have no penalties. **Opal aurora** Damage was increased and cost lowered from 2 to 1 soul rune. Nice to have if you use prisms, as it allows them to last longer and thanks to the rune cost reduction it is generally cheaper than using the prism spell to renew half of their time, especially if you have multiple prisms nearby as it affects all of them. Still think the damage penalty should be removed. The effect is too niche to warrant a -2 level penalty, especially when more useful effects like emerald/ruby and zaros spells have lesser or no penalties at all. **Sapphire aurora** Damage was increased, salvation prism buff was improved and now actually does something to loyalty prism. As with opal aurora, the effect is nice to have if you use prisms, but it is too much of a niche spell to warrant the -2 level penalty. Sapphire provides the following buffs to prisms: - Restoration: Restores 3 special points instead of 1 for next heal effect. Possibly also increases the amount of familiar HP healed, but it is hard to tell since HP bars do not refresh fast enough. Unchanged with this update. The prism is already useful, this spell makes it more useful, so nothing much to say. - Salvation: Lowers teleport cooldown from 10.2 seconds to 6.6 seconds, 3.6 if aurora's caster is using Light Form prayer. Lasts until next use. This is certainly better than its previous useless effect of reducing the cooldown from 10.2 to 9.6. - Loyalty: Increases the prism's healing by 10%. Lasts until next use. Adding more HP to the prism will count as an use and remove the buff but provide no benefit. This should be changed so that it buffs when charging the prism (either by storing more HP or dealing less damage) or simply have it not remove the buff. This buff is pretty good, but until the prism is made useful, it obviously won't have much use. **Emerald aurora** Can stack up to 5% damage reduction. Each stack now lasts 24 seconds instead of 6, making it easy to maintain maximum stacks. Essentially shadow spells in a buff form and longer duration. This has the advantage that it reduces damage from all NPCs attacking you, rather than just your targets. Unlike shadow, it won't affect other players, but you can always have someone else apply shadow/enfeeble debuffs if you want to stack both effects (or even yourself if you switch spells or dual wield both and auto attack) **Ruby aurora** Up to +3% damage to all nearby (5x5 area) players. Smaller boost compared to vulnerability, but worth using as both effects stack. Since it now lasts 24 seconds instead of 6 it is very easy to maintain this buff. Definitely worth using on team fights. **Prism of salvation** Range was increased from 6 to 8 tiles. The position is much less random than before, you typically land on a adjacent square to the prism in line with your direction. Due to the longer distance and higher reliability, i find them particularly useful for Telos phase 5 to quickly allow movement between the fonts and beams. Can also be used to dodge the uppercut, similarly to surge and escape. Also nice to have for mechanics like Vorago's teamsplit and Araxxor's darkness path. A team using a combination of light form, prism of salvation and sapphire aurora would allow very quick movement across large areas thanks to the very short 3.6 cooldown."

They have been disconnecting numerous times per day for unknown reasons and most people have attributed that to Jagex. However, I have made this throw away account to quickly outline what is actually happening to the Australian servers. As a person who is quite knowledgeable in the world of cyber attacks, it was recently discovered by a group of players that the Australian servers have a weakness, allowing them to knock the worlds offline for any period of time which would disrupt many players by allowing them to die to bosses among many other things. This method of attack has been used to gain an advantage in-game by luring players in to risky areas or socially engineering a trust-trade by dropping their items momentarily to potentially gain an arbitrary amount of gold from the scammers/lurers. Quite frankly, it is ridiculous and something needs to be done about it, otherwise the attacks simply will not stop. If any J-mod related figure would like further details on the vulnerability and how it affects each world, please let me know. I am making this post to shine some light on the situation. Do NOT trust anyone on an Australian world with anything that can potentially be detrimental to your account or items.

This stems from a few main reasons: **-Legacy pking just isn't for them** **-Not enough of a payout** **-Constant raggers (people who purposefully annoy others, typically farcasting and using overhead prayers)** The first and third reasons are a bit tricky to work around but the second reason is something that has been fixed many times in the past in RS with something that is now currently used in OSRS. ----------------------------***BOUNTY HUNTER***--------------------------- Bounter hunter has proven successful many times in the past, the adventure of hunting down a target for some nice loot while trying to stay alive yourself has long proven successful. Simply compare W18 populations from BH world times to today (or even compare them to after free trade came out, there was still a sharp decline). REWARDS: Not going to lie, the old EP system was quite broken and didn't have a risk/reward system in place, this is where OSRS's system comes into place. By having constant targets within minutes of each other, players are able to always find a fight and with the current emblem system in place in OSRS; players still get a small added reward onto their normal loot without it being some arbitrary EP generated loot. Now obviously the rewards shop would have to be revamped and balanced for RS3 but this will definitely help bring back a non warbands PvP element to runescape as W18 populations are beginning to hover in the low 100's-sub 100's range. ***PvP Changes:*** These are just my opinions on what could re-balanced alongside an update like this. **Reduce stun/enfeeble/vulnerability to a 5% debuff instead of a 10% debuff for PvP** *This will reduce some of the insanely high hits that goes on primarily in the pure community while still giving an incentive to cast debuffs* **Nerf godbooks/disallow usage in PvP** *This is coming from someone who actually uses godbooks in pvp, they work wonders but the fact that they can be gamechangers instead of small accuracy/damage buffs like scrimshaws really messes up the pacing in some fights* **Increase base damage reduction in PvP** *Increasing the base damage reduction very slightly in PvP regardless of gear/defense will again, very slighty slow down the high hits and allow fights to go on for a bit longer (the increase should be quite small and slightly increase with defense level).* **Disallow the use of emotes that aren't required for any clue scrolls &amp; disallow use of wardrobe in the wilderness** *Just a small thing to stop people trying to interrupt fights, marker plants being un-usable in the wilderness would also be great :)* Anyways, these are just my thoughts and opinions after being pking for quite a few years now.

149,vulnerability,runescape,Some tips on QBD to maximize efficiency,0,3jxkn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/3jxkn4/some_tips_on_qbd_to_maximize_efficiency/,2015-09-07 13:46:46,"So I've been doing a lot of QBD lately and I've seen the guides on Youtube and they are pretty bad. Good for beginners, but not so much for advanced players. Assuming you know all the mechanics, let's start. On first phase, turn on deaths swiftness ASAP as possible. If this is the first kill, build adrenaline on grotworms outside, takes 10 seconds. Basics until you finish the first phase and then click the artefact. Immediately hit rapid-fire, then hit a snap-shot. Hit the second artefact and just move immediately south. Shoot off a rapid-fire and when you're finished, surge to the other side and continue with a snap-shot. Basics until phase is over. On 4th phase, start off with rapid fire and snap-shot. Then focus on ending with 100% adrenaline. Hit the last artefact and go inside the rewards chamber. As soon as you click the rewards chamber, spam anticipate. Then loot and hit freedom. Quick start and hit surge immediately entering the fight. Pot/eat up and immediately hit anticipate as soon as it's off of cool-down. If done right, you will not lose any adrenaline. Then rinse and repeat. -------Tips Always start the phase with thresholds. Because on P4, you don't want to end with a threshold. Start with thresholds and end with basics. Bring full subjugation and a staff. When she switches to mage vulnerability, switch armor and weapons, switch bars, and continue with the kill. Should be done in under 2 ticks. This will really speed up kills. And remember, vulnerabilities persist through phase change for a minutes. Even if she changes colors, she will be vulnerable. I always run through the fire. May not be an issue if you have higher tier armor or are using penance aura (not taking much prayer pots). It's always good form to turn on protect item at the beginning of your trip and just leave it on. Accidents happen. If you do die, just do a port sarim lodestone teleport and run to your grave. Takes 30 seconds. If you dodge most mechanics, first two phases will deal more damage than last two phases. Her ranged attacks hit consistent 1.8ks. On the last phases, she does a lot of bullshit that is easy to dodge. ----------- That's pretty much it. I consistently get 1:50 kills with mh asc's and offhand chaotics and armadyl armor. I use revolution also, so kills are mostly laid back. If there is a demand, I will make a video of some of my kills. "

It casts really slow with nox staff and when it splashes of can be a pain. I won't just be using them at nex, I'd like to get into vorago and rots etc. It will damage the bank but since they're are pretty cheap ATM and I'm making bank from rax (will hopefully complete 4th leg soon)."

155,vulnerability,runescape,A Detailed Guide to Farming the Ragged Abomination,33,3eeihu,http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/3eeihu/a_detailed_guide_to_farming_the_ragged_abomination/,2015-07-24 13:08:00,"Hey there guys, I'm sure most of you felt it was too much of a hassle before to fight the Abomination for mediocre drops, and may still feel the same despite the double-drops added over the past week, but I'm here to tell you that farming this 'boss' is not as bad or as hard as you might think. **Staple Items** First off, let's discuss a few staple items I *highly* recommend, if accessible, to be used on this boss: * **Superior Leviathan Ring** - This ring has a 5% chance to reduce incoming damage by 50%. This is amazing for this boss, as you are constantly taking damage from falling rocks, flames, and by the Abomination himself. I cannot express how much food/restoration items this ring saves alone per kill/trip. It is a staple, if nothing else. * **Saradomin / Zamorak Warpriest** - Although the warpriest sets do a similar damage reduction, where the damage is reduced to 10% - 1% per warpriest piece from any source of damage. I recommend using the helm, cape, and boots for this reason, so that you will have a 3% chance to reduce damage to 7% of its initial value. This also saves many resources per kill/trip. * **Dominion Mines** - Yes, that's right- Dominion Mines do work on the Ragged Abomination! use these at the beginning of your kill to get a free 10,000 hit (per mine) on the Abomination, meaning he'll be at around 45,000 HP at the start of the match instead of 65,000 HP. This saves you a number of seconds and resources over the course of the trip. * **Chaos Runes / Soul Runes** - You'll be using the standard spellbook, and to make full use of the hits you do manage to land on the Abomination, you'll want to use **Vulnerability**, which increases the damage the Abomination will take by 10% for the next minute. Your actual kill time will be around 40 seconds or less, so this is plenty of time and requires only 1 cast per kill. You should have this spell already queued by the start of the match, that way you can instantly fire off Vulnerability + your first on-bar basic ability almost simultaneously. Instantly after your Vulnerability + basic ability land on the Abomination, quickly lay down 2x Dominion Mines and continue to attack the Abomination, regardless of whether or not Vulnerability succeeded or failed. * **Do NOT use Overloads!** - Don't bother with overloads at this boss... trust me, you won't be hitting much more than you would without them. You will get about the same kills per hour without them, and the Dominion Marker can fill the role for free somewhat if you truly desire a stat boost. It's a waste to use Overloads on the boss, for both time and money! -------------------- **Worn Equipment** Now we will discuss the remainder of your worn equipment. Keep in mind your helm, cape, boots, and ring slot are currently occupied by the Zamorak Warpriest Helm, Zamorak Warpriest Cape, Zamorak Warpriest Boots, and Superior Leviathan Ring respectively, so I will cover the remaining slots. It should also be noted that the Abomination will **ALWAYS** hit you, regardless of your armor or its values. As such, the aforementioned staple items are used, and the worn equipment is recommended further based off this boss's unique feature. *My preferred worn items:** URL * **Top/Body** - You'll want to use some power armor, preferably Nex armor (Virtus, since I recommend using Magic), but if you really want to save money, Subjugation is fine, too. * **Bottom/Legs** - The same as the body, in that power armor should be used (Virtus is preferable for niche DPS, but Subjugation is fine to save money). * **Amulet/Necklace** - The Amulet of Souls is the best necklace for this boss. You'll have to pray Protect/Deflect Melee, and the Amulet of Souls will protect an additional 10% (meaning 60% damage reduction from oncoming attacks of the prayer's style). This saves food/resources, though it is, in of itself, an expensive item to purchase and maintain. The degradation is very slow, however, and I have not gone under 50% charges from around 85% after approximately 2,000 Ragged Abomination kills. If you do not have access to this, then the Dragonrider's is the second best choice (for a more powerful Dragonbreath, as well as niche prayer bonus). * **Gloves/Bracelet** - Personally, I prefer the Dominion Gloves for the glove slot. These will make your auto-attacks and basic abilities occasionally more powerful, while also reducing the Abomination's stats. This allows you to hit more often, speeding up kills somewhat. This is, of course, also difficult in that Dominion Gloves degrade to nothing rather quickly in comparison to other glove-slot items. The second glove slot item that is worth noting is the Deathtouch Bracelet. This will reflect a (very tiny) amount of damage you take from the Abomination back to it. Since the Abomination is reflect-damage immune, it will only take 25% of the damage it inflicted to you. This is not a majorly important feature, but the damage value is already high, making this item viable already (outside of its high repair cost). * **Ammo** - Your ammo slot should use either a Wicked Pouch or, more realistically, any of the Quivers for added prayer bonus. * **Pocket** - Your pocket slot is largely up to you. If you have a difficult time getting into the Abomination, perhaps use a Sign of Life/Death initially, but personally, if I am not using Penance, I prefer to use the Holy Wrench. It isn't worth wasting Scrimshaws at this 'boss', thus you will likely choose one of these aforementioned items. * **Aura** - I prefer to use the Penance Aura. This saves you slots and makes the use of prayer potions/restoration methods unnecessary during its duration. Other auras worth noting are the Dark Magic Aura (lots of damage due to the Abomination's high hitpoints), Superior Runic Accuracy, Superior Knock-Out, and the Superior Reverence auras. * **Weapon** - I prefer to use the Noxious Staff for this boss. It may differ for you, but it makes more sense in regards to auto-attack damage and due to Sonic Wave's 10% accuracy buff to a following attack (since this boss has insane defence values). ---------------------- **Ability Bar Set-Up** The ability bar set-up in this section is a result of having to run around while facing this boss, making attacks that you can fire off quickly the most useful, as well as actually landing them. **Image of the Action Bar:** URL * 1 Sonic Wave should be the first on your bar. If Sonic Blast lands, not only will it deal significant damage, but your attack following it will have a 10% accuracy boost. You'll be running around a lot during this fight, and accuracy is something you'll want lots of. * 2 If you do not have Corruption Blast, then Combust will be placed here. Ideally bleeds are your friend against this boss, and the fact he is always moving means Combust will always deal 2x damage. Since you will have to run, and your attacks will not always hit due to the Abomination's massive defence, the bleeds will damage him while you run, as well as when you yourself cannot land a hit. Since Sonic Wave will ideally boost the accuracy of your bleeds, this makes them eve more effective in increasing your DPS. * 3 Dragonbreath is your other DPS ability, one of the most damaging, and thus wins a spot at third on your bar. Since you cannot always sit in place to attack, it will be more likely to fire off if you are relying on revolution than if you were using abilities manually. * 4 Is where Combust will go if you do have Corruption Blast as a secondary bleed, though if you do NOT have this ability, you will place Tuska's Wrath here as another DPS ability. * 5 Is where you will place Sacrifice, as this can sometimes heal you for a small amount (provided you can hit the Abomination with it). You will usually have to use this ability manually, but it helps a little bit and still gives adrenaline. The rest of the bar is as you see in the image, and can be in any order you like. I strongly urge you to **NOT place Freedom in any of the first 9 slots affected by revolution**. Freedom may save your life if the Abomination stuns you while you are stuck under falling rocks and/or are standing in a pit of flames. Freedom is **necessary** for this boss for this same reason. Surge is a nice way to escape from being cornered by rocks and fire, as well as if you are late to respond to the Abomination preparing to slam into the ground to stun you. Be aware that this may trigger the Abomination to stun you and for him to run over you at high speed hitting you twice if you are too far away. Finally, Devotion is also an excellent ability to use against this boss. Since the Abomination only uses melee, Devotion will provide 100% protection against his attacks for 10 seconds. The best time to use this ability is when the Abomination has just slammed into the ground to try to stun you and is crawling back toward your character. During this time it is also ideal to fire off Asphyxiate for some potentially high DPS while taking nearly no damage due to Devotion. By the time Asphyxiate wears off, he will cycle back into using his fire attack, followed by his slamming attack after a few more attacks. Firing off Wild Magic or Deep Impact after Sonic Wave when possible is, of course, also advised. Although Tendrils are on my action bar, try to NOT use this ability when starting out, or at all, really. More rapid damage to yourself can be very harmful when you take rapid hits from melee, fire, and falling rocks throughout the fight. I also advise against using Ultimate Abilities, even Sunshine. Your thresholds will be enough to DPS and finish the Abomination, and you will not often have much time to stand in the Sunshine's affected area, nor keep the Abomination within it too long either. You want to have some adrenaline left at the end of the fight to restore HP using regenerate. ---------------------------- **During the Fight** During the fight you will want to follow these guidelines (roughly) to best DPS the Abomination, while also taking minimal damage. This is without using the safe-spot near the entry point on the water, of course, as this 'safe-spot' is not reliable, and will not bring about the best DPS. You actually want to eat an average of 1 food per fight so that you may pick-up loot (and bank them with your Yak if it is not a stackable item). At the start of the fight you should have Vulnerability queued, so that it will hit and be followed by Sonic Wave. Immediately as these two attacks hit the Abomination, lay down 2x Dominion Mines, and continue to attack the Abomination. If the Abomination spews its flames at you, allow them to hit you, then run 2 spaces to your immediate right or left (of there are not walls or falling rocks there), OR north/south 2 spaces, OR run 3 spaces diagonally in a direction to avoid bring hit for rapid damage by the flames. The Dominion mines will hit for 10,000 damage each, reducing the Abomination to at least 46,000 HP by this time. Now you will likely encounter the Abomination getting ready to slam the floor- **BE CAREFUL**, as this attack can be deceptive. the Abomination will slam the floor, which sends a shock wave covering a few tiles radius from the distance between you and the Abomination. This can be deceptive because he will not always be facing you- if he is facing a direction that is not directly at you, avoid the area in which he is gazing, as the entire distance between his head to that spot (the distance between your previous standing point and his head inclusive) will hit for approximately 1280 damage, and stun you for a few seconds. use Freedom to free yourself quickly should to fail to avoid this! To maximize the damage the Abomination takes, keep the Abomination spread out over as many fire pits and falling rocks as possible. This is usually doable by moving left or right (2 to 3 squares to avoid the hazard), followed by then moving up/down 2 to 3 squares to avoid his slam. By moving in this fashion, he will always be hit by his previous flame pit, as well as his new flame pit *at the very least*. Staying at the edges of the falling rocks and fire pits and moving in this fashion is very easy as long as you keep in mind that a minimum of 3 paces must be run across to avoid the rapid damage of the flames that will hit you, as well as avoiding his stunning slam attack (and falling rocks, should they spawn on you- which they will). Do NOT try to run away from the Abomination more so than is necessary, and do NOT get too far away from him. if you do, he will stun you in place and run over your character, dealing 2 to 3 melee hits. Following the 2 to 3 spaces rule will prevent this from occurring, maximizing damage the Abomination takes, and minimizing damage you take. It is safe to use Asphyxiate or other channeled abilities only directly during/after the Abomination is about to use/has just used his slamming attack that stuns the player (if it connects). This means that you should *always* use Asphyxiate to deal damage while the Abomination finishes its slamming attack, and then tries to crawl back to you. Do NOT move from your spot after dodging, as you WILL be too far, thus triggering his high-speed stun/run-over attack (which can also move him out of hazards, meaning a longer kill and more damage taken). Either use Devotion to reduce damage as he nears you, and/or use Asphyxiate. Using Wild Magic/Deep Impact when possible is safe almost always, as these are not channeled abilities and are quick. ----------------------- **In Conclusion** So long as you follow these guidelines, you'll take far less damage in your fights against the Abomination, and reap his many stackable rewards. Trips can vary from 30 minutes to a whole hour utilizing this method, especially in conjunction to a Pack yak and Spring Cleaner. Profits are about an average of 3.2m an hour to nearly 4m an hour, with about 50 to 65 kills an hour. I hope this helped, for anyone else going for the Abomination Cape! If you have any tips/suggestions for others who may or may not wish to fight this boss and why, feel free to mention them or to amend my post. I'm nearly 2,000 kills and still no cape, but hey, maybe you'll have better luck!"

Just had an encounter with a pretty sophisticated attack. I dont play much rs3, so i clicked the #1 streamer, who was ithersgiuy on twitch. He said he was quitting and done streaming. So I click the link to his forum post, and next thing I know my internet is down for 5 minutes. They got through my authenticator, pin, and all. I'm guessing A LOT of people just got nailed from this thing. So everyone be careful. This was a sophisticated attack with secure certs that got through my noscript and ublock. The link redirects to their own site entirely identical to runescape, but has a small country code of .nz after .com, link also begins with URL and has secure certs. very easy to miss this thing. Be careful fellas. Genuinely curious to see how many accounts got hit by this."
