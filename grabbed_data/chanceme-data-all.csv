1,vulnerability,chanceme,Stanford Chance Me,1,dka3yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/dka3yo/stanford_chance_me/,2019-10-20 08:37:38,"Heya, soooooo Mexican Male (International) from a small mexican town, Gay, Non-Binary, White, Low-Mid income bracket for America. SAT: 1350 (710 RW and 640 M), I know, not good. Also no SAT II GPA: 5 (I go to a very competitive school in Mexico, on a 90% scholarship for merit. All my classes are counted as AP) ECs: MUN: I know u rolling ur eyes already, because it is so common, but my MUN experience is really strong. I've done it since middle school, and worked with an international organization that is known as the pinnacle of MUN in Mexico (probably also in LaTam already or at least very soon). I chaired in the two best MUN in LaTam through scholarships, one for which I gave a Report at the UN HQ ECOSOC, had a joint reunion with the Mexican Ambasador, and Lead Delegates to the Samoa UN mission. Also I'm local VSG, and I'm working to create our best edition by far, inviting the Ambassador of China, and making it a nationwide event. One of my essays is why I love it, and how it inspired me to do change in my other extras. Chinese: I taught myself Chinese for three months, and I got to HSK2+, I am on conversational now. I can talk about simple concepts, and even explain linguistics in Chinese (with the wrong wording obvs) Novel: Basically my own project, it's in three languages and it is supposed to reflect the healing nature of grief. Teacher in China: I taught ESL for two months as a volunteer, working 9 hours 7 days a week. They even gave me a bonus as a teacher because they really like my job! HeForShe: Started my own gender Equality Club, we have over 100+ volunteers and a lot of engagement. We do workshops, events, political inclusion, among others. UNICEF National Teenage Network: I was the VP for a National association of Child activists, did a lot of bureaucracy. We were working with the Mexican Government, NGOs and the actual UNICEF. They are getting a lot of Clout now but I left because the work was insufferable. Global Network of Young Politicians: I am the Human Rights Coordinator for a Statewide group of politicians. We have congress connections, work with other associations, are passing law (I'm drafting and lobbying!), and doing 2030 Agenda Projects. Tutor: I am a peer tutor for basically everything, pretty self explanatory. Social Project: I started a social initiative after of an earthquake that basically destroyed my home town, as a healing workshop for middle school kids that were downtown when the earthquake hit. Awards: Secretariat Scholarship for the New York MUN Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean (NYMUNLAC 2019), giving a Report at the UN ECOSOC Chamber and leading visits to Samoas Permanent Mission to the United Nations. International Winner of a Scholarship to go to Punta Cana and work as Secretariat for the International Conference of The Americas (CILA 2018), Leading Conference in Latin America. International Chosen as a member of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network Youth in Mexico. National Named Human Rights Coordinator for the Morelos Chapter of the Global Network of Young Politicians State First Place Winner of the Scholarship for Academic Excellence Tecnolgico de Monterrey (0.5%). State Essays: There are a ton. My main one is about my mom's mental struggles and my own emotional journey related, very emotional and abstract. Short questions are about some additional passions and activities. The activity one is about my love for MUN and how that impulses me to create actual change. My passion is about language relativity in relation to personal identity and multicultural connection (lowkey shitting on Hopi Time). My care about one is about my bracelets and how they represent my loved ones. And I did an extra outlining how I lost my home during the earthquake, how that forced me to work for my own opportunities, and how that made me reflect on my calling in life, which is to help disadvantaged kids (maybe through my own NGO). In general, I would say my essays are 95/100, they are definitely not typical, and the writing is very much personal and lyrical. I didn't want a basic essay, so I worked very hard to give them energy, emotional impact, and a sincere sense of vulnerability. Many of my friends have told me that they almost cried reading my mom essays, and that they got emotional reading the others. Disadvantages: Poor international, low SAT, not certifiable school difficulty, MUN is my main EC and if my passion and excellence doesn't translate then I lose a huge part of my profile. Hooks: My origin, I would be the first person in my state to reach Stanford, my state and city are very poor and the population is rural. My resilience, I feel like learning from my mother's mental struggles and losing my home to the earthquakes really shows that I am a passionate and emotionally caring person, and that it shows on the essays. I am from three minorities (gender, sexuality, and nationality). My profile is very defined toward Social Sciences and humanities in a school mainly STEM. So, what do you think?"

I'll try to give all the factors I know about myself. **Demographics:** Asian male **School:** Public High School in North Carolina **Major of interest:** Computer Science **Colleges I'm looking into:** * University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign * University of Washington (Seattle) * Georgia Institute of Technology * University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill * University of Wisconsin at Madison * California Institute of Technology &amp;#x200B; * **Academics** * 4.0 Unweighted GPA, about 4.67 Weighted GPA by end of Junior year * Class rank: Top 10 out of about 800 (a fair chance at being Valedictorian once class rank is recalculated at my school in the fall) * 16 AP classes by the end of Senior year (including AP Chem, AP Calculus AB-BC, AP English Language and Composition, AP US History, AP Physics C: Mechanics). I expect to score 5's on most exams. * Dual Enrollment at a local community college where I am taking higher-level math classes. * **Test Scores** * 1560 on SAT (800 in Math), unimpressive essay score * 35 on ACT (36 in Math and Reading), unimpressive essay score * 1500 on PSAT (I suspect I will become National Merit Scholar Semifinalist) * 800 on SAT Chemistry Exam * Planning on taking SAT Math II Exam soon * **Extracurriculars** (I count the years to be including Senior year) * Founder and President of my school's Data Science Club (2 years). Competed in some virtual Hackathons and hosted a competition on Kaggle * Sergeant-at-arms for my school chapter of Technology Student Association (4 years). Won a few state awards, and 1 national award. Part of American Cancer Society committee (fundraising) and Ambassador committee (helping start new TSA chapters at other schools) * Vice President for my school's Cybersecurity Club (2 years). Competed in some competitions like PicoCTF * Secretary of my school's Web Development Club (2 years). Competed in some competitions like Google Code-In. Made some websites for other clubs and organizations * Scouting Directory for my FRC Robotics team (2 years). We also do community STEM outreach and won some awards at regional competitions * Programming Lead for my VEX Robotics team (2 years). We won a regional competition and made it to Semifinals at the state competition * Cross Country team (3 years). Not a top runner, so I was more participating than actually competing * Volunteering (4 years). I'm in Key Club, National Honor Society (tutoring students in chemistry and calculus), and a few community based/cultural volunteering organizations. I can say about 50-75 hours per year * **Recommendations** * I asked my AP Physics and Psychology teachers. Definitely positive, but likely not extraordinary * I also will send in one from my TSA advisor, which should be very good * I just got a new counselor Junior year, so he doesn't know me very well, so mediocre recommendation from them if I need one from a counselor * **Essays** * My writing skills aren't amazing but above average. I have a good feeling about my Common App essay though Please be realistic when giving predictions. I welcome any advice or comments on these schools or even other schools."

I got a buddy on board as a graphic designer to make product images, logos, advertisements, product videos, and more. He also decided to help tackle FB marketing. I gave him 40% of the company.

No profit was made. \- Start of freshman year I created this marketplace/community for people to buy and sell items/accounts in a particular game. Had around 2k members. On top of buying/selling myself, I offered services such as advertisements and middleman services. Both were paid services.

Due to a wildly successful marketing campaign, the store made 6k in sales in less than 3 days, but due to a copyright issue I shut it down. Really sad, but it was the right thing. \- I used this Instagram account to start a new e-commerce business catered to the same audience. I got a buddy on board as a graphic designer to make product images, logos, advertisements, product videos, and FB ads. He took 40% of the company. Though this venture was undertaken with more caution, planning, strategy, and professionalism, we started very slow and only net about $300-$500 total in sales before pulling the plug. No profit was made. \- Start of freshman year I created this marketplace/community for people to buy and sell items/accounts in a particular game. Had around 2k members. On top of buying/selling myself, I offered services such as advertisements and middleman services. Both were paid services. Hired 2 friends to serve as middlemen. \- Most recently I've been involved in stock trading and I spend the majority of my time doing it. Though I've lost a substantial amount of money trying to day-trade, I've learned an immense amount about the monetary markets, economics, the stock market, business, and more. Ever since I've been trading stocks in March I've decided to potentially take on Finance/Econ as a major. **Essays/LORs/Other:** 0 idea about what I am going to write. There were 2 times I had a ""I need to get my shit together"" moments in FBLA, but they seem cliche. A bit early for thinking about LORs, but I'll def get one from my Cybersecurity teacher (she also is the FBLA advisor). **Schools:** UGA Honors, Georgia Tech, possible UCLA/UC Berkeley. Stanford has been my dream school since freshman year and I would LOVE to major in SymSys there but I have to be realistic. Please reverse chance me and help me figure out some schools I should have in mind!"

I'm a rising junior who wants to apply for Carnegie Mellon's early admission program, where you can enter CMU at the end of your junior year. CMU is my dream school and has been for years. I want to study information systems, and CMU's program is the best in the country. **Demographics:** White female from the Midwest. I'm low income (EFC of 0) and I have an incarcerated parent. My background is pretty fuarked, ngl. Lots of alcoholism and abuse. I attend a top 3 boarding school in the nation, one that sends 40% of the class to T25. **Intended Major(s):** Information systems **ACT/SAT/SAT II:** Scoring around 1530 pretty evenly on SAT practice. I took it in 2018 and scored a 1420 (740 RW 680 M). I'm taking Physics and Math 2 in August. **UW/W GPA and Rank:** School doesn't rank. I think my GPA's hovering around a 3.8. **Coursework:** School doesn't offer AP courses, but I'm taking some exams. Last year, I took Psychology and got a 5. Next year I'm taking the Calc AB, Physics 2, Lang, APUSH, CSA, and Macro exams. **Awards:** * Pretty big school award * Top 30 at picoCTF 2019 out of 20,000, top 20 at redpwnCTF 2019 out of like 1000 * Won a business competition out of 100 participants in my city * DECA state finalist * Some GPA awards, dean's list * Trying for USACO Silver haha * Handful of debate awards, nothing too crazy * Robotics team has won quite a few awards * Won a state-wide poetry contest **Extracurriculars:** * Founder of computer hardware club * Research with a professor in VR, submitting to science fair. I'm working on a virtual environment that can be used for anxiety therapy. * Worked 3 jobs throughout high school * Head developer for a decent-size non-profit organization * Moderator and instructor for another NPO * President of a girl STEM club * Debate pod leader * Outreach manager for a tech magazine, website manager for a health magazine, writer for a few other publications * Web dev for a tutoring organization * Ecological representative for my dormitory * \*CMU SAMS 2020 (huge for CMU, apparently lol)\* * FRC team member, programming sub-team * Acted in a handful of school productions, volunteer at my city's kids theatre troupe * Cybersecurity team and coding club at my school **Essays/LORs/Other:** I'm an okay writer, and since I've got a whole bunch of stories to tell from my past, I think my essays should be decent.

I'm a current junior with a 3.5 weighted GPA, as I got a C- in honors English my freshman year due to some family issues. In my sophomore year, my grades improved, however, I still ended with mostly Bs and a few As. That year was also the year I took AP computer science A and got a 4 on the exam. This year, as a junior, my grades improved even more, with mostly As and a few Bs, and my major coursework being AP physics, AP psychology, and Advanced computer science AB (the ap that follows ap comp sci, but was discontinued in 2010 due to lack of interest, my school still teaches it, though). Not sure what my exam scores are yet, but I did well in the classes. Also, I took the sat for the first time (and unexpectedly the only time) cold back in December, and ended up with a 1400.** **I think where I would truly shine in my application is my recommendations (I have a good relationship with my teachers and my counselor), my essays (I'd like to think I'm a pretty good storyteller), and my extracurriculars. I've found I perform really well in self-directed projects, most notably my science fair project from sophomore year, which won me several awards and a few local newspaper articles: an AI that could distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous skin cells.** **When it comes to clubs/activities, I've done MUN for three years, but I never really advanced to any leadership positions, however, this year was my first year in cyber patriot club, and I was elected to be president next year. I did some other activities as well (Colorguard, JV boys lacrosse manager-I'm a girl though, in case that wasn't clear, in-school ap comp sci tutor, etc). I've held a job every summer in high school, and as a rising junior, I was a STEM instructor at a prestigious (aka expensive -\_-) boarding school. During junior year, I was also a paid, private math tutor outside of school. This summer, I had a cybersecurity internship lined up, but with COVID, it got canceled, so I'll probably end up working in retail, however, I'm trying to play to my strengths and work on my own side project creating a videogame, might even try to release it online for free or something.** **Other details: I'm applying out-of-state and not planning on applying for financial aid. I'm a middle eastern girl and the first in my family to go to undergrad (although my dad has a master's degree, he immigrated to the states and never went to undergrad here). I have a couple of older friends who are currently attending CMU for engineering. I don't know if any of this is helpful, but I'm including it just in case haha.** **Anyway, that was a lot of background to ask what my chances are. I'm coming in as class of 2021 (or 2025), and Carnegie Mellon is my dream school. I know their school of computer science is super competitive and it's a big longshot, but if I somehow got in, it would be a dream come true. Any advice would be helpful!**"

Thinking of applying mainly in the US/Canada, but I've also looked at NUS and NTU in Singapore and might apply there because it looks nice and isn't as expensive. I'm probably gonna need some financial aid, so I'm looking at unis which have co-op/internship programs (like these URL URL not just because they'd help pay off the tuition but also because I like coding and would love to get some practical work experience during the course itself. A lot of the canadian universities I checked have co-op programs but I don't know what the equivalent would be in the US. On to the specs: **Academics** Just entered 12th grade in the ISC board, doesn't have any APs or such but the course level is pretty high. Got 97% in 10th grade which was second in the state and highest in my school. Although in 11th grade I ended up with 84%. This is because in 9th and 11th grade the finals are graded internally by the school teachers and the marking is stricter, while for 10th and 12th the exams are graded directly by the board and there's a considerable amount of inflation, so it's normal for kids with 80s % to easily get 90+ in board exams. But I'm worried that the 98% -&gt; 84% might look bad so I don't know if I should explain this in my application somewhere. **SAT** Haven't got a chance to take it yet but I've done some practice tests and I think I can score 1500+ if I prep well enough. Not sure if I should take subject tests. **Awards** Won a pretty popular national level technology/IT quiz last year - prize was around ~2000 USD split between the 2 teammates Got 3rd place in a national level CTF held in a college in another state (kind of like a hackathon but there are small cybersecurity-based challenges you have to complete) Have some first place awards in competitive programming and web design events in an inter-school conference of ~30 schools from around the country. **Extracurriculars** Have an interest in coding and have some small but unimpressive projects on github (one of them is a connection-based note taking app I made to prep for the tech quiz, sort of like relational flash cards). Thinking of adding it in the application as a mini portfolio I guess. Currently coding an official blog for my school from scratch right now (will probably be on github once it's done). Have done a lot of video editing / production work for the school. Stuff like short films to introduce guest speakers, and promotional videos for events like school concerts etc. Was looking to do some programming internships this year but corona happened : ( **Essays/LORs/etc** I haven't really looked much into these for now but I have two teachers in mind who know me well and can write LORs for me and I'm a decent writer so hopefully my essays won't suck. I think I'll apply to 12-15 colleges but as of now I don't know what would be a reach/target/safety for me so need some help figuring that out. I know my ECs and awards are lacking so I'll take part in some more stuff in the following year and try to improve it."

I live with two middle class parents who work in the IT department.

Likely 3 year varsity in both Spring and Winter Track by end of highschool 4)Cybersecurity Club (2 years): worked on community outreach projects where I would teach basic cybersecurity concepts to others. Participating in CyberPatriot this year. 5)STEM for Kids Club (3 years): Co-president with 2 others as we teach elementary and middle school kids within our district fun science and technology activities. 6)FBLA (3 years): *Hopefully* top 2 in state for the cybersecurity competition. Also got 3rd in state for Sports Management. 7)Robotics (4 years): CO-Pres Junior and Senior year.

Acted as youth leader where organize and conduct meetings where I teach the kids how to become better speakers and leaders. 9) Math club (4 years): Secretary junior and senior year and was the team MVP freshman and probably junior year. 10) Spanish Club (4 years): Just for fun and because I only plan to take 3 years of Spanish though most colleges want 4. Community Service: around 120 rn and hopefully 175 hours when I apply. Accumulated from my extracurriculars (STEM for Kids, toastmasters, and Cybersecurity), summer volunteering at physical therapy centers freshman through junior year), Kumon, and probably several other places since Im in NHS now. Essays: Havent written but I think Im a good writer based on writing competitions and grades on English papers throughout high school.

Basically, I applied to a bunch of reach schools, and now im not so sure I'll get into any of them. I have matches and safeties, but, like, it would be nice to get into my reach school (although I do like my match and safety schools). I am majoring in political science. I want to double major (or get a dual degree) in comp sci, but I applied as a poli sci major (except for my safeties, where I applied as a comp sci major). Not that I want to have a cs degree simply as a backup, but I like the idea of working in like cybersecurity or possibly in the government one day. Basically, here are my reach schools: Fordham, Brandeis, NYU, Union, kenyon, bates, bowdoin (ed1), con college, holy cross, GWU I know it's a lot, so I'll give a brief stat thingy: GPA: 3.4 UW (3.8 W) - I will have taken 7 ap's by the end of senior year (my school offers like 11-12 AP's, but has a vhs program that offers more) I have 3 C's. 1 C-, and 2 C+. All in math (well, 2 in math, 1 in chemistry. It was sophomore year and I doubled up in biology and chemistry.) SAT: 1410 (750 R, 660 M) EC's: - Temple volunteer (9th) - school band (9th) kept playing afterwards just for fun. - Building computers. A hobby - learning sanskrit - internship (10th grade) - museum volunteer (12th grade) - model UN (12th grade) - debate (12th grade) - founded school poli sci club. I spend a lot of time doing this. - Political campaign volunteer (12th grade) Circumstances: Just moving a lot honestly. Some things happened sophomore year (unemployment related and so we were kind of stuck and it was kind of rough but I did my best to explain it in a way that didnt seem like I was blaming that for anything). I've moved to 3 different high schools. LOR's should be good. The teachers I asked do like me. I liked my essay, and my teachers liked my essay, so its hopefully above average (idk I can't objectively rank it). I also liked my supplements, but idk I can't objectively rank those either. Can someone help me out? I'm sorry if I'm being annoying, but I (like everyone else) am extremely stressed out and I guess I'd like some condolences before I get rejected and have to end up being a janitor for the rest of my life. I'm also just looking for advice in general as I've been operating my college apps like a chicken with its head cut off, getting my advice from online, a2c, and my school counselor (they're really busy so understandably they can't do too much) Help?"

I was responsible for the formatting of the articles and all I.T. related stuff that was required by the team. * Music Production - 3 years, 7 hours per week. I make music pretty often, I don't want anyone to really hear it as I think it sounds really bad. I love to just sit down and paint my emotion via music as a medium. Mainly electronic, but I'm starting to pick up the electric guitar as well. * Eco Club - 4 years, 5 hours per week. Spearheaded an initiative by implementing recycling in our school. I helped pave the way for a contract with a local recycling facility in our city and we installed recycling bins for different types of materials. We made sure that they were used for their purpose, generally a success that I've seen continued. Also participated in tree-planting initiatives. In my own time, away from school, I took part in marine conservation of dugongs and the stingrays that dot our coast as it is kinda personal for me. * Rugby - 2 years, approx 10 hours per week.

Was a platoon's cadet executive officer during this time on top of academic responsibilities. Seeing myself on the front page of the newspaper at a gas station was kinda surreal though. Essays: * I've got style, I think my essays are a solid 7/10 or maybe even an 8/10. I touch on heritage and culture a lot, but I also tend to focus on academics, albeit I feel that with my IB scores I might be grasping at straws so I struggled with that a little bit. LoRs: * I had a letter of recommendation from my head of senior school, who also happened to be my Economics teacher, as well as a letter of recommendation from my IB physics teacher, great lads and we enjoy each other's company. * Also got a letter of recommendation from a brigadier general, who was my direct commanding officer.

Doctors told my mom I wouldnt be able to retain information. Low expectations meant me getting put in a pre-K for the physically and mentally impaired. I remember being frustrated when none of my questions about the simplistic things we were learning were taken seriously and, before eventually being put in the appropriate class, taught me that you shouldnt wait for you education to be handed to you so think about things for yourself and dont be afraid to pursue things on your own and outside of school.

Dad went to Columbia, first generation and mom went to Wellesley and is very involved in admissions **Intended Major(s):** Government or Economics with a minor in Engineering, hopefully some kind of urban design or planning. I wanted to do data science but it's too computer sciency. **ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 34 on the ACT, all 35 or 36 subscores but English is a 30. (So I should be able to get a 35.) This is without studying, I had just taken a practice test I found online the weekend before and got a 31. 1420 on the SAT, 720 on reading/writing and 700 on mathematics **UW/W GPA and Rank:** We do not have GPA at my school, we have QPA and I have high 80s/low 90s typically. All classes are weighted the same, 5 credits. All of my classes have been above an 85 except chem, which was an 80. **Coursework:** I took AP Calc AB sophomore year and am in AP Calc BC this year as a junior. I am in all honors classes, typical classes and an engineering class each year. I've had Introduction to Design and Modeling, Technology &amp; Design, and will take Advanced Manufacturing and Design and Intro to Programming (Python). Senior year, I believe, is Architecture. All of these are honors. I also have 1 spot for 'electives', this year is Cybersecurity and Patent Law. Last year was Electrical and Civil Engineering. **Awards:** I've gotten some great awards at large regional MUN and YAG conferences (multi state). I don't do much that has significant awards. **Extracurriculars:** I am co vice president of MUN and of Speech and Debate for my entire district. About 50-70 people in each club. I will be co-president of both next year. I am an assistant managing editor in my yearbook, to be one of 3 managing editors under the editor-in-chief. A big thing I think will set me apart is the fact that I am a pilot. I will get my license on my 17th birthday (as soon as I can) and have already soloed. **Essays/LORs/Other:** I'm a junior so I'm not sure how my essays go. I have gone through high school admissions but didn't get into anything. I am working with a college adviser to hopefully have good essays. For Letters of Recommendations, my school has had issues with teacher's contracts for the past three years. It has been settled until June, but a lot of teachers are refusing to do any recommendations. I should be able to get one from my sophomore year calc teacher, which I got a 97+ in his class. I absolutely love him. I also may be able to get a letter from my physics teacher and my lit teacher, but those may not be options. I will also be able to get to know my guidance counselor better starting in January when the college process for the Juniors starts. **Schools:** Ones I'm excited about: Smith College, my number 1 Columbia University, unlikely to get in but I love it Northeastern University, also absolutely in love with it Wellesley College, ED. Very likely to get in. &amp;#x200B; Ones I'm not very excited about but will apply to: Williams College Amherst College Rutgers New Brunswick Honors (The acceptance rate from my school is so high it's basically guaranteed so this is my safety.)

Neither of my parents finished college, nor got even an AA. Income: around 100k 2 brothers, 1 in community college and 1 at a local university. Currently live in Florida. Mid-tier Public school (currently), but I was in a private school centered around accommodating students with numerous disabilities (due to my family) with a full scholarship as a typical peer/peer role model and tutor on account of being a ""typical"" (non-disabled) peer for 5 years (through grade 9) **Major:** Computer Science / Computer Science &amp; Engineering **SAT:** 1550 (800 Math/750 English) \[retaking in October\]/Math L2: (TBD. Expecting 800)/Bio E: (TBD: Expecting 750+) **GPA:** 3.99 UW/4.55ish(?)W. Class rank and immediate weighted GPA at my school is hidden (I know I'm not in top 3, class is around 450 people. **Coursework:** Grade 9: school offered no AP or honors courses, no community college to dual enroll into, so I took full regular classes (the hardest I could). I also skipped Grade 8 here. Grade 10: school essentially picked for me since I moved and registered after school started, many APs were full...still full honors/AP. AP Comp Sci Principles, Environmental Science + 4 honors Grade 11: APUSH, AP Lang, AP Gov, AP Calc BC, AP Seminar + 4 honors Grade 11 (summer after): All Dual Enrollment: Bio 1 \[my only B\], Bio 1 Lab, Microcomputer apps Grade 12 (Semester 2 is predicted course schedule): Full year: AP Comp Sci A, 1 honors course Semester 2: AP Microeconomics Dual Enrollment: Semester 1: Calc 2, Calculus-based physics 1, english Literature, humanities Semester 2: Calc 3, Calculus-based physics 2, public speaking, humanities Many of these classes are online (AP Calc BC, AP Gov, AP Microeconomics, a few of the honors classes, etc) Most of my AP scores are 3s and 4s, I disregarded their importance because 3/4 is all I need to get 3/6 credits from the class to graduate HS with my AA through Dual Enrollment. \^ I will be graduating HS with my Associates in Arts degree completed. I am unsure if I can mark this on apps? **Extracurriculars:** Lead Programmer in FRC robotics team since Grade 10. 4-time regional semi-finalists, 1 time regional champion, competed at world competition. Done a lot of volunteering with them, including helping to organize camps and outreach events for middle schoolers. Internship at a Cybersecurity startup since Grade 11 (summer after). Boy Scouts (Grade 9 only, when I moved I stopped; was life scout) Volunteered at a homeless shelter for 9 months (Grade 9 only). **Essays:** I assume pretty solid. I have a lot to talk about in terms of experience with how much I've moved around. **Schools:** Listed in title: Caltech, MIT, Stanford, all ivies. My ECs are so lacking compared to others on this sub that I've seen for MIT and all these ivies so it has me worrying. Not like I can fix it in the 2 months I have left though. Definitely applying ED to at least MIT"

Right now I am thinking for you guys to chance me for physics at UC Berkeley, CMU, Georgia Tech, UIUC, HYPSM, Cornell, UPenn, Columbia, ... Fair warning, I have been taking the absolute maximum courseload from Freshman year, but that has led to me having some low grades due to family issues and keeping up with the classwork. GPA: 3.5 Weighted, 3.1 UW on a 4.0 scale. SAT: 1590: 800 Math, 790 English SATII: Math II: 800, Physics: 800 ECs: (for next year) Captain of Physics Club, Captain of Computer Team, Co-Captain of Cybersecurity Club Achievements: USAPhO medalist, AIME 4x qualifier, USACO Platinum, ISEF 2018 Grand Award and Special Award Winner in the Physics &amp; Astronomy category, 2017 Siemens National Semifinalists, Published research in largest applied physics journal, presented my research at the biggest Physics Research conference in March 2018, Science Olympiad National Finalist, various National CyberSecurity competition national titles. (Will likely get STS semifinalist, and hopefully finalist next year) Recs: From my physics teacher who I recieved A's in for two years, my foreign language teacher who I've known since Freshman year so I think both will be 8/10 to 10/10 Counselor Rec: 8/10, she was able to understand what I've been going through and has context of what my grades were and how they got to that point. The big problem with my application is purely my grades. Everything else is on par with the most competitive applicants. The reason I have this is due to the the advanced math classes which are taught by one teacher. They assign hours upon hours of homework/classwork that I was not able to keep up with due to my family troubles. I recieved 3 Ds in classes over my time at high school. Chance me for the schools above, and please please let me know how to present myself to colleges in the best way possible.

Major: CS, political science SAT: 1520 Essays: I'm a pretty strong writer, so I think they'll be pretty good. Recs: Quite strong. I am a good student, and the teachers who I have asked know me very well. GPA: My school doesn't calculate my GPA, but I calculated it to be 3.9 (not sure if I did it right). I've gotten straight A's, with the exception of a B in physics this year. My school also doesn't do APs. Our top level is ""advanced,"" and I've always taken advanced classes. EC's: Class president Captain of FRC robotics team (we've been to worlds every year I've been on the team) NHS and highest honors designation at my school Competitive fencer and youth coach at my fencing club (some of the coaching is volunteer and some is paid. I also help out my coach with paperwork, cleaning the gym, etc.) Docent at a local history museum (internship) Counselor at a summer camp for inner-city kids (volunteer position) Legislative intern for a state senator (doing some really cool stuff in this role, it's most likely going to be what I write about for my essays) Varsity math team HiMCM and M3C competitions (made it to the final round of HiMCM, past the second triage round of M3C) Grade, school, regional, and state representative on student advisory council Part-time job for a local clothing start-up (paid position) First place at school, regional, and state science fairs, fourth place at Intel ISEF 2018. (My research was in an intersection of both polisci and cs, the avenues I want to study in college.) Apps for good I want to study both computer science, ideally with a focus on cybersecurity, and political science; I think the biggest weakness of my application is the ""B"" in junior year (I know colleges don't like to see downward trends.)

I noticed that many essays often tell a story about a specific event, or simply about their childhood. I am horrible at writing stories. How can I make my essay stand out? Here in Singapore, as the majority who plans to study overseas are applying to the UK, the mentoring programs are generally geared towards that. 2. Do schools hold places for students who need to go for military service? In Singapore, this is compulsory for 22 months, which means I would enroll in 2021. 3. Is it possible that I study in Singapore and still gain employment in the US? How much harder is that? Thank you very much for reading all these and answering my questions, I really appreciate it."

As I've moved up the rungs of the education ladder, I think computer science has really stood out among other majors as what I want to pursue. Slowly, I've tried to cultivate a list of activities that match my interest in this area. So far, I've really enjoyed working with local startup companies and better understanding programming in general. &gt; What I've struggled with most of all is the lack of personell in my community to help give me guidance through this process. We live in a rural community, meaning I have to travel about 15 miles every day to the nearest high school (which happens to be ranked in the lowest quartile of our state). The opportunities there unfortunately aren't ideal for someone who's really trying to chase after top colleges. We've had multiple student deaths and shootings this year and our dropout rate is above 45%. My guidance counselors, while well-intentioned, are pretty stockpiled with other students and aren't informed on admission into top universities. When taking my first SAT II, they revealed to me that they'd never heard of the exam before. As such, it's been a struggle to connect with people in my community with similar interests in attending a prestigious college. Everyone in my friend group (even though they are genuinely smart students) aren't interested in going further than our state flagship college (CU Boulder). I was hoping to pass it back to the redditors on chanceme to give me some advice about my list of extracurricular and whether it raises any red flags. I'm really hoping to get into a selective CS + Business program such as MET or Jerome Fisher, but would be content with more modest options as well such as Northwestern or Cornell.

I am currently a junior at a very rigorous private school. Due to the academic rigor, I will have achieved a ~3.5+ GPA by the end of my junior year. I believe that schools give GPA boosts based on rigor, but I'm not too sure. I am looking to major in CS with a focus on cyber security and I did 2 CS competitions this year &amp; am planning on doing 3 next year (I did well in them &amp; 1 is focused on cyber security). In terms of service, I do 15 hours of work per year (school requirement), and I will be going on a week-long service trip this summer. I am expecting to get normal recommendation letters, nothing too special. I took the SAT a couple months ago and got an atrocious 1300. Since then, I have been studying a ton and have gotten a tutor to help improve in June. I know my GPA &amp; SAT are under the average for CMU, but I'm hoping that my ECs display me as someone who is really passionate about my major.

Normally, most other students in my school who also take these academy classes will chill in the library until next period instead of going to a class because no academic teacher will allow me to be late every single class. However, I am thinking about taking personal fitness instead of chilling in the library so that I don't have to work out at home and I have more time to work on other stuff at home.) Teacher Recommendations: I haven't technically asked any of my teachers for a recommendation yet since I'm a junior, but I'm planning on getting my computer science teacher and my math teacher to write one. My math teacher loves my hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm. My CS teacher thinks that I'm an extremely passionate student because I already knew how to code before I took the class, go above and beyond (which sometimes pisses him off when I go too far), and help other students during class. Of course, idk what they'll actually write about me, but this is what I'm guessing they'll write about. Stuff I'm planning on doing for the future (not all of which I can put on my resume): - Summer internship at a software engineering company. (I've got connections :) ) - I have a Java coding competition in May - I have an FBLA National competition for cybersecurity in a few weeks that I'm studying for - I'm may try to get a few certifications. I've heard that the FBLA state competition is similar to the Comptia Security+ exam and the Network+ exam, so I might try to also go get those certifications as well. However, I may or may not do this before I apply to college. - I'm going to study some metaspoit over the summer - I'm retaking SAT and Subject SATs - Next year, I'm planning to start a computer science club in my school. (I missed the deadline for making a club in my school this year :( ). - I'm going to take the AP computer science test later this year - I'm going to take the AP US History test later this year - I'm taking the IB Math SL exam this year - I'm taking the IB Psychology SL exam this year - I'm taking the IB Computer Science SL exam this year - I'm taking the IB Business Management SL exam this year - Graduating with an advanced diploma next year Questions: 1.) If I don't have a good shot at getting into these colleges, what other good CS colleges should I be looking at? 2.) What do you think are some good backup colleges for me? 3.) Will me taking personal fitness next year severely impact my chances of getting into a competitive college? I would rather be working out than wasting most my time in study hall, but will not taking on another IB class negatively impact my chances of getting into a competitive college? 4.) I've preformed quite poorly in some subject SATs (which I didn't list here). If the college we're applying to says that it doesn't use score choice, does that apply to subject SATs as well? Or does their policy only apply to the regular SATs? 5.) I know that my test scores and academics could be way better (I honestly prefer screwing around on my computer, something that could help me in life, than to study for a stupid SAT, something that won't help me in life), but can my extracurriculars cancel that out? Or am I completely fucked? Should I consider easier colleges? I really want to go somewhere nice, but idk if I'll make it with my scores."

My unweighted grades in all these classes are in the 90's consistently. Lower 90's for the most part (~92-94) in English and social studies (a little bit higher in social studies, maybe 93-95), high 90's in math and science (math is very high, like 98-100, while science is more like 96-98), and straight 100s in Spanish with the occasional 99. Overall I'd estimate my UW NGA across the whole thing would be a 97. Tests are great too, mostly 5s and some 4s on the AP's, SAT IIs in Chem, Physics, Math II, and Spanish, high 700s on all of them.

I also did a technology club in 9th grade and we helped a lot and I liked it, but it was shut down after that year, and no other opportunities have really come up. I know I should've looked for them (not much to look for) or created them, but I failed in that regard. I think part of it was laziness and part of it was social issues. Other than that I have National Honor Society but I don't know how much of an impact that has. **Schools** I know with my ECs MIT is a big reach, but it is my first choice so I put it up there. GA Tech and Irvine are great CS schools and high matches by my estimates, so I included them too. Also, I should've said this earlier, but I'm out of state (from NY if that means anything) for both schools. I also heard that a lot of the admissions are academics-based, which is obviously good for me. **Questions** I've done lots of research, but does anyone know any other schools that are good for CS and realistic for me in terms of admissions. Emphasis on that last part, I don't want to apply to ten Top 20 schools and get rejected from all of them. "

It's just that there's not much advice for those in my situation, so I want to cover all my bases. It's also why I want to know what you all think about my chances. I'm almost certain that places like MIT, Columbia, and Cornell will reject me, but I'm applying anyway. After all, the only way to have a 0% chance is to not apply at all, right? Besides that, I'm applying to slightly easier schools (GA Tech, CMU, UMich), and schools slightly easier than that (UC Irvine, UIUC, RPI). At the high end I've put in VA Tech and SUNY Stony Brook, my state public university. I'm using those last two as safeties since I'm in state for one of them and the other has a 70% acceptance rate. Tl;dr: applying to a bunch of schools with varying levels of competitiveness, in the hopes that at least one will accept me. You can try to evaluate my chances with as many or as few as you like, or offer up other suggestions. **Questions** I feel like I've talked enough so I'll just conclude by thanking you for whatever help you provide."
