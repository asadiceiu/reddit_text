Which one is a better book? What are your experiences? Those books are very different and seems to contradict each other. Models from Mark Manson is about honesty, vulnerability, connection, self-improvement etc. How to be a 3% man from Corey Wayne is about being mysterious, revealing less about yourself, let a women chase you. It doesn't talk about vulnerability, deep connection, intimacy etc. I don't know which one is better for dating and sexual relationships. I never dated and am new into it. Please let me know."
1,vulnerability,seduction,Expressing vulnerability vs Remaining mysterious,1,id3t41,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/id3t41/expressing_vulnerability_vs_remaining_mysterious/,2020-08-20 14:39:44,"I used to someone who heavily filtered what they said, which led to me feeling tongue tied and honestly just not enjoying conversation very much. A while ago I read a quote from Dr Suess that goes something like 'say what you think and think what you say / those who matter won't mind what you say / those who mind don't matter anyway' I don't think that adage holds true in a workplace, but I started to develop that sort of attitude towards dating. I mean, If you don't feel like you can be yourself around someone, why the fuck would you choose to spend time with them? Well that's basically turned into me over disclosing everything about myself, and I can see how it's probably coming across as being off putting. Anyway where do you guys draw the line between saying whatever is on your mind, expressing vulnerability or personal info, and remaining stoic and mysterious on a date?"
2,vulnerability,seduction,Summary of Models by Mark Mason,1,hnq7i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hnq7i9/summary_of_models_by_mark_mason/,2020-07-09 07:40:14,"Here are my notes after reading the book in one sitting: **Seduction** *is the act of making a woman equally invested in you*. Before sex, men are more invested. This is because women have a biological drive to be picky due to risks: pregnancy, sexual assault, etc. Men have relatively little to lose by sleeping with a partner. Women want sex as much as men, but there are also sociological factors that also come into play. There are two ways to make a woman investment in you: Performance (superficial, pick up artist stuff), the second is by being less invested in her (instead become invested in yourself). Mason believes that the best way to attract women is by becoming a ""**low neediness man**"" (which is an indicator of high status). Such a man is touch with his feelings, has high self-esteem, strong sense of identity, is vulnerable, has self-respect, knows what he values. This is a fundamental aspect of being attractive to women and cannot be faked. You want to put women into **three categories**: **Receptive**, **Neutral**, and **Non-receptive**. Receptive women should be approach and escalated further. Neutral women are testing the waters, and you want to ""polarize"" them into either receptive or non-receptive categories shortly after meeting them. Wait too long and they will move into non-receptive (""friend zone""). Don't invest time into women who have shown they are receptive. Your ultimate goal when meeting women is to Polarize them: make them say ""Fuck Yeah"" or ""Fuck No"". The next part of the book is about what he calls the 3 Fundamentals: Honest Living, Honest Action, and Honest Communication. **Honest Living** is about your lifestyle. Finding what you believe in and creating character. Dont just go with the flow, dont just agree, invest in your own interests / passions / desires. Be polarizing and inhibited. Make opinions known, express them. Know why something is interesting to you. Things you an improve: * Body Language: Make Eye contact, improve your Posture, watch your Vocal Tone when speaking (head vs chest voice), Speed (slow down) nervous needy men speak fast, Speak Loudly and clearly. * Fitness: Exercise &amp; improve your Diet (cut out Sodas, Fast Foods, Desserts, Candy) * Fashion: Find fitting clothing, use matching colors, it should match your personality. * Demographics: Know what type of women you want to attract, focus on that demographic There are two types of men who will fail with women: * Social Anxiety - overthink what others will say, fear of making a move * Social Disconnected - wrong actions at the wrong time. **Honest Actions** \- This section is about overcoming any excuses you might have that prevent you from becoming successful with women. Anxiety is a sign of neediness, it shows you have a high level of investment in her opinion of you. Keep in mind that rejecting people is awkward, uncomfortable, and not fun for women. * Women are rooting for you * Face your Fear, embrace it * Incremental, consistent exposure * Focus on: Approaching, Escalating, and using Bold Actions Avoid Excuses, the most common are: * Blame Game - Don't blame the woman, location, etc when you fail. * 2) Apathy / Avoidance - Don't avoid something just because its painful * 3) Intellectualize - You can read all you want but actually practicing is worth more Fapping / Porn * Cut out all Porn, it decreases motivation to pursue women * Fap once a week (pick a day), but only to women you have met in person and haven't slept with yet. &amp;#x200B; **Honest Communication** \- Learning to express yourself freely and and effectively. How to communicate your true intentions and emotions to others. Men communicate through Facts, Women communicate largely through feelings and emotions. Most men are oblivious to the emotions and intentions that underlie everything women say. Realize that Women have more to lose than you: They can get pregnant, Pregnancy, assaulted, called sluts. Sex is the ultimate act of vulnerability for a woman. *Tension* \- create sexual tension with women. *Flirting* is a sexual expression that makes her feel *secure*. Use *Teasing* which creates tension through uncertainty, what did he really mean. Use *Boldness* which create tension by stating clear intentions, you are attracted to her Creepiness - When approach women, avoid being creepy, but also realize you can't please everyone. SOME women won't be into you, thats ok, accept it and move on. Emotional Self Awareness &amp; Vulnerability * Women like vulnerable men, romance Novels - all follow the same pattern: * Hard &amp; Rugged bad boy is troubled but strong. He is fearless but able to open up, and share his vulnerable side. They create Emotional Connections with women * Women only feel ""slutty"" when sleeping with a man who doesnt care about her, or who hasnt connected with her * Be Vulnerable, and go a level deeper when communicating, Express your Feelings, not facts. Explain why you like something * Use universal emotions such as: ambition, shame, loneliness, achievements, regret, hardship, love, heartbreak. Flirting * Communicate clearly and effectively * First Impressions matter * Intentions, level of anxiety, how you present, communicate, confidence Conversations skills can be improved through the following: * Effective language, use fewer words, quality &gt; quantity * Questions vs statements * Use statements instead of questions, Statements assume rapport, practice cold reading (making an assumption about her based on her appearance). Avoid blanking during conversations. * Statements will make her ask the questions * Use Jumping off points, branch off anything interesting she might share. * Storytelling - always follow a pattern: Setup, Conflict and Resolution * Try to Relate &amp; Connect with women: Open Up. * Share passions / interests, dreams, ambitions, goals, * Share your Best / worst experience * Share Childhood experiences, family stories * Humor can be expressed in difference ways: Misdirection, Exaggeration, Teasing / Sarcasm, Wordplay, Role Playing. **I will post the the second part: The Dating Process in the comments.**"
3,vulnerability,seduction,"""Never Chase a Girl""",1,hop50i,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hop50i/never_chase_a_girl/,2020-07-10 23:41:38,"I sat down with a relationship coach Genie Goodwin to discuss our best tips for chasing women. Follow these tips to get better at meeting women, dating, and relationships. I also made a podcast episode to help you remember these principles fast. (Combining text-based and auditory information helps retention.) Here is the link: URL ## Tip 1: Find a sweet spot between chasing and protecting Testosterone drives men to chase women. They are hunters by nature. So chasing is not a bad thing in it itself. It becomes a problem, though, when a man overdoes it, scaring a woman and making her go into a self-protection mode. And women are easily scared, believe me! Whats the solution? Be a hunter and a protector at the same time. Have a vibe about you showing that you want to protect everyone around you. Heres an example from a Tony Robbins conference where Genie went a few years ago. 1. Tony asked a man to get up on stage and ask the women in the audience out on a date. 98% of the women said, No. 2. Next, Tony whispered something in the mans ear and asked him to do it again. The man said the exact same words but this time, he came from a place of masculinity, strength, and confidence. To that 98% of women responded with Yes. What had Tony told the man? He had told him to come from the vibe of Im hunting but Ill also protect you against anything that might hurt you. So yeah, dont approach this Never chase a woman principle as black or white. Hit a sweet spot between being aggressive (chasing) and gentle (being protective). ## Tip 2: Let yourself be vulnerable Its important to be vulnerable and authentic as a man. If you play games as I did with Anna, you might get lost in them and wont feel any connection to a woman. And your woman will also sense that youre fake. Women are very good at reading you. So the more vulnerable you can be in a relationship, the deeper is the level of intimacy and connection. I know it takes courage to be authentic and open up, though. To be clear: vulnerability doesnt mean youre a loser. It means you feel confident to express your emotions, without worrying what the woman will think about them. Thats what Genie says about opening up: *When my husband hasnt talked to me all day and then wants to have sex, I dont like that. I feel Im being used for my body. Women use conversation to create the emotional intimacy that will lead to sex.* See? If you open up to your woman, youll enjoy a deeper connection and better sex! ## Tip 3: Do this if she doesnt respond Normally, you send a text or call a woman a couple of days after meeting her. If she doesnt respond, wait one day and text something funny and filled with confidence: *You missed out on me yesterday, baby. You and I had a really great connection. And I was really looking forward to it.* The funnier you can make it, the better. Humor takes off the pressure in a relationship. And then dont ask her anything but let her respond instead. Thats how you come from a masculine place. If she still doesnt get back to you, you might want to do it the third time a couple of days or even a week later. *I really enjoy your X. Im really looking forward to Y.* That might her feel special and finally respond to you. ## Tip 4: Dont buy her love with gifts Dont lavish a woman with gifts or free help if shes not attracted to you initially. These things only provide comfort, creating a brother-sister vibe but not passion. See, these things themselves are not a problem at all. But using them as a replacement for your testosterone-driven vibe is. ## Tip 5: Pass your womans tests like a pro Women make things a little bit difficult for men at the beginning of dating. Because shes weaker, shes going to test you to see if your strength will always be there when she needs it. For example, when you two just met, you need to chase a little bit more: Call or text her first Initiate a few first dates Be calm when she cancels a date And to be honest: these tests never stop. They do become less frequent or intense, though, as your woman starts to feel safer around you. One common test later in a relationship is this: She has something on her mind but she just wont tell you. Again, this is when healthy chasing is a good thing. You want to set a timer for three hours and keep asking her: Honey, whats on your mind? Honey, somethings bothering you? Im not going to allow that to happen. Honey, what do you need to get off your chest? And you dont stop until she opens up. And then make sure not to make her feelings wrong. Listen instead of fixing her. ## Tip 6: Feel okay when she doesnt respond When a woman ignores or flakes on you, its easy to get upset. You might have thoughts like these:  Im a loser  Will I ever find someone?  Shes a hottie and Im not good enough for her Focusing on such things makes you feel less masculine and destroys your confidence. When you feel that way, you cant deliver your good to the world as a man. Instead, ask yourself:  Is that thought serving me?  Does it really have anything to do with the woman?  Is it her or me who is in charge of my thoughts? And then create a new focus:  How do I want to respond to this situation?  What do I really want in a woman in general?  What kind of good qualities do I want to display to a woman?  What do I want to receive from her? This will shift you back to the testosterone-fueled mindset. Itll make you unstoppable and pumped to meet another woman. \_\_\_ **TL;DR;** : Everything you need to know about the ""Never chase a girl"" principle. This podcast includes a ton of practical tips and examples."
4,vulnerability,seduction,Who are you backstage?,1,hpy3d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hpy3d3/who_are_you_backstage/,2020-07-13 03:20:49,"I read a post where someone mentioned how important it is to know your own value when dating. And several men asked "" How do I show my value? How do I feel valuable?"" ""How do I become valuable?"" So here's my guidance. When you know your value you don't need to impress anyone. You know you're good enough as you are. The way to show this for a girl, is to show her who you are backstage, the real natural you, beyond acts beyond expectations. That's where vulnerability comes in. Being vulnerable shows your self strength and self awareness. It's a proof of growth. Of someone stable. Share your fears in life, share your childhood memories, share your routines at home, share a time when you really struggled with yourself/ life. For the wrong girls, you put up a show. For the right one. You bring her back stage. So who are you when those curtains closes? Let a girl you vibe good with see who you are. That's how you will show you know your value."

Neediness,7,hra4va,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hra4va/vulnerability_v_neediness/,2020-07-15 07:13:12,"Im getting ready to try and escalate things with a long-time acquaintance/friends, idt im in the friend zone or anything, but weve known each other for a while and Ive more than had my chance to make a move so Im not sure if she sees me in that way bc weve been cordial for so long. Regardless I decided to take a page from the Mark Manson vulnerability playbook and just tell her that I think shes great and want the opportunity to know her better. For some reason though, I feel like this level of emotional honesty without establishing mutual attraction might come off as needy and maybe corny Has anyone else ever felt like this? Do you think it actually helps to honestly tell a woman you think shes gf material before you know shes attracted to you? Whats the difference between vulnerability and neediness? I want to get my honest feelings across without putting her on a pedestal."
6,vulnerability,seduction,I want to smile more at women,1,hsw74u,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hsw74u/i_want_to_smile_more_at_women/,2020-07-18 00:02:01,"There a lot of people that smile to me when I walk past them. Most of the time I found it hard to smile back, especially to women. Smiling to men is less akward for me. There a lot of women that have smiled at me. Sometimes I see that they are interested in me. I found it uncomfortable to smile back and most of the time I looked at them angrily while I was not even angry with them. For me, that was to protect myself. I always had a wall around me to keep people from getting too close. I was also interested in those women myself. When I'm interested in a woman and we look at each other, I don't dare to smile at her, even when she smiles to me. I think it is a fear of vulnerability. The fear that someone will not smile back. Or that they see that I am interested in them. Sometimes I have the insecurity that my smile is not beautiful, that I do not have completely white teeth. While I have heard from some people that they liked my smile. I now want to change and smile more at others. What I do now is force every morning to smile. There was a study that smiling (even forcing one) can trick your brain into happiness (Google it). I noticed in just a few days that it worked for me. Do you recognize this? What worked for you?"

8,vulnerability,seduction,Field Report Going Direct,1,hclu0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hclu0o/field_report_going_direct/,2020-06-20 22:53:58,"So this happened before Covid but I thought this report could be interesting to show progression from a direct open to having sex within a hour and a half. Context: I was completely sober for the approach, it was pretty early in the night (around 11pm or midnight). The girl I liked had long brunette hair, she was a bit tanned and had a big ass, it turned out she had just finished walking the Camino de Santiago in Spain (40 or so days of walking 20-30km daily). I was also with 2 friends that weren't necessarily into approaching girls but were happy to be a part of the fun (the point here is that even if your friends don't approach, you still can) The venue my friends and I were in was an expat/international bar, it had a mix of both standing tables/area as well as sit down tables. On that particular night it was a ""face-painting"" party and I hadn't had mine painted yet, that point is important for later. I was standing in the corner with one of my friends chatting and bullshitting, we were just enjoying ourselves. Low and behold I saw this beautiful lady walking to the washroom across the room. I didn't even know what else to think about in that moment, I was in complete awe. I walked up to her and told her this, ""**Hi, I just saw you walking by and this is totally inappropriate but you have a beautiful ass, I had to come say hi**."" (I said it with such conviction because I believed it, it wasn't some fabricated line but I meant it) She was a bit taken aback but took it right in stride saying thank you. We were bantering a bit back and forth with commonalities about where we were from etc. When exchanging pleasantries, she said that she had just finished walking the camino. I took that as a cue to express my interest in that subject telling her how cool that must have been and we talked about it for a few mins. It allowed me to lead into one more comment about her on the context of saying she had a beautiful ass from all the walking, so I asked what color thong she was wearing. (There was no need for me to do this, I just wanted to know for my own satisfaction.) She played along and made me guess and eventually she showed me by pulling it above her high waisted jeans. I proceeded to tell her I haven't had a drink yet (at this point in the set I figured it was worth it to spend more time getting to know each other) and that I knew another bar down the street that was pretty cool and much quieter than the venue we were in (and more near my hostel I was at.) We had our drink, the vibe was good with a bit of kissing which lead me to telling her to come to my hostel on the pretext of having my face painted for the party aforementioned. At that point we arrived at the hostel to have my face painted in the washroom. She also happened to have a ""painting set"" in her purse which she had told me about at the very beginning when she asked in the first bar why my face wasn't painted. So we got up to the washroom and once inside the washroom we both knew we couldn't keep our hands off of each other. After we did the deed, we had another drink in the hostel common area before going into a private room for a more proper romp in the sheets. Main points are: If you feel attraction to someone you don't know, don't be afraid to show it. We switched between 3 venues in a short amount of time, if you are able to do this, it gives the illusion that you have spent a lot more time/various activities doing something together. The washroom that we used to have sex in could have been at the bar, the 2nd bar or the hostel, just don't think you have to limit yourself to a bedroom, granted the sex may not be as good but once you have had sex, especially spontaneously/erotically like in a washroom, it's going to lead to a callback. Closing points: During the interactions at both bars, we managed to find common interests in places we had lived, the camino de santiago and our passion for the Spanish language. We were able to keep the conversation light, fun, with good eye contact, we both showed vulnerability at times and a mutual attraction for one another. I've said this before in other posts, but as men, always carry gum and condoms with you at all times."
9,vulnerability,seduction,Difference between vulnerability and being feminine?,1,hcy4zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hcy4zn/difference_between_vulnerability_and_being/,2020-06-21 11:30:47,"I know what the title looks like so dont be triggered. There seems to be a lot of conflicting information about how men should approach being vulnerable. Some people say being vulnerable can help strengthen the relationship by showing the SO your sincere feelings, but others say being vulnerable will end up making you look like a nice guy or feminine. Ive heard stories about men who opened up, treating women like princesses while and getting broken up with. Even if they never had nice guy qualities in the first place. Is there a healthy medium on vulnerability? I want to open up to my gf but not in a way that would repel her or make me look less attractive."
10,vulnerability,seduction,"Live with 2 attractive bartenders, here are my thoughts",1,hifa6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hifa6e/live_with_2_attractive_bartenders_here_are_my/,2020-06-30 13:23:25,"Socialization was always hard for me. Crippling self esteem turned to alcoholism  I had a bunch of issues. My saving grace came in the form of 2 beautiful bartenders that needed a room to rent from my house. I was heavily listening to game and puas to try to understand romance and dating. The more I listened, the more I watched these two women deal with the plethora of men after them  the more I saw through smoke and mirrors of professional puas. It fucked me up. Just being around new people coming over all the time taught me how to socialize so much better. It taught me that not all of it is about saying the right things at the right times. Its about finding a connection and working with it. Many players fake it til they make it. I found this to be dishonest with myself. I saw a guy that one of them was very into play her like a fiddle. He was seeing 6 different women at the same time, spinning plates. He was good looking, and charismatic enough to play right into her interests. She eventually caught on and dropped him. He is now known in the area for being a womanizer and no one wants him besides his ex wife that has leverage. She started talking to someone else. Then the next. And the next. The same with the other roommate. Know what these guys all had in common? Probably the one thing that this sub is so against  pursuit. These men made them feel wanted. These are men from all walks of life, rich and poor, good looking and not so good looking. Know the next thing they all had in common? Confidence. And not in the sense of arrogance. They were comfortable with themselves and what they wanted. They wanted them. They knew not to take everything so serious in the beginning. Its all light. They would both get invited to hang out, grab a beer, do this and that. They only accepted those that made them feel comfortable with themselves in the first place. No pick up lines, no creepy ur beautiful  actually tried to get to know them as a person. That realization was huge for me. Taking what Ive seen, I applied that first to myself, practicing talking to people everywhere I go. Once I got comfortable with that, I felt like I could walk up to anyone. One night at the bar, I walked up to a cute girl and said I fixed my hair just to come talk to you she stared wide eyed. I had to come get to know you! Hi Im  she says OH MY GOD really me??. We chit chatted, then slow danced and made out. What the hell happened there? Just complete honesty. I got to a place in my head where I figured we could all die tomorrow. Why they hell not take the shot? Another night, one of the roommates had a very attractive friend over. They were talking and the roomie decided to point out my hair. The friend goes omg hes beautiful. Youre beautiful next thing I know, Im on my bed and shes giving a full body massage, it was great. Another night, I was at a friends dj show, walked to the bar and made some joke to the bartender. The milf next to me laughed. We chatted and I got her number. Another night, my friend introduced me to another milf. Next thing we are making out, shes trying to undo my pants at the bar, we end up goin at it on a friends balcony. Another night, at a party, I walk up to a girl and ask her what flavor of truely she likes. We get on that topic, move on to what we do yaddayadda. This other chick interjects about my occupation  she used to date someone the same. We hit it off and end up accidentally making out in front of the first chick. The next night, Im invited over to the same house with the same people. Me and the first chick got to talking and joking and then we confessed our attraction for one another and slept together that night. This is not to brag. There is a grey area of correlation between all of this. You have to take the risk in the next step if you want something to happen. That was my biggest take away from all of this. You just talk about anything and everything. When it doesnt go well, its not always oh well shes just a woman and she has all these things that go on in her head and Im not acting alpha and I need to say this and that to get her in! I recently had an interaction with a cute girl at a bar that I asked to dance, she was there alone with her cousins. We go to the bar to chat and I could tell she was nervous and anxious. I tried to calm her down, but she was constantly looking around, trying to talk to me, but couldnt really focus. That not some game shes playing, its not even not attracted, she was nervous and had a lot going through her head. Nothing to worry about, and I told her if she wants to go back to her family to feel more comfortable, theres nothing wrong with that. She stayed trying to keep her composure, then walked back to her family. It doesnt always work out. The bullshit about being indirect, beating around a bush with certain lines and this and that, I never found that to work for me. If I was ever wondering about what I was doing with someone or if theyre comfortable with it  heres another thing I think goes so against a lot of pua and game  you just fucking ask. The last chick I was with was a damn model, but I also got to know her. Joke with her. See her views on the world and whats been going on in hers. We found connections and I couldnt keep her off me. As I hugged her good bye I just asked can I kiss you? We made out for a while. I know a guy thats literally 5 ft nothing, works retail, and has a beautiful blonde wife. How? Its not all about looks, for those of you wondering. There are things that naturally attract people to one another and some of those things can be stacked against one another. Whyd she choose him? He made her feel loved without any games. I recently ran into an old friend, very attractive, at a bar. She drunkly confessed how I was so hot, dude like...youre hawt. I told her I never knew she thought that. She replied you never talk! Haha its like you were a brick wall back then. She ended up being with someone at the time so I didnt make any move. I dont wanna be like that. I found theres no secret to chemistry. If its there, its there, its far more important to find things you can both relate to. Thats connection. The vulnerability, and being comfortable with that vulnerability. The humor you can have with others and with yourself. Your world isnt everyone elses, youre just sharing a bit of your world with them. As that progresses, so does a relationship. Does any of this sound far off? I feel as though Im doing something right. It doesnt always work out  but thats the shot I take. To see if something works."

13,vulnerability,seduction,The Last Game Ben Yareem Summary,1,ggshuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ggshuw/the_last_game_ben_yareem_summary/,2020-05-10 11:48:33," I have recently read a book that made a huge impact on my understanding of seduction. The last game by ben Yareem is different and here is a summary for you to understand why. From the beginning, the author challenges the idea of what we consider as success with women. The author all over the book stresses on this theme of coexisting with womens nature instead of using tricks to game women. The introduction discusses the human condition and the struggle for power that we all participate in. in other words, seduction itself is a struggle for emotional power. Ben Yareem also talks about our inner flaws and vulnerabilities and how we can embrace them. ## CHAPTER 1: THE FRAMEWORK (The basis of gender dynamics) The author critiques the PUA approach to seduction comparing it to a sleazy marketing sales page. Stating that while pickup artistry has notable benefits on a mans journey to learn seduction. It is a fading and unfulfilling phase. Seduction is a byproduct of the reproduction instinct. Says Ben Yareem. The author explains why we treat women and men with double standards and how these skewed ingrained beliefs hurt men and women alike. Especially in a modern culture, that encourages and rewards victim mentality. The author proceeds to reveal what search engines reveal about what women truly desire from men. Big data from the search engines have no agenda and dont adhere to political correctness. Numbers dont lie. There is also an emphasis on the theme of pain. The differences in what makes men feel pain in relationships vs womens struggle to bond. In contrast, the author proceeds to describe the perfect male that women adore. The male archetype that women crave and on which every successful novel aimed at women is modeled after. The author also disses Mark Mansons idea of vulnerability saying that it is lacking. It is a zero-sum game and women want you to win it says the author. Monogamous relationships are something of the past and modern technology declared romantic love dead. ## CHAPTER 2: INTRIGUE (I have what you want and I can give you what you need) Intrigue happens when someone meets our unconscious criteria the author explains. Every act of seduction occurs because someone intrigued us. We want to know the secret. Whether the subject of our fascination matches our criteria of the perfect mate. This state puts us in an open place where we will get hurt. The fascinations clouds our judgment and makes us forget that every interaction is a game as ben Yareem states. The chapter focus on how can we notice intrigue when it happens and how can we create it from nothing. The author gives some advice on how to date online but insisting on real interactions as a superior way of creating enchantment. In this chapter, there is also much talk about value. How to elevate it for maximum attractiveness. In addition to another subtle critique to Incels and their ideology. Sexual Marxism as the author labeled it. ## CHAPTER3: PRIZE (My value is higher than yours.) In this chapter, the author shows how to give the right signs to women through a set of subtle signals and techniques such as reframing, exerting the least effort, hypnosis, and the power of assumptions. The author details the anatomy of tests: a test is either a qualifier, a validator or a conundrum, says Yareem. A test is a request for authority and reassurance that the woman unconsciously seeks. The author explains the theory of mind. What makes some pickup lines work and others fail. How to counter womens arguments and win womens hearts. ## CHAPTER4: ADDICT (Intensa Emozione) The author speaks about mind control techniques used by narcissists, psychopaths, and jailers to break someones spirit and use that knowledge to create strong addiction. The things that make a girl suitable to long term relationships, and ways to test her to reveal her true nature. How to manage a date. The author suggests a standard formula: Drinks. 3in1 date. Adventure. ## CHAPTER5: TRAUMATIZE (Falling from Grace) Disclaimer: Personally, I do not agree with this. The author says that after the rise comes the inevitable fall. The author explains the passion trap elaborating that relationships are subject to entropy and chaos. The author tells you to take this inevitable fall to your advantage and exploit it for your own benefit. ## CHAPTER6: THE ANTIDOTE (Protect yourself from your poison) How to protect yourself from love, from breakups, and dating dangers. Marriage too. The author is strongly anti-marriage. The author details the gimmicks women play to domesticate men into compliance, and the reason why women evolved to use them. The sports of women as stated in the book. ## Chapter7: The Way Forward A description of the current state of manhood and how can you as an individual not as a collective, can adapt to change. Very touching stuff and it makes you reflect on many things. The last game is not a great piece of literature. There are better books for that. Many ideas and concepts this book contains will fly over your head until things happen to your life and then you will realize the precious gems this book contains. You will keep returning to it to understand concepts. &amp;#x200B; cheers!"

You cant logically convince someone to like you. Words often mean nothing, and you must evaluate what a persons behaviors and actions sub-communicate. Its not what you say, but what you emotionally convey. **Most interactions lack authenticity** Forming connections with others is only possible through honest communication. People rarely fully communicate their honest selves, instead hiding their true thoughts, beliefs and intentions out of fear of making themselves vulnerable. Vulnerability is not being weak or soft, but rather being strong enough to deal with the consequences of exposing your true self, thoughts or feelings. **Fear of scarcity** A fear of scarcity causes you to work jobs that you hate, marry people that you dont love and remain in terrible relationships. The key to overcoming scarcity is to get on a path that will lead you to abundance via your own initiative. Knowing and truly believing that it is possible to better your circumstances through taking the right actions allows one to overcome the their initial feelings of helplessness. **Attraction is not a choice** You can never predict the outcome of any individual interaction. However, you can develop a great intuition to predict the almost Pavlovian-like type responses that people on average will have to certain stimuli. You learn that attraction is not a conscious choice. Just as one naturally finds a person with certain physical features attractive, the same is true when it comes to the behaviors that a person communicates. An entire chapter of [my book](URL is dedicated to covering these behaviors, such as not bartering for attention, qualifying oneself, forcing a rapport, etc. **Full Video:** [**URL"

Personally I got kinda deep into it after my most recent breakup, I think mainly as a way of trying to cope with it. I've definitely gained some insights from it especially when it came to the idea of spinning plates/having options and not falling into oneitis. I definitely made this mistake in my relationship as I started to look to her as my only source of emotional support and became somewhat possessive for fear of losing her. That all being said it seems the red pill makes a lot of massive generalizations about women and almost brushes off the idea of individual differences and variation within the genders. I also am skeptical about the idea of men needing to be constantly dominant over her and never show her any weakness. In my experience, vulnerability isn't always a turn off or a deal breaker.

With these woman telling them how they should attract a girl. That they should be vulnerable. Or that they should avoid being offensive. That they should stuff down their toxic masculinity. &amp;#x200B; But in this video I tear that down. How feminism gives terrible advice and what you should actually do to be better with girls. Vulnerability- This is not something you should throw around at will and should be kept private. Only revealed for those closest to you. Girls are not attracted to a man who has a sensitive side. They want the polar opposite. Masculine energy draws feminine energy. Period. Being Offensive- If you are moderating your words so as not to step on someones feet its a biological indication that you are worried about how others will perceive you. I.e. low value. Not saying you should hurt others feelings for those that can't read between lines but as long as you do not have ill intent in your words you should be able to say what ever you want when ever you want. Thats sexy. Have your own solid belief system. Don't fall into the trap of falling into feminism. It will only castrate you. Find other forms of medium but in general the movement doesn't care about your love life. Unplug from the victim mentality of the movement. Be man that does not care what other think of you. You don't need to be everyones friend. Don't supplicate. Be you unrestricted. Don't let anyone put you in a sociological straight jacket. If you want to go talk to a girl there is nothing fucking wrong with it. As a man you are allowed to show intent at any given time. However it is the girls right to reject you if she wants but if she does poorly thats on her. Period.
20,vulnerability,seduction,What to say when talking to a woman,1,fn5de9,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/fn5de9/what_to_say_when_talking_to_a_woman/,2020-03-23 06:21:22,"A lot of guys say I dont know what to say when I approach a woman, so I decided to write this article with some tips. The thing women are most attracted to is an adventure, and a fun conversation should be an adventure where you and her are tackling a difficult, interesting, and fun subject, with you in the lead. The value you provide her is your leadership in the conversation, and the value she provides is that she contributes to the fun of the conversation. Your goal, therefore, is to get the conversation to a point where it is fun and interesting before she loses interest and becomes bored. To do this you must hook her with an opener, and then you can hopefully get the conversation to a point where you are talking about deep, fun, interesting stuff as quick as possible. **Openers** A compliment is a great opener because it implies that she has already done something to contribute to your emotional experience. You can say Hey, you look fucking amazing or Hey you look fucking hot or Hey, I love your shoes, backpack, hair, etc or I fucking love your energy and aura. If she reacts with interest, you can follow it up with Whats your name or something like You are hot, but are you nice/cool/etc? If a girl is having a great time and exuding joy and positivity, I will make that the basis of my compliment and say something like You look like you are having the most fun of any person here or Damn, I love how you came to turn the fuck up tonight or Thanks for coming. This party is so much better because of you. I can already hear you dorks squealing you cant tell a girl she looks hot! You will look needy, creepy, etc Wrong. As you will learn, creepiness is when you do more for a woman than she has done for you or than she deserves. If a girl spends a bunch of time doing her hair and makeup before she goes out and you tell her that she looks great, you are doing the right amount for her. If, however, you tell her she looks hot and she brushes you off, and then you hang around staring at her with your tongue out, THEN you look creepy. A simple and effective opener is to introduce yourself. Hi, my name is X. Whats yours? This is good for more formal situations where you cant go around telling girls they look fucking hot. If you are in a party or something where everybody knows each other, you should introduce yourself to every single girl there as a matter of course. You can also keep it simple and go with Hey, how are you? or Whats going on with you? or Hey, whats up? Because these statements have relatively low emotional impact, you need to deliver them with extra intensity. If a woman is mid-conversation with somebody else, you can butt in and say Hey Im really sorry for interrupting, but I just wanted to say you look fucking amazing. If there is a group, you can hand out compliments to the entire group, but you should quickly settle on one woman and make it clear to everybody that she is your target. If you want to get a little spicy, you can try the following: Sorry for interrupting, but you are too hot for this place. If you want to get extra extra spicy, you can say you are too hot for these guys you are with. If the girl is clearly too good for the guys she is with and is clearly unhappy with them, this can work. Otherwise, it is risky. So, whats your deal? (with a sly grin) Congratulations, whats it like to be the hottest girl in this club? If you have a friend with you, a very effective approach is to go up to the girls and introduce them to your friends. For some reason, this technique has been very effective for me, and I am not sure why. It might be because I am immediately giving my friend social proof in front of the women, or maybe it is because my friend does not look needy because he is technically not the one doing the approach. For whatever reason, it works. Many men approach women and immediately lose confidence or their mind goes blank. To prevent yourself from doing this, I suggest at least one follow up line to keep the conversation going. Where were you before this? or What have you been up to tonight? What did you do today? (This one sounds weird but it is actually very effective. Everybody is thinking about what they did that day, and it sounds like something you would hear from somebody you were close with). What brings you here tonight? Have you been here before? Are you having a fun night? How do you guys know each other? (when there are two people) For your second line, you can also use one of your other openers. For example, if you open with hey my name is your second line can be you look fucking hot. If you think those lines are corny and you think you can do better, then fuck off and think of your own. Remember, these scripted lines are back-up plans for when you cannot think of anything else. It is always better to be in the moment. What you say doesnt matter as much as how you say it. **Deep conversation subjects** Ideally, your goal should be to get the conversation as deep as possible as quickly as possible. The purpose is for you and her to go on an adventure and conquer the difficult question. Here are some go-to questions I use, including my answers for these questions. What is the craziest thing you believe? (My answer: I believe in mind reading) Do you believe in ghosts? Aliens? (My answer: I am open to anything being true) What is your favorite conspiracy theory? (My answer: That Paul McCartney died in a car accident in the 60s and the current Paul McCartney is an imposter) What do you think a dream is? (My answer: a dream if your subconscious brain trying to help you solve a problem) If you could be any celebrity, who would you be? What is your idea of a perfect day? (Wake up, get high, go surfing, drink some cappuccino, have a delicious meal, fuck somebody I like) What do you think love is? (My answer: when you commit to doing the best thing for the other person, no matter what the best is) What do you think a true friend is? (My answer: somebody who will be there for you at 3 AM). What superpower would you have if you could have any? (My answer: flying) What would you do if you had all the money in the world (My answer: buy myself an island and help poor people) What are you reading now? (My answer: whatever I am reading at that time). Other good subjects are drug stories, stories about times you did something really stupid, uplifting stories about a time when somebody was a good friend, and stories about a time you were really scared/embarrassed/uplifted/excited. Basically, any strong emotion. Because these subjects are deep, sometimes controversial, and require vulnerability, please make sure you do not say anything rude or judgmental. If you ask somebody what the craziest thing they believe is, and then you make fun of them for it after they do it, they will not open up to you again. Most people refrain from talking about subjects like this for the very reason that they are afraid of being judged. You want her to feel comfortable, open, and vulnerability. You might say these are pretty subjects to bring up to a woman. You are right  you have to find a way to talk about this stuff in a light-hearted, fun way. Take away the stigma and pressure off of these subjects and make her feel like there is no wrong answer and you are both there to have fun, not for anybody to win or make the other person feel bad. The purpose of these questions is to spark a deep, interesting conversation that touches peoples emotions: their desires, their fears, their values, etc **Topics to Stay Away From** Stay away from anything relating to politics or religion if it something that you and her will inevitably disagree on. Also stay away from boring subjects like what is your favorite movie or album? That stuff is actually much less interesting and deep than people think. Stay away from exes. Stay away from subjects that could be interpreted as creepy  if you are interested in famous rapists or serial killers, you may want to keep that to yourself until you guys know each other very well.

It creates an ""us vs. them"" dynamic that makes the other person feel valued and special since they feel like ""wow we both noticed this, we're the normal ones in this crazy world"". It feels like a cheat-code to vulnerability. I've seen versions of it, but I find ""the cube"" and all that other bs pretty useless and corny. I mean more like mentioning something about their body language and how you read somewhere that it means something about their personality and then using that as a segway into social interaction. It allows for smoother kino and deeper conversation, while also not being too risque to where it can be done earlier on in the interaction and not come off as forced. Any tips?"

I know girls are looking for emotional connection so showing some vulnerability is attractive because if demonstrates that youre comfortable talking about it and youre more relatable, but Au contraire I understand that often less is more and being reserved and a bit mysterious can be very alluring. Since the mysterious character just isnt me should I even bother trying to implement some of that into my interactions?

Please dont judge. This is a developing story so if your advise works, ill keep you posted on what happens next if youre interested. Sorry if this is way too long. INTRODUCTION I have posted this in another sub, but turns out most people are too judgemental. I came here for a 3rd opinion and gather a different perspective from other users. About me and my dating history (or lack thereof): Im a 28 year old female who had just gotten out of a 12 year serious long distance relationship (broke it off when I found out he has a live in partner of 24 yrs). My ex is 20 years older.I find that Im more attracted to men who are smart and are much older than me. Ive never really experienced dating before as that was the only relationship Ive ever had. Of course, I was heartbroken as this was the only guy Ive ever really known and am used to my entire life. I live a busy life mostly spending long hours at work and with family. Now that Im newly single (9 months and counting), I wanted to experience what it feels like to date, be outging, meet new people and eventually land into a serious and committed relationship. As I venture into the dating world, I realized that it can be daunting, exhausting and frustrating. I scroll,swipe pictures here and there, read bios and find things interesting about the men, some casual chat messages and a few phone calls which really lead to nothing (didnt meet anyone). I thought that these dating sites/apps dont work for me as most of the guys are not really honest about their intentions. To weed out the men who are just looking to play, I decided to join this dating service where you come to seek arrangement based on what works for both parties. This I thought, could give me a higher chance at landing a more honest man who will be clear about his boundaries, desires and intentions. With the experience I had from previous dating sites, I came to the new one with lower expectations that Ill find anyone interesting. Fast forward to a week, I finally felt like I found a connection. Guy in his mid 40s, divorced with 2 boys (19 &amp; 15) a sr executive in this big company. We corresponded and finally had our first phone call. In his profile hes only looking for fun and something discreet. He was upfront about what he wanted. Hes not looking for a 1 night stand either but he finds that the women hes dated were too clingy and were revolving their lives around him. He didnt like that. He was clear about having his own space and that he would cancel any plans or date if it meant he had to be there for his kids or something important at work came up. The women would be ok with it at first but would resent him for it later on and then leave. He talked about his previous marriage and why it didnt work out. He said that his priorities are his kids and that his ex wife and him had made a pack to be discreet about who they will date to protect them. And that when the kids are mature enough to understand and have finished school, then both will be open about introducing new partners to the them. I completely understood this and I couldnt agree more. I listened to him and asked a few follow up questions. He was also honest about his feelings and vulnerability. That hes a man who has needs and also feels lonely and longs for someone to hold at night etc but right now not looking for anything serious. Now, maybe this is a flaw of mine but him being straightforward about what he wants, his situation and his vulnerability made me feel connected. It felt like it was a challenge. I have this urge to prove Im different from the previous women. I assured him that I get where hes coming from and that Im on the site to look for fun and excitement as well since Im newly single. I also talked about my previous relationship. I had a few naughty convos with him for the first week and 1 steamy hot video call which only happened once. I realized that the guy isnt a big texter and caller and Im the type who would send gmorning/evening texts which he barely responds to. Id start a convo to get him to text me more, he would reply sometimes and would get it going then leaves me hanging and stops responding later on. This gets me frustrated but I keep it cool. THE BUILD UP.. Three months into us talking, we agreed to meet and go over for coffee a week after.The build up was giving me extreme excitement. On the week we were supposed to meet, he stopped responding and texting. I could stil see him online but he doesnt read my messages nor answer my calls. I was worried and kept sending concerned messages. I kept my cool and was cautious about the words I used to not sound frustrated. I asked for closure and expressed that Id appreciate if he could tell me upfront that he didnt want to be bothered me anymore and Ill respect his wished instead of going silent. Still there was no sign of life from him. A week later, he texted and apologized for going ghost. He explained that he went over our convo and felt (assumed) that I was looking for something serious and he didnt want to misrepresent himself to me. He didnt want to be in a situation he cant handle since he has insinuated many times that hes not looking for something serious. He added that hes a very busy person and cant even probably do justice to a platonic relationship. So I tell him, if hes really that busy, how does he have time to pay for a dating membership and be even on the site. He said he joined the site 2 yrs ago but never really pursued anyone coz he didnt find a connection. Hes only accessed it again 2 weeks prior when he was at the airport but doesnt have subscription anymore. I apologized and has said that I didnt mean to make it seem like I was seeking for something more. I assured that I understand his concern. I shared that I thought he had gotten a cold feet since ill be the first woman hell meet from the internet. I kept my cool but at the same time asserted that he should give us a chance to meet over for coffee as theres no harm in having a friendly chat. After this incident, Ive learned to set my boundaries and not seem too clingy. I stopped texting daily but would make sure to check in from time to time. I mirrored the same effort he was putting towards. Two weeks after, I brought up the subject of meeting for coffee again, so we set it up on the eve after work. I felt confident it was bound to happen this time. Evening came and received a text 3 hours before scheduled that he has to cancel because something came up at work and cant leave early. I empathized and offered to wait but he insisted it will be too late if it were to happen as we both had to work the next day. I kept my cool and said it was ok and we can reschedule for next time. My heart sank and was frustrated. I felt like crying as I had arranged for that day to happen. Excitement dropped, any bit of hope left was gone. Just when you thought I had given up, I didnt. The more he acts evasive the more I want him. I dont understand this about myself either, I seem to like guys who are this type. I let it slide this time, waiting for a perfect timing. We still text here and there but not much effort. A month after, December came and I made a bold move to ask to see him again before the end of the year. I expressed in jest that weve been talking for 4 months, that should be long enough to convince him Im not a serial killer. I let him know that Im not the type to easily give up but if the meet doesnt happen this year, I doubt it will ever happen. I assured that I have no expectations and that I just wanted to meet him because I like and find him attractive. Of course I was cautious with how I used my words as I didnt want it to sound like Im giving an ultimatum. At the back of my mind, I was already losing hope and interest. He replied and agreed again to meet for the 3rd time. I was already skeptical but I gave it a shot. I grew more anxious as I anticipate the days leading to our meet up, I wasnt as excited because of the previous incidents. FIRST MEETING.. Judgement day came (Day after xmas). I arrived 30 mins early and texted him of my whereabouts. He came on time. I got in his vehicle and said our greetings and pleasantries. He didnt seem nervous but I can sense a little shyness at first. I wasnt nervous at all, we were in the vehicle for about 30mins as he was driving to our destination (Starbucks). I asked if its ok for him to hold hands as we walked to the coffee shop and he was cool with it. We Went over for coffee and had a fun and serious conversation basically about each others career, romantic and personal life. We got back in the vehicle and was parked for 30 mins waiting for my driver to pick me up. I had this assumption that our first meet would be sexually motivated given we met at that site and had done a few naughty stuff prior but turns out he was actually respectful and behaved. I was wearing a V neck dress (cleavage showing) and stilletoes. He made a comment about my outfit, asked if I was wearing a bra. So I answered yes and grabbed his hand put it under my bra so he could get a feel. I teased and said, see I told you Im wearing one. He played with my breasts without hesitation. I asked if he could suck and bite them, he obliged and suck them gently. He didnt bite coz he was concerned it might hurt me. People were passing by us so he had to stop what he was doing as we run the risk of getting seen from the inside of the vehicle. There was a bit of silence so I asked if its ok to get a kiss, he said yes. I leaned over to kiss him. A smack and a little nibble on his lips. He seemed passive about the kiss, probably wasnt sure what kind of kiss he was getting. You could hear a pin drop from the silence. I did this again and he was still passive , no tonguing though, just me nibbling on his upper and lower lips. For him to return the gesture, I asked if he could kiss me back and he did but was only a kiss on the cheek. I smiled and asked why only a kiss on the cheeks, he replied that there are cameras in the area and where we were parked had a bunch of lights directed towards us (the windshield), people outside could see us.He talked about how he has access to the cameras and can zoom in out, at his job and could hear peoples conversation if he wanted to but would never dare do it if it didnt require for his job to do so. It was getting late so both of us were tired, we held each others hands. As the clock ticks, he made a bold move to put his hand under my dress and started to carress my thighs.I was getting wet, a bit conscious and shy at this point...when my driver arrived (thank god) lol. I had to leave and we kissed each other goodbye with a promise to see each other again after the holidays. An hour later, we update each other of our whereabouts, he said he had a great time and looks forward to the next meet (he doesnt call it a date but a meet) with a blushing emoji. That evening, I didnt realize that I had forgotten a gift I had bought for my boss, in his backseat. He promised to give it once we meet again. THE AFTERMATH + SECOND MEETING.... Having met him, I expected that maybe this time he would text or reply/communicate more. I guess there was change but only at a bare minimum. January came we both were busy with our careers. I kept my distance and would only return the effort hes giving. 2 weeks before Feb I expressed my interest in seeing him for the 2nd time, probably by Feb 13 or 14 + I needed to get the item I had forgotten in his vehicle so I can gift it to my boss. He gave assurance that hell take note of it but 14th maybe a no as its a valentine day where people are out and about causing traffic on the road. I pretended that I was oblivious to the fact that 14th was a Vday. I looked forward and waited patiently. That week came, we agreed to meet on the 13th. I planned out my schedule and made sure to look damn good even though I was a little anxious. 2 hours before scheduled I notify that Im leaving work in a few to our rendezvous. 10 mins later I get a text that he has to cancel as he cant leave work early due to an urgent matter he has to address. Its hard for me to believe this now as its becoming a theme already. I was extremely upset and frustrated but I replied with understanding and assured that I can wait and will be at the rendezvous on time. He insisted he cant make it and has an early meeting the next day. I expressed a little disappointment by saying he couldve told me at a much earlier time so I didnt have to leave work early, I cant go back since Im already on the road. I politely insisted that he doesnt have to stay long and just hand me the item so I can give it to my boss. He apologized and said that hes not the type of person who just cancels unless its a valid reason. He offered to have the item shipped the next day if it was really that urgent. I went quiet for 5mins thinking of a good reply. I responded that the item is indeed important but I also wanted to see him. He replied and offered to swing by the next day (evening) Feb 14 for a few minutes. I didnt respond and got to the rendezvous and notified him. He replied and said he cant make it. I assured that I understand and that I just felt the need to let him know and I was going to leave after I pee, with or without him. That night was horrible I felt like I was yet again rejected and dismissed. So I went on another date with a friend instead. Yes Im not putting all my eggs in one basket. The next day, I let him know that I needed him to confirm by 6pm if the meeting is on or not. So I let him know Im already at the meeting place and hes on the way. I didnt know what was bound to happen that night since we didnt have anything planned. While I was waiting he texted and asked politely if its ok to get him a drink at SB since I was already there waiting and that hell pay me in the car, hes too tired to go outside. I gracefully said its fine and he didnt need to pay me since he paid for the drinks last time. He arrived, told me where he was parked so I went. I was a little anxious but kept my cool. Got in his car, smiled, handed him the drink and he said thank you. He handed me the item I had left in his car and I apologized for the inconvenience and thanked him for still seeing me despite his busy schedule. He may have sensed that I was upset from last night which is why he kept his distance and there was little silence for a while as we sip our own drinks. I jested and asked why I didnt get a kiss, he gave me the same reply last time, lights directed towards us and didnt want people passing by to suspect that we were doing something. I let him know that I understand then asked how much longer he can stay, said he has 30 minutes. I didnt want to bring up what happened the night before so I just looked at him and gave assurance that I wasnt mad and that Im happy he made it tonight (Friday).(He picks up the kids every Friday to stay with him during the weekends. So him making time for me on a Friday is a big deal to me since I knew the weekend is dedicated to the kids). He replied with, oh yeah Thanks. We talked for a few more minutes as we finish our drink. I told him about the problem I had at work which almost cost me to lose my job and I almost didnt know what to do. He asked what happened so I told him. He commented that I couldve come to him sooner so he couldve helped me out with how to work around it as hes been running companies for yrs and yrs and knew the due process etc. In this meeting, there was no petting or anything, I didnt ask to hold hands, I didnt attempt to seduce or do anything since he already set the tone when I arrived (not giving me a kiss coz hes concerned people could see us from the outside). I let out a cute sigh and mumbled that maybe there wont be a 3rd meeting, he reacted and made a promise that well see each other again when he gets back from out of the country for a week. Its just that hes busy right now due to a lot of movements at work (higher boss will retire end of Feb and hes next in line to take the post). Hearing this from him gave me a little hope that there will be a 3rd meeting. Time was up and we had to go. Thanked him for the time and asked for a kiss. He obliged and had his lips pouted ready to kiss me. It was a quick smack, then I went for another one..then off we left. We both update each other as soon as we arrive home and said our goodnight. OBSERVATIONS From what Ive observed, hes careful with his words, weve had conversations but Ive never heard him say the words ""love, date, fell in love, i miss etc"". First week we started talking, he only asked about how Im doing 2x. Up to present, I mostly am the first one to text and ask how hes doing but like I said, I stopped over texting and only check in from time to time (maybe 2 to 3 txt per week). Hes only addressed me by my name 2x and this was in text when we first started talking. But to be fair, we havent disclosed each others complete name..yet, we only go by our nickname. Hes not complimented me yet. Id like to think that he doesnt do so coz he didnt want me to misinterpret his compliments since he is not into something serious. He has shared pics of his kids though. I dont know where he works nor does he know mine. I tried to ask his position at his job but wont share so I didnt insist coz Im tryjng to respect his boundary. So yeah theres mystery in all this. Id like to think he really is who he says he is (divorced and not cheating on his wife). I have asked if he has a live in partner and he strongly replied with no, if he did he wouldnt be out on a Vday. No other observations or red xflag other than when he cancels our meet up. THE PLAN: HOW DO I KEEP HIM INTERESTED? I appreciate if you got to this part of my post. Please dont judge me. Im not looking to rush into things with him. I know hes not serious right now but Im hoping that over time, Ill be able to earn his trust and affection. Somehow, I have this theory that maybe hes giving me a test? Is he testing my patience and how committed and determined I am? Maybe hes purposely cancelling in the hopes that Ill go away sooner or later? I dont know. I want to show him Im different than the rest of the women hes met. Im running out of ideas on what to do when we meet for the 3rd time. I want to keep him interested and actually spend quality time with him every time we meet. I have asked for his input on what he wanted to do from the last 2 meetings we had but he doesnt give any input and he seems to let me drive the situation. I do my best to be as feminine as I can be. Compliment him, listen to him and show appreciation and be sexy for him. I dont want to seem aggressive and masculine as this might put him off so I try my best to be gentle and staying true to myself. Can you please give me ideas on how to keep him interested and motivated? What should I do on our 3rd meeting? We plan to meet next week Thurs/Friday. How do I convert him from non-serious to serious? Im not rushing things, Im giving myself 1yr to be able to convert him or at least keep him interested. Its been 6months and running since we started talking. I have this idea for the next time we meet, where Ill express how Id like for this to move forward. I.e how often we can arrange to meet/spend time (1or2x/month), things we could do together, how often he should try to communicate/respond to texts, and maybe request for him to ring me sometimes since he doesnt ring me at all, only text, so I can hear his voice. Is this a good idea?If so, how do I go about it? Is the 3rd meet the right time to talk about this or do I wait 2 more meetings to do so? I want to use sex to keep him interested but I am not all for it as Im afraid hell ghost me right after. What am I doing wrong? What am I doing right? How do I keep my frame? I really feel a strong connection for this man. Hes so mysterious, very masculine and smart which keeps me more interested and drawn to him. Its been 6months since we started talking and I still feel strongly for him. Please dont tell me to dump him and find somebody else coz thats not the answer I seek. Your help is much appreciated. Thank you."

they provide no obvious benefit to the peacock survival and can even turn out to be a hindrance when escaping predators well one theory is the handicap principle The Peacocks feathers are attractive to other females because they hurt the male peacock survival chances which means that only a strong peacock can support such a waste from a survival perspective not optimizing for its own survival signals just how fit that peacock really is consider then the moment from Geralt who tells the truth despite at harming his own reputation ""there was no slang I had my ass kicked by a ragged band of elves I was about to have my throat cut when Phil Evandro let me go"" Paradoxically but totally in line with the handicapped principle in this case it is received as a confident move And get this as response ""any man willing to paint himself in the shadow of his failures will make for far more interesting conversation this night"" The same for the Peacock's feathers and it holds true in modern society when someone tells the truth that hurts their own reputation we assume that they must be strong enough not to need people to like them we see them as having supreme confidence Geralt continues this habit speaking plainly to royalty on multiple occasions now true to the handicapped principle although it's signals deep confidence telling the truth doesn't always put Geralt at an advantage in fact it gets him thrown into jail at one point If you have a nerdy hobby that you think other people might judge you're often better off speaking about it with enthusiasm rather than downplaying the last point is that Geralt is extremely nonreactive he doesn't easily adopt other people's emotional tone for instance he still calm as yennefer chastises him He maintains his line of questioning when he's being screamed at by ostrich This all highlights one of the key indicators and creators of confidence :the ability to have a sturdy emotional Center the world will of course throw stresses, irritants and frustrations of all kinds at you and when we see someone immediately reacte to a negative emotional state of another person we see that they lack that grounded Center When we notice that people are resilient and that their calmness is not easily pierced we view them as more confident and capable Their low reactivity signifies that whatever is coming at them is a problem that they can handle this principle plays out dramatically in the animal kingdom where a strong emotional mastery can trump physical strength in dominance battles Tribesmen steal a kill off of a lion alter a solid nonreactive front in the face of danger now of course there will be things that create emotional shifts and part of being confident in the modern social world is the ability to express your emotions with honesty and vulnerability this point is just to say that you want to cultivate a more firmly grounded internal calm so that you aren't always in constant reaction to the world It is importance of recognizing your specific triggers Some events and people are going to set you off pretty easily compared to other things So literally make a list it might include family a person that you might like to impress or being involved in competition writing your own triggers out can jog your memory in these moments where your cool is about to break and help you snap out of it in real time if you're someone who lacks confidence these tips will definitely help you to appear more confident and make a stronger impression on the people that you meet ultimately, what you'll want to strive for is unshakable inner confidence when you make deep confidence your natural state of being all these body language tips It was Ivan to serve you"
25,vulnerability,seduction,Lost my game and struggle to get it back,1,em4kcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/em4kcw/lost_my_game_and_struggle_to_get_it_back/,2020-01-09 15:25:38,"Ok, so heres the thing. Im not sure wether I (m, 31) can grasp my situation exactly but Id appreciate any advise or clarifying questions of you folks because Im stuck. For quite some time Ive been struggling with game, seduction, flirting or whatever you may call it. This frustrates me beyond anything because four years back I had to start a fucking calendar to not lose track of my dates. Im not trying to brag here or impress anyone - I literally started my first organizer in my late twenties to manage my dates; oftentimes it seemed to me like the more women I was seeing the less I had to invest in any interaction because girls either knew me already because of stories (Im living in a small but very young city with lots of female students) or because of my own narcissistic charisma that I was radiating at that time. Cut to four years later. After making a wonderful person of the girls Ive slept with my girlfriend, endless fights about her legitimate jealousy and trust-issues, almost 150 sessions of psychotherapy for myself, a terrible but rewarding breakup, Ive not only become more aware of myself, my good qualities and my disfunctional behaviors, thought- and relationship-patterns but I really started to love myself step by step. What I mean by that is that I started to feel empathy for myself in moments of vulnerability and thus for almost anyone around me; Ive built great relationships with new friends and repaired the old ones as good as I could, healed the relationship with my father and siblings, focused on my career - like really the good stuff. I realized that I probably wasnt made for a monogamous relationship, made that clear to my then best friend who I fell in love with; we became a couple 18 months ago and have been building a wonderful (nonmonogamous) relationship since then Ive never even imagined was possible. The only fucking problem right now is that I seem to completely have lost my game; I am considered a self-confident and charismatic person by my friends and new people I meet. In group projects at university or at work I usually find myself quite naturally in a position where I actively listen to everyone and work towards a common goal while appreciating differences in perspectives and opinions. Still Im the guy who protests authentically when theres something going wrong in my opinion while doing so in a manner that gives my counterpart the opportunity to respond without being crushed. In short: I often act as something Id call a good leader. Four years ago I was kind of an asshole, especially to women. I always pushed myself to care less and it seemed as if I was rewarded for it. Now that Im really interested in women, their thoughts and feelings, hopes and fears, Im counting rejection after rejection. Probably one of my core questions might be: Can I be a respectful playboy? And if so, how? Sorry if this post might seem chaotic, its the first time Ive tried to verbalize my struggle and English isnt my mother tongue. I would really really appreciate help from you guys. Thanks alot in advance. Tl;dr: Lost my game with women after changing myself towards a more loving person. I dont want to be a nice guy nor do I want to be the asshole I used to be. Thanks for your help."
26,vulnerability,seduction,Is confidence killing your game?,1,enk3sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/enk3sk/is_confidence_killing_your_game/,2020-01-12 17:32:43,"Wait, what?! But I thought women are attracted to confidence? If you interview women and ask them ""How do you feel about a man approaching you in public?"", their top complaints are: 1. Disrespectful approaches 2. Cocky / over-confident approaches If you want some evidence, Sasha Daygame conveniently recently interviewed a bunch of women, and they repeat those 2 complaints over and over again: [URL Here's my takeaway from all of this, which is corroborated by my successful (though short) career cold approaching: When you approach a woman, you should do so **respectfully** and **authentically**. You are already exhibiting extreme confidence by approaching her in the first place. If, for the following 10 minutes of vibing, you are nothing but confident, and show no vulnerability, no chinks in your armor, you're essentially showing how good you are at approaching, which means you do it all the time, which means she is not special. Since she's not special, she is probably going to give you her number and then flake on you. Are you feeling particularly nervous on this approach? Tell her. Be vulnerable with her. ""I'm sorry, I'm super nervous, you are so cute."" Or use a vulnerable opener: ""Excuse me, my heart is beating so fast right now, but I just *had* to come meet you."" Did something awkward happen, like an awkward silence or your hand shaking while you were handing her your phone? Point it out and own it, don't pretend it didn't happen. Women can see right through that. If you try to play it cool and confident, and you don't acknowledge it, you look cocky and inauthentic."
27,vulnerability,seduction,"Keeping it simple, actionable, and healthy with: IPOD.",1,ep1q10,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/ep1q10/keeping_it_simple_actionable_and_healthy_with_ipod/,2020-01-15 23:31:08,"This will take away most of the over-thinking of approaching and interacting. The result doesn't matter, if you're going to overthink, just overthink on if you're doing these or thinking like this. The I has 2 things to remember, P has 3, O has 4, and D has 2. Knowing the acronym and getting familiar with it is enough to embody the general concepts though. **I:** Being *INTERESTED*. You're showing that you're INTERESTED in what they're saying (empathy), and you're showcasing INTEREST (a.k.a attraction) in them, in some way. Even a flirty eye look works, a casual remark, kino, whatever you want. **P:** Being *PRIDEFUL, PRESENT &amp; POSITIVE*. You're showing that you have PRIDE in yourself (which comes from doing SOMETHING which merits you having pride, which is confidence). You can't lack a sense of direction and pull, unless you look really good, you're REALLY lucky due to circumstances, you're deluded to the point of having narcissistic fabricated pride, or a combination of these. What you do could be anything: working out, writing, drawing etc. It gives you confidence in your value to the other person, and these can stack up (ex. your rough life experience is something that can give you pride). Being PRESENT in the moment is important so you're focused on what they're saying and giving off (this ties back to empathy, since you need to be present to actively listen to what they're saying). Being POSITIVE refers to reading ambiguous situations positively. I'm not telling you to be positive when someone insults you. But if someone makes a neutral expression/look, or says something that can be interpreted either way (which happens a lot), go for the positive interpretation. If someone IS being passive aggressive or attacking you, then they're forced to directly attack you out in the open, in which case it's okay to retaliate, OR, they'll back down and go with your positive interpretation. **O**: Being *OPEN*. You're being OPEN with the person (basically being authentic like you would with a friend you're comfortable around, but not authentic to the point of being a man-child and sharing a vulnerability you haven't worked on and crying about it). You're also having OPEN body language (basically just to show you're relaxed, with arms wide if it looks natural, legs crossed leaning back, not fidgeting etc). Additionally, you're OPEN to leading (this one was forced in, but it allows you to factor in all the important basics). Being open to leading most of the time is important for logistics and doing what you want and bringing that person along with you. Last of all, you're OPEN to being rejected (the end result doesn't matter). **D:** Feeling like you are *DESERVING*. This addresses self-esteem, NOT the result (so don't be entitled or act like you ""got her""). You are DESERVING of being there in that interaction. You are enough as you are, during that interaction. This doesn't mean not to work on yourself, but we're assuming that you did what you could, and now you surrender to knowing you're enough for the conversation. You said something weird on the approach? Fuck it. You DESERVE to be there. Sit in it and see what happens. If they're not interested, you already know that you deserve to be there, so reply in the same way you would to a friend that isn't interested in a topic, just shrug and move on. You're also DESERVING of your time. Someone is flaking even after a re-schedule? Next. Someone is trying to play hard to get? Your time is valuable, let them play around in front of the door until they're ready to knock. As a bonus, this can also apply to friends. The only difference is that you just take out the sexual interpretation from the I(nterest) portion of IPOD, unless you're about that, then more power to you. I made a fun little acronym of the opposite acronym of unnacctravtive traits for fun: ""GFCU"" (as in, bye bye chances of a GF). (G)uilt, F(ear), C(losed), U(nworthy). **What does this not include?** (1) Specific Techniques: like push/pull, frame control, logistics, agreeing and amplifying etc. \- Do you need these too? You could learn them, but you don't have to. Being authentic is naturally polarising and creates a natural push/pull. A bit less efficient than doing it mentally, but a lot less mentally draining. If you think you're deserving of being there, and that you have value, that's a frame of its own and works for your needs. With regards to logistics, knowing to lead is most of it. Agreeing and amplifying happens naturally when you feel like you deserve to be there. If a chick says ""did you this just to sleep with me?"", you just shrug, smile, and say ""not just you"" or anything to show you don't give a fuck and you can't be pushed around. It doesn't need to be thought about because it's innate though. Most techniques are variations of these basics, just more broken down. Personally though, too much technique leads to insecurity. (2) Increasing your looks and social status. \- Do you need to know this? YES. This is the only part I didn't include, because it depends on the person. Basically as you get better with styling well, lifting and eat healthy, and having some sort of social status with those around you, everything else becomes easier. Having money can ruin your chances (outside of the social status aspect, unless you want a gold digger), so I didn't include that. **TL;DR IPOD:** being **Interested** (attracted and interested in them), **Prideful &amp; Present &amp; Positive** (prideful of purpose &amp; value, present to the moment, and you interpret situations positively), **Open** (you're authentic, have open body language, and you're open to leading and rejection), **Deserving** (you deserve to exist in that environment, but not of the result, and you deserve to have your time respected)."

The thing I love about it is that it is more focused on self improvement than just having hacks for getting laid. Initially I couldnt talk to any girl that I didnt know but now I have the confidence to just say hi to someone and start having a conversation. But right now all that doesnt matter. Ive been recovering from a breakup for about a year now and I still havent fully recovered. It was my first love, first kiss, first sex, first everything, and I was madly in love with her. Moving on has been difficult (almost impossible) because 1. Shes much hotter and sociable than me, 2. Shes in the same class as me. 3. She still wants us to get back together. I dont wanna be with her because shes already cheated on me once and shes the kind of girl who wants to be on great terms with every guy. My friends keep sending me pics she uploads on insta with guys (around her arms, in her bed); nothing overtly romantic but definitely flirtatious. I dont wanna be the type of guy who says dont send me these pics they hurt because I dont wanna be weak anymore. But seeing it still does bother me. I want THAT to stop more than I wanna get laid or keep a score of how many strange girls Ive been talking to, and I dont wanna keep a game just to distract myself from my true feelings of vulnerability.

29,vulnerability,seduction,First dates going great but unable to get a second.,1,evzy44,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/evzy44/first_dates_going_great_but_unable_to_get_a_second/,2020-01-30 15:47:26,"So I'm GREAT at first dates. Most of the girls I go out with absolutely love me and are usually willing to go back to my place, getting at least a makeout. However, I completely lose all confidence and tact after the night is over. The girl ends up ghosting afterwards. Most recently there were 2 girls. One Saturday, one Sunday. Even though I only had 1 date with each of these ladies, I felt some sort of connection. I was convinced that it'd be no extra work at all to land a second date, but apparently I was wrong. They've already ghosted and it's bringing me so fucking down. For brevity sake, here's a quick rundown of each scenario: **Girl A (from Saturday):** We have 2 drinks, go back to my place, essentialy have sex with our clothes on, but no actual penetration. She bounces after 45 minute of fooling around. I text her Monday night in an attempt to get a quick convo going so I could ask her out again. We probably go back/forth 3-4 times, she mostly sent low effort replies and I was the last one to reply. In the morning she sent me a ':)' in repy to my last message. 12 hours go by, she hits me up again, just saying my name. I send a low effort reply 'well hi there', then a few hours later 'curious why you sent my name?' and she blocks me. The chemistry I had with that girl was insane. I don't know if my texting came off too aloof, she had a random ex come back into her life, or she died. All I know is I can no longer even find her username on IG. **Girl B (from Sunday):** Pretty much same as above. We have two drinks, go back to my place, talk a bit and then makeout. Great chemistry. I walk her to her car, she says she has a great time, etc. Texts me when she gets home saying she had a great time again. SHE hits me up on Tuesday afternoon. I reply about 6 hours later with a picture of something I was doing. Then again 3 hours later (because I got impatient waiting for a reply) saying that I found a cool new sushi place (thinking she'd reply to that and I could then invite her to it). But, she never did. So tonight, about 24 hours after I sent my last message, I added a 'anyway, since we had a good time together, I was wondering if you wanted to go there together?'. Welp, still no reply. This girl ghosting me confuses me even more. She hit me up first. I sent two texts afterwards, neither of them being exceptionally weird IMO. Maybe not amazing texts, but certainly not ones that should be ignored for 24 hours if the girl liked me. Then since I figured what did me in with the last girl was a lack of intent and vulnerability, I just asked for the hangout straight up. So this girl is probably as good as gone too. -- So, I know its tough to get the full picture since you only have to go on with what I've told you, but the first girl I realized I probabaly needed to have provided a bit more comfort before getting into a sexual situation with her like that. I honestly don't know WTF happened with the texting. She wasn't giving me much to go on, and girls that like you are supposed to make things easy. Since she blocked me, I'm trying to just not think too much into it, because who the fuck does that? It's the second one that has me more fucked up. I don't really know what I did wrong, aside from my third text not illiciting a response. Because of that, now I just look like the crazy guy that texted a girl he barely knows 3 times in a row. Anyway, this got longer than I expected it to, but I guess the **tldr** is that: I need some sort of help to find a way to not destroy my chances with girls that like me. My game goes out the window after the first date, especially when it goes well, because I become over invested and over analyze every single thing. This must shift the vibe of my texts in a way that is perceivable to the girl."

Every thing was going brilliant. I remember thinking, wow, this is so easy when you actually know what you are doing. There was one thing I wasn't sure if I did right on my texting so I posted here a question about it. Then just before entering to the date I got a push notification from a harsh comment reply calling me a creep. It instantly triggered me very heavily and I went into discussion with him, asking questions, and the commenter insisted on shunning me with that word, using a previous post of mine here as his ""proof"". In that post I was just venting in a moment of frustration about a girl not replying to me. Needless to say I never said anything to her. Since it was my first success for a date and I'm still learning to improve as a person and as I man, especially in the confidence and anxiety field, I've lost confidence after reading this judgment before seeing her. I tried push it away it didn't work. Probably made it worst. It just got into my head and under my skin and wouldn't say goodbye. Result was I wasn't relaxed the all date, kept thinking about that awful word (I'm super sensitive for that word), trying pointlessly make sens of it and wasn't 100 percent with the girl. I ended up in her friend's zone. The frustration was very painful and I'm still collecting my wounds. She was beautiful, available and appreciative of me. She was the perfect person at the right time and i made it all go down to the toilet. I found it sad to find out that people come here to open up, with their vulnerability, anxieties, successes, and it can backfire at you. Most of the people here are brilliant, heartfelted and supportive. Just be careful with sharing too much or be prepared that not everyone here has your best interest in mind and apply this always true rule: what other people think of you is none of your business."
31,vulnerability,seduction,The Strength of Vulnerability,1,duk5gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/duk5gx/the_strength_of_vulnerability/,2019-11-11 11:26:53,"Vulnerability gets a bad rep. So many people believe that being vulnerable is the same as being weak; the same as allowing people to hurt or have the ability to impact how you feel on a day to day basis, but true vulnerability is anything but. The point I will make today is that true confidence and comfort in yourself mandates a certain amount of vulnerability and I plan to give hypothetical scenarios and examples that demonstrate what I mean. I also hope to give you practical applications for practicing confident vulnerability. Being Open Ive recently started a blog where I am open about the fact that I am on the Autism Spectrum. Thats because I accept that it is simply who/what I am. Its a part of me. No amount of medication, therapy, substance abuse, bench presses, or anything else I could do to make myself feel better about it and it took me far too long to accept that. Instead what Ive chosen to do is be open about it in hopes that the stigma of it thats prevalent in popular culture today is, if nothing else, diluted to be less accurate and more accepted. For the practical effects of it, my family and friends have been far more accepting and supportive of me since being open and honest about it. This isnt to say that they ever werent, just that the quality of those relationships has increased. Being open and vulnerable with how youre feeling in a conducive way lets people know that you value them, that you value their insights and thoughts. When people feel valued by you, they value you in return. Vulnerability is Attractive Imagine that youve followed my advice on dress, fitness, dieting, in my blog and youve met that pretty girl in the coffee shop and youve asked her out on a date or out for a drink or whatever else you have planned. She says yes and smiles wide. Youre in. But what do you say to her to get the conversation started? What do you say when she asks you something? A lot of men view conversation as a simple information gathering exercise. She asks this, you say that, etc. The thing a lot of us have trouble understanding is that conversation is very much an emotional exercise, where the person youre talking to is trying to figure out who you are and if youre right for them. Heres a sample conversation Her: So whats your favorite movie? You: Horrible Bosses Her: Why? You: Its funny Reading that was a little painful right? Her understanding is that youre not interested in participating in the conversation or are intimidated by her in some way. The latter may very well be true. But do you really want to have interactions with this that have no real depth? Instead try to model the following: Her: Whats your favorite movie? Horrible Bosses, my brothers and I had a little tradition growing up called Bro Day where we would go see a movie and get something to eat! Oh wow! Did they like the movie too? They loved it! We had a lot of fun doing that together; it meant a lot to me. Showing vulnerability like this gives the person youre talking to insight into who you are. They feel more comfortable around you. When someone feels comfortable around you, they are much more likely to find you attractive. An important note to make is that you dont want to tell sob stories to gain pity. Talking about your abusive parents or that time your ex cheated on you isnt going to make the other person feel more comfortable with you; its going to make them pity you and feel sorry for you. You dont want that. Vulnerability in Friendships In my line of work, being open and honest about my struggles and weaknesses with my coworkers is necessary, bordering on critical. Im happy to report that my coworkers are also some of my best friends. We talk about our families, our relationships, and where we struggle in the classroom. Frequently, I go to them and share with them praises of something that one of our students did so that they know what theyre capable of in their history class. I also share with them anytime I have behavioral issues from one of my students in the hopes that they can give me feedback on how I can handle the situation or they can spill the beans on anything that may have happened earlier in the day or at the individual students home. Vulnerability at Work Im going to get some flak for this one but to hell with it. If you are in a supervisory position at work, whether it be as a classroom teacher, an office manager, or something else where you are charged with supervision of people, I cant stress enough the importance of showing a degree of vulnerability to them. I frequently admit to my students that I dont know something, including things about the subject I teach. Its important to me that my students know that I am merely a man. Yes, they look up to me and are dependent on me to a degree for their grades and teenage life advice, but they also know that I am not the expert of everything. Im also open with them about upcoming life challenges. For instance, I may have to have surgery on my eyes in the coming months. Theyre aware of this, and they have been nothing but kind and graceful about it. We may have also exchanged the occasional pirate joke but thats how we operate. Im also open and honest with them about my interests. I was once a gawky gamer kid but I am also an avid weightlifter and deeply into fitness, giving me a wide range of subjects to connect with my kids on. A couple of years ago, I had a solid clique of students which adored talking about Dragonball with me. Those kids that I have built these types of relationships have consistently worked harder for me and more confidently for me than those that I havent been successful in doing that with. Impact of Vulnerability Ive spent so much time today talking about different situations in which vulnerability can help you because I firmly believe that a degree of vulnerability is necessary in having true confidence in yourself. Not caring about what others think of the things that are truly a part of you betrays a sense of self value that will broadcast your comfort with yourself like few other character traits will. Demonstrating the kind of vulnerability that Ive discussed today will increase the depth and quality of all of your relationships and ultimately make you more approachable, and therefore, more attractive. Very Respectfully, Darrell"

Did it even matter? He didnt really know how much he cared, but he knew that he had a lot of problems. He looked upwards and swiped the virtual screen in front him.

We have a winner. Four-for one-special!\* **Info:** your ego investment problems are what lead to your lack of vulnerability. This has created a loop in your mind, leading to a crippling mental anxiety of never approaching anyone you deem better than yourself. As a result, youve developed an insecurity from being average looking. Looks like you have a whole host of problems. In order to proceed, you have to be willing to act in ways that would make you completely ashamed of yourself, with the people you consider better than you. In doing so, youll realize that acting shameful is normal, maybe even fun, and that what they think is irrelevant. This means you need come off as creepy in the beginning, which is completely fine. Eventually, youll just be doing it to see whatll happen and what you can try next. As a result, the shame from being vulnerable will disappear, and you will no longer fear opening up. If youre able to open up, youll start seeing that it was never about your looks. If it ever is, it was never your issue anyways. The other person just has ego investment issues.

It was never about getting laid. I just didn't want to always be uneasy in any group where women were involved (work, weddings, school, street etc.). I'm still dealing with this issue but now I'm pin-pointing my specific problems and evolving A LOT as a person. For the guys lurking you can too. It's definitely discouraging at times when you hear that some random dude managed 100 lays in a year with low effort and you're like ""wtf how?"" while you're struggling to even approach a chick after putting in work with reading, lifting, and all that other shit. I didn't even go into this wanting to get laid and now I'm like shit, if these average guys can do it (one guy was apparently straight up below average and disabled, with 40 lays after insane hard work), what's stopping me? Maybe I can give this a shot? And sometimes,because of seeing all those posts it would even seep into my daily vibes and I'd be bummed out because I haven't dated in legit five years and I see how I'm mentally blocked from approaching because of my ego. What's worse is knowing how many opportunities were missed because of my excuses and ego. I see them now. ALL of them. There's easily minimum 5 opportunities to approach if you so much as leave your house and bus to school or work, or walk in the street. The funny thing is, when I was lazy and fat, I didn't care much to get laid because I had porn, novels, youtube, and I could even study from home. I was cool working remotely and living in isolation until I died. I also figured I could never get fit again and that I was too far gone at 21 with my depression, and my fat ass to even do much with my life. But now, I don't accept that of myself. It's harder but more rewarding. I literally lost 80 pounds in less than a year and it's easy to maintain it to. Sure, it feels good when a novel character gets that level up. But leveling up IRL is pure bliss. Here are some things I've been battling in my mind that you might too. ""Cold approaching only works in some places in the US, my city is cold and unwelcoming"", ""I'm average or below average looking"", ""I was destined to be anxious for the rest of my life"", ""The blackpill is the truth, I saw that FaceandLMS video, clearly these people are lying about being successful and verage looking"", ""Why do I owe girls my energy in approaching them?"", ""Will doing this really change me and help me in my goals?"", ""Approaching a random girl anywhere is fucking creepy and I'm probably disturbing them unless I look hot"", ""Why do I need this shit? None of my friends do self-improvement yet they seem to be doing really well"". Listen fuck all that noise. All that shit is ego and rationalizing. Did you see that guy with asbergers who did 3000 approaches? That's when you can wave the flag and say ""I tried, but it didn't work"". This dude did EVERYTHING he could. Even RSD and those expensive ass scammy bootcamps didn't work for him. It took him 3000 approaches to get 3 lays. That's 1 lay per 1000 approaches. Apparently he wasn't particularly attractive, he was short, and he was working on top of that. So don't lie to yourself. You're not fighting against other guys. You're fighting against yourself. If 1000 is what you need to be able to take risks socially (even for the future, if you want to get into business) then that's what you fucking need to do. Unless you look like a 1-2/10, you can have SOME sort of success with SOME girls, as long as you're fit and dress well, and work on your mannerisms and body language so they become natural. People judge you on looks. Deal with it. We're all animals coded to be this way. Welcome to earth. You can't change that. You can only change YOU. Fine tune yourself. Sculpt yourself. Become an emotional puppeteer of yourself. What? You want to be a celebrity and think that doing cold approach isn't something that someone ""cool"" would do? Well, when you're cool af in your 30s-40s or whatever age you'll be, telling people that story and being open about it shows you give no fucks. Hell, even if someone told me ""I was at a weird stage in my life in my late 20s and would take a shit in different malls in front of everyone"". As long as they seemed authentic and well-meaning, I'd find them interesting and even laugh my ass off at their candidness. With that level of vulnerability, it makes people open the fuck up to you and view you as someone with a story. Why do you think RSD are so known? They're controversial. RSD tyer literally admitted to fucked up shit. So did julian, and a bunch of other rsd guys. But here they are living their best lives. If the entire media can't take down someone's business where they actually did something fucked, what's the worse that can happen to you from cold approach? A girl saying ""get the fuck out of my face?"". Maybe a slap for the uncalibrated or a ""creep!"". She just has a stick up her ass. Just move on and find someone else. Yeah don't touch people when they say no obviously, but you get the point. You'll get there. Remember, you're YOU. Are you a dork? Fuck it. Do you look like Sid from ice age? FUCK it. Do you not fit into any group? Fuck it. Are you a short indian? Fuck it. I know a short and fat af ugly indian guy who's shameless as fuck and has high standards, and somehow he can pull at night clubs AND talk to girls during the day (even if he gets friendzoned for day game or social circle game). But he gives literally no fucks about his appearance or fashion at all, so it's that much tougher for him. He literally wears jackets in the summer type shit. Despite that, somehow he managed to get into a frat and even dudes respect him. The world is crazy. So FUCK IT. Be the best you. If the best you is still a virgin after ALL this shit (assuming you're a 1/10), then FUCK it. But do it ALL and try it ALL first. Then, you can wave the flag, work hard, and just get hookers. When you put your ego aside, there's hookers out there that look better than what even the most good looking guys can pull even after hard work. So at that point just work on your purpose and meet your own needs."

My desire to be better with women and become more fearless eventually began to outweigh my misplaced sense of pride, and I eventually started looking for a book that would help me with women. I started researching which pick-up books to start with, and I saw a lot of recommendations for Models. So I caved, walked ashamedly into Barnes and Nobles to place an order for a book with a front cover that exclaims how it will help the reader to attract more girls (seemed like a hoax for chumps), and waited for the book to ship. Look... when I tell you that Im not even halfway through the book and it is changing my whole perspective on LIFE and not just women, I now feel foolish for thinking I was some kind of a loser for wanting to get help from a book in the first place. The concepts of neediness and vulnerability have been ringing so true with respect to how Ive dealt with women in the past, and now I feel as if Im on a self discovery journey more than on a getting laid journey. I say all this to say that seeking help and/or looking to better yourself doesnt make you look like a chump/loser/wannabe/pussy/[insert other inaccurate noun here]. Sitting in your pride and allowing it to stand in the way of becoming better does. Hopefully this resonates with someone."

It is guaranteed that, no matter how sublte i would communicate that to her, i'd immediately put her off. At this point, having had experiences with many beautitul women, i would love to finally fall in love with a girl and get in a serious relationship (never had a serious one in my life) with her. But i feel like that's not something i can afford. If i show vulnerability they'd reject me. The last experience of this i had was some weeks ago. I went to visit a foreign city with my friends, a city in which lived a girl i met this summer, with whom i had a great connection but didn't do anything yet. We met, had fun, couple of beers and i kissed her, she immediately melted, hugged me and buried her head in my chest, before kissing me back. We spend two hours like this kissing and being cute to each other, before she had to get home. She was emotionally invested, more than me, The day after, when i got back in my country, i decided, as she was this kind of ""cute/innocent/adorable"" type of girls, to text her something cute, along the lines of: ""i felt great being with you, i want to meet you again"" type of text, to make her sure that i didn't ""used her and never got back"". She replied with a two words answer a whole l day afer. Yesterday, to get the conversation start again, i sent her a fun video we made together that night. Took a day to visualize, and never answered again. This is the second time i happen to get feelings for a girl and it's the second time it ends badly. That never happens with fwbs. E.g. the last fwb i had, texted me first the night after we had sex for the first time. I never showed any feeling to her (despite treating her very well)."

Whole night goes good at the club. Pregamed but didn't drink once I got there. While I was leaving some girls were talking about ""I don't think you understand the drinking rules in this state"" I said ""Zero Tolerance"" while looking at one girl. She smiled and went on to talk to her friends near their car and I talked to mine over elsewhere. Our friends were leaving with other girls and didn't want to take a uber with us so we were stranded. The girl walked past us and I asked her can she drive she said yes come on. Her GF left her. We walked to her house which was like a mile away and I sat in the backseat because an acquaintance called shotgun. I made sure they got dropped off first and took the front seat. We talked the whole 40 mins back about I don't even know what there were a lot of topics. We get to the military base and she has a military card because of her parents. We park the car and I'm saying you should probably take a nap here your sleep deprived. Couple minutes of me playing the sleep here I'm worried about your safety jokingly go by and she leans in really close and I basically have to kiss her. This make out session was really intense for 2 people that just met. After I continued trying to convince her to nap but I guess she really did have work in like a hour and a half. So I take my ass up stairs and fall asleep. I wake up and im on cloud 9 like what just happened. I haven't kissed a girl in 3 years. Im nervous to snap her i was drunk and socially lubricated that night now. I snap her if she wants to come over today. She said I would if I could but it's family day at the pumpkin patch. I told her I'll take her on a date instead another day. She said haha ok. She wasn't really responding. I know texting can kill a vibe so I was just trying to see her. The next day I text her how her days going. She said she just got off. I texted her like 30 mins later ""Do you want to come over today"". Went unread for like 5 hrs and otw back from the gym I just kindve kept driving past my dorm and blared music to possibly get me out of my head. Nothing was working so I just deleted her snap. Have no way to get back in touch with her Trying to understand what made me do it. Part of it was feeling she was out of my league. I was scared of a upcoming date because how would I top the first day we met you know. I just wanted to have sex with her so I could be calm and have some power over her but every second of vulnerability drove me insane. I was finding myself latching on to her and I could feel infatuation taking me over. I couldn't hit the gym hard I was infatuated and becoming soft. She was all I thought about and I just wasn't comfortable having love take me over. She is really pretty and has a deep country accent like me. I only knew her for a hour and a half and it was one of the greatest nights of my life. Yet it felt like I was having my soul slowly stripped away from me by a stranger I barely knew and it scared me. I'm also insecure in that she could be a immune to emotion slut because she's a waitress and her snap story had cleavage which is how all the girls look at that bar. That paired with a unread message, insecurities, and being engulfed and drowned in a mixture of love and infatuation made me mentally paralyzed and was just terrifying. I did not want to give her power over me. I have goals and the only way I found it possible to focus is if I just let her go. I've only texted her a day and a half after the first night. What I've learned: Free your mind don't expect outcome. Don't be distracted by what is happening externally look internally. Keep your mind in the right place. Put yourself in a position to be her man. Girls want to be loved deep down not treated as sexual animals. And don't delete the girls number you just made out with to break free of ""infatuation"" it's prime time to overcome insecurities and grow  Now roast my ass"
39,vulnerability,seduction,When Blocked Meets Unblocked,26,dfyj2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/dfyj2v/when_blocked_meets_unblocked/,2019-10-11 01:08:23," Today Im going to give you guys some insight into the transitional face between being blocked and unblocked when it comes to Social Primes perspective regarding emotional blockages in dating. This is important information and if you have ever tried out our philosophy this is definitely something youve run into at least at some occasions. The problem starts with being blocked. What I mean by blocked is basically that there is a belief that gets triggered in your mind, that manifests as a unconscious behavior, and is experienced as an emotion with a bag of thoughts reinforcing that emotion. This is what we call an emotional blockage, and this is the main obstacles you are facing in your development in dating. The primary directive of this blockage is to go undetected by you, and if detected its primary directive is to push you away from examining it. Because if you do that, it will dissolve. Now, obviously I dont mean that it has a life of its own, it was created by you at a specific time in your life when you didnt know better. At that moment, you thought adopting that specific belief and behavior was the best thing that you could do. And now it exists as a perspective in your mind, and when this perspective gets triggered, you can have a hard time distinguishing it from the truth. As an example: Lets say that you had an incident at the age of three, you were lost in a store by your mother and felt abandoned. What happened in reality was that your mother went looking for some item in the corner of the store and accidentally lost you for three minutes. How your mind interpreted it at the time was that your mother abandoned you and you dont deserve to be loved because of that. All of this was suppressed, because your mind felt like it was too much to handle at that time. The problem is that this perspective was never revisited, and it sunk deep into your subconscious mind, and was reinforced many times throughout your life, without your knowledge. It was first only triggered by your mom, but later in your teenage years it developed into girls in general, a lowkey fear of being abandoned by every women that you like or love. And this pattern is here with you today. Whenever you are in an environment with girls, and you want to talk to them, this pattern of fear of abandonment is kicking in, and there is a part of you that believes 100% that you will be abandoned by every woman you like, because it happen when you were three. What do you think will happen when you become aware of this pattern? Do you think you will just right away say oh! I feel afraid of being abandoned, but its just how I feel now, its not true, I dont have to worry about it!. Probably not, because you still feel like its true, you still believe its true. This is the limbo state between being blocked and being unblocked. This is the vulnerable part, this is the part you have to go through in order to become unblocked. So a couple of things that will greatly help you when you are in this limbo state are the following guiding principles: The main issue lies in the emotional charge of the belief, so if you can feel out the emotion and not reinforce it, the intensity will lessen and the belief will seem less true. Always remember that its a belief/perspective and not an objective truth, if you insist that its an objective truth you will stay stuck and will not be able to move forward. Observe how much your emotion colors your perception and how all these thoughts about you and the situation start popping up, thoughts that wasnt there 10 minutes before. See how the emotion is twisting your perception. Treat your blockages with respect and acceptance. Even though the blockage might have held you back 1000s of times in the past, its just your young self crying out for something, maybe love, maybe reassurance, maybe acceptance. Approach your blockage with understanding, not malevolence. Last and not least is to remember that acceptance of a vulnerability does not mean weakness, but on the contrary it means strength. Because you have now accepted and moved past it, freeing yourself of the limitation that that blockage held over you. These are some useful and practical guiding principles to use when you are in that limbo state. Now I want to expand a bit more on what happens on the other side of being blocked, what happens when you are unblocked? I think its quite intriguing that many men in today's society completely misunderstands emotional acceptance, and misdiagnoses it as accepting emotional weakness. Emotional acceptance is not accepting emotional weakness, emotional acceptance means coming to terms with the fact that we are extremely emotional beings and integrating that part of ourselves. We become more whole and much more powerful. We heal ourselves, and when we are healed, we are obviously more capable.. Going through and letting go of emotional blockages will also permanently raise your self esteem, since your self esteem was blocked by the blockage. But this fear of being vulnerable and weak is still a strong form of social conditioning looming in most mens minds today. I am not advocating whining and not taking responsibility for your emotions, thats the other extreme, and often what men are afraid will happen to them if they acknowledges their emotions. The keyword here is awareness, stay aware through this process, dont let any perspective pull you too far, dont believe any particular emotion too much. Act as a whole, rather than a sum of parts. \- Nils Flair"

It's weird and different than a stranger comes up to you and says they were interested in some funny thing they just saw you did. 2. **Your interest becomes a situation to get out of** - We hide our interest because women are getting bombarded at all times by unwelcome interest from men. Imagine you can't go outside without a bunch of strangers trying to sell you shoes. Every person becomes a person to handle. This is the value of False Time Constraint - it gets her out of planning how to get rid of you. 3. **You will not be cool with her declining** - A guy says he likes her. Now she's in charge of managing her feelings about the situation, but also she thinks she has to handle HIS. This is why women rarely outright decline, but instead they are diffident - they ""have boyfriends""/are ""busy""/flake. You must be as okay with her turning you down as if your friend orders a different meal than you. This is **especially** true in friend groups or workplaces. Women are afraid there'll be some kind of resentment for the decline that will mean you won't be a human any more to them and then they'll be stuck seeing you all the time. 4. **Being overtly sexual** - Men do this either because they're thinking in terms of how *they* see the interaction, because they think it shows confidence, or because it shows detachment. The problem is you're starting the movie with the climax (pun not intended). 5. **Doing it in a way that minimizes vulnerability** - it took me forever to figure out why women went for a vulnerable Paul Walker-type when movies overtly taught that stoic Vin Diesel or Clint Eastwood were manliness embodied. The difference between ""you're hot"" and ""I don't know how to talk when I'm with you"" is big. I've read a lot of people posting about Approach Anxiety, trying to get rid of it. Fuck that. Be nervous. Tell her why you're nervous. Be a person. Her instincts will reroute from ""find a way to sneak away and get rid of him"" to ""Whoa, this guy being real."" Showing your fear dismantles her own."
44,vulnerability,seduction,"Don't try to get her interested, attraction is about excitement",1217,dnjzzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/dnjzzo/dont_try_to_get_her_interested_attraction_is/,2019-10-27 08:23:33,"One thing I see a lot on this sub is questions about interest : ""I want to know is she is interested"", ""I think she was interested but I couldn't escalate"", ""How to make that girl interested ?"" and so on. I feel like addressing that, and would welcome any feedback or comments. Interest is mental. It's in your head, it's rational, it's in control. Excitement is in your body, you feel it inside you. It's a powerful force that you can't control. Imagine you're going to see a movie, one you tell yourself ""oh I'm really interested to see that movie"", and the other one ""Oh I'm so excited to see that movie !"". Do you feel the difference ? In your opinion, which one will you go for ? I had a discussion yesterday with one of my LTRs. She was telling me about this guy she had a date with. She told me ""It went very well. I want to see him again but I'm afraid he will think there is seduction going on between us"". I was surprised, and feeling bad for the poor guy, so I asked ""well what makes you want to see him again if you don't want any seduction ?"". And she told me he was very interesting, a fascinating person and discussion with him was smooth and intellectually stimulating. She would love to see him again. Obviously I told her he would probably like more than that and any guy I know after a date that went well would not be happy if the girl said ""Hey I would love to see you again as friends"". I asked her : ""but what's different with me ?"" (our relationship is still pretty recent, we had sex on the first date and we connect very well physically). And she said something along the lines of ""I don't know. I'm just so excited when I see you. I never know what will happen, and when we see each other I feel like my brain just melts and my body takes the lead"". I feel it's something that happens more and more often to me. I used to be all in my head, trying to show I was smart, funny, nice, interesting. I was focusing on looking good, demonstrate value, making money. And I didn't have nearly as much success as I do now. Now I have girls telling me that they have butterflies in their stomach when they think about me, that I'm always in their head. I just had a girl texting me three weeks after having sex telling me it was so profound that she made changes in her life and solved some long-lasting issues since then. So they talk about it to their friends, who obviously are very curious and interested when they meet me, and so on... So I never have to make an approach or use online dating, I just have an endless number of people wanting to meet me, interact with me, and eventually get into sensuality or sexuality with me, if excitement is there. **So, how to generate excitement ?** I think excitement goes in three steps : 1. Connecting to your body 2. Building a safe environment 3. Being in the flow **Step 1 : connecting to your body. ** First paradox, you can't generate excitement if you're looking for excitement. Why ? Because ""looking for something"" is already being in your head. Right now, reading that text, picturing how it would fit in your life, what plans you can do about it, it's all in your head. You're probably asking yourself ""is this worth it to read that wall of text ?"", ""Is this guy bullshitting or is it really an effective method ?"". It's all mental. What you need to look for is connecting to yourself. It's being inside yourself. Not only when you're with that girl, but all the time. Just noticing what goes inside you, without trying to change anything. When you have an emotion, observe how you feel. Don't rationalise, don't avoid it, just stay with it. Go for yoga, meditation, massages, anything that gets you a connection to your body and sensations. Hug deeply the people you meet, friends and family. Get used to eye contact, be at peace with your body and your nakedness (yes, by that I mean being naked in front of people). Dance, move, let your body decide what is right for it. Danse in the streets, take care of your posture, take time to close your eyes and feel your breathing. Observe the little things around you like the wind in the trees, like children having fun. When you're with a girl you like, shortcut your thoughts into your body. If you hear a voice telling you ""oh my god, I wonder if she wants me to go for the kiss ?"", focus on your breathing and sensations. If you tell yourself ""oh shit I don't know what to say, she must be bored right now"", just breath and put your consciousness in your body. You're there right here and right now. You're perfect the way you are at this exact moment. Life is an experience, you can sit inside of you and enjoy, look at the movie that goes in front of you, and be present with any emotion or sensation. **Step 2 : Building a safe environment** You know what is preventing most girls to be in their body during interactions ? A perception of danger. During a first date, most guys will be stuck in their head trying to get laid, while most girls will be stuck in their head trying to protect themselves from getting in a situation they don't want. Anxiety is the number one excitement-killer. It's the best way to not be in your body and even to dissociate (it's when you get completely disconnected from your body because the sensations are too difficult to handle. It's very important you know this so you can identify it and prevent it in yourself and the person you're with). Number one safety-builder is consent. Basically the girl should feel at any point that she can decide what she wants and nothing is forced on her. There is no pression, no expectation other than for her to choose what she wants. It's especially true in the first steps of the interaction when there is still a bit of tension. Asking ""can I touch your hand ?"" instead of touching it directly will reassure her. Maybe she will be surprised, telling you ""well of course you can, you don't have to ask !"", but deep down she can rest a bit a be a bit more in her body. Ask for questions that have yes / no answers. Like ""do you want us to go to my place ?"" and not ""Where do you want to go ?"". If she hesitates, diffuse the tension ""Ok, I feel that's a maybe, so maybe we can take it as a no right now and see if that changes at some point"". Just let her know that she can take her time to decide, and that anything that is not an enthusiastic yes is a no. That's what safety is. Final tip for consent, the ""thank you for you no"" method. Whenever you hear someone declining your proposition, look at her in the eyes and say from your heart ""thank you for your no"". Why ? Because saying no is hard. Many girls are afraid to say no to guys because they don't want to hurt their feeling, they don't them to be frustrated, they don't want to argue. By saying that you put value on her being able to say what is right for her and affirming her boundaries. That's also great for you because you don't want anyone to do something with you they don't want to do, right ? I can't overstate how powerful it is and how I have seen some girls completely drop all their mental barriers after hearing that. Of course you have to really mean it, if you ask again 3 minutes later or if you show frustration, it doesn't do any good ;) Another way to build safety is to have emotional and vulnerable discussion. The question ""how do you feel ?"" (and NOT ""are you okay ?"") is your best friend. You can ask it at any moment about anything. Go deep, don't stay on the surface. Learn to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is the most attractive trait in a human being. Scientific experiences have been made that show that we connect through our vulnerabilities (look at ""the power of vulnerability"" Ted Talk if you haven't already). The more you'll be able to talk about your emotions, your fears, your struggles, your emotional wounds, even your relationship to your parents, the more quickly you will build a deep sense of connection and security. Whatever is shared, especially if that's something emotional, welcome it and don't judge it. Listen attentively, and thank her for being herself in front of you. Most people never hear a thanks for just opening to someone, but that's very courageous. Be willing to show who you are, even the parts you struggle to love, and be open to welcome fully that person. I need to precise something : you're not trying to please her. If you try to please her and agree with everything she says because you fear she will not like you, you will end up in the ""boring zone"" (which is the real name of the friend zone, being friends is great, being boring is not). Be honest and don't try to be liked, just try to integrate that person into your world, to make her feel at home in the interaction with you. Like she would with someone she has known for a long time and feel intimate with. **Step 3 : being in the flow** Ok so now you're able to connect to your body at will and are not intruded by self-judging thoughts. The beautiful person in front of you is completely secure and ready to abandon herself to her sensations. So what should you do ? Nothing. You shouldn't do anything. Don't try to impress her, don't try to ""demonstrate value"", don't try to escalate, and don't try to have sex. Instead, allow yourself to be who you are. Express what goes trough you. Be vulnerable, be authentic. If you feel awkward, say it, the other person probably feels it too. If you are afraid, share it ! If you want to touch her, ask for it. You want to be with her in a more intimate place ? Propose. You don't have anything to say ? Just contemplate the silence. You feel good ? Just say ""I feel good when I'm with you"". Smile if you feel like smiling, let spontaneity express itself through you (but don't ask yourself to be spontaneous !), be present and follow your intuition. Being with the flow means not resisting to anything that life trows at you. She is expressing some negativity ? Don't consider it as a ""shit test"", it's just the expression of some insecurity. Take care of it. Be caring with everyone, but do not care about anything. Caring about someone is being present for that person, it's being deeply committed to make the experience as truthful and meaningful as possible. Caring about something is taking things personally, it's taking a no as a rejection, it's trying to make the person like you, it's putting expectations on what should happen. When you're in the flow, you never know what will happen. This is something that I hear all the time ""wow, I didn't expect us to have sex / to spend the full day together / to feel something so intense / to have so much fun"". Why ? Because I didn't intend for any of those things to happen. I just tried to be present in the moment, listening to my desires and acting on them without expecting anything from the other person. Fulfilment doesn't come from reaching objectives that only generates more objectives. Fulfilment comes from loving the experience no matter what happens and feeling gratitude for being alive right here and right now. Here are a few words I would advise to get rid of because they all put your power on external forces. You're better off without them : * Shit test : No one is testing you. You're yourself, there is nothing to test about that. Some reactions can generate anxiety inside you, and it's fine. Accept it as any emotion, smile, and stay connected to yourself. * Being rejected : you can't be rejected. You're a complete human being, nobody has the power to reject you. But they can decline your propositions. Start conversations with a closed question : ""can I talk to you for a minute ?"", ""Can I sit with you ?"". If you hear a no, just say ""thank you for your no"" and move on. * Cockblock : You can't be cockblocked if you're in the flow. The situation can change, people can interact, but it's not about you. A few days ago I was about to have a threesome when one of the girls' roommate got in the apartment in tears because of a break-up and we spent the evening giving her emotional support. Was I ""cockblocked"" ? No, I just adapted, took the change of situation as an opportunity to bring support to someone and made a deeper connection with three people. Use the word ""opportunity"" instead, it will change your mindset. * Physical type, as in ""I'm not her physical type"" : There is no physical type. Attraction is not about putting people into boxes. When a girl is attracted to you, she is not having a checklist of things you have and don't have, giving you a grade and then telling herself ""hey, that's good enough for me"". That's just mental bullshit. Attraction is about what you feel, what goes in your body. No matter how you look, you can still connect with anyone. You can build excitement, you can have a meaningful moment with no expectation. * League, as is ""she's out of my league"". There is no league. The most attractive guy I know is very average-looking. He's just magnetic, because he loves himself, he connects to his body, he builds the most amazing sense of safety and he is so much in the flow it's like he's synched to the other person. When he listens to you, it's like nobody has ever listened to you before. When he touches you, it's exactly the way you want to be touched. And there is never any pression to go forward or to do anything that is not right for you. The only important thing about appearance is that you love being in that body and you take care of it. The more you practice being in the present moment, the easier it gets. After a while you'll realise that the girls you find the most attractive are also the ones that you connect with the most intensely. Why ? Because once you're not in your head, you will see beauty as something authentic and personal, not ""this girl is pretty because she has nice make-up and good symmetry"". You will go for physical features that appeal to you, that make sense to you. And your intuitive mind knows what is right for you. It was a bit longer than expected, I hope it will help some of you. I can assure you that once you get into that authentic and mindful connection, seduction becomes like a dance. You let your mind go and deeply connect to yourself and the other person. You will see girls having a huge smile whenever they see you, you will have much better sex whenever you want and you will feel love and gratitude in your body and can share that feeling with the world. I wish you all a wonderful journey."

I am recovering from a porn addiction (no porn, no masturbation for 3 months). One of the main triggers for the porn was a sensation of belonging. When viewing attractive women, I get really relaxed overall and just calm. This relaxation then allows for my libido to function. But it is short-sighted. Because after I masturbated, I end up crashing and realizing my isolation and lack of progression. Eventually I start to think that porn watching is similar to meeting real attractive women. I spent all my energy finding more and more porn when I was a teenager and most of my 20s instead of actually engaging with women. Since I have cut out the porn, my sex drive has flatlined. But it is mostly due to visualization caused from removing the influence of porn + masturbation. General touch has increased significantly. I was standing in line and a woman bumped into me and said ""sorry"" gently next to me. I do not know why, but just that touch was really soothing and calming. I then moved out of my parents home but unfortunately I am living a hermit lifestyle. I cannot seem to get past the flatline to go out into the world and socialize. I am mostly stuck inside day after day after day. I do not even really want sex. I just want to feel that comfort of touch with women. I feel that if I can focus on my own self-development, I can attract what I want. However, I have this sensation that I am too old and too far behind. That I have missed the cut off. And that sensation is another ""trigger"" from the porn. But because I have zero references other than porn to my sexual energy, I feel demotivated. What would you suggest to gain experience?"
47,vulnerability,seduction,"I made an animated summary of Models by Mark Manson, notes included",20,dponqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/dponqe/i_made_an_animated_summary_of_models_by_mark/,2019-11-01 01:54:26,"Hi all, I've consumed a lot of attraction/dating material and if I were to suggest one book to any man looking to improve their dating life, it would be Models by Mark Manson. I found embedding the contents of this book into my sub-conscious very useful. I've made a video on it explaining some of the key points, if you'd rather read I've also put some notes together from the book. Let me know what you think! Link to the video: [URL &amp;#x200B; **Non-neediness** *Non-neediness is when a man places a higher priority on his own perception of himself than the perceptions of others* A needy man is inherently unattractive, in dating a needy man will try too hard to impress others, in relationships he will invest more in the other person than himself. Non-neediness is when a man is more invested in himself than others, he is confident in himself and his prospects to act how he wants to act without fear of rejection. Some men over-compensate in an attempt to appear non-needy, in ways such as rehearsing pickup lines, trying too hard to impress women or being over zealous in asserting their alpha male attitude. The theme in Models is Why pretend to be awesome, when you can simply be awesome instead? *Take a moment to considerThat before meeting a woman, instead of worrying whether or not she will like you, you could wonder if you will like her.* &amp;#x200B; **Vulnerability** For Manson, vulnerability means putting yourself in a position where you might get rejected or rebuked, voicing a risky opinion, introducing yourself to strangers, asking a girl out on a date and so on. This shows a man is confident enough to face rejection in the face and say this is who I am, take it or leave it this again shows non-neediness. Vulnerability also means opening up to others about your innermost feelings, insecurities and doubts, as once you do this its easier for others to open up in front of you, building stronger relationships. But its not about sharing sob stories in the hope of getting laid, its about intention, doing the former will avoid in women sussing out that you are just trying to have sex and that its merely another performance. And all performance is neediness. Vulnerability is not something you practice, its a state of mind that is going to allow for a greater emotional connection and conversation with women. Its not what you are saying but the intention behind the words. Be honest with yourself and your life story, and share it! Humans are attracted to each others rough edges anyway. *How attractive you are is based on your lack of neediness. Your non-neediness is based on how vulnerable youre able to make yourself. And how vulnerable youre able to make yourself is based on how honest you are to yourself and others.* &amp;#x200B; **Intention** *What you say doesnt matter, why you say it matters* We dont trust somebody complimenting us unless weve earned it first, it comes off as too needy in terms of trying to win approval. Express honest appreciation of others strengths, ideally something that they are not normally praised for. Say it without expecting anything in return. *You cannot be an attractive and life-changing presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others. You simply cant. You have to be controversial. You have to polarize.* *Develop opinions, about everything. Question yourself to think how do I feel about this? when reading a book, watching a film* Communicate your awareness of any bold or risky move Excuse me, I know this is kind of random but or I know weve just met but You want to make sure that your boldness is fuelled by confidence and not sociopathy. Give yourself permission to be creepy, sometimes awkward situations occur, as long as youre respectful in how you express yourself there should never be a serious problem. *She doesnt want to reject you. She wants you to be that man, shes rooting for you.* Dont get fancy with opening lines, spending 10 minutes thinking of the perfect line is needy. Never approach for any other reason than simply wanting to talk, see rejection as a win-win situation (worst case scenario, you save yourself lots of time) Use statements &amp; cold reading instead of ordinary questions, make an assumption about them, youll either get it right or theyll correct you and continue the conversation. Be open about yourself Get her to be open about herself Relate to each others experiences &amp;#x200B; **Polarisation** *The first step to being more attractive is to see rejection as a means to eliminate women who won't make you happy from your life. It's a blessing, not a curse.* Women you meet can be divided into three categories, neutral, receptive and un-receptive. Women who are unreceptive are not interested in you, this could be for multiple reasons, forget them and move on. Neutral women havent decided whether they are interested in you or not yet, women typically dont stay in the neutral area and either become receptive or un-receptive. The goal with neutral women is to polarise them so that they make a decision on whether they like you or not. This may mean flirting with them, teasing them, asking them out on a date, or smiling at them from across the room. Receptive women will reciprocate your advances and are already interested in you. *The Friend Zone typically occurs when a man meets a Receptive or Neutral woman but never makes a move or expresses his interest. Instead, he behaves pleasantly, like a good friend would. In his mind, this is great because it means she likes talking to him, laughs at his jokes, etc. But because hes withholding his sexual interest, hes placing himself in her mind firmly in the friend camp.* *The percentage of women who are Receptive to you will increase proportionally to the quality of your lifestyle, your social status, and your looks. The percentage of women that youre able to move from Neutral to Receptive will be proportional to how good your game is, or how well youre able to communicate and express yourself with women. And your ability to sort through each type of women and meet as many as possible will be determined by how fearless and bold you are when it comes to meeting women.* The **THREE FUNDAMENTALS** 1. Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle. 2. Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality. 3. Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly."
48,vulnerability,seduction,"I feel like for my personality, the typical methods of approaching aren't going to work so well. Would spending more time scouting for girls that are more likely to connect with my vibes better than approaching randoms?",1,d4enkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/d4enkl/i_feel_like_for_my_personality_the_typical/,2019-09-15 12:21:54,"I can spark up conversations with just about anyone but I'm trash at connecting &amp; maintaining conversation or keeping frame with most people unless I'm being fake af, and that's hard af to maintain even in the short-term beside a casual greeting and brief small talk. So, I can be the life of the party in the first few hours when I'm meeting people and can even create new friend groups and lead for a while, by using the same script (ex. where are you from, I like your style, it's so cold out, i'm excited for tonight, man this \_\_\_\_ is soo, or talking about something random and going on a tangent about it), but then I fade out in group conversations because we're not on the same frequency. I'm very confident from first hand experience to say that it's literally like we're wired differently. For reference, I'm INTP and I have strong reason to believe (from life experience and actually going out and experimenting, not just theory) that I'm hardwired to connect better to certain subsets of people which aren't in the majority. I know this because the only time I'm ever able to more easily maintain frame is when I resonate with the other person or if they're wayy more introverted than me. This applies to both girls and guys. I feel like there's a specific niche subset of girls who I could be skilled with and can resonate with to create attraction and sexual tension but its prob like 10-20% of girls at best. And this isn't considering other aspects that we might find different/unattractive or availability. The girls who tend to be shy around me also tend to put me in a weird place to approach because they tend to be REALLY vulnerable introverts who can be read easily. So then I feel like a creep because its like having a slave/follower if I actually do get to know them because they tend to be trash at setting boundaries. Think of a 6ft guy and a 5'5 girl whos super shy in an obvious way, maybe a year or two younger, super innocent, and just says yes to everything, and EVERYONE else can see that too (it's not like she's only innocent when you're alone, they're just an innocent being). I feel weird taking advantage of that because i'm not growing as a person by being with them, and id just be taking advantage of vulnerability. This isn't just in my head either because i'm sure other people would also be able to pick up on the dynamic and be grossed out. I also sometimes feel the same way about others who do this. Anyways, I'm not going to act like I've done 1000 approaches, but so far, other than getting some numbers &amp; a few texts, things die off after that. Ill admit that I tend to approach HB6-8 girls, but no success so far. I tend to be a bit nervous but still follow through &amp; show interest subtly &amp; keep eye contact. I could care less about the specific girls themselves, but its still humiliating when shit like this happens, outcome indepence or not. I got a girls' number (HB8) who I indirectly complimented by asking for fashion advice &amp; got her number &amp; we spoke for a bit &amp; connected on being of the same nationality. Shes one of those ""basic but classy"" finance girls. I set a time &amp; place to meet up for coffee, then she says she can't on that day and instead to meet the same day on campus. We agree, then 2h before she says sorry and that shes not going to campus anymore and that she'll make up for it. I got the message clearly but left things open and just said ""allright, let me know when you're free"". It turns out while walking on campus that same day at night, I bump into her. I was so caught off-guard that I said ""hey"" in a high-pitched voice &amp; kept walking. I could care less about the girl, but it shows that I have a weak frame &amp; my immediate reaction is to people please when I'm caught off-guard rather than to stand my ground. I could have easily made a joke about her excuse in a light-hearted way then walked off, regardless of whether I was subtly rejected or not. It made me learn that my frame is still weak. I then bump into the girl again the next day at the library &amp; at this point I was just neutral af because i wasn't in the mood, nor did I have the energy to pretend to please anyone so i was just expressionless and its like she seemed surprised because she expected me to be nervous or something. There's also the weirdness of them thinking the guy would get salty about rejection or stalk them but honestly fuck catering to other peoples' worries. I've realized that that's on them. I'm just doing me. The few times I've ever managed to have girls fawn over me was when I was my unfiltered nerdy self doing my own thing (back in HS) and the girls themselves approached me, and it was VERY niche &amp; I somehow fucked up all those opportunities a long time ago so I no longer have a frame of reference for what a good relationship for my type would be like. So now its like, fuck. I know for a fact that I'm not going to resonate with most basic bitches. Fuck getting a snapchat or insta too because that shit is toxic af and kills your self-growth and self-respect. Honestly, I wouldn't enjoy being around those types for long either, but it'd still be a good learning experience I feel. I know how you have to communicate value to the other person, and being with someone superficial means catering to their desires in some sense. Being my authentic self won't work with most chicks when i'm approaching because my eyes only light up when i'm geeking out. I can't free flow with most chicks because we wouldn't resonate. Which is fine, you know ""outcome independence"" and all. But if you're just trying to get a quick lay, it kills things. Faking it will only go so far and when i'm being inauthentic, it also kills my frame. **How would you guys suggest dealing with this? Should I keep approaching randoms &amp; build a mask &amp; nerves of steel even if i mostly don't resonate with them? Or do I scout for receptive girls who would be into the ""real me"" who tends to geek out and becomes really social when that happens (which is much less likely to happen at parties/clubs, and will possibly take longer to get sexual)?** I dance at parties and give no fucks &amp; last week I even ended up dancing with a random group of girls who were receptive to the lack of giving of a fuck but from there its like I can sense from how the girl dresses if were likely to be receptive once I get their number &amp; we talk a bit. Its just using common sense. I need to get rid of self-defeating viewpoints though, but its hard when you're aware of what is likely to happen from past experience. Especially since im only considered really hot to the girls who can see value in my personality, which tends to have its own quirks (and those girls tend to be geeks too, or just straight up controlling/crazy, it's a toss up). Its fucked too because I can look attractive enough &amp; not come off as a nerd, but I radiate geek aura throughout the day. I trip on myself when I walk sometimes, I tend to zone out or just analyze peoples social bullshit easily, I pause and look off before being able to piece my words sometimes, and i'm forgetful af. Ive also smoked weed for ages &amp; still need help from newbies when I try lighting up a joint. Its like i look like an average somewhat attractive fit dude who could be sporty or involved or w.e, but then i radiate nerdiness. If I was a full-on nerd at least the girls who are into that (&amp; that I tend to connect with it) would be able to find me. But its like i'm a cyborg social chameleon nerd or something. Hard to explain in text. So I've read the theory, tried some approaches, done the events, tried psychedelics for inner game, and am aware of how to detect insecurities, along with the possible ones in this post. But that won't magically make me have a solid frame, or make me able to increase tension with the majority of chicks. So now what?"
49,vulnerability,seduction,[FR] First swingers party,3,d7rc3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/d7rc3c/fr_first_swingers_party/,2019-09-23 00:44:21," Went to a proper swingers party for the first time yesterday at a club in a discrete location downtown. The majority of the women were no younger the 35 years old (with one late twenty something year old). I can say for certain that any kind of sex at a swingers party is the ultimate test for vulnerability and handling of rejection, which makes daygame pale in comparison. It really stings a lot when you having women who approximate your ""ideal"" or ""iconographic archetype"" reject you. Nonetheless I had more sex , an array of ""masculinity issues"" have cropped up to me following on from this occasion and engaged in a sort of routine rendezvous with a timely fantasy of fucking older, mature women who physically fit the archetype of 'mothers' or 'authority figures'. However, a type of feminine archetype that is been recurring in my fantasies lately is the 'the femme fatale' or quasi 'dominatrix archtype. Dark outfits, dark hair (or redhair), tall stature.... there is a kind of 'masculine' femininity to this archetype I am really turned on by the idea of seducing and fucking a woman who is physically bigger than me sort of provokes this sort caustic masculinity in me. Fucking an ""Amazonian"" has a fuck yeah! edge to it. At the party, my mindset automatically regressed into telling myself that I have to meet a very specific masculine archetype to meet such women - be at least 6' in height and have lots of muscle definition. Somehow, I seem pretty convinced ""performing"" the whole James Marshall mindful, meditative, playful vagabond. Nearly all of my successful interactions have involved some degree of imitation of seducers I have observed on YouTube. Yet I need to consolidate those personality traits with my so-called 'intellectual, left-field, profusely creative interests. It seems to me that I need to have some degree of commonality with these women before I bother consider chatting them up. Yet quite possibly I don't physically meet the ""prerequisites"" being 24, 5'7' with a 'slight' but mostly thin build with crazy long hair. A guy, who happened to be husband of these types of women set this insecurity in me by telling me: ""sorry mate, it's not happening. Not taking a shot at you or anything"". Another women (who I wasn't into anyway but was part of a social circle of these types of women) did it again by telling me how unattractive my hand was. I should of probably made a joke out of it by saying ""yeah, I dye my high six times a day."" But hey, I was a first timer and I did get quite a lot of action and was mildly knackered thereafter. It probably pays to do a substantial amount of daygame before going to such parties. My social intelligence was a bit off due to a lack of extensive approaching, have been preoccupied with studies and pet projects I am aiming to get of the ground."
50,vulnerability,seduction,What Most Men Need to Realize About Seduction and Human Interaction in General,13,deay3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/deay3k/what_most_men_need_to_realize_about_seduction_and/,2019-10-07 10:04:35,"Hey guys, just thought I'd write this post for those of you that have trouble/anxiety over small interactions that may be confusing or frustrating to figure out. You might be stuck wondering why a girl didn't respond the way you thought she would or why she treated you differently or why something you were absolutely sure would work ended up making you look bad in the end. Whatever the reason, we can all agree that stressing over it is not worth our time. You're on this sub to learn seduction, not to get over rejection. Here's an easy way to judge each individual interaction you have and figure out if it's worth your time or not, and how to go from there. This post will also strengthen your interpersonal skills in general, and help you get along with /alpha male everyone. I see a lot of people on here saying ""If she didn't do this then she's not interested"", or ""She would've texted you back sooner if she wanted to, move on"". The problem with a lot of these statements is that they are phrased like it's ONE WAY or ANOTHER. The truth is, they're almost always pure speculation because in reality there's no way to know exactly what went on in her head and why she did what she did. Thankfully it's easy to figure out her intentions by simply paying attention to how she acts and what she says, or even just talking to her. Even if she was completely uninterested in you, there are ways to change her perception of you for better or for worse. You just have to know how. People are attracted to whatever pleases them. That sounds simple but that's really all you need to know. I'll give you an example: Imagine you are pursuing this girl, she's shown signs of interest (at least you thought she did) and you're wondering where to go from there, she may be showing mixed signals and making it a little harder to make the next move. The first thing you need to do is look at the context, keep in mind how you guys met and the first impression that you guys made on each other. This is all relevant and factors into the way that you guys will behave towards each other. This largely applies to the setting that you meet them in, this sub is mainly tailored towards adults that might meet someone in a casual setting like a bar or at a party, where people go with the intention of meeting others and having a drink or two. On the flip side, you may meet them in school where you're forced to see them on a regular basis, whether you like it or not. Whatever the context, you should keep it in mind while talking to them because it'll make your conversations go smoother. Everyone gives a chance, it's just the chance varies from person to person. Some are nicer than others. The key here is to treat them as if they don't affect you, you need to appear fine no matter how they act towards you. People feed off of reactions and how you respond. Lots of girls are used to this and may put up an initial front because they are used to having many options, the truth is that every human craves attention of some sort. And by not giving them the attention that they're used to getting, you automatically shift the dynamic so that they're now aware of you and expecting something from you. You already have the upper hand, and you now have tension built up to make your next move with. For instance, you you can increase the tension by talking to them like usual and acting like nothing has changed. It'll be frustrating to them because you're not doing anything wrong, but the energy has shifted. This will leave them wanting validation and wanting to talk to you. You have to be careful with the kind of person you do this to though, because the higher their ego is, the less their attention span for you will be. Not giving people attention is frustrating for all and can be embarrassing, so it's not uncommon for them to snap back and try to shift the dynamic back. Everyone wants validation. You can easily gain the upper hand by acting like you don't want validation, which can throw someone for a loop and make you stand out right off the bat. Depending on what you want to do with the person, the key is to keep a balance of being desirable while still treating them the way they deserve to be treated and ensuring that thing's between you are as equal as they can be. Anyways, here's where you can choose to keep your calm, play it cool, and keep the dynamic in your favor (&lt;&lt;---successfully flirting in a nutshell) Or you can bring the dynamic back into a playful back and forth and acknowledge their snapback so that you can ease the tension while playfully keeping the upper hand (&lt;&lt;---being humble but sharp). You'll start to notice that you can do pretty much whatever you want with the dynamic that between you and that person, and that different people admire different qualities. Virtuous traits like humility, honesty, sincerity, and vulnerability will always go a long way. Other people have walls built up that may prevent them from caring about those, others just want someone to spend time with .The same formula isn't always gonna work on them every time, regardless of if they might give off that appearance. If you're gonna only pay attention to one thing I say, listen to this. The only 100% FOOLPROOF method to winning someone over every time, is to adapt to them and THEIR PREFERENCES. This involves personality mirroring, figuring out their wants and needs, what's good for them, and probably the most important of them all is to always treat them with respect and/or as an equal (again depending on the person and what you're trying to achieve with them), and last but not least to make sure you stay relevant to them (this includes loyalty, everyone values that). A person is going to naturally align themselves with people that put out the same kind of energy with them, so make sure not to switch up on them, because they will take notice. Sometimes it can happen without you even knowing. You also want to make sure not to completely give in to them and do whatever they want, because that's not healthy and it defeats the entire purpose of the relationship/seducing in the first place. This post was just to get some of my thoughts out and address something that I think needed to be said and that everyone in the sub can benefit from, hopefully this helps you out there to figure out what to do in your own lives. I left out a lot of information that's still relevant to what I'm saying, feel free to ask or comment below on something that you want clarification on or something you'd like me to go more in-depth on. I wish all of you the best."

I feel like they should be flattered and politely refuse if they aren't interested.

I always want to talk shit to them but I've gotten in trouble before so I just walk away."
52,vulnerability,seduction,The Seducer's Handbook.,64,cw3acs,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cw3acs/the_seducers_handbook/,2019-08-27 21:46:27,"I've been on this sub for a while now, and I'd like to share and validate with my fellow Seducer's on things that should be known about the whole seduction game. Feel free to read on, hopefully some insight would be shared where maybe some of us could add some knowledge to our own game. I'd like to point out that when I refer to the word ""*victim*"" I do not in the slightest mean to degrade anyone into an object, instead it just adds thrill to the whole game, so please don't take that word with a serious attitude. *Allow me to begin.* **Seduction** is Latin for ""lead astray"" where you want someone to be lead into a direction you already have set for them. Ever since we were children, we all yearned to be seduced, we all wanted someone to do things for us and lead us into experiences. We've all played Seducers at a young age with our parents and friends where we constantly had to play into receiving love, affection, and attention from those we want it from the most. Recall the days where you'd do something in hopes of receiving something. This is early seduction, but with time it's important to work off of what you already started with, and assume yourself a position in what you want to achieve. By that, I mean get better at playing your cards and working off of what you feel comfortable with most. We're all seen the ""~~F\*ckboys~~"" and ""~~Fishlips~~"", but we all yearn to understand them. Hence why you are even on this sub to begin with. I'd like to separate what I'm about to say next into 2 major parts. The first part being about ***yourself*** as an individual, and the second part being about the ***person you are trying to seduce.*** (You can skip the self part if you're sure of yourself, but Id like us all to agree in these sets of things, so please read on incase you believe I didn't touch on something properly!) # Part 1; Yourself: First of all, I NEED to ask you one question, and you MUST have an answer to it. I'm not expecting anyone to comment their answer, I just want you to be comfortable with yourself. You have to be comfortable with yourself otherwise you're *just projecting what you feel onto the person you are trying to seduce and you'll end up coming out as ""needy"".* ***What do you want?*** As broad as it sounds, it's up to you to put the pieces together. If you don't know how to answer this, I'll give you an example about myself. ""I want to finish my university degree, I want to master my hobbies, I want to learn how to cook, I want to......) All these things help you in taking up your time and letting life happen. Instead of doing nothing all day, allow yourself to get to know yourself better. Experience things you'd like to experience or didn't even know you could experience. It's 2019 for f\*cks sake, just watch something interesting that allows you to gain information, work off and expand your information, or build yourself from that information. (I heard a lot of people love a person who's handy in the kitchen) \--&gt; If you don't do this, how do you expect yourself to even have a personality? You're not a walking vessel, you're your own person who has their own beliefs and traits, doesn't matter where or how you started to think the way that you do, what's important is that you can actually manage a conversation with someone through having your own visions and things to stay and stand for rather than allowing your insecurities out. Girls and guys, please back me up here. How many times have you been out with a person where you feel like you're talking to sack of bricks? In other words, don't be that sack of bricks. People would love to hear about your day and life, just remember to keep your balance and not come out as a douche. Build yourself, even if it means you have to build yourself from scratch. It's all up to you to start bettering yourself and set standards for yourself. The moment you understand what you want, you have to ask yourself: ***How do I get it?*** If it requires work and dedication, then you're in fantastic luck because that's exactly what you need in life! A purpose! If you ever find yourself stuck at home doing nothing all day, take that as a sign of accomplishment rather than grief. ""I CAN DO WHAT I WANT TODAY!!"" (now that you know what you want, DO IT!) We all do things for other people, drop that ""nice person"" act and start caring about yourself. Trust me, it's not at all selfish to want your own wants and needs. Everyone has them anyway, so why should you repress them. Just because you have no one to do something with, that doesn't mean you can't do that something alone! I'll give you an example, the people who sit at Starbucks alone are probably the best ones to talk to. Unless you catch them in the middle of something important, they are people who are comfortable enough to be in public alone and enjoy themselves without the need of other people. They can be surrounded by people, and not have any anxiety towards them. Be your own person, but you can take things from other people's personalities and build them upon how you are comfortable. ""I like how X is so confident, I'd like to be confident too. This is how I would be confident, it's not the same as how X is confident, but it's how I'd like to be confident which is what I like which is important to me if I want it to be."" One last thing I'd like to discuss would be our insecurities. We all have insecurities, some more drastic than others, but you should know that they are all able to be turned down if not overcome. It's not an easy path to fix them, and finding them can be a worse search at times. Just tell yourself that you can do it. It's not in your head, it's not something wrong with you, it's not something that should take control of your life, you can overcome them. With that being said, I'll ask you this: **What makes you feel anxious and in a loss of control?** I'll give some examples:"" Being called out, losing control, looking stupid, being imperfect.."" Those are a couple common insecurities people have. Now that you know what they are, ask yourself this: How can I overcome them, or keep them from springing out in the wrong times? Practice makes perfect. You have social anxiety, find a place that you can sit and be around people, and with time you'll realize you are not out of control instead can be comfortable doing what you want in such situations. NO ONE LOOKS, COUNTS, AND KEEPS TABS on you but yourself. Human beings are selfish. We are all selfish. So keep that in mind every time you f\*ck up, if they throw blows at you, take it with a light heart and throw some banter back. You're out with your friends at a restaurant, and you spill your drink. Friend X:""omg you're such a klutz"" What do you do? *Laugh it off.* Your reply could be that of:""omg you're right I should've been aborted as a child."" Sure that statement of mine was hefty, but through it you show that:"" Yes, I did f\*ck up, but these things happen and it's not that bad"" rather than getting defensive and shook because of it. If you allow someone power over you, they WILL take that power. Humans are power loving wh\*res, whether they show it or not, they strive to be better than the competition, but through showing them that you are above it by seeming unfazed while taking responsibility, you show maturity in the midst of chaos. Keep your chin up, we're all imperfect, and we all f\*ck up, but who cares, right? Okay, so that part is so that you discover yourself. You MUST discover yourself, it's important for you in the long run. I'll be changing the mood of speech here on out, the only person you will ever truly listen to, is yourself. And the only time you will ever take action is upon validation and motivation. I'm sure you know what you could be doing differently, but you just don't want to do it. &amp;#x200B; # Part 2; Your Victim. Listen, I'll be continuing here based off Penetration of mind, and penetration of body which follows. If you're looking for one night stands, bring her home after the party, or get her to do sexual favors for you, all within one night,then you'll need to know and have a deep understanding of the core Seducer's beliefs which will be covered in this part of course. Recall what I asked earlier about what it is that you want. Did you reply to that with 1- ""I want a ^(relationship)"" or 2-:""I wanna get ^(laid)"". Both have a similar path, but one of them stops after sex exclusively. ***Let's begin.*** There are MANY ways you could meet someone knew that you would like to seduce. Whether you meet them through a friend, meet them at a bar, walk up to them in the park, sit next to them in class, they all have 1 major thing in common. *First impressions.* The importance behind this is that it will be used to judge you at first. What you wear, how you get introduced, what you smell like, how the whole start is, all of that has an affect on the person you are meeting. This is where you're charm and alluring personality that is projected through your confidence is sprung. The moral of the story, always take care of yourself because opportunity will happen when you least expect it. Before you approach ANYONE, all people agree upon a psychological reading. You see the person from the distance and work on your approach. You see them reading a book, it suggest A LOT about their character. It hints at what you should work off of more than anything else. They are now your victim. &amp;#x200B; # Who are they? In the game of seduction, you should choose the person you are seducing properly. The game of seduction is only fun when your victim is reacting the way you want them to, likewise you are reacting to their words the way they want you to. They should have an affect on you. People who have a lot of time on their hands are usually the best victims since they have the most mental space that you can fill in for them. The introverts and timid people of society are usually the best to draw out as they are very susceptible to your seductions, the manly man is also one of the best victims as through your seductions you can draw out his insecurities. Likewise the more happy and comfortable someone would have the worse the seduction game for you would be, and whats fun about seducing someone with no imagination. Remember, they should want to bring out that inner desire of yours. What is a game if you're not having fun, right? This becomes a stage of fight for figuring out if the insecurities you draw out from them will have an affect on them. If you can sense a blush here or a sign of vulnerability then consider yourself able to penetrate your victim's mind. &amp;#x200B; # Allow them to feel comfortable around you. Get close to them. Enter their lives appearing as a friend who is not too close to you, yet fascinates you. Never be too direct early on, you risk stirring up a resistance that wont be able to be lowered. At first there must be nothing of the seducer within you, it should come at an angle striking them by surprise. Indirectly aimed at them when they least expect it. Get their attention to stir their desire. Through your friendly conversation you will be able to discover them, know about them. Understand what they like, their background, their tastes, their behavior, their weaknesses. By spending time with them they will become more comfortable with you. Believing you are interested in their company will allow for them to lower their defenses. Once you are able to penetrate close enough, make a sudden move that wouldn't be taken fatefully. A touch here, a rabid comment there. That will make them wonder why you haven't made a move yet sparking them to think they are in control. Nothing more satisfying that making the seduced think they are the ones doing the seducing. The moment they think they are acting off of your accord, they will become resentful. Use the power of indirection as a tool you guard with your life . To make them come to you requires giving them space. Remember, too much attention early on sparks insecurity and gives the target to room for imagination. Let them think about you, wonder about you. # Show them a bit of wrath/confusion. After becoming closer and closer, make it so that you radiate a sense of mystery. Let one side of your personality show, but also send out some sign that you are not what you seem, make it paradoxical. To capture and hold their attention, you need to show attributes that go against your physical appearance, creating depth and mystery. &amp;#x200B; # Never appear to be undesirable. If nobody wants you, then why would anyone want you? Only few are drawn to the people that others don't want. To draw your victim closer, you must create an aura of desirability. Let them see that you are wanted, even by the most different of people. If the people who desire you stem from ""that emo kid"" to ""the popular kid"" then just imagine what that makes you come out to be. It will shrink them in their vanity for them not to be desired by you. There is a saying that goes:""If you want the girl to like you, go after her sister."" Same thing for men of course. Through creating love triangles, this forcefully triggers the:""I want them, why are they having them?"". Through raising your own value, your become desired. &amp;#x200B; # Let them see something you have that they don't. A perfectly satisfied person can't be seduced, remember that. Show them their life, through your eyes. Allow them to see that they are missing something in it, be it adventure, romance, thrill, spirituality, the list goes on and on.. And show them that you can fill that void. We all mask our true selves in society. We prefer to be more sure of ourselves, but when someone comes crushing our wall down showing us that they see through the mask, they will squirm. We begin to self doubt, and that is when the seducer steps in. Creating a need thus making us want to possess them more. &amp;#x200B; # Insinuation. I hope everyone knows what this is on a spiritual level. This, is probably one of the most useful tools. The way to make someone realize what they lack and find that within you, is through insinuation. It's a sublanguage mean only to penetrate the unconscious mind that would awaken an idea allowing it to sprout in the user's mind. You plant a seed of thought with a bit of self doubt in your victim's brain and allow it to bloom on it's own making the person think it's their own idea. Class A manipulation at it's finest, I guess. An example would be: ""Oh, you're not fun. jk, but you know"". ""You could just let loose once in a while"", ""Don't you have a sense of adventure?"", these put into bedtime talk in a jokingfully suggestive manner will help plant your seed. (You know, the casual resentful sentences and slips of the tongue) &amp;#x200B; # Become one with them. Most of us are locked in our own world, so for you to draw someone out of it, is to enter it, and slowly alter it. BY hypnotizing your victim by the mirroring presence you have, they will open up becoming vulnerable to your influence. Of all the seductive things to do, entering their spirit is the most devilish of all as it gives the victim the feeling that they are seducing you into becoming them. The feeling of them thinking you are under their spell. Remember, we're all narcissistic, so they will love you through themselves in you. # Make them see a glimpse of the pleasures to come. Find their insecurities, and strike them with thought of taking them there. Stimulate the curiosity and work off of their desire to reach the goal that you have set yourself in the middle of. The weakness portrayed are signals for you to get there and provide them a chase. Any sign of repression is your queue on hitting them with it and keep them tempted for more. Lust, if you would say. &amp;#x200B; I'm gonna stop here for now. There is a lot more to be said, and if you like this one I guess I could continue with a part 2 later, but for now I've written too much and need to get some work done."

They can be surrounded by people, and not have any anxiety towards them. &amp;#x200B; Be your own person, but you can take things from other people's personalities and build them upon how you are comfortable. &amp;#x200B; ""I like how X is so confident, I'd like to be confident too. This is how I would be confident, it's not the same as how X is confident, but it's how I'd like to be confident which is what I like which is important to me if I want it to be."" &amp;#x200B; One last thing I'd like to discuss would be our insecurities. We all have insecurities, some more drastic than others, but you should know that they are all able to be turned down if not overcome. It's not an easy path to fix them, and finding them can be a worse search at times. &amp;#x200B; Just tell yourself that you can do it. It's not in your head, it's not something wrong with you, it's not something that should take control of your life, you can overcome them. &amp;#x200B; With that being said, I'll ask you this: &amp;#x200B; What makes you feel anxious and in a loss of control? &amp;#x200B; I'll give some examples:"" Being called out, losing control, looking stupid, being imperfect.."" Those are a couple common insecurities people have. &amp;#x200B; Now that you know what they are, ask yourself this: &amp;#x200B; How can I overcome them, or keep them from springing out in the wrong times? &amp;#x200B; Practice makes perfect. You have social anxiety, find a place that you can sit and be around people, and with time you'll realize you are not out of control instead can be comfortable doing what you want in such situations. &amp;#x200B; NO ONE LOOKS, COUNTS, AND KEEPS TABS on you but yourself. &amp;#x200B; Human beings are selfish. We are all selfish. So keep that in mind every time you f\*ck up, if they throw blows at you, take it with a light heart and throw some banter back. &amp;#x200B; You're out with your friends at a restaurant, and you spill your drink. &amp;#x200B; Friend X:""omg you're such a klutz"" &amp;#x200B; What do you do? &amp;#x200B; ***Laugh it off.*** &amp;#x200B; Your reply could be that of:""omg you're right I should've been aborted as a child."" &amp;#x200B; Sure that statement of mine was hefty, but through it you show that:"" Yes, I did f\*ck up, but these things happen and it's not that bad"" rather than getting defensive and shook because of it. &amp;#x200B; If you allow someone power over you, they WILL take that power. Humans are power loving wh\*res, whether they show it or not, they strive to be better than the competition, but through showing them that you are above it by seeming unfazed while taking responsibility, you show maturity in the midst of chaos. Keep your chin up, we're all imperfect, and we all f\*ck up, but who cares, right? &amp;#x200B; Okay, so that part is so that you discover yourself. You MUST discover yourself, it's important for you in the long run. &amp;#x200B; I'll be changing the mood of speech here on out, the only person you will ever truly listen to, is yourself. And the only time you will ever take action is upon validation and motivation. I'm sure you know what you could be doing differently, but you just don't want to do it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Part 2; Your Spouse. Listen, I'll be continuing here based off Penetration of mind, and penetration of body which follows. If you're looking for one night stands, bring her home after the party, or get her to do sexual favors for you, all within one night,then you'll need to know and have a deep understanding of the core Seducer's beliefs which will be covered in this part of course. &amp;#x200B; Recall what I asked earlier about what it is that you want. Did you reply to that with &amp;#x200B; 1- ""I want a relationship"" &amp;#x200B; or &amp;#x200B; 2-:""I wanna get laid"". &amp;#x200B; Both have a similar path, but one of them stops after sex exclusively. &amp;#x200B; Let's begin. &amp;#x200B; There are MANY ways you could meet someone knew that you would like to seduce. Whether you meet them through a friend, meet them at a bar, walk up to them in the park, sit next to them in class, they all have 1 major thing in common. &amp;#x200B; First impressions. The importance behind this is that it will be used to judge you at first. What you wear, how you get introduced, what you smell like, how the whole start is, all of that has an affect on the person you are meeting. This is where you're charm and alluring personality that is projected through your confidence is sprung. The moral of the story, always take care of yourself because opportunity will happen when you least expect it. &amp;#x200B; Before you approach ANYONE, all people agree upon a psychological reading. You see the person from the distance and work on your approach. You see them reading a book, it suggest A LOT about their character. It hints at what you should work off of more than anything else. They are now your Spouse. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Who are they? In the game of seduction, you should choose the person you are seducing properly. The game of seduction is only fun when your Spouse is reacting the way you want them to, likewise you are reacting to their words the way they want you to. They should have an affect on you. People who have a lot of time on their hands are usually the best Spouse since they have the most mental space that you can fill in for them. The introverts and timid people of society are usually the best to draw out as they are very susceptible to your seductions, the manly man is also one of the best Spouses as through your seductions you can draw out his insecurities. Likewise the more happy and comfortable someone would have the worse the seduction game for you would be, and whats fun about seducing someone with no imagination. Remember, they should want to bring out that inner desire of yours. What is a game if you're not having fun, right? &amp;#x200B; This becomes a stage of fight for figuring out if the insecurities you draw out from them will have an affect on them. If you can sense a blush here or a sign of vulnerability then consider yourself able to penetrate your Spouse's mind. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Allow them to feel comfortable around you. Get close to them. Enter their lives appearing as a friend who is not too close to you, yet fascinates you. Never be too direct early on, you risk stirring up a resistance that wont be able to be lowered. At first there must be nothing of the seducer within you, it should come at an angle striking them by surprise. Indirectly aimed at them when they least expect it. Get their attention to stir their desire. Through your friendly conversation you will be able to discover them, know about them. Understand what they like, their background, their tastes, their behavior, their weaknesses. By spending time with them they will become more comfortable with you. Believing you are interested in their company will allow for them to lower their defenses. Once you are able to penetrate close enough, make a sudden move that wouldn't be taken fatefully. A touch here, a rabid comment there. That will make them wonder why you haven't made a move yet sparking them to think they are in control. Nothing more satisfying that making the seduced think they are the ones doing the seducing. The moment they think they are acting off of your accord, they will become resentful. Use the power of indirection as a tool you guard with your life . To make them come to you requires giving them space. Remember, too much attention early on sparks insecurity and gives the target to room for imagination. Let them think about you, wonder about you. &amp;#x200B; # Show them a bit of wrath/confusion. After becoming closer and closer, make it so that you radiate a sense of mystery. Let one side of your personality show, but also send out some sign that you are not what you seem, make it paradoxical. &amp;#x200B; To capture and hold their attention, you need to show attributes that go against your physical appearance, creating depth and mystery. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Never appear to be undesirable. If nobody wants you, then why would anyone want you? Only few are drawn to the people that others don't want. To draw your Spouse closer, you must create an aura of desirability. Let them see that you are wanted, even by the most different of people. If the people who desire you stem from ""that emo kid"" to ""the popular kid"" then just imagine what that makes you come out to be. It will shrink them in their vanity for them not to be desired by you. There is a saying that goes:""If you want the girl to like you, go after her sister."" Same thing for men of course. Through creating love triangles, this forcefully triggers the:""I want them, why are they having them?"". Through raising your own value, your become desired. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Let them see something you have that they don't. A perfectly satisfied person can't be seduced, remember that. Show them their life, through your eyes. Allow them to see that they are missing something in it, be it adventure, romance, thrill, spirituality, the list goes on and on.. And show them that you can fill that void. We all mask our true selves in society. We prefer to be more sure of ourselves, but when someone comes crushing our wall down showing us that they see through the mask, they will squirm. We begin to self doubt, and that is when the seducer steps in. Creating a need thus making us want to possess them more. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Insinuation. I hope everyone knows what this is on a spiritual level. This, is probably one of the most useful tools. The way to make someone realize what they lack and find that within you, is through insinuation. It's a sub language mean only to penetrate the unconscious mind that would awaken an idea allowing it to sprout in the user's mind. You plant a seed of thought with a bit of self doubt in your Spouse's brain and allow it to bloom on it's own making the person think it's their own idea. Class A manipulation at it's finest, I guess. An example would be: ""Oh, you're not fun. jk, but you know"". ""You could just let loose once in a while"", ""Don't you have a sense of adventure?"", these put into bedtime talk in a joking-fully suggestive manner will help plant your seed. (You know, the casual resentful sentences and slips of the tongue) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # Become one with them. Most of us are locked in our own world, so for you to draw someone out of it, is to enter it, and slowly alter it. BY hypnotizing your Spouse by the mirroring presence you have, they will open up becoming vulnerable to your influence. Of all the seductive things to do, entering their spirit is the most devilish of all as it gives the Spouse the feeling that they are seducing you into becoming them. The feeling of them thinking you are under their spell. Remember, we're all narcissistic, so they will love you through themselves in you. &amp;#x200B; # Make them see a glimpse of the pleasures to come. Find their insecurities, and strike them with thought of taking them there. Stimulate the curiosity and work off of their desire to reach the goal that you have set yourself in the middle of. The weakness portrayed are signals for you to get there and provide them a chase. Any sign of repression is your queue on hitting them with it and keep them tempted for more. Lust, if you would say. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I'll be posting Part 2 within the next days. (If anyone is interested of-course)"
54,vulnerability,seduction,The way of a romantic artist,1,czcr5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/czcr5t/the_way_of_a_romantic_artist/,2019-09-04 09:34:40,"What is the secret of attraction? It is well and good to talk about a magnetic personality, but what does that mean, really? What makes a man irresistible to women? What qualities cause women to fantasize about a man? What is the essence of charm? Why do men like Casanova still fascinate us today? Why do women always gravitate toward certain types of men, inviting them willingly into their lives, their arms, and their dreams? Is it looks, power, money? We have this notion that all men who are successful with women must have something going for them that the average man does not. Well, that notion is correct. However, contrary to everything we have been led to believe, it is not looks, power, or money. These are the things most men concentrate onan accumulation of externalities, so to speak. And why not? A man with power and money will be surrounded by women, of course. Is that success? Perhaps. Is he loved? Ah, who knows? Maybe he is. All we know for certain is that men spend their lives trying to increase their personal power, thus increasing their influence, thus increasing their perceived value to others, thus believing that all this will make them appear more lovable to women. This is not new; it is a simple concept that we all understand. But is there something else? Yes, my love, there is. If you press me for an answer, I will say this: the kind of men that women universally adore possess an inimitable love of life, a sense of aliveness, an irrepressible audacity, and an overwhelming sense of fun. And more than anything else, they possess a supreme and ever-abiding love and admiration for women. There is something magical about the heart of a man who loves himself, loves love, loves life itself. There is a surging rush of curiosity and wonder and mystery in his every step. His is a life poetic, filled with the spirit of elegance and gratitude. The words are light on the page, a lightness and ease, a welcomed breeze about the whole experience. All women and all men are drawn to him, for he is a man of conviction, of honor, of purpose. And this sets him apart, miles apart, from other men. He is labelled by all, in hushed tones and with a modicum of envy, as a natural. Why is it that we can get phone numbers, but you get women who love you *forever*? I will say it again: *men who love women are loved by women*. Men who love women are hymned far and wide, adored and doted on by women. Men who love women view the world with different eyes. Men who love women smile and wink at all the girls, for they possess a secret, a secret of the universe. A lover of women is a lover of life. Thats just the way it is. It might be possible to love life without a love of women, but it is not possible to be a lover of women without a love of life. Its like spelling. People who are not good at spelling may or may not be intelligent, but people who are good at spelling are *always* intelligent. All men who love women have the same way of looking at the world. They all have the same traits, and these traits have been constant throughout all of time. What is interesting is that other men have *none* of these traits. A man either has all of them or none. Many have tried to unravel the tapestry of men, but no one has ever managed to successfully tease out the threads that belong exclusively to the lovers of women. I shall try. There are plenty of men who possess a certain facility with women, but those who possess a masterful understanding of women, and the hidden arts of love, are exceedingly rare. In all my years, I have met exactly two. These two men, from entirely different backgrounds, have the greatest facility with women Ive ever seena smoldering understanding, an intuition approaching my own. Theirs is a life of abundance, an abundance of women, the kind of life that men everywhere dream of every day. Women can tell in an instant who has women in their life and who does not. So can I. Game recognizes game, as they say, and these men well, I recognized them immediately. A knowing nod, a clear-eyed assessment, a shaking of hands as peers. I get it, you get it, we both get it. Yes, indeed. Behold, a brother-in-arms before me. One is European and has spent his life traversing the world as a high-paid escort for lonely women of means. The life of a gigolo. Now then, although one might bridle at the morality of his chosen profession, one cannot deny that his years of practice in making women of all ages and sizes feel special and beautiful, of sitting and listening to them and their stories, and of touching them in caring ways they have never known, would tend to make him highly attuned to the majestic symphony of the female spirit. Which is my only point. The other man is a fellow Canadian. Women hover around him like a rock star, and it is phenomenal to behold. Oh, and he isnt a rock star. He drives a city bus. The bus driver. And yet he has a quietly seismic effect on women. They adore him. They give him everything. They take care of him. They defend him. They seek him out and miss him when he is not around. They bring all their girlfriends around to meet him. Mothers tend to jokingly keep their daughters away from him, but love him just the same. He is magnanimous and inviting to all around, generous to a fault, kind and gracious. Above all, he is highly, highly sexually charged, concupiscent to the core. Everything he says to women, young and old, is a manifestation of his virility. He is here to lay waste to all the land, scorched earth, all or nothing. Everything out of his mouth and everything he does informs the world around him of only one thing: I am here to bend you over, if you desire it. And you will love it. And yet every woman who meets him feels thoroughly safe and protected in his presence, like he is a magnificent, well-fed lion, calmly protecting a little gazelle from harm. This man will be surrounded by women until the day he dies. In the presence of these men, something is invoked in the hearts of women, something placid, something ancient, a direct summons to the brightest aspects of female nature. These men command attention from womenin every connotation of the wordand women rush to comply. \*\* Here is a sublime secret of the ages, the secret of men whom women eternally love: They are father figures and little boyssimultaneously! There you go. Ive never heard anyone say that before, but I am convinced it is true. Leadership and vulnerability, a lightning combination that is utterly impossible for women to resist. It is the greatest strength of these men, their triumph, the defining characteristic that sweeps all other men unceremoniously into a corner forever. Because they are simultaneously father figures and little boys, these men are the only ones that can reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable duality of the nature of women: the madonna and the whore. They appeal to *both* sides of the feminine mystique. A woman wants to be put in her place by a leader and, at the same time, she wants to take care of him immensely. She wants him to stand guard at the mouth of the cave, fire-torch in hand, majestic and defiant against the elements in one moment, then crawl into her lap like a kitten the next. Do you understand the impact of this, my love? The broad-spectrum, dual nature of these men is an overwhelming notion for a woman, a shattering, unprecedented, thoroughly welcomed assault on her senses and her heart. Oh, what possibilities, what profound and boundless enlightenment this is for her, for him! When a woman enters into the presence of a man who embodies both the indomitable spirit of a warrior and the inimitable spirit of a child, she will respond to him with her entire being, her entire body, her entire life. She will *never* leave it. She will love this man forever. It is a perfect balance, a tightrope they traverse with ease. The leader side of them is never aggressive or controlling; it is firm and in command. And the boyish side of them is never mewling or pitiable; it is playful and beaming and in need of a bath. These men command attention in pleasing ways. Given the right circumstances, they can get *any* woman into bed. Never by coercion or convincing or conniving; but by making her feel, with every breath she takes, that she is a true beauty and she is highly desired. Their sexual nature is always direct and on full display, but it is forever accompanied by a gracious generosity and profound respect. They have a knowing about them, charm is ever present, and a graceful escape is always proffered. All sexual aggression is sexual frustration. Women are buffeted by winds that should be directed outward. Men who love women can afford to be extremely sexual because they have no sexual aggression in their soul. There is nothing frantic about them. They are bastions of stillness and grace, but still highly sexual. They are dangerous, yes, but never to her. Simply put, a woman always feels safe in the presence of these men. Women only feel afraid if they think they might lose their ability to choose. Other men, awash in sexual urgency, simply do not have the light touch necessary. They invade women, occupy the land by force, then spend all their time trying to suppress the rebellions and uprisings. They come from a place of frustration: either needy and begging for sex or indignant and demanding it, a hand that is either limp and clammy or an iron fist. Never the requisite velvet glove. What about men who are good-looking, my love? They have an unfair advantage, do they not? Well, maybe they do, but only for a few minutes or so. Ultimately, a mans physical appearance is such a small component of attraction for women that it barely registers. In fact, it doesnt really matter at all. Women are not attracted to men who are good-looking they are attracted to men who are *attractive*. Big difference. A woman is attracted to the way a man chooses to move through life and how he perceives the world around him. She is far more attracted to the way he makes her feel than the way he looks. She is far more turned on by his mind than by his appearance. A mans mind is his greatest, most attractive, most erotic feature. This isnt to say that women dont notice or care about the way a man presents himself or the way he carries himself. The first thing a woman notices about a man are his extremities: his head, his hands, his feet. In other words, his hair, his nails, his shoes. These subtle clues speak volumes to women, for they are indicators of how a man views himself and the world around him. Part of the attraction for a woman is knowing that he finds it important to take care of the little things, to look his best. So yes, it is a wonderful thing for a man to learn how to dress well and how to groom himself well, and he has no excuse whatsoever for not staying in shape. After all, walking is free! These are all great things for a woman to see in a man, and its not only because it makes him more physically attractive to her; it is because it portrays to her mind his sense of self-worth. Which, I suppose, amounts to the same thing. \*\* Some of the most famous lovers in history were, by most accounts, average looking, or even quite ugly. Look at some of the portraits of Casanova, for instance. Or photographs of Jean-Paul Sartre. Not physically attractive at all. But the auras of these men were intoxicating, mesmerizing, breath-taking, to volumes of women. Casanova described it like this, I was not handsome, but I had something better than beautya striking expression which almost always compelled a kind interest in my favor And one writer said of Sartre, Women fell for him because he knew how to explain their soul to them. Even Voltaire said, Give me five minutes to explain away my ugly face, and I can bed the queen of France! Sartre, for example, was renowned for his philosophy but almost more renowned for his prowess with the Parisian ladies. Yet he was, by all accounts and evidenceand by his own admissionnotoriously ugly. One leg was shorter than the other, causing him to lurch when he walked, his eyes were big and loopy, flailing around in random and opposite directions, and he was barely five feet tall. And yet women loved him, desired him, fell at his feet. It was no accident. Sartre deliberately and painstakingly developed his confidence and persona. He looked at his life, realized that he could either wallow forever in his limitations, or he could do something about it. He dreamed for a long time about being adored and desired by women, until finally he made a conscious choice to become just that. Through sheer force of personality and deliberate choice, thats exactly what he did. He became what he always dreamed of being: a ladies man. We have absolutely no excuse. Some guy said to me recently, I feel like Im too short for women to ever be attracted to me. I told him the only thing he was short on was the courage to get out there and put himself into the land of women. Almost everyone can think of a guy they have known who seemingly had nothing going for himnot good-looking, not in shape, no moneyand yet he was constantly surrounded by women. His secret? His assumption that all the girls are *his* girls. \*\* It has been well said that you dont have be impressive you just have to be interesting. So how does a man become interesting to women, my love? By being interested in *them*. Casanova said, Love is three quarters curiosity. Behold! The fundamental ingredient for dynamic interactions and sublime relationships with women: *curiosity*. Curiosity is the wonderment of life. It is the sense of adventure in our soul. It is learning to cultivate profound interest in the journey itself, the learning, the surprises. It is the essential ingredient in every dynamic interaction in life. It is infectious. And it is, in turn, massively attractive to women. Curiosity is underrated. Curiosity is misunderstood. It is not about seeking answers. It is about seeking *mystery*. Always and forever seeking mystery. A great life is one of mystery, not answers. We have this packet of answers in our hand. Now what is the greater mystery? Intelligence is curiosity. It is that and only that. If you are curious, you are intelligent. If you are not curious, you are not intelligent. In fact, politically correct be damned, I will say it straight: A general lack of curiosity is a general lack of intelligence. I will even go so far as to say that a general lack of curiosity is the *worst* of all traits. We are automatically good at what we are truly curious about. The effort of learning is halved. A man who is curious about women, or anything really, is always paying attention, always fully engaged, always learning. While other men are looking for ways to impress women, a curious man is looking for new ways to understand them. Curiosity is alchemy, transforming a pedestrian encounter into a truly engaging experience. It imbues all of our interactions with a sense of ease and delight. It is the only tool a man needs on a date with a woman. It negates any worries about what to say, what to do, how to be. And it is the only thing that will ever keep a relationship alive and interesting. It solves everything. When there is genuine curiosity in an interaction or a relationship, everything will flow. Curiosity is a form of creation. What does it create? Why, curiosity, of course. Curiosity begets curiosity. If all men had a spirit of curiosity, the world would change. Imagine a man who is genuinely curious about his wife and children, excited to gather them around him at the end of the day. Tell me, my loved ones, about your day. Yes, genuine curiosity allows everything to unfold and spread out before us like a picnic on a sunny day beneath a tree. Curiosity is a gift, a gift from a man to the world. It is about him learning to be genuinely interested in a woman. It is about being puzzled, amazed and enchanted by her, this amazing woman sharing this part of his life. He is listening, engaged, and interested. He is fully present with her. He is drawing her forth in return. By sharing himself with her, she will share herself with him. But what if I am not really curious about women? men say. Then *get* curious. You can always find something in any woman to be curious about. Curiosity is a choice. We can all choose to be more curious, more interested, more engaged. When we choose curiosity, choose to view the world with a real sense of wonder and delight, our curiosity deepens and strengthens. Men want a greater experience with women, but all they have to do is look for ways to be curious about women and their lives will change. Women will *adore* them. Even sprinkling their conversations with the phrase, Im curious is immensely powerful. Im curious why did you move to this city? or Im curious about those shoes And then just listen. It sets a beautiful tone for the whole interaction. She will call all her friends and say, Wow, I met a man who really listens! Genuine curiosity is a trait of all great lovers. It is impossible to be truly adored by women without it. True lovers are immensely curious about women, always listening to them, always looking at them with a sense of wonder. True lovers want to know, want to know, *want to know*. Tell me things. Tell me your stories. What do you love? What do you love? I cant even begin to describe how mesmerizing this is to women. Men have this notion that they need to talk about *themselves* in order to be interesting. After all, if they only talk about and listen to her, well, isnt that tantamount to neediness, to supplication, to putting her on a pedestal? Uh, no. Not at all. A true lover never talks about himself when he sits down with a woman. How can he? The truly interesting subject is sitting right there in front of him. Hello, beauty tell me about you. Sometimes a man on a date with a woman will rapid-fire a bunch of inane questions at her, like a persiflage-spewing, polyester-clad salesman, not really listening to her and not really wanting to know. He is only thinking about the next thing he is going to say, and he is waiting for her to stop talking so he can say it. Its all about him, and how he can impress her. He brags about himself, he talks non-stop, slowly burying her with shovelfuls of unremarkable personal information sludge. Yes, and when I lived in Cincinnati and my other car is to the gym three times a week I dont mean to brag but when youre good at it, its actually pretty easy Ah, but thats not curiosity. Thats not being interested or interesting. Thats not real listening. Thats smarmy and invasive. Thats a job interview. Maybe if he can just say enough impressive things about himself, shell hire him. Might as well just hand her his resum. Wheres the fun? Wheres the joy? Who is this delightful girl in front of him? What is interesting about her? What is she passionate about? What does she believe? What does she love? What is the dream? She will match his energy. She will riseor descendto the level of the interaction. She will give back to him exactly what she receives. If he is distracted, distant, dry, platitudinous, monotone, not really paying attention, and sitting stiff, she will respond in the same way. If the conversation is all surface, just a dispassionate exchange of pedestrian information, then so is the whole experience. The time spent with him is mostly uninteresting and devoid of life. But if he is genuinely curious about her, a little more quizzical in tone, posing questions more searching than the general interrogations of others, she will come alive, animated, poised, and focused on him; the whole conversation is elevated. She will be caught up, transformed, in the magical juxtaposition of him and her in that time and space. It seems to men that women never seem to know exactly what men want and need. Its because we never explicitly state our desires. We expect her to just know what we want and then we are frustrated when she doesnt. If men were ever lucid enough to ask why, women would look at them in surprise and say, Well, its because you never asked! Women are marvelous reflectors. They will respond and meet a man exactly where he is at. They will treat him exactly in the way he asks to be treated. Its that simple. It is up to men to create the kind of experiences they want with women. It is up to men to describe to women exactly what they desire from them and exactly how they want it to be. This is the supreme task of men when it comes to women. We teach women how to treat us. Women only give us what we ask for, even if we have no idea we asked for anything at all. \*\* And sometimes no, all the time how do I say this without being misunderstood? Ah, let it be misunderstood, for it is subtle and it is wonderful. When I am talking to a woman, I interrupt her. Constantly. I break her train of thought, her sentences, in mid-phrase, all the time. And she doesnt even notice. Dont get me wrong, my love. I do not interrupt her in order to impose my opinions or to hear my own voice or because I think I have something more interesting to say than her. No, not at all. I interrupt her to clarify, to shape, to enlarge the things she is saying to me. Wait a minute, I will lightly tap her arm, cutting her off in mid-sentence, You said you love to paint more than anything else in this world tell me more about that. Or I will cut her off for fun, just to shift gears a little, taking the conversation somewhere completely different and new. She might be saying, Yes, I moved here to Montreal three years ago and I tap her arm. I smile. I look in her eyes. I love the shape of your lips And straighten suddenly, sitting back in my chair, Sorry, you were saying? Montreal? A wonderful diversion, a digression, a short-circuit across her frontal lobe, or something like that. In a good way. It has the same effect as kissing her suddenly, unexpectedly. It might sound counter-intuitive, but interrupting this beauty before me does not come across to her as rude or offensive. Not at all. Instead, my little innocuous interruptions, my gentle asides, create a natural ebb and flow between us. Interrupting her amplifies the connection, sprinkles magic all around us, and electrifies the air, a palpable frisson. Am I listening to her? Oh yes, my love, I am *really* listening. I am right there before her, hanging on her every word. Because of her, I am omnipresent, omniscient, enchanted. This is listening on a superior plane. It is active listening, interactive listening. It is sharing my experience of listening to her *with* her. Im listening to you, my love, and here is what I am hearing, as if to say. I am asked all the time: What is your method? What do you do or say to women that is different from other men? Ah, well the truth is, it doesnt really matter what I say to women at all. In fact, my method is: there is no method. If pressed, however, I will say that my method is this: *I put invitations into the world, and I leave them out there.* Thats all I do. Putting invitations into the world is the essence and foundation of the way I interact with women, my love. Everything about me is an invitation. Life is a dance and I am inviting her to dance. If she accepts, then I am inviting her to shine. I will not grab her hand, lift it up, and spin her dizzy round and round by force. No, I will lift up her hand and invite her to step into the space between usan invitation to twirl, to be the beauty, to wow the crowd. The important part is that she must step *willingly* into that space. If she accepts my invitation, then I will lead and she will shine. I dont ask for anything. I dont ask if she is free. Or if she would like to go for coffee. Or what she is doing later. Or if she has a boyfriend. I simply invite. A grand invitation. A luscious invitation. I tune into her desires and extend my hand, as it were, in invitation. Always by invitationnever by force, never by controlan invitation devoid of presumption or expectation. I extend an invitation very early in the interaction, sometimes even as my opening line. I always say it with a smile, with delight, and without apology. If I get close to her and everything about her is nicethe way she smiles and the way she smellsthen I invite her to join me. Where? When? How? Is it even possible? I have no idea. I havent even thought that far ahead yet. All I know is that she and I should be together. And this is exactly what I say to her. I lean in close to her and smile, I love your smile. Can you feel that in the air? You and I should be together No, she might say, I have a boyfriend. If this is so, I will bow out gracefully, respectfully, for if she is in love with another, then she is not my girl, now is she? I want her full heart, her full attention, her full ebullient spirit, excited to be with me. Not with *him*. I do not, however, apologize. I had no idea she had a boyfriend. How could I know? I did nothing wrong. I simply spoke my truth, expressing my desire for a pleasing woman whom I encountered, doing my job as a man. Ah, I understand, I will say, I meant no disrespect to you or to him. But of course I would be remiss if I did not say these things to you. Look at you in that dress you, my dear, are absolutely lovely. If she says she has a boyfriend but she signals to me with her eyes or body language (they often do) that she is not happy or not in love or not sure, ah then, that is a different story. My invitation stands. I cant she says. Yes, well, I understand. And youre still invited. Come away, o human child, to the water and the wild intoned the immortal Yeats. Because why not? What else is there? Why not escape into immeasurable, shimmering romance? Why not return for a while to the innocence and passion of our youth? What is the point of a life if we are not living? Look over there, my love. Can you see what I see? Over there beyond the horizon come away with me. \*\* Women are never offended by an honest invitation. I cant count the number of times a woman has stood before me and said, with her voice and her eyes, I cant but thank you. It is so *refreshing* to hear. Yes well, I hear you, sweet girl. I hear exactly what you are saying. You are thanking me for noticing you. You are thanking me for respecting you. You are thanking me for honoring your current relationship. You are thanking me for giving you the gift of desiring you. You are thanking me for presenting myself to you in all the ways that men do not. Yes, we both know that it cant happen between us, and thats okay. Thats not the point anyway, now is it? The beauty of this moment is enough and will suffice. And whats more, you will never forget this moment, will you? That one time when a stranger expressed an honest desire for youwithout presumption, without manipulation, without games, and with full respect. You will go forth from our little encounter floating a little off the ground, shining like an angel of glad tidings and great joy. Because I am simply putting an invitation into the air and leaving it out there, because I am merely stating what I would *like* to happen, because I am not asking for anything, it is not possible to be rejected. Let me say that again: *I never experience a sense of rejection.* A glorious invitation. Take it or leave it. Of course you are invited *look at you*! It makes complete sense to my mind. What you do with the invitation is entirely up to you. The ball is in your court. To live a life in the spirit of invitations is to live the life of a true lover. I have this notion that as long as I stay connected to what I desire in my life, and speak my truth and put invitations into this world, then the right ones will show up. *The ones you love are the ones who love you.* That is a law of the universe. If she accepts my invitation, then she is my girl. If she doesnt, well then, she never was. How perfect is that? We both win either way. There is an alignment, a calmness, an elegance, about the whole thing. If I just stay on my journey, then one day, perhaps, I will look over and notice that someone lovely is walking beside me. I was alone before, and now, because of my spirit of invitation, she is walking beside me. Just like that. There is no need in me to go out and frenetically try to pick up girls or phone numbers. I know where I am going and I have no time to veer in the direction of any woman, no time to try to convince her of anything. If she is my girl, we will find each other in our travels, naturally and easily. Yes, there is a delicious calmness about the whole thing. Thats the way it works."
55,vulnerability,seduction,The way of a Romance Artist,2,czcyn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/czcyn6/the_way_of_a_romance_artist/,2019-09-04 09:52:30,"What is the secret of attraction? It is well and good to talk about a magnetic personality, but what does that mean, really? What makes a man irresistible to women? What qualities cause women to fantasize about a man? What is the essence of charm? Why do men like Casanova still fascinate us today? Why do women always gravitate toward certain types of men, inviting them willingly into their lives, their arms, and their dreams? Is it looks, power, money? We have this notion that all men who are successful with women must have something going for them that the average man does not. Well, that notion is correct. However, contrary to everything we have been led to believe, it is not looks, power, or money. These are the things most men concentrate onan accumulation of externalities, so to speak. And why not? A man with power and money will be surrounded by women, of course. Is that success? Perhaps. Is he loved? Ah, who knows? Maybe he is. All we know for certain is that men spend their lives trying to increase their personal power, thus increasing their influence, thus increasing their perceived value to others, thus believing that all this will make them appear more lovable to women. This is not new; it is a simple concept that we all understand. But is there something else? Yes, my love, there is. If you press me for an answer, I will say this: the kind of men that women universally adore possess an inimitable love of life, a sense of aliveness, an irrepressible audacity, and an overwhelming sense of fun. And more than anything else, they possess a supreme and ever-abiding love and admiration for women. There is something magical about the heart of a man who loves himself, loves love, loves life itself. There is a surging rush of curiosity and wonder and mystery in his every step. His is a life poetic, filled with the spirit of elegance and gratitude. The words are light on the page, a lightness and ease, a welcomed breeze about the whole experience. All women and all men are drawn to him, for he is a man of conviction, of honor, of purpose. And this sets him apart, miles apart, from other men. He is labelled by all, in hushed tones and with a modicum of envy, as a natural. Why is it that we can get phone numbers, but you get women who love you *forever*? I will say it again: *men who love women are loved by women*. Men who love women are hymned far and wide, adored and doted on by women. Men who love women view the world with different eyes. Men who love women smile and wink at all the girls, for they possess a secret, a secret of the universe. A lover of women is a lover of life. Thats just the way it is. It might be possible to love life without a love of women, but it is not possible to be a lover of women without a love of life. Its like spelling. People who are not good at spelling may or may not be intelligent, but people who are good at spelling are *always* intelligent. All men who love women have the same way of looking at the world. They all have the same traits, and these traits have been constant throughout all of time. What is interesting is that other men have *none* of these traits. A man either has all of them or none. Many have tried to unravel the tapestry of men, but no one has ever managed to successfully tease out the threads that belong exclusively to the lovers of women. I shall try. There are plenty of men who possess a certain facility with women, but those who possess a masterful understanding of women, and the hidden arts of love, are exceedingly rare. In all my years, I have met exactly two. These two men, from entirely different backgrounds, have the greatest facility with women Ive ever seena smoldering understanding, an intuition approaching my own. Theirs is a life of abundance, an abundance of women, the kind of life that men everywhere dream of every day. Women can tell in an instant who has women in their life and who does not. So can I. Game recognizes game, as they say, and these men well, I recognized them immediately. A knowing nod, a clear-eyed assessment, a shaking of hands as peers. I get it, you get it, we both get it. Yes, indeed. Behold, a brother-in-arms before me. One is European and has spent his life traversing the world as a high-paid escort for lonely women of means. The life of a gigolo. Now then, although one might bridle at the morality of his chosen profession, one cannot deny that his years of practice in making women of all ages and sizes feel special and beautiful, of sitting and listening to them and their stories, and of touching them in caring ways they have never known, would tend to make him highly attuned to the majestic symphony of the female spirit. Which is my only point. The other man is a fellow Canadian. Women hover around him like a rock star, and it is phenomenal to behold. Oh, and he isnt a rock star. He drives a city bus. The bus driver. And yet he has a quietly seismic effect on women. They adore him. They give him everything. They take care of him. They defend him. They seek him out and miss him when he is not around. They bring all their girlfriends around to meet him. Mothers tend to jokingly keep their daughters away from him, but love him just the same. He is magnanimous and inviting to all around, generous to a fault, kind and gracious. Above all, he is highly, highly sexually charged, concupiscent to the core. Everything he says to women, young and old, is a manifestation of his virility. He is here to lay waste to all the land, scorched earth, all or nothing. Everything out of his mouth and everything he does informs the world around him of only one thing: I am here to bend you over, if you desire it. And you will love it. And yet every woman who meets him feels thoroughly safe and protected in his presence, like he is a magnificent, well-fed lion, calmly protecting a little gazelle from harm. This man will be surrounded by women until the day he dies. In the presence of these men, something is invoked in the hearts of women, something placid, something ancient, a direct summons to the brightest aspects of female nature. These men command attention from womenin every connotation of the wordand women rush to comply. \*\* Here is a sublime secret of the ages, the secret of men whom women eternally love: They are father figures and little boyssimultaneously! There you go. Ive never heard anyone say that before, but I am convinced it is true. Leadership and vulnerability, a lightning combination that is utterly impossible for women to resist. It is the greatest strength of these men, their triumph, the defining characteristic that sweeps all other men unceremoniously into a corner forever. Because they are simultaneously father figures and little boys, these men are the only ones that can reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable duality of the nature of women: the madonna and the whore. They appeal to *both* sides of the feminine mystique. A woman wants to be put in her place by a leader and, at the same time, she wants to take care of him immensely. She wants him to stand guard at the mouth of the cave, fire-torch in hand, majestic and defiant against the elements in one moment, then crawl into her lap like a kitten the next. Do you understand the impact of this, my love? The broad-spectrum, dual nature of these men is an overwhelming notion for a woman, a shattering, unprecedented, thoroughly welcomed assault on her senses and her heart. Oh, what possibilities, what profound and boundless enlightenment this is for her, for him! When a woman enters into the presence of a man who embodies both the indomitable spirit of a warrior and the inimitable spirit of a child, she will respond to him with her entire being, her entire body, her entire life. She will *never* leave it. She will love this man forever. It is a perfect balance, a tightrope they traverse with ease. The leader side of them is never aggressive or controlling; it is firm and in command. And the boyish side of them is never mewling or pitiable; it is playful and beaming and in need of a bath. These men command attention in pleasing ways. Given the right circumstances, they can get *any* woman into bed. Never by coercion or convincing or conniving; but by making her feel, with every breath she takes, that she is a true beauty and she is highly desired. Their sexual nature is always direct and on full display, but it is forever accompanied by a gracious generosity and profound respect. They have a knowing about them, charm is ever present, and a graceful escape is always proffered. All sexual aggression is sexual frustration. Women are buffeted by winds that should be directed outward. Men who love women can afford to be extremely sexual because they have no sexual aggression in their soul. There is nothing frantic about them. They are bastions of stillness and grace, but still highly sexual. They are dangerous, yes, but never to her. Simply put, a woman always feels safe in the presence of these men. Women only feel afraid if they think they might lose their ability to choose. Other men, awash in sexual urgency, simply do not have the light touch necessary. They invade women, occupy the land by force, then spend all their time trying to suppress the rebellions and uprisings. They come from a place of frustration: either needy and begging for sex or indignant and demanding it, a hand that is either limp and clammy or an iron fist. Never the requisite velvet glove. What about men who are good-looking, my love? They have an unfair advantage, do they not? Well, maybe they do, but only for a few minutes or so. Ultimately, a mans physical appearance is such a small component of attraction for women that it barely registers. In fact, it doesnt really matter at all. Women are not attracted to men who are good-looking they are attracted to men who are *attractive*. Big difference. A woman is attracted to the way a man chooses to move through life and how he perceives the world around him. She is far more attracted to the way he makes her feel than the way he looks. She is far more turned on by his mind than by his appearance. A mans mind is his greatest, most attractive, most erotic feature. This isnt to say that women dont notice or care about the way a man presents himself or the way he carries himself. The first thing a woman notices about a man are his extremities: his head, his hands, his feet. In other words, his hair, his nails, his shoes. These subtle clues speak volumes to women, for they are indicators of how a man views himself and the world around him. Part of the attraction for a woman is knowing that he finds it important to take care of the little things, to look his best. So yes, it is a wonderful thing for a man to learn how to dress well and how to groom himself well, and he has no excuse whatsoever for not staying in shape. After all, walking is free! These are all great things for a woman to see in a man, and its not only because it makes him more physically attractive to her; it is because it portrays to her mind his sense of self-worth. Which, I suppose, amounts to the same thing. \*\* Some of the most famous lovers in history were, by most accounts, average looking, or even quite ugly. Look at some of the portraits of Casanova, for instance. Or photographs of Jean-Paul Sartre. Not physically attractive at all. But the auras of these men were intoxicating, mesmerizing, breath-taking, to volumes of women. Casanova described it like this, I was not handsome, but I had something better than beautya striking expression which almost always compelled a kind interest in my favor And one writer said of Sartre, Women fell for him because he knew how to explain their soul to them. Even Voltaire said, Give me five minutes to explain away my ugly face, and I can bed the queen of France! Sartre, for example, was renowned for his philosophy but almost more renowned for his prowess with the Parisian ladies. Yet he was, by all accounts and evidenceand by his own admissionnotoriously ugly. One leg was shorter than the other, causing him to lurch when he walked, his eyes were big and loopy, flailing around in random and opposite directions, and he was barely five feet tall. And yet women loved him, desired him, fell at his feet. It was no accident. Sartre deliberately and painstakingly developed his confidence and persona. He looked at his life, realized that he could either wallow forever in his limitations, or he could do something about it. He dreamed for a long time about being adored and desired by women, until finally he made a conscious choice to become just that. Through sheer force of personality and deliberate choice, thats exactly what he did. He became what he always dreamed of being: a ladies man. We have absolutely no excuse. Some guy said to me recently, I feel like Im too short for women to ever be attracted to me. I told him the only thing he was short on was the courage to get out there and put himself into the land of women. Almost everyone can think of a guy they have known who seemingly had nothing going for himnot good-looking, not in shape, no moneyand yet he was constantly surrounded by women. His secret? His assumption that all the girls are *his* girls. \*\* It has been well said that you dont have be impressive you just have to be interesting. So how does a man become interesting to women, my love? By being interested in *them*. Casanova said, Love is three quarters curiosity. Behold! The fundamental ingredient for dynamic interactions and sublime relationships with women: *curiosity*. Curiosity is the wonderment of life. It is the sense of adventure in our soul. It is learning to cultivate profound interest in the journey itself, the learning, the surprises. It is the essential ingredient in every dynamic interaction in life. It is infectious. And it is, in turn, massively attractive to women. Curiosity is underrated. Curiosity is misunderstood. It is not about seeking answers. It is about seeking *mystery*. Always and forever seeking mystery. A great life is one of mystery, not answers. We have this packet of answers in our hand. Now what is the greater mystery? Intelligence is curiosity. It is that and only that. If you are curious, you are intelligent. If you are not curious, you are not intelligent. In fact, politically correct be damned, I will say it straight: A general lack of curiosity is a general lack of intelligence. I will even go so far as to say that a general lack of curiosity is the *worst* of all traits. We are automatically good at what we are truly curious about. The effort of learning is halved. A man who is curious about women, or anything really, is always paying attention, always fully engaged, always learning. While other men are looking for ways to impress women, a curious man is looking for new ways to understand them. Curiosity is alchemy, transforming a pedestrian encounter into a truly engaging experience. It imbues all of our interactions with a sense of ease and delight. It is the only tool a man needs on a date with a woman. It negates any worries about what to say, what to do, how to be. And it is the only thing that will ever keep a relationship alive and interesting. It solves everything. When there is genuine curiosity in an interaction or a relationship, everything will flow. Curiosity is a form of creation. What does it create? Why, curiosity, of course. Curiosity begets curiosity. If all men had a spirit of curiosity, the world would change. Imagine a man who is genuinely curious about his wife and children, excited to gather them around him at the end of the day. Tell me, my loved ones, about your day. Yes, genuine curiosity allows everything to unfold and spread out before us like a picnic on a sunny day beneath a tree. Curiosity is a gift, a gift from a man to the world. It is about him learning to be genuinely interested in a woman. It is about being puzzled, amazed and enchanted by her, this amazing woman sharing this part of his life. He is listening, engaged, and interested. He is fully present with her. He is drawing her forth in return. By sharing himself with her, she will share herself with him. But what if I am not really curious about women? men say. Then *get* curious. You can always find something in any woman to be curious about. Curiosity is a choice. We can all choose to be more curious, more interested, more engaged. When we choose curiosity, choose to view the world with a real sense of wonder and delight, our curiosity deepens and strengthens. Men want a greater experience with women, but all they have to do is look for ways to be curious about women and their lives will change. Women will *adore* them. Even sprinkling their conversations with the phrase, Im curious is immensely powerful. Im curious why did you move to this city? or Im curious about those shoes And then just listen. It sets a beautiful tone for the whole interaction. She will call all her friends and say, Wow, I met a man who really listens! Genuine curiosity is a trait of all great lovers. It is impossible to be truly adored by women without it. True lovers are immensely curious about women, always listening to them, always looking at them with a sense of wonder. True lovers want to know, want to know, *want to know*. Tell me things. Tell me your stories. What do you love? What do you love? I cant even begin to describe how mesmerizing this is to women. Men have this notion that they need to talk about *themselves* in order to be interesting. After all, if they only talk about and listen to her, well, isnt that tantamount to neediness, to supplication, to putting her on a pedestal? Uh, no. Not at all. A true lover never talks about himself when he sits down with a woman. How can he? The truly interesting subject is sitting right there in front of him. Hello, beauty tell me about you. Sometimes a man on a date with a woman will rapid-fire a bunch of inane questions at her, like a persiflage-spewing, polyester-clad salesman, not really listening to her and not really wanting to know. He is only thinking about the next thing he is going to say, and he is waiting for her to stop talking so he can say it. Its all about him, and how he can impress her. He brags about himself, he talks non-stop, slowly burying her with shovelfuls of unremarkable personal information sludge. Yes, and when I lived in Cincinnati and my other car is to the gym three times a week I dont mean to brag but when youre good at it, its actually pretty easy Ah, but thats not curiosity. Thats not being interested or interesting. Thats not real listening. Thats smarmy and invasive. Thats a job interview. Maybe if he can just say enough impressive things about himself, shell hire him. Might as well just hand her his resum. Wheres the fun? Wheres the joy? Who is this delightful girl in front of him? What is interesting about her? What is she passionate about? What does she believe? What does she love? What is the dream? She will match his energy. She will riseor descendto the level of the interaction. She will give back to him exactly what she receives. If he is distracted, distant, dry, platitudinous, monotone, not really paying attention, and sitting stiff, she will respond in the same way. If the conversation is all surface, just a dispassionate exchange of pedestrian information, then so is the whole experience. The time spent with him is mostly uninteresting and devoid of life. But if he is genuinely curious about her, a little more quizzical in tone, posing questions more searching than the general interrogations of others, she will come alive, animated, poised, and focused on him; the whole conversation is elevated. She will be caught up, transformed, in the magical juxtaposition of him and her in that time and space. It seems to men that women never seem to know exactly what men want and need. Its because we never explicitly state our desires. We expect her to just know what we want and then we are frustrated when she doesnt. If men were ever lucid enough to ask why, women would look at them in surprise and say, Well, its because you never asked! Women are marvelous reflectors. They will respond and meet a man exactly where he is at. They will treat him exactly in the way he asks to be treated. Its that simple. It is up to men to create the kind of experiences they want with women. It is up to men to describe to women exactly what they desire from them and exactly how they want it to be. This is the supreme task of men when it comes to women. We teach women how to treat us. Women only give us what we ask for, even if we have no idea we asked for anything at all. \*\* And sometimes no, all the time how do I say this without being misunderstood? Ah, let it be misunderstood, for it is subtle and it is wonderful. When I am talking to a woman, I interrupt her. Constantly. I break her train of thought, her sentences, in mid-phrase, all the time. And she doesnt even notice. Dont get me wrong, my love. I do not interrupt her in order to impose my opinions or to hear my own voice or because I think I have something more interesting to say than her. No, not at all. I interrupt her to clarify, to shape, to enlarge the things she is saying to me. Wait a minute, I will lightly tap her arm, cutting her off in mid-sentence, You said you love to paint more than anything else in this world tell me more about that. Or I will cut her off for fun, just to shift gears a little, taking the conversation somewhere completely different and new. She might be saying, Yes, I moved here to Montreal three years ago and I tap her arm. I smile. I look in her eyes. I love the shape of your lips And straighten suddenly, sitting back in my chair, Sorry, you were saying? Montreal? A wonderful diversion, a digression, a short-circuit across her frontal lobe, or something like that. In a good way. It has the same effect as kissing her suddenly, unexpectedly. It might sound counter-intuitive, but interrupting this beauty before me does not come across to her as rude or offensive. Not at all. Instead, my little innocuous interruptions, my gentle asides, create a natural ebb and flow between us. Interrupting her amplifies the connection, sprinkles magic all around us, and electrifies the air, a palpable frisson. Am I listening to her? Oh yes, my love, I am *really* listening. I am right there before her, hanging on her every word. Because of her, I am omnipresent, omniscient, enchanted. This is listening on a superior plane. It is active listening, interactive listening. It is sharing my experience of listening to her *with* her. Im listening to you, my love, and here is what I am hearing, as if to say. I am asked all the time: What is your method? What do you do or say to women that is different from other men? Ah, well the truth is, it doesnt really matter what I say to women at all. In fact, my method is: there is no method. If pressed, however, I will say that my method is this: *I put invitations into the world, and I leave them out there.* Thats all I do. Putting invitations into the world is the essence and foundation of the way I interact with women, my love. Everything about me is an invitation. Life is a dance and I am inviting her to dance. If she accepts, then I am inviting her to shine. I will not grab her hand, lift it up, and spin her dizzy round and round by force. No, I will lift up her hand and invite her to step into the space between usan invitation to twirl, to be the beauty, to wow the crowd. The important part is that she must step *willingly* into that space. If she accepts my invitation, then I will lead and she will shine. I dont ask for anything. I dont ask if she is free. Or if she would like to go for coffee. Or what she is doing later. Or if she has a boyfriend. I simply invite. A grand invitation. A luscious invitation. I tune into her desires and extend my hand, as it were, in invitation. Always by invitationnever by force, never by controlan invitation devoid of presumption or expectation. I extend an invitation very early in the interaction, sometimes even as my opening line. I always say it with a smile, with delight, and without apology. If I get close to her and everything about her is nicethe way she smiles and the way she smellsthen I invite her to join me. Where? When? How? Is it even possible? I have no idea. I havent even thought that far ahead yet. All I know is that she and I should be together. And this is exactly what I say to her. I lean in close to her and smile, I love your smile. Can you feel that in the air? You and I should be together No, she might say, I have a boyfriend. If this is so, I will bow out gracefully, respectfully, for if she is in love with another, then she is not my girl, now is she? I want her full heart, her full attention, her full ebullient spirit, excited to be with me. Not with *him*. I do not, however, apologize. I had no idea she had a boyfriend. How could I know? I did nothing wrong. I simply spoke my truth, expressing my desire for a pleasing woman whom I encountered, doing my job as a man. Ah, I understand, I will say, I meant no disrespect to you or to him. But of course I would be remiss if I did not say these things to you. Look at you in that dress you, my dear, are absolutely lovely. If she says she has a boyfriend but she signals to me with her eyes or body language (they often do) that she is not happy or not in love or not sure, ah then, that is a different story. My invitation stands. I cant she says. Yes, well, I understand. And youre still invited. Come away, o human child, to the water and the wild intoned the immortal Yeats. Because why not? What else is there? Why not escape into immeasurable, shimmering romance? Why not return for a while to the innocence and passion of our youth? What is the point of a life if we are not living? Look over there, my love. Can you see what I see? Over there beyond the horizon come away with me. \*\* Women are never offended by an honest invitation. I cant count the number of times a woman has stood before me and said, with her voice and her eyes, I cant but thank you. It is so *refreshing* to hear. Yes well, I hear you, sweet girl. I hear exactly what you are saying. You are thanking me for noticing you. You are thanking me for respecting you. You are thanking me for honoring your current relationship. You are thanking me for giving you the gift of desiring you. You are thanking me for presenting myself to you in all the ways that men do not. Yes, we both know that it cant happen between us, and thats okay. Thats not the point anyway, now is it? The beauty of this moment is enough and will suffice. And whats more, you will never forget this moment, will you? That one time when a stranger expressed an honest desire for youwithout presumption, without manipulation, without games, and with full respect. You will go forth from our little encounter floating a little off the ground, shining like an angel of glad tidings and great joy. Because I am simply putting an invitation into the air and leaving it out there, because I am merely stating what I would *like* to happen, because I am not asking for anything, it is not possible to be rejected. Let me say that again: *I never experience a sense of rejection.* A glorious invitation. Take it or leave it. Of course you are invited *look at you*! It makes complete sense to my mind. What you do with the invitation is entirely up to you. The ball is in your court. To live a life in the spirit of invitations is to live the life of a true lover. I have this notion that as long as I stay connected to what I desire in my life, and speak my truth and put invitations into this world, then the right ones will show up. *The ones you love are the ones who love you.* That is a law of the universe. If she accepts my invitation, then she is my girl. If she doesnt, well then, she never was. How perfect is that? We both win either way. There is an alignment, a calmness, an elegance, about the whole thing. If I just stay on my journey, then one day, perhaps, I will look over and notice that someone lovely is walking beside me. I was alone before, and now, because of my spirit of invitation, she is walking beside me. Just like that. There is no need in me to go out and frenetically try to pick up girls or phone numbers. I know where I am going and I have no time to veer in the direction of any woman, no time to try to convince her of anything. If she is my girl, we will find each other in our travels, naturally and easily. Yes, there is a delicious calmness about the whole thing. Thats the way it works. \*\* There are, I think, three levels of invitation. When a young man wants to invite a girl on a date, he asks her out: Hey, would you like to get together on Thursday evening? Now then, his whole plan for Thursday night is dependent upon her answer. She can, with a single word, determine how he is going to conduct that particular slice of his life. Yes will set him scurrying off in all directions at once, excited, nervous, and making plans. No will return him to his former state of equilibrium (albeit a little more subdued) to do whatever it is he would normally do on a nondescript Thursday evening. You could say that she is the arbiter of his fate for that particular Thursday evening. You could even say that he gives her that power. If she says yes, he is excited and now must create a date he hopes she will like, something memorable, something better than all the dates she has had with all the other guys. He racks his brain. Where should he take her? What should he do? What will she like the most? Coffee? Dinner? Movie? Concert? Art gallery? Hot air balloon? Ah, who knows? Its all so confusing. If, on the other hand, she says no, then he will just stay home or hang out with his buddies or do whatever. Lets call this the *first level of invitations*. As he gets a little older, experience or advice teaches him that it is better to already be doing something interesting and then to ask her to join him. Hey, my friends and I are going to a concert on Thursday. Would you like to come with us? He discovers that this is much better than just asking her out and then trying to dream up something to fill in the time slot. This is much better because it looks like he already has an interesting life and he is going to have fun on Thursday anyway, with or without her. You could say the only power he is giving her now is the power to enhance, with her presence, what he is already doing anyway. Yes, this is much better. Lets call this the *second level of invitations*. Now then, is there perhaps a *third level of invitations*? Yes, my love, I believe there is. Ive never heard anyone describe it like this before, but it makes complete sense to me, and aligns with my experience. The third level of invitations is this: inviting her into nothing absolutely nothing. An invitation into nothing. How truly powerful this is! I am not worrying about where to take her on a date or what memorable event I can invite her to. I am not trying to prove to her that I have a busy or interesting life. I have nothing special planned at all. I am offering her *nothing*. Which is to say, I am inviting her into the presence of us. Which is to say, I am inviting her into our own little world. Which is to say, I am inviting her into *everything*. It doesnt really matter what it is we do at all because we, together, are the event. We, together, are the memorable occasion. We, together, are all that matters. In other words, I actually do have something special planned: the experience of me and her together. There is even a sense, I suppose, of subconsciously down-playing and disqualifying myself. Its almost like some quaint part of me wants to strip everything away, down to the essence of just me and her, down to the simple ascetic beauty of a jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou, as Khayym so wonderfully put it. I want her to accept my invitation simply because we like each other, not because of the distractions I might offer or because I have something cool for us to do. Yes, my love, I have nothing spectacular to offer you just me and yes, youre still invited. \*\* When a man meets a woman and he wants to ask her out on a date, he usually does it by well, literally *asking*. He will say something like: Would you like to get together sometime? or Are you free tomorrow evening? or Do you have any plans for this Thursday? or Would you like to have coffee with me? or It was nice talking to you. Can I call you sometime? On the surface, these questions all seem innocuous and normal, a good thing to do. Its better than doing nothing, right? However, he is still, hat in hand, asking. I dont ask for anything. I make statements. Big difference. With ease and delight, and a sparkle in my eye. I will say, It was nice talking to you. I would love to see you again. Or Cancel your plans, sweet girl! Lets get together tonight. Or Im going for a coffee right now, if youd care to join me. All of this is presented as what it is, a pure and honest invitation. There is no hint of ordering her around or controlling or demanding. And no questions at all. Only statements. Never questions. There seems to be little difference between saying, Can I call you sometime? and I would love to call you. Each, at first glance, is pretty much saying the same thing to her. In fact, she wont even notice the difference. But the effect on the interaction is huge. Subtle but monumental. It speaks volumes to the heart of a woman, for it telegraphs to her that not only am inviting her to dance with me, but I am willing to lead the dance. Where are my desires as a man? Where is my masculine edge? Where is my love of women? Right there. Right there in front of you, my love. \*\* A man sees a woman over there and he studies the situation, stands back, watches her, and wonders what is the best thing to do. Then when he has summoned enough courage, he approaches her and says whatever he thinks might be best to say. His intentions are good. His attraction is real. His approach is honest. However, he has been conditioned by media or mother that he must remain sexually neutral, that he must not offend her. He has learned to hide his attraction, his desires, and certainly his sexuality, beneath a politically correct neutrality. This sets the tone for the encounter. His conversation is surface, breezy, and innocuous. He might be pleasant and interesting. He might offer to buy her a drink. Oh, but he has something he has an agenda, a desired outcome, hidden, buried, shunted into the shadows. He wants something from her: a phone number, or a date with her, or a one-night-stand, or a relationship, or love and marriage. None of this is secret to her, even though he thinks it might be. He is afraid to just say it. He is in his head the whole time, trying to figure it out. He is not really listening to the things she says because he is trying to angle the whole conversation toward his subterranean goal. Hes thinking: I have to somehow get her phone number or Ive failed. And thus, he spends the entire time calculating, calibrating, inching toward his goal. He measures his success in the interaction by her response, and how well it seems to align with his agenda. If she responds favorably, he feels good. If she doesnt, he starts to feel that old familiar twinge of rejection. His hidden objective, he realizes, just might not be obtainable. Once again, he has failed. He turns away, dejected. He walks away knowing what hes known all along: that he is not good enough. None of those objectives are, within themselves, objectionable. People can want what they want. Desire is not a bad thing. *Needing* what they desire will create problems; *hiding* what they desire will create even more. And hiding it, of course, exacerbates the neediness. The mistake is to not express what we are really after. The hidden-ness of his agenda, his masking of intentions, his secrecy about his desired result, is what clouds the interaction. When I meet a delightful girl, she knows exactly what I am all about within the first minute. She knows there is no way she can put me in the lets just be friends box. How does she know this? Because I tell her! I tell her with my body language, my touch, and especially my words. I just say it straight. Of course I would love to explore her in all her glory! Of course I am going to say, Wow, look at you! Of course I am going to say, Run away with me Thats who I am. This is what I want. She, of course, can want something else entirely. Thats completely up to her. I cant be rejected by her because I am not *asking* her for anything. I am just stating what I would like to happen. I am just speaking my truth. Im just saying what I want. A woman knows the difference between me and a guy who is on the make, trying to pick her up. And also the difference between me and a nice guy asking her out for a coffee and a subsequent string of frustrating dates."

57,vulnerability,seduction,Quick tips for combating neediness and overthinking.,692,cjdojv,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cjdojv/quick_tips_for_combating_neediness_and/,2019-07-30 02:36:20,"1. *Neediness is largely a bad mental habit, treat it that way.* Neediness is actually a manifestation of anxiety. Even if you're not actually feeling anxious, your brain will follow the bad habits anyway. So if neediness is an issue for it, look at it as combating anxiety. Meditate, gain mindfulness, and face your fears. 2. *A bad decision is far better than no decision.* If a girl is into you, you'll have far more wiggle room then you think. So stop being afraid to make mistakes. A bad decision is also a learning experience, treat it that way. 3. *If she pulls back, you pull back.* Nearly every girl can and will do a pullback on you at some point. Often it is a test, or happens for reasons that have nothing to do with you - she does or should have a life of her own after all. All you have to do is be patient, and often after a week or two she'll come to you. There is literally nothing to be gained by chasing her, and by the time you're experienced enough to know when to break this rule, you won't need me to tell you. 4. *The three sure-fire signs of interest are in order - initiation, reciprocation, and compliance.* The reason why is because they all signal investment. Those are your cues to escalate and take risks. 5. *Stop being afraid of eye contact, it's your friend.* This should be almost self-explanatory. Even if you're on the spectrum, you can tell a lot about how a girl is feeling by the way she looks at you. The trick is to feel, not think and hone your intuition by learning when and how to trust it. You're not a body language expert and you don't need that level of insight 95% of the time. 6. *Give her vulnerability when she's earned it.* This is how you root attraction and build an emotional connection. This is also how you keep your level of investment in line with hers. You're not playing hard to get, especially when that's actually what girls want. For instance, when a girl propositions you out of the blue, it's actually unsettling, because it makes no sense and doesn't feel earned. That's how girls feel when a guy gives them what she wants too soon. 7. *When in doubt, don't be afraid to pull back yourself.* The wrong time to pull back is when you have some momentum with the girl and she's sending the signs. If things are weird or awkward or seemingly stalled, sometimes pulling back and doing you is exactly the right move. Often times this happens because she doesn't know how she feels, or is distracted by something, or you overinvested a little and made her doubt you. As Robert Greene says - use absence to increase respect and honor. 8. *Always be on your purpose.* This is how you stay off your phone, stop overthinking, and react to girls texting you as a pleasant distraction, rather than something taking up far too many mental cycles. Men need to have a life outside of women, both for her, and for you. Your independence does for your love life what her looks does for hers. You need it. 9. *Women trust men who are who they say they are and do what they say they'll do.* One of the guardrails against neediness is having a strong identity. When you know what you like and want and aren't afraid to live by it, women understand you better. It's your vulnerable side that confuses them because they fear that's who you really are and your identity is nothing more but a thin social mask. When you show you have a strong identity that works in harmony with your shadow side, then she feels she can trust the way you present yourself and can wrap her head around the contradictions that are present in every person and many men try very very hard to hide - in itself, a needy behavior. 10. *Abundance mentality.* Doesn't matter who you are, dating will always be on some level a numbers game. Even if you're compatible with a lot of women, not every woman will be compatible with you. You cannot be afraid to walk away from a sub-optimal situation, and it's actually kind of liberating when you do. But the secret is to always be chatting up new girls, and letting girls go on the back burner, especially if that's where they want to be because they plan on circling back when they can. You'd be surprised how often this happens. But the secret is not being set on making it with any one particular girl at any one particular time."
58,vulnerability,seduction,Vulnerability and attraction,3,cn39up,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/cn39up/vulnerability_and_attraction/,2019-08-07 18:49:16,"Hello fellow redditors, I want to know your opinion about vulnerability. I stumbled upon the concept of vulnerability by watching Brene Brown's TED-Talks. I think she's doing wonderful work and that vulnerability is the best way to conquer your feelings of shame. I tried to show more vulnerability towards my clostest family members and all I received was unconditional love. It was amazing. And Dr. Brown said it right: Vulnerability is not weakness. Opening up about the things I was ashamed of was one of the hardest things I've ever done. However: I have the feeling that this does not have the same implications for game. Whenever I showed even the tiniest bit of vulnerability towards a woman (who clearly was attracted to me), it felt like the attraction almost immediately faded. I wasn't pouring my heart out to her, I just tried to show the authentic me. Including the things that might not go well in my life. Because I'm not ashamed of them anymore. While it may have made me more sympathetic, it feels to me like it's a highway to the friend zone. You can sing the last sentence in Kenny Loggins' voice if you want to... Funny enough, I remember Mark Manson talking about vulnerability and being your authentic self as a key to attracting women (at least that's what I remember from his book ""models""). So, what do you think? Does vulnerability kill attraction? Or is it the key to attracting the opposite sex?"

She had a boyfriend at the time, but I got pretty drunk and started hitting on her anyways bc I was digging her vibe. It reciprocated well all things considered, we had very playful interactions but I didnt push it bc of the boyfriend. Didnt talk much after that. Fast foreword to February, shes single, a big festival was going on in my town and I ended up catching up with her at the bar she works at, we talked about all kinds of things and turns out we have a ton in common particularly our taste in music. That got me thrilled. Well my male friend noticed us hitting it off and walked up to us and yelled kiss. Mind you were drunk off of our asses here, shes shocked but she looks at me and I just go for it. Things got awkward soon after and I rolled out, she fussed my friend when I left saying she doesnt like to do stuff like that when shes not sober &amp; on the spot. I believe I tried to text her a bit after the weekend to push for a hangout, but the vibe was off so we took another break from talking. We would go in spurts from here where we would snapchat for 2 weeks and things would die off, then we would pick it up again. After my school semester ended I had a ton more free time (nursing major makes it hard to socialize) so I visited the bar she works at &amp; the fire was there. Attraction and everything. This summer weve been hanging out &amp; building a legit friendship, she invites me to the bar or to her other job from time to time, we hang out after sometimes but its always in a big friend group so I find it hard to feel intimate. At some point I REALLY started liking her and all of a sudden get really fucking nervous trying to make this shit happen. We went do some trespassing the other night with a friend group and it seemed great at first until I had her alone for 2 minutes talking and I pussied out, didnt make a move. The night still wrapped up okay but I was beating myself up after that &amp; never really had another window of opportunity. We (the group of 4 of us) sat and talked and really got deep with some of the shit weve been through. The playful energy me and girl usually have died, but I got some things off my chest. She stayed relatively quiet while the 3 of us talked. It put me in a weird ass mood after &amp; I was self conscious asf for showing vulnerability I guess? I felt a shift in dynamic &amp; maybe its all in my head but my thought process was that making a move was do or die &amp; I failed. Ive got to fucking kiss this girl man but we only hang in a social setting with other friends &amp; the effects of rejection race through my mind. This was last night. Im worried Ive done goofed &amp; fucked up what could have been a dope ass relationship, she noticed I was nervous and usually thats not the demeanor I show people. Now I dont know what my next move should be. Honest thoughts appreciated."
60,vulnerability,seduction,Show her your flaws!,26,c6n2qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/c6n2qt/show_her_your_flaws/,2019-06-29 03:33:45,"Here's a surprising reason why women don't feel comfortable enough to text guys back after exchanging contact details. **A lack of vulnerability** As you may know, there are typically two feelings you need to build to have a woman want to meet for a date. SEXUAL ATTRACTION + COMFORT Once theyve got the hang of cold-approaching women, a lot of pick-up guys become **brilliant at sparking sexual attraction.** Theyll use jokes, wit, charm or whatever clever lines theyve learned, and thatll often be enough for a woman to want to swap contact details. However, these guys never tend to show any flaws or vulnerability. The woman never gets to see behind the iron curtain of this pick-up persona. That means theres never an opportunity to build an emotional connection - so theres **no comfort built.** She doesnt know the real you, so she has no reason to trust you, and that can be reason enough for her to ignore your text messages. After all, men can be dangerous creatures... Heres what I'll often do... When a woman compliments me on being confident, Ill tell her that I didnt always used to be this way. Ill explain that there was a time when I couldnt speak to men or women. I used to feel lonely and isolated, until one day I decided to start a journey to develop the traits I was lacking at the time. Often, shell be touched by the story, and share something about her social vulnerabilities. All of a sudden, there is a unique emotional bond created. Hopefully you see how this would increase the odds of her wanting to meet up again! So, rather than aiming to be smooth and sophisticated like James Bond, dont be afraid to show your flaws. ***Ive co-launched WhatsApp and Telegram groups for men who want to be incredible with women.

I introduced myself to them and we quickly had a really good connection after having many drinks together. Both of the girls had boyfriends, but claimed what happens on vacation stays on vacation. I was confused a little but I was pretty sure at least one was into me. We both had family around so nothing physical could happen, but we planned on seeing each other at night. After seeing them at the pool for a few days, met at the club some nights later with the one girl who made it out and we get to talking and I tell her that I found some weed and my family and I were smoking it earlier. She got playfully jealous a little, and asked for an invite next time. I told her I still have half a joint, lets go smoke it. We still havent been physical at this point but were both giving amazing eye contact. She agrees, and we go to my balcony and sit side by side and smoke it. After its done, were just staring deep into each others eyes and then I waive my hand in a come here kind of motion and we start making out. I pull her on top of me after a couple of minutes and now were making out while shes straddling me and dry humping me. After a few minutes of that I pull her into the bedroom and we start off the foreplay. I start feeling her up slowly over her panties, then move into fingering her slowly and shes just dripping wet and I tell her that its sexy. She whispers in my ear that shes been waiting for this all week. I then seal the deal, last pretty long because I was quite drunk. Despite it being my first time, Im pretty sure I gave her a couple of orgasms because she pulled the shit out of my hair for 10 seconds at a time a couple of times. We go for round 2 as well. Ive been on a high ever since being back. Ive finally gotten over this hump thats been holding me back for years. Im 22 and throughout my first 3 years of college I placed sex on such a high pedestal that I would never get it.

Fear of rejection and open up your vulnerability to others and avoid your sexual interests. Ive had several close girl friends and Now I notice how they look at guys the same way we do to hers. If you dont approach leaving your intentions clear because of fear, then why should women do it for you, its not her role! Its never been.

64,vulnerability,seduction,The Five Stages of Interest,53,bidhzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/bidhzo/the_five_stages_of_interest/,2019-04-29 03:14:24,"One of the things I finds that trips up a lot of guys, is trying to figure out if a girl is interested. To me that's the wrong question. A girl being interested to one degree or another is really nothing special. If you're remotely presentable and have some things going for you, some girl at some time is gonna have at least a passing interest in you. Law of large numbers yo. Therefore, the devil is in the details. Some women like to tell you that they decide whether or not they're gonna sleep with a guy in five seconds or thirty seconds or two minutes flat. What they really mean is that's how long it takes them to decide that a guy is attractive, according to their various criteria. Deciding to sleep with them - the fastest I've ever experienced was half an hour. The irony is that often girls do have ""sploosh"" moments where they decide a guy is bangable almost on the spot, similar to how guys react to decently attractive women. But guys definitely take their take deciding if they'd date a girl. Girls are the same way with sex, as even if they're intentionally looking just to get laid, their interest level and their trust has to reach a certain level before they're willing to turn a hypothetical into a reality. Doesn't matter if you've known her for ten years or five minutes. Knowing where you are with a girl on that pathway is all-important. Another important thing to remember is that girls don't go through these stages by time, only by feel. Sometimes she's already primed to talk to you before you even approach her. Sometimes she goes straight from first meeting to ""let's bang"" crazy fast. Or sometimes she gets stuck at a level and stays there - more than a few friendzone situations are actually this, just not yours :p So without further ado, here are the 5 (actually 6) stages of a woman's sexual interest. Relationship interest is a similar but much broader topic. **Stage 0: No Interest** This is where either a girl doesn't know you exist. This is actually not the worst thing, as it represents a blank slate. What's worse is where she not only has no interest, but negative interest. You know you're below this stage when she's actively avoiding you and its usually a good idea to cut bait and move on before you make it worse and get a restraining order. Key Signs - the absence of them **Stage 1: On Her Radar** You reach this stage with a girl usually through one of two ways. Either she notices you first, and starts sending approach signals of various intensity. Or you go up and talk to her. Either way, you've now made a first impression. That matters, but it's certainly not the be-all and end-all. Sometimes, if you see a girl around work/school/your normal places, and she keeps sending approach signals, by the time you do approach her, she could already be primed to move to the next stage. The key to getting through this stage is making an impression on her. Some girls respond to a calm and normal approach, maybe a chaste compliment or a joke. And some respond well to polarizing flirting. Either way, this is a surprisingly easy stage to get to. Key Signs - approach signals (eye contact, waving, proximity, she opens you etc.) - she's willing to be opened - responds to something you say - no compliance yet **Stage 2: Initial Attraction** Old-school PUAs used to call this the hook point. This where she starts to invest in her interaction with you. You're past the initial awkwardness of first meeting, and now she has some reason to talk to you. You usually get to this point if she's already physically attracted to you, or has responded well to some flirtation. This is also where rapport slowly begins to develop. This is also where you should start calibrating to this girl and get the wheel of attraction spinning. You do that through qualifying, screening, teasing, and compliance tests. By this stage she's willing to invest a little to see if you're a confident and interesting guy. You know you're out of this stage when she's giving you classic IOIs or compliance, or starting to reciprocate the flirtations. Key Signs - she talks to you directly and starts giving sustained eye contact - she gives you classic IOIs like compliments, touching you, or playing with her hair - she gives limited compliance (is willing to high five you, let you tell her a story, responds to teases/qualification etc.) - she starts shit-testing you (actually a good thing) **Stage 3: Moderate Attraction** By this point, she likes what she sees so far and is starting to view you as a possible option. She's gone beyond curious and now she wants to see what you're all about. If you've been teasing and qualifying her and she's giving you compliance, it's important now to reward that by showing some interest. Or if you opened directly with say a compliment or casual conversation, now you need to start teasing and qualifying. Either way, the important thing now is to keep the wheel of attraction spinning so she becomes open to escalation and closing. By now the touch barrier should be broken. By the time you're about halfway through or nearing the end of this point, she should be open to isolating herself with you, or giving you her number. If she hasn't started shit testing you yet, she probably will now. Another important thing to consider is the more rapport you can start to build now, the more open she will be to bigger escalations like asking her out or kissing her. By the end of this stage, you should have her number, some serious sexual tension, and enough rapport that she'll be open to either physical escalation or meeting up with you later. Key Signs: - By now she should be doing just as much talking as you, if not more. - Eye contact is now sustained and the touch barrier is broken. - Not only are shit tests likely now, she'll probably start leading the interaction a little as she is now considering you seriously. Let her, just remember to keep her chasing. - Compliance is much higher now. She'll wander off with you, give you her number, even start qualifying herself unprompted. All good signs. **Stage 4: Actively Interested** Now this is the stage where the rubber meets the road. This is also where the momentum you've built up over the past few stages becomes all-important, because this is when she decides whether she's gonna be physically receptive to you and eventually sleep with you. The classic rookie mistake is to think you're done attracting her and go straight into rapport-building. Rapport is crucial here, but you also can't start chasing her or let all the sexual tension dissipate. This is also where leading the interaction becomes all-important, as most girls won't chase you into the bedroom, they'll just let you take them there. By this point, you're hanging out one-on-one and likely heading towards making out. If you got her number and asked her out, she'll likely be at this stage by the time you get to wherever you're going out to. This is where seduction becomes a bit of a balancing act and calibration vital as you've gotta be able to sniff out what she's looking for make up her mind. Does she want more rapport she feels comfortable being alone and physically intimate? Is she looking for more attraction to get the sexual tension peaking and help her make sure she's not making a mistake? Is she looking for you to be confident and respond to her escalation windows? Key Signs: - By now she's alone with you and equally invested in the interaction as you are. - Compliance is high enough that she'll go out with you, let you touch her, answer personal questions. By the end of this stage, she should willing to let you kiss her, if not sooner. - Eye contact and touch are your most important IOIs as the former signals rapport and interest, and the latter signals physically attraction and comfort with you on a physical level. - Vulnerability is also a big deal here. If she starts being vulnerable with you, respect it and respond to it. This means you're not just some guy anymore, you're someone that matters to her. - Escalation windows are the sign that she's at the end of the stage. Look for things like long lingering looks, dragging you off into someplace private, or for her to start being sexually provocative. If she's teasing you hard at this stage, it's often because she wants you to make a move. **Stage 5: Sold** By this point, her plausible deniability of sexual interest should be diminishing rapidly. By now you've probably kissed her and have started escalating physically. The important thing to do now is keep her in this state and don't kill the mood. Keep the sexual tension up until you're in a location where you can hook up - as sexual tension here is actually more important than arousal. Her big concerns at this point is will you get needy as you get closer and closer to hooking up, and not seeming easy. If you've practiced good game, built good rapport, and given her sexual affection as a reward, not a demand, then LMR is unlikely. If you haven't, be on the lookout for it and diagnose it. LMR most often happens because of sexual insecurity or she's afraid of being a slut. One thing that actually really helps is being vulnerable with her. Just don't overdo it and make her think you want sex too much. Unless it's explicitly a one-night-stand, she's probably also gonna be screening you for boyfriend potential so be on the lookout for it. Sexually teasing her here has a powerful effect on her, as the anticipation will make her hornier and hornier. Key Signs: - Her compliance level will be a product of your game through the last three stages. Done right, she'll be more than ready to sleep with you, if not escalating on you. If there is a shortcoming to your game, it will likely emerge here. Recognize it and address it in a non-needy manner. - She starts screening you as a boyfriend, partly because she's interested, and partly because she won't want to be just a booty call. - By the time you're in this stage, you should be making out. By the time you've left it, you should be sleeping with her. - Look for her to start getting really invested and really vulnerable with you. Women really do love sex, but there's not a woman alive who doesn't feel a little vulnerable hooking up with a new guy. Respect her vulnerability, but keep the vibe fun and upbeat. There's plenty of time to be emotionally intimate with her later. Anyway that's enough verbiage. Discuss!"
65,vulnerability,seduction,All Of Game Summed Up In Three Sentences.,89,bj84s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/bj84s9/all_of_game_summed_up_in_three_sentences/,2019-05-01 06:25:03,"One of the things I like most about Mark Manson's whole oeuvre of dating advice is his Three Fundamentals (Honest Living, Honest Action, Honest Communication). They cut right to the chase of what it means to be a man who is attractive to women. One of his big hobbyhorses is that you should be honest with women, and he's right. Trying to be someone you're not is fundamentally needy. However, I think his attempt at distillation didn't quite capture the essence of game. MM's Three Fundamentals describe what you should be doing when you're good with women, but is a little more vague on how you get there, what's the pathway. Now that isn't to say he doesn't offer advice on how to improve. He does a lot of that, and the advice is solid. But I don't think it really captures what you should be aiming at. The seduction community emerged because women would always say ""oh just be confident"" and never really offer much useful advice. (The only exception I've encountered is a female friend who told me once my eye contact game is weak and I talk and walk with my chin down - she was right and I'm deeply grateful to her for pointing it out). Game honestly reminds me of a combination of poker and bridge. It reminds me of poker in the sense that your interest and investment in your relationship with a woman is a bet, and you're always on the lookout for clues as to what's in her head, and the best clues are her decisions. But it's also like bridge in that you have to make decisions yourself based on limited info, and the key is indirectly communicating with your partner. Because game isn't actually a competitition - it's a team sport. There are competitive influences sure, but you find success on the basis of working successfully with your partner. And that's why confidence matters - because it matters in both games. To be a good student of the game, you have to try your best, don't get obsessive, push the envelope, and have fun. So here's my attempt to explain how to build, use, and act with confidence. Do that, and you set yourself apart faster than anything else. **Be a person of value** The root of confidence is self esteem. And the root of self esteem is developing what I call power-within-self, or the capability to act in your own self-interest and accomplish things. One of the unsung luxuries of our day and age is that you do not need power over others, or to be in the ugly competition for social status in order to be in control of your reality. You do not need to be a king to be free, in fact you find that kings are some of least free people you'll ever meet. The reason why this matters is the proof of self-esteem comes in self-sufficiency. Where you deal with others as neither a beggar, nor a lord. You may have more influence on them than they do on you or vice versa, but you never sacrifice your self-respect to please someone else. Where your time and energy has value because it is useful to both yourself and others. You have an internal locus of control. And a big part of that, is learning how to channel your sex drive into productive work, and by doing so invest in yourself. Man is the animal that invents himself. When you do that, self-esteem will be yours. But one last thing on this topic. You do not have to be Harvey Specter or Hank Moody or Indiana Jones or Elon Musk or Donald Trump to be ""good enough"". All it takes is making full use of your time to develop your independence and shape your life into something that truly works for you. That's the one thing those archetypes, both real and fictional have in common. You do that, and you're ahead of about 85% of guys, who build their lifestyle according to the path of least resistance. They take the girls that already want them, do the kind of work they can already get, and do what is expected of them, rather than what fulfills them and makes full use of their talents. They accept responsibility over their own lives and make the fullest out of that. *Man is the animal that invents himself. So do it, and don't let others do it for you. They won't do as good a job.* **Believe you are a person of value** My perspective shift women first started to come around when I realized that I was on some level attractive to them. Then suddenly when I looked back on say high school, I see all these girls who had crushes on me to one degree or another, and I never noticed. One of the hottest girls in my year used to tease me relentlessly, and I just thought she was trying to tool me/fuck with me. And she was just playing around, but that was because she wanted to see how I'd react. She wanted to see if I was confident as well as attractive. Needless to say I disappointed her, and continued to disappoint women for some time. I was not a confident guy growing up. Everybody wants something. Even if you're just hanging out with friends or family, it's because you enjoy each other's company on some level. You may have more or less value to others, but always remember on some level that love and respect are earned, especially as an adult rather than a child. You earn them with two necessary things: first you have a moral and ethical values that you've fully internalized and live by, and the second is that you add value to people's lives. This means that if you want a woman to take notice of you, feel attraction for you, and invest in you physically, emotionally, and literally, you need to add value to her life on your terms. If you're a person of value, you look for the women that you feel are best for you, and add the most value to your life. Now here's a big secret. The men who add the most sexual value to a woman's life are the ones that want her, but do not need her. Neediness does to attraction what water does to fire, and in some ways that's actually a good thing, because there is such a thing as too attracted. But the point is, the whole point of believing you are a person of value is so that you have the right frame of mind when it comes to sex. That's a gift you give to women when they show their value and invest in you. It's not a demand or an ultimatium, or something they reluctantly swallow just to satisfy their non-sexual needs. *Your sexuality is a gift, especially to women that are actually interested in you. Treat it that way. Don't give it to just anyone, push it on people who don't want it, or throw pearls before swine. When you do believe that your sexuality has value, you'll demonstrate that you're a man of value without even thinking about it.* They'll almost smell it on you. Then everything from approaching to escalating becomes worry-free, especially with experience. Why? Because your mind is in the right place and you'll represent yourself well and trust your decisions. Women will pick up on that and respond positively. And because you're not trying to convince yourself that every woman is right for you, rejection won't bother you anymore. You'll look at it as a blessing - you won't waste anymore time and your time is valuable remember? **Behave like a person of value** Attraction is like a flywheel and a magnet. It both holds a relationship between a man and a woman together, and gives it momentum. Men have the luxury/or curse of being able to be sexually attracted to a woman without being emotionally attracted to her (if this wasn't the case, men wouldn't approach women, and the human race would be a lot smaller). Most women do not share this, despite having a desire and affinity for sex that actually greatly exceeds most men's. That's why women inhibit their sexuality - sex has far greater consequences for them, literally and emotionally. And that's why a woman has to be emotionally attracted to you to want you sexually (generally speaking). Women's sex drives are like the proverbial object at rest. If you want her to want you, you need to overcome that inertia (as well as your own - you're the object in motion that stays in motion). Want to be her lover and not her friend? Make her earn your interest, especially your sexual interest. That's how you exert a gravitational pull on her. Nothing actually turns on a woman more, because they want your interest to be valuable. Sometimes you can even convince them your interest is valuable through your behavior, even if it isn't. That's why ""fake it till you make it"" sorta works. But the act always eventually falls apart unless it's rooted in self-esteem. That's why this is the third part of being a confident man, and not the first. And it's also why women HATE fakers. That's why the seduction community gets such a bad rap in certain circles - people think it's about teaching men to pretend to be confident to con girls into bed. In order to seduce women (once you have the proper mindset), you only need two skills. The first is how to flirt, and the second is how to read her signs so you can lead confidently, build rapport, and show vulnerability when she's ready for them and wanting them. Flirting is actually really simple. The basic flirtation is the tease, everything else is a variation of it. Cocky/funny, push-pull, qualification and screening, even the much-slandered ""neg"". All the same thing. All you doing is demonstrating your sexuality in a non-needy way that leaves her free to accept or reject the sexual frame. That's what innuendo for instance is - she can either pick up on it and respond to it, or ignore it. She can either tell you about what's awesome about her other than her looks, or she can blow you off. The reason why women respond to this is because it's how she communicates her sexuality. Women don't put themselves out there - they flirt and they tease long before they say ""hey let's bang"" (and they do say that, more often than you think). By sending out flirtations and responding to hers, you flip the script and make her earn your interest through her agreement and participation in the game. Flirting is how you get the flywheel of attraction spinning, and if you don't do it, either she'll be gaming you, or nothing will happen. Now the next skill - calibration. Calibration is what separates the amateurs from the pros, because the only way to get it is with experience. You could read every book about female psychology there is, and still not learn things you could learn with just one girlfriend. Calibration is how you shoot up your batting average. It's almost as important as everything else put together. Why? Because women are different. They're both different from you because of gender, and they're different from other women and other people because everyone's personality is unique. There may be general trends, but no two people are perfectly alike. We all have different needs and priorities, different hopes and fears, different insecurities and points of pride, different values. And that especially shows up in people's sexuality. Some girls deal with their sexual anxiety by treating sex as uber-special, some devalue it to the point where they only really care if you're attractive. Some girls like to play the field, some are serial monogamists. Some girls dream of the white picket fence, some girls just want a partner. Some love super-dominant guys, others feel insecure around them. The point is that if no two girls are like, there is no one-size-fits-all pathway to the bedroom. I could write pages and pages on calibration but I'm already up to 11k characters so I'll say this. In order for most women to feel comfortable and willing to sleep with you, they need to feel some measure of both attraction and rapport with you, and some meeting of the minds when it comes you two hooking up. Even if a girl is attracted to you and knows you well, she won't sleep with you unless she wants to. So you have to read her signs and interpret them correctly. For instance, a shit test is actually a form of flirtation, just an unusually aggressive one. She does those because she wants to see if you're for real by testing whatever her impression is of you. If she thinks you're confident, she'll bust your chops. If she thinks you're into her, she'll accuse you of being a player. If she thinks you want her in bed too badly, she'll give you LMR. Passing these tests is easy, just be who you hold yourself out to be. Want to really understand women, and render yourself immune to shit tests forever? Stop focusing on the ""what"" of what she says and does, and focus on the ""why"". That's the secret to calibration. She's telling you about herself, her values, her hopes and dreams, her sexual likes and dislikes, and her wants and needs. You're just not listening. *""Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.""* - Ayn Rand (what she didn't mention is that this definitely applies to women too) Discuss!"

There are a few ways I see myself losing my virginity: 1. Getting therapy and settling for a relationship with an ugly or introverted girl 2. A meaningless hook up with a ""virgin-collector"" of middling to ugly looks 3. A ""gamey"" hookup with some random hot chick with daddy issues. 4. An escort (if that even counts) According to the latest research on confidence, the ONLY way I can improve my confidence is by improving my skills/reality. This means having sex. A lot of guys act like losing virginity isn't a big deal. These guys are idiots. **The longest dry spell a man ever has is his first one.** Will losing my virginity solve all my problems? No. Not even close. But will it open the floodgates and allow me to work on my deeper issues? Statistically speaking, yes, in every guy I have ever seen this is what happens. I will never fuck an ugly chick to lose my virginity because that show desperation. I could never live with myself if that was the case. The same is true of a virgin collector. I would never be a notch in someone else's belt. Might as well let her peg me at that point. The hookup: this is what I want. To fake myself and suppress my inadequacy. TO FOOL the chick. I am a great actor and very socially aware. If you concern is that ""girls can see through it"" then rest assured, that's not the issue. I just need the script to follow and the logistics hammered out. The escort: same shit. Illegal, logistically challenging, STDs, etc. etc. My point is not to be some Mark Manson butter fly hunting la di da sensitive vulnerable guy. I want to turn myself into a killer. And maybe when that's done focus inward. Thanks for your help I am specifically looking for someone in my case who went through the same shit. How did you do it? Tons and tons of daygame? I estimate it would take around 300 approaches. Night game is probably out of the question if you are a short dude (under 5'5). Perhaps going to another country is an option."

You awkwardly force each foot in front of the other and finally make it over to her. She looks at you with an expression like \`what the fuck do you want you creep\` Then... you say I want to have sex with you. It comes out of your mouth like a squeaky mouse. Next, she looks at you like you're a piece of shit and then tells you to fuck off. You walk away with the conclusion the \`be honest\` concept from Social Prime is a load of shit time to learn techniques to solve this problem. After reading many comments in the Facebook group this story describes how the concept is often retardedly interpreted. I have experienced the power of this concept in my life with unbelievable results during and after the immersion I took. Hung out with the SP crew a ton and seen how effortless interacting with girls can become when applied correctly. Firstly let\`s clear up what Social Prime actually means by \`honesty\` within in an interaction. Next, we will look at how this is the path for game to finally become \`effortless\`. How to use \`honesty\` within in an interaction? The simplest way to describe what Social Prime means by honesty is not trying to hide anything or not wearing a mask. Girls are amazing at sensing bullshit, they are like walking lie detectors, their brains are literally wired this way. SO trying to hide behind a mask is like walking on a tightrope. Not only can girls sense it, even if you can manage to hide it successfully you are harming yourself internally in the process (we will get into this later). Your sub-communications are generated by whats going on internally and emotionally. The more closely what you say matches whats going on internally and emotionally in the moment the more honest, the more congruent, the more authentic you are being. In the opening story, an honest thing to express would have been something like... I\`m feeling quite overwhelmed by the environment but I felt attracted to you and decided to nervously come over here and introduce myself One thing that is likely to happen is the girl drops the bitchy look on her face, admires your courage, likes your realness and begins interacting with you. Girls are attracted to authenticity and repulsed when they sense deception, neediness, and supplication. However, the thing to focus on is not if the girl's reaction is good or bad. The thing to focus on is are you living with personal integrity. Integrity means congruence: words and behavior match. (pg 144 Six Pillars of Self Esteem) As soon as you start trying to manipulate the girl's reaction you are fundamentally supplicating to the girl and not living with personal integrity. The pick-up industry is one big giant supplication. It also means you are hiding who you are from others which over time reinforces beliefs like you are not good enough. Especially if you have had beliefs like this from a young age. Your beliefs about yourself and the world are always coming through in your sub-communications regardless if you express or not. Pick-up models are like a factory for reinforcing terrible beliefs. Hiding from others means suppressing the potentialities of the unreleased self. If you cannot reveal yourself to others you can not reveal yourself to yourself. It does not only mean that you suppress who you are but also what you could be will never be forced by necessity to come forward, biological truth as well as conceptual. - Jordan Peterson Now that the interaction has started you continue to be authentic throughout the interaction, moment to moment. So... \-You like something about her and want to tell her. You tell her. \-You want to tell her what you had for breakfast. You tell her. \-You dislike her behavior. You tell her. \-You want to say a joke. You say it. \-You want to be playful. You do it. \-You think her joke isn't funny. You don't laugh. \-You want to tease her you tease her. \-Your bored of listening to her talk and talk about herself you put your finger on her mouth and tell her to ssh. \-You want to kiss her. You kiss her. \-Your feeling really horney and you want to fuck her. You tell her. Etc This is what naturals have been doing for centuries before pick-up even became a thing. The only thing is they dont have all the blockages stopping them from expressing freely. All the stuff the pick-up industry focuses on takes care of itself the more unblocked you become without even having to think about it. (E.g Qualifying, push-pull etc) But on STEROIDS. Now its coming from a real place, its way more powerful and the girls notice. Once you are unblocked girls literally start getting addicted to your presence, you see this with naturals. Think Hank Moody from Californication or Russell Brand. Do these guys think about what technique to use? The more unblocked you become the easier it becomes. Different parts of your previously suppressed personality come out naturally. The more and more effortless interacting becomes over time. You can express dominance You can express vulnerability You can be loud You can be fun You can be challenging You can be chill How to become unblocked? When a blockage arises. You have two options. Try and hide/suppress the blockage from the girl or just simply express it and own it (the authentic route). So any time you become blocked emotionally and feel stuck you simply express that. For example, your standing with a girl, looking into her eyes, there is sexual tension. Internally you get that feeling its time to kiss her. But for some reason your afraid to do it, the fear cripples you. Look her in the eyes and simply tell her you feel afraid to kiss her and own it. Own the fuck out of the fact that you're afraid. You're not saying it as a technique to try and get the girl. You're saying it because its real and expressing yourself and living with personal integrity is more important than getting the girl. When you own it it doesn't come across as needy. Its only needy if you say it to try and manipulate her. Instead, it shows a lot of bravery and self-respect. Which is very attractive. So most likely the sexual tension will grow stronger or you will snap out of it and kiss her. Remember she can most likely already sense your hesitation at this point so by trying to hide your fear is not only supplicating but pointless, it causes distrust and its very unattractive. You also compromise your own self-expression and it will actually work to decrease your self-esteem over time. Six Pillars of Self Esteem is an amazing book that covers this in depth. When you express the blockages in this way, over time they lose their power over you. You get it off your chest. Your mind can now start processing and reshaping how it views the world and how ridiculous many of the blockages you have are. Your limiting beliefs and emotional patterns will change, if applied correctly they change very fast. Carl Jung would say what you resist not only persists but will grow in size. By surrendering, and expressing the blockages they shrink in size over time. This is why so many guys end up hating the game quitting pick-up after a few years or rely on alcohol. All the suppressed emotions from wearing pick-up masks take its toll. Everything they are resisting and covering up via external models grows over time. It takes effort to manipulate your own expression to maintain an image of someone you are not. Benefits from applying honesty and being authentic overtime... 1. All your internal blockages decrease over time and game becomes effortless Once you have removed the blockage to approach, express yourself with a full range of emotions, move the interaction forward and removed a bunch of bullshit beliefs. Game is now effortless. Say goodbye to \-Approach anxiety \-Second guessing yourself and overthinking. \-Not being able to move interactions forward. \-Downward spirals and state crashes. \-Low self-esteem. \-Putting hot girls on pedestals. 2. You start having amazing connections and girls stay in your life When you drop your mask, girls reciprocate by dropping their masks. You are now interacting with the real girl. Strong connections are a natural progression of this. Welcome to a reality where girls \-Remember you and message you back and stop flaking \-Trust you faster and have sex with you faster \-Start hitting you up and chasing you 3. You feel much better about yourself. You experience huge increases in \-Self-esteem. \-Natural confidence. \-Happiness. \-Motivation 4. Your beliefs about women and yourself change You will start to see... \-That women dont care what you say but rather if you are owning what you say and if there is any incongruence (words and behavior/sub communications match) \-Girls love sex and will actually often help you make it happen when they sense no incongruence. They are on your team. \-Girls want to be approached \-Rejection in pick-up does not exist and is a misinterpretation of reality (that's for another post) 5. You become better company to be around and more charismatic in all areas of your life This one's obvious. E.g That moment at work when you know you should speak up, you find yourself naturally doing it, without hesitation. By removing the blockage to speak up in pick-up it transfers to all areas of your life. 6. You start to see clearly what you want and stop chasing validation By living with honesty and authenticity it extends to being honest with yourself. You start to see which of your behaviors are chasing validation and which ones are in alignment with what you want at a deep level. That could be a girlfriend, crazy experiences, one night stands or open relationships. Whatever it is it doesn't matter. The more you become clearer for what you want the more you will notice your expression optimizes to bring you this. In other words, you start going for what you want NOT what you think you want (e.g laycount). 7. There is no limit to your growth and it's completely sustainable."
75,vulnerability,seduction,Do You Want to Learn How to Hold a Conversation ? : Read This,13,at4s4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/at4s4f/do_you_want_to_learn_how_to_hold_a_conversation/,2019-02-22 03:02:53,"Did you know there are specific techniques you can use to have more meaningful conversations? People waste countless hours engaging in unproductive conversation. Many times, you have scheduled calls that go on for hours, or run into someone at a conference and kick off a seemingly endless conversation without much end product. These valuable hours can never be recovered. Here are some time tested techniques on how to hold a conversation that will improve your communication skills instantly. #1. Be an Active Listener : When you are in a conversation with someone you're always tempted to let your mind drift away and maybe think of what to say next. But that in turn affect your conversation. So you have pay attention to this person, to what they have to say and this single act doesn't only gives you the clue about what to say next but when someone notice you're genuinely interested in hearing what they have to say. It motivates this person to share more and more.  Have you ever been in a conversation where you were talking to someone and he doesn't seem to be present or seems not to be interested in what you're saying. How do you feel? Deep inside of you, you will have a negative feeling about the whole thing. You won't even have the urge to carry on the conversation. Not paying attention is one of the worst thing people do that kills a conversation even before it kicks off. Let's say you're busy and someone comes up to you and start making a small talk with you, and you really know that you can't give this person your full attention and you don't know what to do. Simply let the person know that he is intruding into something instead of hurting their feelings by giving them quarter of your attention. Or maybe draw this person into your own reality. How? Let's say you were busy thinking how to scale your business or how to make a particular girl fall in love with you and some random person strikes a conversation with you. What I do is to draw you into my own reality but it depends on the subject . Let's say I'm thinking about how to scale my business, I will just stop this person and ask for his opinion on how to scale a business successfully and when he answers, we continue the conversation based on what I want to talk about. With this technique I don't have any reason to be distracted. #2. Ask Open Ended Questions : For those of us who don't know what open ended questions means, it means questions that requires the other person to answer in details rather than a simple one word answers. For example, What do you think made Justin Bieber popular?How do I show her how much I love her? As you see, It provokes the listener to share his own ideas and thoughts in full details and you can pick up some few clues from what he said and keep the conversation moving with energy. Before we continue I would like us to get acquainted to what close ended questions also means. It means questions that could be answered by only one word (Yes or No) For example, Are you Shopping today?Would you marry me?. As you can see this question can only be answered either a Yes or a No and after that awkward silence and you will be totally lost in the journey to find what next to talk about. How do you ask the right questions? Always use open ended questions to start the conversation, because doing this you are setting the mood and energy of the whole interaction from the beginning .Whenever you ask a close ended question make sure to follow it up with an open ended question too. This causes the conversation not fail and makes you understand better. For example, you ask someone Do you have a pet? the other person answers Yes then you follow it up with  What advice would you give to someone who just got a new pet. the person won't worry about the close ended question you just asked but would be ready to invest in the conversation.Make sure you avoid using DO to ask questions because that's a worst conversation killer. It provokes no investment from the other personIf you can, Always try to transform all your close ended questions to an Open ended questions. Practice changing any close ended question you can think of to several Open ended questions.Practice will make you perfect. If you practice the art of asking the right questions, you will end up mastering not only the art of asking the right questions but also the art of making meaningful conversation. To lean more about Open ended questions Click here . #3. Don't Over Think it : This use to be the first advice I give when my student or someone ask me about keeping the conversation going either with a girl or anyone. Because it's all about your mindset. This is not only applicable to keeping a conversation going but to every areas of your life. When you are in a conversation and you're lost in your thoughts about what to say next, is it my turn to speak, Am I investing more than I should, the conversation will be over before it even starts. So when you're in a conversation instead of worrying about those things focus on what your goal is. Because you can't fly a plane if you don't have a particular destination in mind. You can't keep a conversation going if you don't know the reason why you're in the conversation in the first place. So before going into a conversation make sure you know exactly what you want to get out of that conversation, your end result. It can be anything. For example, whenever I approach a girl I always have in mind to enjoy myself as much I can and also let the girl enjoy herself too. So when you define this goals, your mind automatically starts working to accomplish them.  Relief the Tension Have you ever noticed that when you care less about the outcome of something or situation or project, anything it might be you tend to perform effectively. I don't mean losing your focus on something but to care less about it. For example, Let's say you start hitting the gym and all you think about is how to gain big muscles in 2 days, you will notice that you end up getting frustrated and overwhelmed and you end up doing nothing. But let's say you care less about getting big muscles fast, but you're focused on your goal of getting in shape, you will see the whole thing as a gradual process. And when you continue putting the effort you will start seeing improvement in no time. That's the same with making conversation, when you focus on your goals, it might be to have fun, very soon as the conversation keep going you will start seeing little improvement and the conversation gradually turns into a fun and meaningful one. #4. Make Sure The Other Person is Open to make the Conversation :  Imagine you're in a conversation with someone who is not interested in making a conversation at the moment or not interested in the topic, I bet you will read that immediately because they won't be investing into the conversation as much as you do. Even more how do you know someone is not Open to hold the conversation How fast do you find common ground with this person? Since this conversation is between you both, it's required for both of you to invest equal amount of energy to hold the conversation and make it fun. You start a conversation with someone and you're busy searching for a common ground and the person is not doing the same, that's a sure sign he doesn't want to hold the conversation at all. Maybe he just wants a quick small talk.What's their body language telling you, this one is the most important if you want to know if someone is interested in holding the conversation. Does he have a closed body language? Or his feet pointing away from you which means he's on the go. If so, you might consider ending the conversation. I'm Available After some series of studies, I came to realize that the best people to talk to is people who are available, open and really interested in the subject matter. Because now both of you have a lot to contribute. And to be hold this conversation as long as you want, you have to make the whole conversation about this person because people love talking about topics related to them. How can you see if someone wants to continue talking? #5. Be Vulnerable : For me, Vulnerability is the art of sharing your experiences, your stories in order to provoke the other person to share theirs. You get it right.  For example, I want the person I'm talking to to tell me more about her childhood, I can spark that interest in her to share it with me simply by sharing a little incident that happened when I was a kid. This confirms to the person that since you shared yours that means you will also be comfortable to hear theirs and it makes it easier for them. I want you to know something, some percentage of conversation don't go anywhere not because you're not good in holding conversation but maybe the other person is not comfortable to share. Sharing is Caring If you can get this person to start sharing, automatically he starts caring more about the conversation and where the conversation is going. In Game we call it investing. When you get a girl to invest in the conversation, that's the beginning of building rapport and attraction. The only tool I use to gauge the performance of a conversation is the level of investment the other person is putting in. So when it seems like the other is not investing much, trigger the urge in them by sharing your story or experience in such a way that will get their interest. Learn how to tell a Story. #6. Be Observant : To be observant here I mean to be able to notice things, both usual and unusual things. This particular skill is one of the backbone of my conversational skills. Matter of fact I can hold any conversation as long as I want by just being observant. This is a skill and it takes time to develop if you keep working on it. Let assume you approach a girl, immediately you notice her hair, smell, fashion sense(maybe an unusual style) etc. This will become your super power if you are good at it. Because you could just strike up a conversation with anybody, anywhere without even thinking about it. This is also important because when you notice something unusual, that people don't normally notice. And make a comment about it or give her a compliment, only that single action will make you stand out from rest of the other guys out there. Observe the Environment Only Observing the person is not enough to help you hold the conversation, if you can notice things happening around you could make a quick comment or quick joke to move the conversation towards a particular direction. For example, let's say you're on a date with a beautiful woman and you notice a painting hanging on the wall of the restaurant, you could use that particular painting to make conversation about things like museums, art galleries, or even get her to talk about her experience and how she loves painting. I hope you get the point. #7. Find Common Ground : How do you feel when you're talking to someone and both of you are sharing your experiences about a particular topic? You feel amazing , right? . You don't want the conversation to end because both of you are having fun. That's because both of you found a common ground. Common grounds means something or topic that both of you are interested in. It can be about anything. For example, let's say I love approaching women and you do too. When we both meet up, it's going to be mind blowing because you have a lot of experience to share with me about approaching girls and on my side I have a lot to share too. So the conversation becomes more of investing. How do you find common ground? Simply by asking, if you don't ask you are not going to know. So ask him about his hobbies, about his passion and aspirations and from their answers you can clearly know if you two have something in common. #8. Stay Up to Date :  Finally stay up to date. Nothing can help you more when you're stucked in a conversation than making a comment about an interesting news update you read that morning. To be honest, this single act of staying up to date have helped me multiple times. Even the masters do get stuck. Nobody is perfect. So that's why I also use this and I always advice my student to use this technique as well. Secondly, not only about being up to date but it's also about knowing when to use them. You might just start talking about a particular news update maybe politics and this other person is not interested in politics , what do you think will happen. The conversation will drop like a fat rock. First of all, to be effective with this skill , you have to know what their interests are. For example, the other person is interested in mountain climbing. And you saw a great news about mountain climbing that morning, what do you think? You use it to your own benefit. Reading news update regularly it's very important because you might use what you read about today to make a conversation in the next few weeks. So you don't know when it will be useful. That's my strategies to hold a conversation as long as you want. I hope I gave you all you wanted. If so, kindly share this post. Today I'm so happy.

Body Language &amp;#x200B; **Have a firm projected voice and good eye-contact when your speaking?** *Check* **Don't overly fidget or laugh nervously for no reason?** *Check* **Walk with with open body language, chin up and shoulders back?** *Check.* **Smile and remember peoples names when you meet them?** *Check* &amp;#x200B; Heres the thing. Women are efficient as hell at reading energy and vibes. While guys have great logical x + y + z thinking and technical ability, women are more in tune with social energy and peoples vibes. Especially when it comes to reading guys energy, and especially if youre an attractive female who gets hit on a fair amount. **The moment you give her an energy of neediness/fear/clinginess/discomfort, she can instantly feel it.** Its completely unconscious for her especially if youre actually *pursuing her.* Women are like mirrors, they *reflect* our energy. If you are comfortable and care-free, she will feel that and begin to be as well. If you are nervous and stiff, she will feel that and begin to reflect those feelings too. **The moment you have shitty weak body language you essentially friendzone yourself before you even open your mouth man.** &amp;#x200B; That being said, it isnt the end of the world you can definitely turn it around by actually *speaking to her* but these are the initial things you should keep in mind that can automatically *slant* things against you before you **even begin.** *They are also good social habits to have in general with people for alot of reasons.* &amp;#x200B; &gt;For example, good eye contact and remembering peoples names instantly makes them remember you much better and associate you in a positive light. Theres no sweeter sound to a person than just hearing their name especially in a happy tone. Lots of people dont bother to remember names so when you are able to while having barely known someone, it goes a *long way in your impression with people.* **Do not go with the soft hi hello how are you mindless small-talk that we are conditioned to have in society.** Infact notice how you even SPEAK when you do say those *robotic things.* 1. Does your voice kind of raise a bit, especially at the end of the sentence? *Stop that.* 2. Do you find your pitch in your vocal to be softer and more safe? *Stop that.* Fill the room with your **booming voice**, embrace your *masculine energy.* &amp;#x200B; # Be Present in the Moment. In addition to building these good habits, because your brain has determined what confident positive body language looks like.. When you begin to walk and talk with more open body language, eye-contact, and a firm voice. You will actually begin to FEEL more confident and positive as your body will now align with your subconscious interpretation of confidence. It will happen on an unconscious level. They will feed into eachother. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # 2. Friendzone her first &amp;#x200B; **Thats right.** Friendzone her *first.* &amp;#x200B; It is the most diabolical possible thing you can do to a beautiful girl especially *early on in a conversation.* Really it should be illegal in all 50 states. Most beautiful girls have guys constantly swooning over them and hitting on them with an energy of neediness and pressure. Guys are like dogs. Girls are like cats. The mating dance is alot like a cat playing with string, if you just throw the fucking *string at the cats head hes just gonna look at you like wtf man?* If you hold the string *way too far*, **the cat wont react either.** &gt;But if you put the string JUST out of reach of the cat, it will now chase the string. The hot/cold, night/day, push/pull dualistic contrast is what creates tension. It is the root of attraction. The secret you haven't been told. Just look at two ends of a magnet. This is what youre basically doing when you communicate to a beautiful girl you just started speaking that you arent necessarily into them, or see them platonically. &amp;#x200B; **You can do this 2 ways:** &amp;#x200B; **1. You can casually communicate to her that you view her platonically.** \- One way could be telling her that she has a cool vibe and she reminds you of a friend you used to have. (Say a females name) &gt;**\[Ex: You have a really cool energy by the way. You kind of remind me of this friend I used to haved named Tiffany. She was so cool, she was like a sister to me.\]** \- You can communicate that you have a girlfriend. Many normal guys talk about how when they have a girlfriend thats when suddenly girls seem to be coming onto them. This is no coincidence. By having a girlfriend you are essentially forbidden fruit, the string just out of reach. *- You can casually tell her she reminds you of your younger sister or cousin.* &gt;**\[Ex: You actually have a really cool energy, its adorable. It kind of reminds me of my younger cousin, shes super down to earth and mature for a kid.\]** *- You can just flat out tell her shed make a cool friend.* &gt;**\[Ex: Hey you actually have a really cool vibe. I can tell youd make a really cool friend.\]** &amp;#x200B; **2. You can put her in the friendzone in a more flirty &amp; teasing angle.** &gt;\[Ex: You have a really down to earth vibe. You could totally be my evil little sidekick. We can rob banks together. I shoot, you drive. Oh wait, your a woman....okay, I drive you sit on my lap and shoot.\] &gt; &gt;\[Ex: \*Hi-5\* I actually really like your energy and vibe its super adorable. If I wasnt gay you would totally make an amazing future ex girlfriend. &gt; &gt;\[Ex: Can I be honest with you for a second? \*pause\* You actually have a really cool energy its adorable. I would totally adopt you as my new little bratty sister. Well drink kool aid and climb trees. But no incest fantasies okay? No really, Im serious.\] &gt; &gt;\[Ex: You probably get complimented on your looks alot but to be honest you actually have a really amazing energy and vibe. Its so amazing, that we could literally never get along. Were too alike, wed eventually fight and divorce and Id take half your stuf. It just wouldnt be fair to the kids.\] **These are a mixture of classic and original awesome things I still unconsciously say til this day especially when I meet a beautiful girl that I can sense feels a sense of superiority and views me as an average guy.** To the typical beautiful girl, these comments are something they NEVER HEAR. It COMPLETELY flips their world upside down when you do the OPPOSITE of what most guys do. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # 3. Give her platonic nicknames &amp;#x200B; **This is another quick tip to further play from the angle of being casual and carefree about the relatonship between you and the girl.** You are impartial, if you become lovers, awesome, if you are just friends, *cool*. If you never see her again for the rest of your life, *thats fine.* &amp;#x200B; &gt;A cool way to do this is to simply give girls nicknames that are either teasing on something personal, or completely neutral and unsexy. &amp;#x200B; ***For example,*** if a girl says she used to have really buck teeth when she was a kid and had braces. You could playfully greet her with *hey bugs* the next time you see her. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Or an example of a neutral nickname could simply be calling the girl wherever shes from. So say shes from Pennsylvania. You could greet her the next time you see her with oh hey pennsylvania, whats up? &amp;#x200B; **That one is a favorite of mine and always cracks me up seeing the reactions of pretty girls when they simply get called their hometown.** For some reason its always consistently hilarious regardless of wheres shes from. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ &amp;#x200B; # 4. Show various sides of yourself, don't try to be cool. ***Alot of guys when they begin to make the transformation from timid and awkward to more confident and playful/teasing with girls...*** They tend to let their *ego get in the way* and instead of being honest with girls regardless of whether they stay or not, they choose to instead *protect their ego and pride* in moments of vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; &gt;True strength in communication does not come from appearing tough or strong when you dont necessarily feel that way. True social strength comes from being to communicate your feelings open and honestly with people and standing on it. Anybody can communicate awesome shit, it takes a different person to be able to communicate their vulnerabilities and weaknesses and be honest about it. &amp;#x200B; Girls are attracted to not just alpha or dominant characteristics. They are attracted to seeing the passion and emotion being displayed from you in a dominant manner. Not the actual emotion. You can cry a million tears and girls will feel deeply compassionate and attracted to you when they see the non ""alpha"" parts of you, as long as you do not sacrifice your character in doing so. **Not only that, but it is impossible to get girls to open up about their personal life, and vulnerabilities if you dont first do so.** And if you do manage to get her to open up and moments where she wasnt cool or awesome, sad moments, tragedies...but you dont relate any of your own back? *You will not be seeing her again.* The faster you can dive into truly personal story topics that arent all sunshines and rainbows, the faster you will be able to really connect with girls in a solid way that wont flake on you later. This is possible the most important thing on this list. # 5. Be physical, but not creepy. **If youre too touchy, lean your body language to her constantly, hover over her, look over at her for approval during witty comments you make**...you will *turn her off.* &amp;#x200B; &gt;But if you do not ever touch her at all, you will equally creep and turn her off. You cant just never touch a girl ever basically and then suddenly ask her out or try to kiss her. &amp;#x200B; When you meet her, shake her hand make *good eye contact*; **smile.** &amp;#x200B; &gt;Give her high fives for cool things she says. Do it with enthusiasm. Highfives will subconsciously break down the barrier of school/work small talk mode into actual real conversations and connection. &amp;#x200B; 1. **Touch her casually on the arm/shoulder briefly.** **2. Playfully hit her or turn away from her like your appauled by her.** **3. Touch a necklace of hers and ask where she got it from and what it means to her.** **4. Measure your hand next to yours.** **5. Thumb wrestle.** **6. Playfully pinky love.** etc etc.... The more casual and relaxed your ENERGY IS, the more she will feel natural and not weirded out by these *brief and slowly escalating physical push/pull exchanges.* &amp;#x200B; # 6. Do not ""ask her out"", but simply go for a coffee. &amp;#x200B; **Growing up in school we tend to behave in a way where essentially you wait around and if you happen to hear that a girl happens to like you.** You then proceed to awkwardly *ask her out* which essentially isnt actually asking her out to a physical date but instead meaning *you are now dating.* &gt;Even adults to a certain degree behave in this manner. Many guys will treat asking a girl out as basically THE determining does she like me indicator. When in reality the more PRESSURE you put on the idea of a first date between you two the more you sacrifice your power, the more slack you give the string. Instead treat it as a casual coffee date. Dont hype it up as some huge thing. Simply say your going for coffee and she should tag along real quick. *Infact if anything you should tease HER about it NOT being a date and not planning to make any moves on you missy.* You want to talk to her enough to relate on a level where you can now get her to see for casual coffee but make it clear theres no pressure. A good way to do that is to role reverse and warn HER not to hit on YOU. Because youre not that kind of guy or girl. Either way is hilarious. I usually like saying girl it kills me every time even years later. &amp;#x200B; # 7. Make a move damnit. &amp;#x200B; **Okay so youre on the date. So far so good, it seems to be going well.** Shes *laughing*, shes relating *back stories about her life and family as are you*. Everything is feeling good, shes giving you *good eye contact* and not completely freaking out when you **touch her** occasionally. For all intents and purposes, it seems like *she likes you.* The very fact that she went out on this coffee date in the first place is indicative of things being *slanted in your favor.* So feel good dude, **you made it this far.** &gt;But now its time to make a move. Im not going to get into specific kissing techniques that will be available in future updates but I wanted to tackle on something even more key. &amp;#x200B; **The fundamental act of not giving a shit.** You have to not care *if you get rejected for a kiss. It means nothing.* &gt;It isnt the end of the world nor does it mean she doesnt like you. It may simply just not be the right time, it may be too early or you may have no established enough romance and comfort yet. Dont get butthurt, dont let your ego get in the way. **Just think Johnny Bravo.** Laugh it off. Act like its *no big deal,* tease her that you werent actually going to kiss her **anyways.** You cannot get discouraged. Infact, fuck kissing for a moment. ***This applies to everything down to the FUNDAMENTAL CORE of your esteem with females, no mattter how beautiful. Its irrelevant.*** # You CAN NOT GET DISCOURAGED. It doesnt matter how many rejections or harsh situations you have to fight til the bitter end in not just this if you want to make a change with women, but with everything in life. &gt;In basketball, even if youre ice cold, you have to shoot every jumper like you absolutely expect to make it. It doesnt matter if you missed 15 straight before that and dont want to embarass yourself. # Stop playing to NOT LOSE and start PLAYING TO WIN. &amp;#x200B; \---------------------------------------- Personal Message ----------------------------------------------------- ***This is Jin and I wanted to dedicate this brief message to say thanks for taking the time to read this piece it means alot to me to possibly help REPEAT the circle of transformation for someone else like it happened for me.*** As your reading this, whatever your feeling, understand that another human has felt that same feeling. You are *not* alone. **I know what hesitation and horrible habits social anxiety can build and do to people not just with their love life, but with how proactive they are with their family, loved ones, and** ***goals in life.*** Be a *beacon of honesty* that others can seek *solace in*. Even if it means showing *your full hand*. &gt;Others will follow you for liberating them to be themselves as well by seeing you expose your own hand. **True strength will be when you are completely honest with yourself and others.** *Only then will the weight of social interaction bear little on your shoulders.* Because it will no longer be a performance for the public. You will be present in the moment. ***Free yourself from this social shell society has placed you in.*** \- Jin, &amp;#x200B; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ &amp;#x200B; \[**Subscribe &amp; Comment** to our free [Seduction Unleashed Channel](URL if you dig this *fire content and want to see more*.

77,vulnerability,seduction,[FR] Showing vulnerability in the right way. I think.,1,agm76o,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/agm76o/fr_showing_vulnerability_in_the_right_way_i_think/,2019-01-17 02:26:34,"Most of us here have read 'Models', and being 'vulnerable' is perhaps one of the trickiest aspects of the book. Last night, I had a date where I just naturally ended up doing it right - so I thought I'll share. Matched this girl on a dating app, talked on and off for a couple of weeks. Very shallow conversations, but I asked her out for a rather interesting date and she agreed. Girl was a lot hotter in person that her pictures suggested, a solid 8 at the very least. Plus she's smart. Alcohol helps me overcome my immediate nerves, and we do well conversing. We vibe really well, end up talking for about 4 hours until the place closes down and we decide to take a walk. Just as we are leaving to take the walk, I go in for the kiss - she obliges. Another hour passes, with more talking and a lot more kissing. Now it's time to call it a night - it's past midnight and we both have day jobs. Logistics are shit, with both of us 20 mins on opposite side of the city by cab. But just as I am about to say goodbye, I go: ""I know this isn't the best of ideas, but as a guy I have to ask - do you wanna come over?"" And she did. The rest of the night took it's own course. Now that I think of it, this isn't the first time something like this happened. Girls are tired of tame excuses, and are also sick of overtly macho maneuvers. Just be honest, be vulnerable, and it may work out better than you expected."

The sense of self-esteem and self-importance you carry should be massive because it is your shield  not your vulnerability. Even I have said words to the effect of dude just go approach that girl so what if she rejects you, stop worrying about your ego so what if she rejects you. But if he had enough self-esteem then the rejection wouldnt bother him. Let me tell you about a speech a high school PE teacher once gave me and I remember the words so clearly believe in yourself because you can do anything and my father didnt believe in me, I could have been a sports star but he told me I couldnt so I didnt even try. If you allow fear of failure and the opinion of others to dissuade you from trying you will end up wondering if you could have done it. On the flip side if your ego is so fragile that you wont try because you would rather believe *I could have done it I just didnt want to* the rest of your life, what a waste. My point being you need to learn to wield your ego and use it as a positive tool. Above we can see a large ego that is out of control can destroy your life. Imagine if you had the self-esteem to try and fail without labelling yourself a failure. Just imagine what you could do if you had enough self-importance to believe that it is worth changing yourself for the better, because you deserve a better life. Become your own focus and grow your ego but use it wisely. Think of your ego as a iron ore, at first it is in the dirt, you must sift through the crap to extract and refine your self worth. However, until you do the work to turn it into something of use it will just weigh you down. So you adopt a so called ""alpha mentality"" and read some self help writings for a quick fix. Just like quenching something you heated and hammered away at too quickly the result is something brittle and fragile which will let you down. Take your time and forge your ego into armour that protects you from fear, the only way you will know if you have done it properly is to go out and take a hit, chance that rejection. If it shatters that is okay too take the time to put the pieces of yourself back together again the longer you work on it the stronger you will become."" &amp;#x200B; **Hey guys I know I am posting a lot but here is a couple paragraphs from a book I am writing/course I am developing.

79,vulnerability,seduction,Why pickup may be leading you astray and how tantra can help you,1,a9nttm,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/a9nttm/why_pickup_may_be_leading_you_astray_and_how/,2018-12-26 22:23:26,"If you have done pickup for a while, but you are not feeling satisfied with the way you relate to women, try focusing on creating intimacy instead of getting laid. This will allow you to interact with women in deeper and more fulfilling ways. **My story:** I first heard about pickup in 2009 as a 19 year old. A friend gave me a copy of the mystery method and soon after I discovered RSD. Initially I just watched their free videos and I started applying some of the principles they taught. In the beginning I only sporadically approached in clubs always after having a few drinks. At this stage I cared more about immediate results than about improving my game. For the next 8 years I dabbled around in pickup and I started to naturally interpret womens behaviour in terms of the concepts and categories taught in the pick up world. In 2017 I attended a bootcamp and several other seminars with RSD instructors. I quit alcohol completely and started to approach pickup as a deliberate practice. I went out with a fellow bootcamp graduate on Friday and Saturday nights and we engaged in 4 hours of deliberate practice each night. We focused on the hardest sets in the club. Sets with many men and few women, couples making out, seated groups - anything that induces anxiety and that pushes you outside your comfort zone. We would pick sets for each other and hold each other accountable for staying in each set for at least 2 minutes, even if the set was unresponsive or hostile. In the beginning these nights raised my adrenaline levels to an extent that I could hardly sleep. It was fucking scary. I was sometimes getting nervous by mid week thinking about the coming weekend. At this point I was focused on personal development. I wanted social freedom and an abundance of attractive and interesting women in my life at any cost. After a few months of high intensity practice, I started questioning whether this approach was really going to get me what I wanted, so I started looking at other options again. In 2018 I went on several courses in tantric sexuality. These courses showed me a way to relate to women that I find a lot more satisfying. I learned to have much more genuine, intimate and meaningful interactions with the women I meet. I also started to have a lot of great sex of a kind that I didnt even know was possible. I feel grateful for the things I learned in the pickup community, but for me pickup is not the endgame. It gets you only so far. And sometimes it can lead you astray and obscure the path to the things that deeply fulfil you. There are many reasons why guys start to do pickup. Some want to have a girlfriend, lots of sex with a variety of attractive women, or prove something to themselves and the world. Ultimately I think there is one thing worth striving for that will make most people a lot happier and that is deeply fulfilling intimacy. With intimacy I mean interactions in which you and the woman you desire are both present, authentic and feel completely at ease, you feel close to each other, you see her, and you feel seen as you are - theres no holding back, there are no filters, there are no goals, all that matters now is this interaction. Intimacy is not only possible in long term relationships. It can often be created in a couple of hours or a couple of dates. If that sounds all too fluffy and all you want to do is have lots of sex I encourage you to bear with me. Give intimacy a try and see what it feels like. Intimacy is very rewarding in itself, but it is also the foundation for truly mind-blowing sex. **The logic of pickup: focusing on goals** I will first look at a few claims that I often encounter in the pickup community and discuss how they can create a goal oriented mindset that can often lead you away from fulfilling intimacy. I will then explain what you can do instead if you would like more intimacy and explain further why intimacy is probably what you are ultimately looking for. Lets look at the following claims: 1. If you master the game you will be happy. 2. Regardless of whether you just want to have casual sex or you want to find a girlfriend: The process is always the same: Approach, play the game, have sex. After that you can decide whether you want to see her again or move on. 3. Clubs are a perfect place to practice. Go out several nights a week. Here you can find the most attractive women. Once youve learned how to succeed here, you can apply the same methods anywhere. 4. Forget what kind of women you would like to meet. Get good at the game. Once you are getting 9s and 10s in clubs youve seen it all. Then you can decide what type of woman you really like. The first claim is often not made explicitly, but it is part of the marketing of the pickup industry. In moments where you are alone at home, and wish that you would meet women that truly excite you, or at least have good sex this claim starts to feel convincing. You watch too many YouTube videos and you think, If I could only do what these guys are doing my life would be great. This can lead to a single-minded obsession with getting good at pickup. You focus on getting good at pickup and what is valued in the pickup community, rather than reflecting on whether what you are doing is actually giving you what you need. You trust that pickup artists have figured it all out and that you just need to keep on following the laid out path. It has happened to me and many of my friends. Sometimes other areas of my life would suffer, because my focus on pickup was crowding out other interests. I was getting laid more often, but not necessarily happier. After a successful night out, I usually felt good about myself. It is nice to feel awesome about the epic things youve dared to do on a night out and get an ego boost from getting laid. But this effect usually wouldnt last very long and I wasnt having the interactions with women that I really wanted to have. There wasnt much intimacy. Having sex with the woman you desire is generally accepted as the goal of the process. It is understood that there are different stages, and you learn techniques to move through these stages smoothly. You take action, you look at the reactions you get, you calibrate and adjust, and take the next step towards the goal of having sex. For a long time I would try to move the interaction towards sex as quickly as possible. I generally find status games and shit tests rather annoying and had gotten used to idea that you first had to have sex before you could relax together and get to know each other properly. This goal orientation towards sex, together with believing that I had to take certain steps in the right way prevented me from fully relaxing. It also sometimes distracted me from truly getting to know the women in front of me. I would think about escalating to the next stage, rather than asking myself how to make the present experience of relating to the woman in front of me more enjoyable and meaningful. The way the pickup industry portrays the path to happiness it looks very well defined: claims three and four work together in convincing you that you should go to clubs and learn to master the rules of social interactions in this setting. Clubs tend to favour high-energy approaches and showmanship. It is loud, there are many distractions and you need to be able to keep her attention and lead. The environment and the mental state that the women are in are often not conductive to creating intimacy. Most women are looking for a light and fun experience, not for a deep conversation. Compared to day game, clubbing is likely to focus you even more on goals and procedures. Especially hard sets in clubs are often unforgiving: There is more pressure to ""get things right immediately. To sum up: pickup is goal oriented. You do what is necessary to have sex with the women you desire. You follow the steps. Clubs are an environment that strengthens goal orientation and limits the potential for intimacy. **The logic of intimacy: being real and focusing on the present moment** Intimacy follows a different logic: it is about finding the place where two people can authentically meet and relate. Being authentic means that you truly express what you feel and think. People find it easier to do this when they feel safe. One factor that helps to create safety is integrity. By integrity I mean that you stick to your word. If you are perceived as having integrity you can create a safe environment by explaining what you are going to do and what you are not going to do, because others are able to believe you. Authenticity and integrity are valuable not just because of the effects that they have on others, but primarily because they allow you to feel good about yourself. Creating false impressions, lying, living in contradictions and deceiving others doesnt feel good. If you get laid from creating false impressions or manipulating emotions it is unlikely that you will experience intimacy. How can you feel truly seen and connected to another person when you havent allowed them to see who you truly are? Being authentic sometimes requires saying things that make you feel vulnerable. This can be uncomfortable. If the honest answer to a question you are asked involves sharing something that you are afraid of or that makes you look weak from the perspective of mainstream thinking stick to expressing the truth, dont try to look cool. This may seem scary in the beginning, but the more you do it, the more it can become a source of strength. I often feel most empowered in the moment when I look most vulnerable. What is going on in my mind in these moments is this: I have fully put myself out there, there is nothing Im trying to hide. I waste no mental energy trying to protect a made up image of how I want others to see me. Ive stopped playing the trying to look good game. When you open up in this way and show vulnerability other people are more likely to open up themselves. You both will be able to talk about your hopes, fears, desires and the things that really matter to both of you. This doesnt just apply to dating. Do it with your colleagues, friends and family and you will form deeper relationships. The idea that this kind of sharing is creating intimacy has been corroborated by psychological research. To get a taste of what this kind of sharing might look like you can try The 36 Questions that Lead to Love developed by \[Arthur Aron et al. 1997\]([URL and explained in \[this\]([URL New York Times Article. When Im on dates Im not following these questions as a protocol. I use a few of them occasionally. Take them as examples of the kind of conversation topics that can allow the two of you to share vulnerabilities. Most people are only willing to operate from this authentic, transparent place when they feel safe. Status games, negs and shit tests are the enemy of intimacy. If you feel like she is going to challenge you in any moment with a shit test, you are less likely to share things that make you feel vulnerable. If she thinks you are going to make fun of her or put her down in some way, she wont be able to relax either. A frame that supports intimacy is this: ""whatever happens is okay, I wont judge, you are safe. You dont need to say this, but you can show it through your actions. You may be worried that without status games and witty banter the interaction may be boring, but power dynamics are not the only way to create excitement. The combination of being present and authentic while moving towards depth and intensity can be exhilerating. In my experience this combination goes deeper than the fun of lightly joking around. That being said, light hearted fun can be great way to connect. But make sure that you dont engage in negging or humour that plays on her insecurities or puts her down. So how do you end status games and shit tests? There is one tantric exercise that I do on almost all of my dates and that is eye gazing. You may need to gain a little bit of trust and rapport before a woman is willing to do the exercise with you. Sometimes I do it within the first 10 minutes of meeting her, sometimes after an hour or later. You find a place where the two of you can sit opposite to each other. You look into each others eyes for 2 minutes (or longer). I usually set a timer on my phone. This creates clarity and is an invitation to take this exercise seriously. You look into each others eyes and you dont engage in small talk. It is admissible to express feelings, desires and requests but it is not necessary. Whatever you share with each other is about what is happening right now within each of you and between the two of you. You only do what has been agreed. When looking into each others eyes there is giving and taking, seeing and being seen - it is not a staring competition. You will introduce all of these rules of engagement to her in the beginning. In order to introduce the exercise I sometimes talk a bit about tantra, but a short Id like to do a 2 minute experiment with you - this is how it works: .. are you willing to try? usually also works. Often I end up doing eye gazing for more than two minutes. Once you have done two minutes, both of you feel probably comfortable to do more eye gazing without a timer. When you start looking into her eyes, notice the sensations in your body, and notice her facial expressions. You might feel nervous, excited, relaxed, attracted to her, there may be tingling sensations in your body or you might feel sad. Whatever you feel: It is okay to express it. Since she has probably never done this exercise before it is helpful if you can express first what you feel. After looking into each others eyes for a while I often start feeling relaxed, open and there are tingling sensations in my chest. I share this. If your eye gazing partner is a compulsive status player or afraid of intimacy, it can be difficult to get her to take the exercise seriously and not see it as another game. She may start giggling in the first 30 seconds. Thats a protective mechanism not to allow intimacy. She may just be nervous. Give it a bit more time. The real exercise starts when you are both relaxed and start to feel what is happening. If I feel like the woman is treating the exercise like a status game, I sometimes call her out on that behavior. If this goes well the result is a conversation about intimacy and what is scary about allowing an intimate contact in this moment. This conversation about intimacy can create intimacy itself if both of you are authentic. Finally, if even this doesnt work I drop the exercise and move on to something else. If I have the feeling that she is a compulsive status player and unlikely to ever be authentic, vulnerable and willing to engage in an intimate way, I usually lose interest. If you want to engage in her game, then revert to standard pickup methods for the rest of the evening and forget about intimacy. While eye gazing, you can also make requests like I would like to hold your hand, how would that be for you?. Make requests when it feels right. There may be a difference between what your mind says you want and what your heart and body are telling you. Go with your heart and body. This may be challenging when you come from a pickup mindset and have been working under the assumption that what you should want from a woman is always to have sex with her now. When Im looking into the eyes of an attractive woman for the first time I might be able to *think* that having sex with her would be fun, but my heart and body are rarely telling me that I want to have sex with her right now. It is much more likely that I want to hold her hand, move a bit closer to her, or express something that I feel. Theres no need to rush. Stay attentive to her posture and facial expressions. Some women might not express any feelings themselves unless they are prompted to do so. Reading someones feelings correctly and stating them out loud can be extremely powerful. It makes her feel that you understand her. I recently went on a date with a woman who was looking into my eyes attentively but did not share any feelings. I noticed that she looked a bit sad, so I told her I have the impression that you are sad. She nodded. I asked her whether she wanted to share what is making her sad. She told me I cant. I felt like giving her a hug, so I made the offer and she accepted. This moment felt magical and from then on we were both totally at ease with each other. If you feel like you would like to be more physical with your eye gazing partner, I suggest making any advance in a slow and careful way. I almost always ask before I take her hand, hug her or kiss her. Sometimes it is so obvious that she wants to be kissed that I dont ask. But in that case I move slowly. Asking explicitly and checking in with her is good, because it creates trust and it allows you to demonstrate your integrity. It is safe for her to do these kinds of exercises with you because you only do what you say you will do. You are not tricking her into anything that she hasnt agreed to do or try to exploit her trust. Usually this is not the last tantra exercise that Im going to do with her during the night and I want to progressively build up trust. When you express emotions first and make requests, she might start to do the same. I recently went on a date in a park, and after I had told my date during eye gazing that I would like to hold her hand, she suggested that we lie down in the grass and cuddle. In my pickup days I would carefully match kino escalation steps to moments in which the woman was on an emotional high trying to get the timing right. I havent had these worries in a long time. Just express what you feel like doing when you feel like doing it. Sometimes your pickup habits can get in the way of creating intimacy. I've only experimented with these new methods for the last 6 months, so sometimes my old habits still find their way to the surface. I had gotten used to apply the walk and talk method when trying to take a date home: Keep talking and as long as shes entertained she wont be thinking much about where you are taking her. At some point my date asked me where we are going and I told her that were going to my place. She laughed: Nice try! Lets go to the station. We had already done a few tantra exercises earlier and been kissing and hugging, so I thought maybe this is just a shit test. I kept on walking to my place, and she went along with it. But when we were in my room and I suggested another exercise, she was less open than before and explained that she is not sure whether she can trust me after I brought her here, even though we were meant to go to the station. She explained that she still has feelings for her ex boyfriend and isnt quite ready to have sex with someone else yet. It took a while to restore her trust. I explained that we dont have to have sex today and she decided to stay. We still found many enjoyable ways to spend the night together. We didnt have sex and I didnt even try. Maybe I could have seduced her and pushed buttons to the point where she would have had sex with me despite her concerns, but I didnt want to interact with her in this way. Finding the point where she could meet me authentically felt more rewarding. The sex that you will have with a woman after both of you have opened up emotionally and feel connected is going to be a lot better then the detached sex you are getting from a traditional pickup approach in a club. This story brings me to another opportunity for creating intimacy. When you notice hesitation or discomfort address it, instead of distracting away from it. You could say: I have the impression that youre a bit tense. Is there something you are concerned about?. Often when I do this, women express what is bothering them. This allows me to show that I care and often come up with an idea that alleviates the tension. When the issue has been stated openly and been resolved, the result is usually a deeper level of intimacy. In the story above, the appropriate response to Lets go to the station would have been to find out what makes her hesitant or state upfront that I find her attractive, but that we dont have to have sex. I almost always feel good about dates in which there is a high degree of intimacy. Whether a date ends with sex or not is much less of a concern than it used to be. I still have plenty of sex but I dont evaluate my evenings based on a single metric. Focusing on intimacy and enjoying each moment ensures that I have a good time. Tantra even tries to take goal-orientation out of sex by avoiding ejaculation and clitoral orgasms. But thats a story for another post. I have done eye gazing when approaching in bars, but it usually works best in a quieter setting without distractions. All of the stories above have happened on dates from online dating or day game. A relaxed setting without too many distractions makes it easier to be present with each other and share thoughts and feelings freely. When you relate to women in this way it is also easy to convert a great night together into a regular dating arrangement. Since youve been acting with authenticity and integrity and there is a genuine intimate connection between you, she feels comfortable and knows what she is likely to get if she keeps seeing you. Mainstream pickup is good for getting laid, but it can create habits that prevent you from experiencing intimacy. If you are feeling that the quality of your connections to women is not satisfying, try to forget about getting laid for a moment and focus on sharing thoughts, feelings and desires authentically to create intimacy and form deeper connections. Im currently thinking about writing a blog about dating, intimacy, sex and other topics. Id love to get some feedback. Is this stuff interesting? would you like to learn more about tantric exercises?

80,vulnerability,seduction,The Strangest Breakthrough in Game - Being Casual,1,9xmygh,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9xmygh/the_strangest_breakthrough_in_game_being_casual/,2018-11-17 02:09:40,"I spent years understanding how sexual interest and attraction worked. Learning that connection was much larger than I had originally understood it to be. But this is the post about how it's easy to have sex without a connection. For a man who writes about self love and finding healthy emotional connections and avoiding validation seeking, this was a breakthrough I didn't anticipate having. Nevertheless, I'm sharing it. It's not uncommon on a date to realize I don't have a deep interest in the woman. She may not have one in me. I am presenting a vibe and communicating a kind of relationship she knows she isn't interested in. So why is it we are almost certain to still sleep with each other? The short answer is: being sexually viable is a kind of curiosity. And women are on occasion (regularly) hungry for a compelling sexual experience. Everyone knows sex is better when there is connection. But when there isn't a deep spark, there can still be authenticity. There can still be vulnerability (simply being what you really are and showing it, not suppressing it). In other words, you can still be trustworthy (be what you say you are, do what you say you will do). When you don't force it, when you don't LIE and act like there's some huge connection between you and the woman because you think that is what she wants even though you aren't feeling that way, your chances of having sex together remain high if you're otherwise sexually viable. If you have a sexual vibe - what some folks call male female frame - and you don't pretend to care when you don't, you don't dramatically reduce your chance for sex with many women. The power of curiosity is high. So is the power of a man who doesn't NEED her, so is a man who is confident he knows how to treat her, and what she will like. Critics might say ""that's just casual sex"" and that this is obvious. Intellectually it's obvious, but it was a huge mental breakthrough for me to understand the emotional and sexual dynamics behind casual sex. Understanding casual sex helped me to understand sex that comes from various connections. Casual sex is a very relevant part of the sexual dialogue between men and women that you will want to understand on your journey. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

So many contributors have helped to point out the complexities of seduction and game, as well as the larger issues of mental health, physical health, style, emotional intelligence, self-awareness, ambition, self-control, etc. which factor into our self-expression and relationships. I want to thank all the folks out there who's comments have helped to balance between feminist values and basic respect and human decency, with effective methods of bold approach, openness about (masculine) sexuality, and game. &amp;#x200B; Some background. I have never really had trouble with women in general, but definitely with connecting with women I actually find very attractive, and developing healthy relationships. I'm 22, but already I've been sober from drinking for two years. I used to rely substantially on alcohol to find reasons to be around women, as well as to have the courage to approach them. And while getting piss drunk or even black out drunk got me laid several times, it was obviously problematic in many other ways. What was harder than abstaining from alcohol was teaching myself how to socialize without it. Whereas on the booze I was boisterous, assertive, confident, etc. when sober I was often anxious, quiet, worried about offending people or being seen as a creep. I also had a lot of trouble just holding a conversation with a pretty girl in a bar, eg. speaking loud enough, not just walking off when I ran out of things to talk about. This is where r/Seduction came in. I had been subscribed for a while, but never really read the posts. But I started learning more about game. At first, it was the basic be-an-alpha-and-approach-girls-all-the-time kind of posts. But I also came to be exposed to more refined analysis, read Models which is such a fantastic book that everyone should start with, and came to understand what it was that I was doing wrong. While I had approached girls to ask for their numbers over the past few years, it wasn't a habit or skill of mine, and usually had no effective result. I hadn't realized that many girls will give you their real number even if they aren't interested. But I was constantly making excuses in my head and developing anxiety about all the beautiful girls that I saw in my life but never approached. That all changed at the beginning of the Summer, as I was just graduating from university. I began to day-game almost everyday. I would approach girls on the way to my classes, on the way to the gym, and I started just walking around my neighborhood to practice my approach. I met several girls this way, made it with a couple of them, and had a lot of fun with myself. A Japanese girl at the supermarket, a blondie Czech girl outside Chipotle who was by far the most beautiful girl I ever kissed, a girl who came straight to my room to smoke a blunt with me after we met, a hairdresser who cut my hair and then came over. I got to practice, practice, practice my posture, voice tone and pacing, conversation flow/topics, push-pull, and all of those basics. In fact i became very witty where I could generally pull a great turn of phrase to make something flirty on demand. I also started going thrifting and getting my fashion on-lock. I really enjoy dressing everyday. And I was working out and gaining weight. But I still was not as successful as I wanted to be, and in fact I had my heart broken by a girl from class who I had initiated with my newfound skill-set. I had really felt a connection with her but now I can see how I totally botched the relationship with my own insecurities and lack of self-awareness. So I kept researching because I felt that I wasn't making more progress. This is when I came across Models and learned more about 1. what women are actually attracted to, 2. How to deal with your own feelings in regards to dating. Since then I've found a lot more success. Just by focusing on doing everything in a genuine manner, regardless of whether I have the perfect line. Making myself vulnerable by telling girls how I feel about them, whether its a physical attraction or emotional, has been scary but delivered big results. It is so, so, so important for guys to take the initiative, and this applies not only to approach, physicality, escalation, etc but also to emotional vulnerability. At first I took this as sharing about the tough parts of my life, and this is obviously important. But far more direct is emotional vulnerability of how you feel towards the other person. I had stayed away from this because I never wanted to come on too strong and seem desperate. Especially with the girls I liked, I tried to exert self-control to NOT express my attractions and feelings. This was a big mistake. Girls can generally tell your intentions, and so I came across as not-confident for not sharing, AND desperate for trying so hard to play it cool. I'm not saying don't try to keep them guessing, but the results for me are that telling a girl directly how she makes you feel is going to make her comfortable enough to open up to you in the same way. You also just feel so much more confident because you get in the habit of doing what your heart is telling you. &amp;#x200B; One thing that I have definitely learned more about is gender and dating. As a feminist I want to say women and men should be treated equally, so just ignore gender. Don't approach women on the street because if they are into you they will let you know, etc. etc. But this is actually far from a feminist analysis. If we take a critical eye to patriarchy, we see that although gender is socially constructed, it is very real. Women and men, in general, live completely different daily experiences. The values that society projects onto them are different. And in dating, we see that the average attractive woman is likely to be hit on by men (and women) every day. But the average attractive guy may not be directly hit on all year. We have to take this as the given. If men get attracted to just one woman(one-itis), well she has guys flirting with her all the time, that is what we're competing with. So it really is up to men to put themselves out there to lots and lots of women, do a large portion of the initial work, plan the first date so that it is fun, etc. etc. Really spontaneous opportunities to flirt with women where you don't have to take at least a small leap of faith that they are interested are rare. Men have to approach women who may not be into them, and sometimes this will make women uncomfortable. Unfortunately there's no way around it, but I have found that 7/10 of my interactions with random women I have been able to make them happier, even if they don't end up giving me their number. 2/10 they are non-receptive but not annoyed/upset. And 1/10 times or less they are uncomfortable that a stranger is talking to them or are visibly annoyed you are bothering them. This is definitely my least favorite thing about game because I do not like making others uncomfortable or being perceived as a street harasser but as long as your intentions are pure then you just have to suck it up. Treat your partners with respect, but do not forget that y'all are probably pretty different, mainly by gender(assuming heterosexual relationship). The women who I have related to through emotional connection way are more beautiful, more cultured, and more interested in me than the ones from earlier this year or earlier in my life. I hope to find someone who is really special and enter into a more committed relationship. But for now I am continuing to meet women everyday. I feel better than I have in many years. Good luck to all of you, thanks for reading, and have a nice day. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Step three: force yourself to share the things you've learned from those experts with others. In the hobby group, ask others in the group to meet up later. Meet with them and do fun shit. Step four: write about what you want to accomplish with this new skill. Spend 8 minutes visualizing using it and how it will change you and what this new competency will feel like. Continue to engage in the social hobby, and consider reaching out to others who have the same hobby and seeing if you can link up.

Theres the fuck it method. Theres the do it to see what happens method. Theres the countdown method. One dude on here a while back was doing the Pennywise method. Thats right, he approached chicks at the bar by tossing them a red balloon. These methods are all great (except Im not sure about the Pennywise method), and there are certainly dozens more. However, if youre still unable to approach. If youre still just standing there. If you still turn into a knees knocking, hands sweating, legs trembling, heart throbbing, mouth babbling, blob of a human being, then heres another opener for you to consider: Be honest. Be straight up honest and tell her youre nervous as hell. I personally prefer nervous as fuck but you make your own choice. Its amazing the kind of relief honesty can provide. When youre nervous as hell and you approach a woman, trying to appear ***not*** nervous as hell, youre not being honest. Youre hiding something. Youre faking it. This not only makes you seem awkward in front of her, but it adds tons of weight to your own personal discomfort. Theres enough to think about when approaching a girl. Hiding the fact that youre nervous is just another thing to think about. So if you want to try this method, just walk up to her and say: Excuse me. Im really nervous as hell to tell you this, but I think youre really cute and I wanted to come say hi. You should find that by saying that, you will instantly feel much more at ease. It will also put her at ease because youve laid your cards out on the table and youre not trying to be some smooth PUA which she then needs to throw up defenses against. So when you say it, say it with a huge smile. Not a Im pretending to be confident smile but rather a what a relief smile. If you try this method, I guarantee you will get a huge smile from her and a thank you 9 times out of 10. Think about it, almost no girl is going to blast you for hitting on her if youre straight up honest (and show a touch of vulnerability) right from the start. Now youre in. The conversation is open. Take it from there. You wont get the number or the date every time. No one does. But you will get the number or the date more times than if you just stood there with knees knocking. Of course, you still should have your grooming and wardrobe put together when you do this. That should go without saying. Being nervous isnt an excuse for looking like shit. And if all else fails, try the Pennywise method. "
89,vulnerability,seduction,I know Models by Mark Manson gets thrown around a lot here; I just did a book summary video on it in case anyone hasn't had time to crack it open.,1,9jrr9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9jrr9t/i_know_models_by_mark_manson_gets_thrown_around_a/,2018-09-29 09:07:00,"Hey guys - I titled this video ""How to Date Like an Entrepreneur"" because from my perspective, dating is a numbers game. You succeed by achieving volume of exposure to opportunity. Your opportunities improve as you develop your product - yourself - and as you learn how to achieve product-market fit by aligning your lifestyle to the type of person you want to become. The concepts that lead to successful product launches are in many cases the same concepts that lead to the launch of an exciting, world-rocking relationship. &amp;#x200B; Here's the [summary video](URL and if you'd prefer to read, here's the transcript of my summary: &amp;#x200B; \------------------------------ &amp;#x200B; **INTRO** Before I get into this, I want to express that dating and relationships are extremely subjective and personal things and everyone is entitled to their own opinions and styles. My personal philosophies have evolved in a response to my experiences and so that's what you'll get here - Mark's philosophies filtered through mine. I don't think that they're right or wrong; they're just what work well for me and if you don't agree with some aspects of it, that's ok; I wouldn't expect every one of my opinions to reflect every one of yours. So feel free to take what works and discard the rest. &amp;#x200B; **MY BACKGROUND** It's probably worthwhile to share a bit of background on my approach to dating so you can understand the origins of my perspective. Back in college I suffered from pretty crippling anxiety. I had spent some time in foster care and I was a little shit when I was a kid and got into a ton of trouble that had me moving from town to town, school to school, home to home, and I didn't quite become socially calibrated at the same rate as my peers. So I entered college a bit socially, behaviorally, and psychologically handicapped and as a side effect of forced, rapid recalibration, I experienced some serious growing pains in the form of anxiety that still persists to some degree today. I was working nearly full time while pursuing an engineering degree and got involved in Greek life on top of all of that and so I was all kinds of stressed out and mixed up. &amp;#x200B; The one aspect of my social life that gave me comfort during those four years of chaos was my interaction with members of the opposite sex. Girls just made me happy; they grounded me, and I was terrible with them and still am terrible with them but the terror of rejection from a girl - that emotional cost - was nothing compared to the terror of being alone with my anxiety. So I decided, like many young men, to learn how to ""pick up girls"" through the online seduction community. I started on this old forum called mASF and met a mentor who encouraged me to just suck it up and approach a girl cold. Eventually I did it. And it was terrible. I went to a tupperware store for some reason and saw a girl and grunted something inaudible and she gave me a funny look and then I scurried away and raced home and drank myself to sleep. The next day I tried again and it actually worked; I got a phone number, went on a date, and for the first time in my life saw how immensely gratifying a random intimate connection with another genuine, good-hearted human being could be. I didn't quite grasp the reasons why this style of meeting women worked so well until much later in life but that discovery carried me through college and early adulthood; without it I'd probably still be spinning my wheels in a state of anxiety. My cold approaches led me to develop confidence in myself which led me to develop confidence in job interviews which led me to some really cool life experiences. One thing that I never felt comfortable with was an inauthentic approach to dating - the use of pickup lines, gimmicks, tricks, or manipulation to simply get laid. That's grimy stuff, it's not cool and will likely lead you down a path of spiritual rot since it's just straight-up wrong. The way I like to evaluate behavior in general is by asking - if everyone in the world was doing this, would the world be a nice place to be? And with the performance-based approach of gimmicky manipulation, I'd say no with confidence. And that's what I like about this book - it articulates a framework - a way of thinking - that prioritizes authenticity and personal development above the direct pursuit of sex or relationships or whatever it is that you're after. &amp;#x200B; **THE AUTHOR** A bit about the author - Mark Manson the author of another popular book called The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck and is known mostly for his candid, no-nonsense blogging about personal development. &amp;#x200B; Despite the title of this book, its concepts apply to everyone regardless of gender. &amp;#x200B; **NON-NEEDINESS** One of the first concepts Mark talks about is the importance of non-neediness. When two people meet, they're likely to be different in a lot of ways. In a healthy connection, both people sacrifice their conflicting inclinations in an equal way as they bridge that gap in the name of bonding. One person might travel more to see the other person while their partner might prepare dinner more; one partner might compromise around their avoidance of phone conversations while the other might attend social events that they otherwise might not be interested in. The formation of a healthy connection should be characterized by a mutual and equal give and take when evaluated over extended periods of time. It will fluctuate but it should trend towards equality. &amp;#x200B; When it becomes uneven, when one person is giving more and expressing more and trying more than the other, that person is likely to be perceived as needy, and that is a universally unattractive quality. Not only is it unattractive; it's unhealthy. Your primary investment should be yourself; anyone else in your life should only ever be the beneficiary of your investment if it's undoubtedly clear that they're willing and able to invest just as much as you're willing and able to without either of you sacrificing your own identity. It's healthy to maintain at least a little space between you and your partner in the name of identity and intimacy preservation, a topic covered in another book titled Mating in Captivity. &amp;#x200B; **IDENTITY DIVERSIFICATION** The takeaway here is to prioritize your own happiness by diversifying your identity and becoming a well-rounded human being that doesnt need sex with strangers or approval from a partner in order to feel worthy or validated. Just don't become so self-focused that you become narcissistic. One way that you can tell if you've crossed this line by looking at how you engage on social media; is your content generally about you and your appearance, in a way that might be perceived as validation-seeking or attention-seeking? Research indicates that this is a sign of narcissism which is another topic Mark digs into. &amp;#x200B; **VULNERABILITY** The next concept Mark talks about is vulnerability. He explains how people are attracted to each other's rough edges. I agree with this whole-heartedly. What makes people interesting is their uniqueness and their uniqueness is usually rooted in stuff that some people find off-putting and others find fascinating. It's the polarizing, extreme, unconventional or unique parts of any given person that make them who they are, and if you're looking for strong connections, you may as well own who you are and attract people who appreciate it instead of trying to sand down your edges and resting in that comfortable zone of weak but safe bonds. Remove the filters, expose yourself, and accept the fact that hey, not everyone is going to like what they see and that's ok. It's actually a good thing because why would you want to spend time in the company of someone who isn't excited about spending time with you? There are some people out there who are going to love what they see, and you won't find those people unless you stop trying to be so damn perfect to everyone. Show off your rough edges. Emotionally. It's ok to be authentic and vulnerable about your anxiety, your attraction towards someone, your desires, your curiosities and weaknesses. Just keep in mind that the revelation of your authentic self is an art form that requires calibration through many, many interactions, some of which will crash and burn. That's the cost of education and there's nothing wrong with it. &amp;#x200B; **BEING HONEST** The next concept he talks about is the gift of Truth. Someone who feels that they need to purchase someone else's attention through entertainment or superficial gestures is someone who isn't confident in themselves. It's one thing to treat your partner with a surprise because you want to make them happy but that stuff should only happen after you've built a bond, not in order to build that bond. I think the best first dates are ones where you walk and talk. Get to know someone and expose yourself through conversation and flirtation and be honest about who you are and what you feel and believe. If you just rely on the conventional ""buy them a drink, say what they want to hear, have sex, figure it out"" sequence of events, you might be having fun but you're doing yourself more harm than good. That's essentially gambling your way into a relationship and it's much healthier to carefully step into one based on deliberate, authentic, and thoughtful calibration over time. In my opinion, any other approach is likely to be characterized by avoidance, fear, insecurity, or a lack of strength, purpose, and identity - not very encouraging sentiments. &amp;#x200B; **POLARIZATION** He then talks about polarization. Time is tight and you don't want to waste it chasing people who are neutral towards you or uninterested in you. Mark explains how people can be thought of as either Unreceptive, Neutral, or Receptive. When you meet someone for the first time, they usually pretty clearly fall into one of these three categories. I've found this to be true and am a huge believer in the philosophy of focusing your time towards ""fuck yeah"" people - people who are clearly and undeniably interested in your company. I've seen a lot of friends waste weeks or months trying to convert someone unreceptive to being more receptive and it's a complete time sink. I've been guilty of it myself and it's always been in those moments of life where I'm least confident and least self-assured that I've taken whatever companionship I could get even at great emotional cost. There are so many people out there; why waste four hours convincing someone to like you when you could invest those four hours into meeting someone who's genuinely interested in who you are and who makes you feel happy and who helps you grow? So if you meet someone unreceptive, move on. If you meet someone neutral, quickly show your cards, show your rough edges, try to polarize them, and see which way they go. And if you meet someone receptive, enjoy :). &amp;#x200B; Given your particular bundle of strengths and weaknesses, there are going to be some number of people out there who are extremely compatible with you. The only way you're going to connect with those people is by interacting with as many as you possibly can. Back when I was in a bit more of an experimental phase of my life, I'd go out and just approach, approach, approach. The majority of the time nothing would happen, but every once in a while, there'd be a spark. And of those sparks, some of them would flourish into relationships. And every single one of those relationships taught me about who I am, my weaknesses, what I need and desire and the things I want to seek avoid in future connections. &amp;#x200B; **EXPOSE YOURSELF** So my philosophy on dating is that you ought to expose yourself to as much opportunity as you possibly can because that's how you accelerate the sharpening of your own awareness of what you want and need in a partner, and how to go about finding it. Some people are of the mindset that the universe will show you the way and you'll just passively fall into a romantic dream come true with the one that you end up sailing off into the sunset with. To this, I say with enthusiasm - fuck that. A passive approach is not going to get you anywhere; would a passive approach get you your dream job, or a successful business, or a nice body, or an educated mind? Of course not. So if you're serious about finding a compatible partner or partners, then you have to invest, likely over the course of many, many approaches, dates, and relationships, before you learn enough about yourself to become deliberate and discerning. Otherwise you're just operating in this vague, foggy space and depending on luck. Take control, get out there, and experiment! &amp;#x200B; If you just wait for the world to hand you something then your options will be limited and the momentum of your growth will be very slow compared to the version of you that runs across an intersection to introduce yourself to someone attractive. &amp;#x200B; **YOU CONTROL EVERYTHING** That bundle of strengths and weaknesses that makes you you; you can control this. You can develop skills and attributes and personality traits and you can build wealth and develop your passions and become a well-rounded, interesting person simply through the power of choice. You aren't who you are, you are who you work to be. And the people that work are the ones who have more options and certainty and confidence and less anxiety because anxiety is nothing more than the absence of information and you harvest information through hard work. And the more information you have, the more options you have to work with, the more opportunity you have to experience growth spurts. And once you have options, you can be more deliberate about selecting potential partners who complement you based on your own confidently identified personal set of priorities. You can learn how to screen your dates for good character and trustworthiness and thoughtfulness and forward thinking and whatever the things are that you're looking for. Maybe you're just looking for noncommittal fun; you can learn how to screen for that in a healthy way, too! &amp;#x200B; At the end of the day, dating is interviewing. You're evaluating each other to see if you can exploit one another in ways that are mutually enabling and beneficial, as cold as that sounds, from an evolutionary perspective, that's what dating is. It's interviewing and in order to effectively fill a position you need to have a broad and diverse pool of candidates. And you can get that by becoming a solid, high-quality human being through identity-level work. &amp;#x200B; **REJECTION** Mark then talks about Rejection. I'm an expert at getting rejected. I wish I could get paid for it because I'm really, really good at it. I've been rejected by thousands of women and this isn't an exaggeration. I can tell you that, as an average looking dude at best, for every ten rejections there was one special interaction. Whether it was an extremely memorable date or something more intense or serious, those positive experiences are the memories that I have and they blow the slight discomfort, the minimal pain of the preceding nine rejections out of the water. You've got to pay to play and the currency of this game is simply thick skin which you develop over time. Just remember to be respectful, authentic, and sensitive to the comfort of others, and remember that the vast majority of the time, you'll be rejected for reasons that have nothing to do with you. Chase that 10% of special interactions. &amp;#x200B; **FOUNDATIONAL FUNDAMENTALS** He then talks about foundational fundamentals which include creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle, overcoming your fears, and communicating fluidly. One of the best things that I've ever done to improve every aspect of my life is to join an Improv workshop and also Toastmasters. These two things will throw you on your ass but it's in the company of people who want you to succeed and so you rapidly sharpen your communication skills in an extremely supportive, nonjudgmental environment. You also want to make sure that you're investing your time into things that resonate with your passion. For me, that's physical fitness, photography, motorcycle riding, self-education, and recently, a bit of public speaking, self-defense training, volunteering, yoga, and meditation. I've done all of these things because they're interesting to me and they put me in the company of like-minded people. Whatever you pick, just make sure that you've got some stuff that gets you around quality people. You have to not only diversify your identity as a whole, but your social identity as well. &amp;#x200B; **STRATEGY** Mark then talks a bit about strategy, and the first thing you should ask yourself is, what do you value in a partner? Based on your answer, where are you most likely to find those types of people? I think you can arrive at this same answer by asking yourself what kind of person you want to become, and this will uncover your target partner demographic. While I agree with the theory here, in practice, I find straight-up cold-approaching to be much more scalable. No matter how many interests or hobbies you have, your pool of social diversity is going to be limited, where the surrounding world is unlimited, and the best interactions I've had have all been in this nebulous space between the points of interest - on my way out of a book store, walking to the office, on my way to an event, running into Target, etc. &amp;#x200B; Mark also talks about how It's important to not just ""perform"" against an image you think people will find attractive; really think about who you want to be and pursue that and display it unapologetically. Your lifestyle should be your wingman, filtering for people who you vibe really well with - guys and girls. &amp;#x200B; **APPEARANCE AND VOICE** He then talks about the importance of appearance and voice. A first impression is made in milliseconds and a bit part of that is visual. So hit the gym, get some books on nutrition and building muscle, stay groomed, and wear clean clothes that fit you well and speak to your personality. Stand up straight, and speak from your chest, not from your face, and articulate clearly and not too quickly. Listen to the difference here - Hey excuse me - I find you attractive and I'd like to introduce myself, would you mind? Or even the classic Joey line - hey how you doin - guaranteed positive results at least some of the time with that second one. I'd be willing to put money on that. Mark doesn't mention this but another critical component to any communication is just to smile and laugh. It's so attractive and disarming to me when someone is genuinely smiling even in moments of discomfort. &amp;#x200B; **BEING BOLD** He then talks about the importance of boldness. If you want to meet interesting people who you're compatible with, you have to meet a lot of people. And if you want to meet a lot of people, you have to put some effort into it. And that effort sometimes requires you to step beyond comfort or convention. It won't always work but sometimes it does - just this past weekend I was walking around downtown LA on the phone with a friend and made eye contact twice with a super cute girl who was walking by and I used that line from Good Will Hunting to get off the phone -""Hey I gotta go, I gotta see about a girl"" and I jumped onto the escalator with her and told her I wanted to say hello to her. That could have gone terribly - if she wasnt into me or if she had a boyfriend or just wasn't feeling social then that would have been a super awkward escalator ride. And there's no escape. I might have tried to walk back up the escalator as it was going down but I didn't think about that risk, I just went for it. And that autopilot sense of just going for it is the result of years and years of rejection and behavioral conditioning that now makes me laugh at the possibility of feeling approach anxiety. It still surfaces on occasion but it's minimal. So start being bold sooner than later, stomach the pain, accept the fact that you'll feel and look foolish sometimes, and go out and grow. Guys and girls should be doing this; I think the world would become more delightfully connected that way. This mindset also gives you a competitive advantage because not many people embrace it. It's a great way to stand out. &amp;#x200B; **CLOSING** Alright that's about it for my summary of Mark Manson's Models. &amp;#x200B; As far as my impressions of the book - there's a lot of gold in here and even if there's something about the title that seems a little off putting, at the end of the day the book's core message is to just become a solid, bold, deliberate individual before you try to form a solid pair. And that's such an important message. There's definitely a hefty ratio of personal anecdote and storytelling to golden insight but there's plenty of insight so I'd recommend picking it up. &amp;#x200B; As far as the book's impressions on me - I read this book the day after a breakup and it pushed me to immediately dive into the deep end of correcting my lifestyle and embracing a more diversified social identity. It sparked a lot of huge changes in my life and prompted me to be unafraid - or less afraid anyways - of exposing my rough edges; I might not have had the courage to screw around with making youtube videos if I hadn't read this. So, thanks Mark! &amp;#x200B; \-------- &amp;#x200B; /fin &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"
90,vulnerability,seduction,"[X-post from r/SelfImprovement] - For anyone who hasn't had a chance to crack open Jordan Peterson's ""12 Rules for Life: An Antidote To Chaos"" - it's packed with a lot of good stuff.

I also attempted to share this on* r/DecidingToBeBetter *but for some reason the mods removed it after it got 100+ upvotes :(.* &amp;#x200B; For those of you who haven't heard of Jordan Peterson, he's a psychology professor and clinical psychologist at the University of Toronto. Regardless of your political or moral beliefs and his controversial public persona, his intent is to make people's lives better, and his materials have made mine better, so I figure why not share the gold. Even if some of these rules might not be relevant to you, I think there's a chance that one or two of them could *somehow* positively impact you. &amp;#x200B; \----------------- &amp;#x200B; **The first rule - stand up straight with your shoulder back.** This comes from his study of lobsters, interestingly enough. They govern their posture with serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that governs status, posture, and emotional regulation in lobsters - just like it does in humans. If a lobster loses a fight, you can coerce it to fight again by giving it antidepressants! If you're on top of the lobster hierarchy then you have high serotonin - you can legitimately mobilize a pinchy, disgruntled bottom lobster upwards into the top of the hierarchy by moderating its levels of serotonin. Human hierarchies are not socio-cultural constructs - they're deeply rooted in biology. Where you lie in the hierarchy is monitored at a deeply instinctual and physiological level by neural structures that were formed hundreds of millions of years ago. And where you lie determines the ratio of positive to negative emotions that you feel. This is why being put down by someone, especially someone in an authoritative position - is so painful. It pokes at the deep physiological thermometer that you have, measuring where you're at, and it messes with the neurochemical systems that regulate your emotions. So you want to present yourself in a way that aligns with our biological indicators of achievement. Stand up straight, occupy some space, open your arms in a display of vulnerability that nonverbally communicates confidence. This actually physically regulates your mood in the same way that smiling makes you feel happy - which some people call faking it until you make it but it's not fake at all, it's just using our bodies to exert some degree of control on the inner workings of our minds and our emotions - postural flexion directly impacts emotional regulation - and others are likely to perceive you as trustworthy and to give you the benefit of the doubt. Part of the universal strategy for success is to confront challenging situations in a vulnerable manner and with confidence and courage. &amp;#x200B; **The second rule is to treat yourself like you're someone that you care about.** Jordan talks about the golden rule of ""treat others the way you wish to be treated"" and how the meaning of that message goes a lot deeper than just the basic virtuous trait of kindness. You ought to treat others the way you would treat yourself if you were your child. That means you wouldn't just be smiling and positive and agreeable about everything in an avoidance of all negative emotion - that's pathetic. You'd want your kid to grow through challenging situations and constructive criticism, you'd tell him when he was wrong. Jordan explores the reasons why when we get a prescription for our pet, we're religious about its administration and we care for it. But for ourselves, 30% don't fill prescriptions and 50% that do don't take them properly. Why don't we care about ourselves? Jordan says it's because you often decide to dislike people based on something that they did and then based on that tiny slice of awareness of who they are, you embrace this negative feeling towards them. But you don't just know a tiny slice of yourself - you know everything you did and haven't done that you should have so your self-perception is just super prone to negativity because man, I did that bad thing over there and then this other thing and I could have done this but I didn't. So it's easy to let go of things that help you and fall into temptation and malevolence because of this existential question of why something as sorry and wretched as you deserves any care? And the answer is that yeah you're useless and weak and terrible but everyone is and that's what makes us human and the way to correct this underlying, subconscious tendency to let go is through the deliberate and conscious acknowledgement of your need to treat yourself in the same way that you would treat your child. It's the hidden layer of the Golden Rule - the more important one if you ask me because it unleashes, it unlocks the growth mindset. And not only would this make your life better individually, but if you don't do this, you could argue that you make the world a worse place. So we've got the carrots of feeling better and pulling the world up through leading your peers by example and then we've got the sticks of feeling miserable and letting go of the things that are important and dragging everyone else down with us. It's a moral decision, an obligation to take care of yourself to pull your weight within the competence hierarchy that matters the most - humanity. You have a light that you need to bring into the world, and if you don't, nobody else will, and the world gets just a little bit dimmer and the deepest parts of your mind will punish you for that by making you feel bad. &amp;#x200B; **The third rule is to make friends with people who want the best for you.** Just like you have a moral responsibility to take care of yourself, you have a moral responsibility to surround yourself with people who help your light shine brighter. Who have the confidence and wisdom to encourage the good things you do and to stop the bad things you do. And that's the measure of a true friend right there - someone who gives you both positive and negative but healthy feedback. &amp;#x200B; **The fourth rule is to compare yourself to who you were yesterday - not to who someone else is today.** He talks about the Pareto principle whereby 20% of your employees do 80% of the work, or that 20% of your customers are responsible for 80% of your sales. The rule is that the square of the number of people in any given effort are doing half of the work. This means if you have four people - two people do about half the work. If you have 10 people, about 3 do half the work. If you have 100 people - ten do half the work. If you have 1000 people, 30 of them do half the work. 10K employees - 100 people are doing half the work. This is a pretty ironclad rule. And this is related to the Matthew principle - those who have more get more, those who have less get less. And I can relate this to my physical fitness journey - those who do more can do more, and those who don't do much can do less and less over time. Your body is like a furnace and you have to start small but gradually increase its fuel and its load - keep giving it progressively more things to eat and to do otherwise it atrophies - and I think this applies to the mind too. Another manifestation of this rule can be seen in the fact that the 85 most wealthy people in the world have more money than the bottom 2 billion. Which is why inequality can't be blamed on capitalism; it's a natural phenomenon that would manifest in any economic system. And the point of all this is to say that there are always going to be some people who are better at some things than other people, and that you should be comparing yourself to others to give yourself something to aim towards, but not as a means of measuring your value. That comparison should be for target setting, not for value measuring. Value measuring should occur in the comparison between who you are today vs who you were yesterday. Because in that comparison, you have the authority to set small, achievable goals and compare yourself to someone who's just incrementally, marginally different from you - your yesterday self. Nietche - he who has a why can bear almost any how. What purpose would make all of life's suffering worthwhile to you? And that is a deeply personal thing that you can only decide from introspection, not comparing yourself to others. You can explore it by comparing yourself to others, but you can only decide it by comparing yourself to yesterday. &amp;#x200B; **The fifth rule is do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.** Carl Jung says that you should pursue that which is meaningful and then you'll encounter that which you least want to encounter - the dark shadow of malevolence that brings the worst qualities out of you. I dont know how to interpret this other than maybe - if you attach your identity to something that has meaning to you, all other things become secondary, or even worse, obstacles. Including the need for compassion or any degree of empathy. And how in any relationship - if you really want to punish someone, you don't wait until they do something wrong, you wait until they do something right and then you punish them for that because they will decrease the likelihood that they do something good for themselves ever again. But if you want a healthy relationship, you pay close attention, open your damn eyes, and you look for the good things and you praise them with everything you've got. Tell them hey, I saw what you did, I know it took some effort and here's why it means a lot to me. Keep that up. This mindset applies from friendships to families to the workplace to relationships to any form of social interaction and it's another moral obligation. I feel like the more you listen to this the more responsibility you have so stop now if you don't want responsibility. But the takeaway here is that we're all messed up, we all have these shadows to contend with, these dragons within us that make us do nasty things, and when you feel that your mood is becoming unstable and that you're less reasonable, broadcast that so you can clear the room and minimize the risk of hurting others and your relationships with them and then manage your state of emotion back down to earth. This tendency to become unreasonable isn't an illness most of the time it's a human condition - there's nothing wrong with you if you experience it but it's another obligation of yours to learn how to monitor yourself for it, communicate it, and wrestle it back to submission. And that's one of the reasons why forming a solid partnership with someone through marriage to raise children is a good call - because it's the closest thing we have to a guarantee that despite our human ups and downs, we're going to stay in it, and we're going to pull through, for us, for our bond, for our children, and for the world at large. And your job as a parent is to make your child socially desirable by teaching them how to laugh and play and be pleasant and deal with conflict without violence or aggression. You can be sure that you've been a successful parent if, when your kid is 4, other kids want to play with them. That doesn't mean that you're an unsuccessful parent if the opposite is the case. But your job is to discourage behavior that other kids and other adults would dislike, and to encourage behavior that makes people like them. Teach them manners and humor and playfulness and steer them away from stubbornness and public meltdowns and inconsiderate behavior. I really, really like this and it applies to adults too. &amp;#x200B; **The sixth rule is about setting your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.** Life can be painful. There's all kinds of stuff to complain about, but if you dwell on it, you will become bitter and tread down a path that will take you to twisted places as evidenced by the diaries and crimes of the Columbine killers. So instead of cursing the tragedy that is life, it's a better and moral decision to act meaningfully. Stop doing bad stuff - lying, disrespecting yourself, eating garbage, saying bad things about other people, etc - stop doing the things that you know to be wrong or that make your feel ashamed. Start doing only those things that you would proudly talk about in public. I like to interpret this as - live your life as if there's a chance that your kids could read a biography of every one of your days. A PG version of those days but an honest version. &amp;#x200B; **The seventh rule is to pursue what is meaningful.** Meaning is a defense against the suffering of life. Again - Nietche - he who has a why can bear almost any how. Meaning lets you know when youre doing the right thing in the right place in life, and he says that the right place somewhere between chaos and order. If you stay firmly ensconced within order, things you understand, then you cant grow. If you stay within chaos, then youre lost. &amp;#x200B; **The eighth rule is to tell the truthor, at least, don't lie.** Telling the truth can be hard in the sense that its often difficult to know the truth or how to reveal it in a way that minimizes damage. But when we lie, we know we're lying, and telling lies makes you weak. You can feel it, and others can sense it too, even if only subconsciously. Lying disassociates you with meaning and while you might get away with it for a short while it comes at a price that you'll have to pay eventually. &amp;#x200B; **Rule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't.** A good conversation consists of you coming out wiser than you went into it. An example is when you get into an argument with your significant other, you want to win, especially if you get angry. If youre more verbally fluent than the other person then it's easy for you to win but winning shouldn't be the goal unless you want to be living with a pinchy bottom lobster; it's important to recognize that the other person might see something better than you, but they cant quite articulate it as well. Always listen to not just the words that people say but the message that they're communicating and the reasons why they're communicating it, because theres a possibility theyre going to tell you something that will prevent you from running headfirst into a brick wall. This is why Peterson says to listen to people even that you don't like. They might try to hurt you, but they will also say true things about yourself that your friends wont. A great tactical tip here is - when you're having a conversation with someone, whenever they're done speaking, summarize what they said back to them to confirm your understanding. In this way you can condition yourself to become a truly active listener because you'll be talking to people with that sense of 'aw crap I gotta do a book report on this in a minute so I'd better listen up' &amp;#x200B; **Rule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech:** There is some integral connection between communication and reality. Language takes chaos and makes it into a thing. As an example, imagine going through a rough patch in your life where you cant quite put your finger on whats wrong. This mysterious thing thats bothering youis it real? Yes, if its manifesting itself as physical discomfort. Then you talk about it and give it a name, and then this fuzzy, abstract thing turns into a specific thing. Once named, you can now do something about it. Things that you can't name are far more terrifying than the things that you can name. This is why Peterson is such a free speech advocate. He wants to bring things out of the realm of the unspeakable. Words have a creative power and you dont want to create more mark and darkness by imprecise or disallowed speech. I interpret this as not just about the precise outward distribution of ideas through speech but also as a meditation on the importance of accumulating inward awareness. I'd still be stuck in a cycle of omega-3 deficiency and accumulating financial liabilities and sex addiction and avoidant attachment and toiling away on a hedonistic treadmill if I hadn't picked up some damn books and harvested the language that allows me to think and speak precisely and accurately about the flaws in my choices and behavior. &amp;#x200B; **Rule 11: Dont bother children when they are skateboarding.** This is mainly about risk taking and the embracing of responsibility. We want to positively reinforce the behavior of taking risks because that fundamental deep-seated inclination to do a kickflip dookickey slide down a rail might be stupid as a kid but might also translate to that same kid putting everything on the line for a tech startup that changes the world in a great way, or approaching a girl that he's attracted to and growing immensely from their relationship. Let people take risks and encourage them to as long as they're not too dangerous. If you restrict a child's play, you're essentially restricting the human spirit and the ability of those children to shine bright and we need all the light we can get, especially right now as things are shifting more quickly than ever before on a species level. &amp;#x200B; **Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.** This chapter is all about the unexpected beauty in life and how as much as we need to try and emit light from ourselves, it's also important to keep an eye out for light coming from other sometimes unexpected or mysterious places so we can try to amplify it a bit. When you see a stray cat struggling for life but figuring out how to adapt and how to still roll around in the grass and play with leaves, that's a bit of light right there surrounded by a big bunch of darkness and it's beautiful and you should try to look for that stuff and cultivate it external to your circumstance by maybe petting the cat or just feeling delighted by it, but it's also important to carry this within your own circumstance because no matter how much stress or darkness you're coping with, looking for the beautiful pockets of light might just upgrade the experience from absolute hell to just a manageable tragedy, which, you know, it's worth a shot. &amp;#x200B; Alright that's about it for Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. As far as my impressions of the book: There were a couple of tearjerky moments and a lot of goosebumps and plenty of moments where I just had to step back and think. I really hate the negative association that ""self-help"" books get because learning from people like Jordan Peterson is one of the best ways that we have to grow at scale, and there should be nothing but positivity directed towards people who share and consume uplifting, illuminating content like this. It's just nothing short of enlightening and I've got the rules printed out next to my daily routine here now so I have to look at them every day when I wake up. Get the book and if you can't afford it just send me a message and I'll get it for you."

It's been a source of a lot of frustration and borderline exasperation for me. From everything that I have read and seen, one of the main keys to being good with women seems to be remaining aloof, caring less about them than they about you, and not being needy at all. The very first chapter Mark Manson's book Models is called ""Non-Neediness"", and starts with ""*A man's attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The less needy he is, the more attractive he will be to women on average. The needier he is, the less attractive he will be to women on average.*"" **So what I can't for the life of me wrap my head around is how to congruently do this and not give all your power away.** I've heard RSD instructors like Todd Valentine say this kind of thing ad nauseam. The frame he says to adopt is that you're like a prince slumming it with the commoners and when approach a girl you're a prince approaching a poor farm girl. The idea being that this will help you pass shit tests because a commoner saying something smart to a prince means nothing. But then in the same freaking breath he'll see a girl from across the street [and run to catch up with her](URL Yeahhhhh because that's what a prince would do, right? A self-sufficient, non-needy prince of the land would go way out of his way, sprint up the street to catch up with a common girl. How the hell do you do that and *not* give all your power away. I mean, according to theory you have to go from that sprint down the street, catch up with the girl, and then go ""Oh, but I don't need you and I'm acting aloof"". Are you fucking kidding me. Have any of you seen the movie Ex Machina? Remember when Nathan asks ""[What imperative does a grey box have to interact with another grey box?](URL **By definition**  again, as far as I can see  the only imperative we have for cold approaching is sex, and if you're flirting with the girl, escalating, and so forth during the set then she's going to know that. So the schizophrenic conundrum for me is how to approach but not give all my power away. She didn't approach you to talk, you approached her. Why? Who has more power in that case? More value? The only two solutions I've come up with (and when I say solution, I mean a mental model to help cope): 1. Again, in Manson's book Models, he talks about this problem and essentially says that there is no solution. *However*, that the vulnerability that comes as a product of this problem is a solution itself. That putting yourself into this kind of vulnerable situation but being man enough to show that you're not bothered by it demonstrates so much value that it's massively attractive to women. 2. My own personal model is that approaching women should be seen as a necessary ""opening gambit"". [In chess, a gambit](URL is a move that is purposely made, which puts you at a temporary *disadvantage*, if only for a moment, which allows you to then gain a strategic advantage. The approach, in my mind, puts you at a severe disadvantage in terms of the power dynamic between you in the girl. However, if she's willing to talk to you, it gives you the chance to attract her. Notice both of these concede that indeed power is lost on the approach. It seems to me that guys are at a severe disadvantage on the sexual market. We have to make alllll the moves and take alllll the risk. Women get to sit back, get approached, and judge whether they want to be led or not. For anyone who disagrees, honestly, which side would you rather be on. If we were the ones getting approached it would take care of 80% of the problem of getting laid. It's unfair but this is the reality and I understand that. Therefore men have had to create perform these mental gymnastics and create these mental models, like the prince thing, to square away why approaching isn't needy. This is the missing piece of the puzzle for me personally in my own game. **tl;dr = What is your frame, or mental model, for approaching while preserving your power as much as possible?**"
93,vulnerability,seduction,I secretly enjoy rejecting myself,10,8zf1hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8zf1hm/i_secretly_enjoy_rejecting_myself/,2018-07-17 07:27:06,"Just got off the subway where I was standing next to a girl I felt very attracted to. As we were standing next to each other I was both pretending not to seem bothered by her and subtly trying to make eye-contact. An inner conflict of on one hand wanting to engage with her and on the other hand trying to tell myself I did not want to engage with her. I think it's a mechanism to protect my own 'ego'. How unevolutionized can the human brain be! How blind! Fucking self-sabotage. Yeah, I didn't get rejected, woohoo! Oh, wait she just got off the wagon and I'll probably never see her again. Oh, well, I tell myself, there's plenty of other fish in the sea, plus, she wasn't that hot in hindsight. At least I didn't make a fool out of myself in front of the other people standing next to us. Man, our brains are still designed for life in small groups where pretty much all people/semi-apes we interacted with belonged to your small tribe. In that context it actually makes a lot of sense to make such a big deal out of these things. I also notice I kind of masochistically enjoy rejecting myself. It confirms my victimized self-image. I somehow deserve this. It also makes me feel in control of my fate, since I'm the one who decides, not the girl. Imagine she tells me she has a boyfriend. Now that would keep me red-faced. I can conceptualize that all this is delusional self-sabotage and is a pseudo smart way of avoiding vulnerability. It's a way to keep myself safe, not realizing it's only encarcerating me deeper and deeper inside of my own mental prison. Dear brain: you're too smart for yourself. If you only used your genius for other crafts, maybe you could save humanity from extinction or so."

96,vulnerability,seduction,Gaming hot Polish girls with HONESTY (Social Prime bootcamp review),2,93smsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/93smsn/gaming_hot_polish_girls_with_honesty_social_prime/,2018-08-02 06:23:15,"I recently spent the evening in Poland with a friend who works as a dating coach for a company called Social Prime. I was supposed to speak at a seminar he was hosting, but this was cancelled. Instead, I joined him on a night out, where he would coach two guys on a PUA bootcamp. You might be surprised to hear: everything this company communicates is based on connecting with people through honesty. After all, it's widely believed by the mainstream media that 'pick-up artists' teach guys ingenuine lines and routines to help them get over their nerves. **Connecting with the students through honesty** The students and I arrived before the coach. The first student was a tall German guy. He was very nervous and a bit sweaty. ""How you doing?"", I asked. ""Yeah, good! Really excited!"" he said, looking even more anxious. Immediately, I wanted to get away from him. Something just felt 'off'. I could feel the front he was trying to put on - and it was instantly repulsive. I guarantee this lack of congruence is making girls feel the same way about him. The second guy was a shorter, younger Polish man. When I asked how he felt, he said: ""No, I actually find it really difficult applying these honesty principles. Being honest is supposed to relieve tension, but I actually find it really nerve-wracking. I had high expectations for this weekend, and I really want to make the most of it."" He owned these feelings, spoke to me confidently and wasn't ashamed of his words. Immediately, I felt like I could relate to this guy. He opened up and showed vulnerability and that made me like him so much more. Once you share these feelings, they no longer have to control you. We became friends really quickly. **Connecting with hot Polish girls through honesty** I tried this 'honesty' thing with the blonde Pole I was speaking with. ""You look a little tense when you talk to me. It feels like you don't want to be here,"" I told her. ""Yes, I feel uncomfortable talking to you, because English is my second language, and I don't want to feel stupid by getting the words wrong,"" she replied. There you go! Here I was thinking she didn't like me. I told her I didn't care if she got her words wrong, and that my Polish was terrible. From there, the tension was gone, she opened up and we spent the rest of the night together. I also spotted the students telling girls they were nervous speaking to them, and even that hey felt beneath them. They didn't pull these particular girls, so I can't comment on the effectiveness of this technique, but it did seem to dissipate the tension and help the girls open up. **It's best not to be nervous, but if you are nervous, OWN IT** It's so easy to put on a front when hitting on a hot woman. Social Prime teaches its students to eliminate this front and connect with girls through honesty. The idea is that once we share those feelings we can't let them own us any more. The tension dissipates, and the girls are encouraged to drop their masks as well. The idea is to OWN your weaknesses. Reveal them with good eye contact and strong voice tonality - and it can still come across as ALPHA. It's a lot better than trying to hide them **Disclaimer** I have no affiliation with Social Prime. I was dubious about this strategy before the bootcamp started. Sadly, I didn't do enough sets to develop a sold opinion on its effectiveness (if anything I hooked too early haha). Still, I thought it would be of value to write about my experience here and let you make your own minds up! \--- FYI I'VE STARTED A PRIVATE WHATSAPP GROUP FOR MEN WHO WANT TO LEARN TO BE AMAZING WITH WOMEN.

We match on Tinder and she asks me for my number after a few messages. We text and set up our date. We meet on a Wednesday night for boba, dinner, and then chill at a hookah bar. She broaches the topic of sex. I tease her for being forward but keep the convo sexually charged. Kino and conversation gets heavy in the hookah bar. I tell her I like to get to know girls before fucking. She knows I'm talking about her too, saying I still don't know who you are. At this point I know she's DTF (honestly, I was too but I get nervous lol and logistics at my place weren't in my favor). I drop her back to her place. No kiss but she made it clear she wants to hang out tomorrow. And so we do... **2nd Date F-Close (following day)** She texts me in the morning saying she overslept, we were supposed to do yoga together. We exchange a few messages then she asks me ""do you wanna hang out?"" I pick her up and proceed immediately to Netflix and Chill. My remote does voice commands and says ""Netflix &amp; chill"" with that cheeky, teasing, grin. It's on. Cuddle for a bit and we eventually do the deed. Got a little nervous - I get a little performance anxiety. I open up to her about it - something something showing vulnerability - She's cool with it teases me (in a playful, non-hurtful way) and we fucken fuck once my nerves are calm. We shower and cuddle for a bit. After a few minutes she pulls off my shorts and starts giving me head. WOW I did not ask or even suggest this. She's doing this on her own accord. I go with it and she finishes me. I drop her back home. Honestly don't remember if we kissed goodbye. But wow I was just processing everything and was amazed at how great the sexual chemistry was. Aside from a small hiccup on my part, we hit the ground running hard. I don't think I've ever clicked with someone like that from the first time we fuck. I was out of town for the entire weekend and she knew this. But I haven't texted her since. I definitely wanna hang out with her again. She even told me what she wants to do/ how she wants to get fucked for next time. The lights can't be any more greener. So my questions are: 1. The sex was great, amazing chemistry for a first time fuck. Is it bad that I haven't texted her since? 2. I didn't mean to ghost but I don't wanna get clingy either. How should I proceed for our next date? **TL;DR:** first time hooking up with her and sexual chemistry was great but I feel like I ghosted her. Questions above."
100,vulnerability,seduction,Overcoming Anxiety to Meet Women,0,96sx71,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/96sx71/overcoming_anxiety_to_meet_women/,2018-08-13 08:23:11,"Okay I said I would write on this since it has been brought up multiple times on posts and in DMs. Anxiety is hard and I know a lot of guys come here with anxiety and insecurity issues. Some people even have formal diagnosis. I too have an anxiety disorder and it made dating hard. So lets start with the basics. If you are anxious and you have not seen a doctor or talked to a therapist that is step one. In order to attract quality women you will have to work on yourself first. I get not everyone has access to quality medical care so I know this can be a hard one. If you think you have a formal anxiety diagnosis and are located in the US there are free programs in major cities and suburbs. Use Google to find one. Clinical and persistent anxiety must be treated before you will be able to be your best self and in order to be slick and have a ton of sex you need to be working on yourself. Ok so that is the first step. Medication and therapy can help. Find the actual source of the anxiety. This takes emotional exploration and I know that is harder for men than women. Other suggestions include writing your thoughts and feelings out to get it out. Adopting a work out routine. I do yoga and if your a guy yoga can be a great opportunity to meet hot women. You dont need to be good at yoga as a matter of fact its a plus if you suck at it. Then ask women around you for tips (dont be creepy) just say your new and want to learn more. Women will be flattered and happy to help. Plus you may get to see her bend like a pretzel. Get in nature. Women love dating app photos of guys who hike or spend time in nature. Hiking and spending time in nature is also good for anxiety. Hikes are also great cheap dates and who knows you may get to fuck that tinder date in the woods as a result. Okay so thats for basic generalized anxiety for social anxiety I suggest starting online. Talk to girls online and DO NOT start with the super hot ones that are high risk. Go with the average girls who have low self confidence and lower self esteem. They will be easier on you and more understanding. Consider these Conversations practice. Keep practicing till talking in chat or text feels more comfortable. Dont rush to meet the girls. Tell them work is super crazy, you have a friend from HS / college in town or a family member visiting, etc. Make a plausible but acceptable excuse to delay meeting up. In order to keep her interest you will have to chat consistently. Try daily but dont overdo it. If conversation is flowing keep it up but do not engage more than she is. Conversation should be even. You have to crawl before you can walk. Remember girls do like anxious guys and emotional vulnerability to an extent but you have to have it managed and be selective about what you reveal and when. So start with text. Ask questions. Women love to talk about themselves. So get her talking. My date today clammed up and got anxious and since he is a gentleman and an excellent lay I am working with him. When he gets anxious I step up and carry the conversation I ask questions based on things I know he likes. Like music. It can be super general. I asked him what his favorite concert was of all time and his face lit up. His anxiety was gone and he reengaged in conversation. Dont ask too many question not rapid fire questions yall. Use them sparingly when conversation dies down. I honestly just keep talking till his face lights up and I see I got a win topic. Then I let him talk. Kino escalation also works well for me with anxiety. Take it slow at first till you feel less anxious around the girl. Start by brushing her shoulder with yours accidentally, touch her elbow when you laugh in a slightly flirty way, pat her shoulder if she says something dumb. Start slow till you get good with technique. When I started with kino I practiced on a young coworker of mine. He was flirty with me so I knew it would fly. I didnt do anything sexual but I gave him some IOI. First we working in close proximity at a conference and I would have to squeeze by him to work so I would touch his shoulder under the guise I was just trying to move around him. Then I moved to laughing and touching his elbow in a flirty way. I also would pay him on the back in a friendly way. These got me decent with escalation. My point is I did it with a guy who I knew didnt have the highest self confidence till I got comfortable. I may do a second part to this post as there is so much more to share. But TLDR: go slow. Dont give up. "
101,vulnerability,seduction,"[FR] Inspired, I took up the 100 Women in 50 Days Challenge: Days 1 &amp; 2",28,8rkewq,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8rkewq/fr_inspired_i_took_up_the_100_women_in_50_days/,2018-06-17 02:20:56,"** Background ** I'm a 21 year old male and I just finished my senior year of college. I'm sticking around for a Master's degree, so I live in a college town for at least the next year, which is about 30 minutes from my state's capital city, so there are a lot of people around where I live. **Why am I doing this challenge?** I'm at a watershed moment in my life. I've got some bad habits and fears that are keeping me from living in a way that I feel is honest and authentic. This may sound kind of cliche, but some events in my life over the last 9 months seriously forced me to open up and connect with my emotions (for the first time in my life), and I have this very distinct feeling that what I need right now is massive, committed action. Ive been really leaning into and exploring this idea that came to me recently -- that Im a hypocrite. I have accumulated so much knowledge and so many ideas about how to lead a healthy and happy life, but I havent done anything with it. I havent acted, or at least not totally. When the opportunity arises, I will gladly regurgitate words from a stockpile of other peoples ideas and realizations about how to alleviate your suffering, overcome bad habits, and lead the life you want -- ideas that I accumulated over the years I have spent listening to and reading this stuff. So few of these ideas or realizations feel like my own, however; they are not based in my direct experience, and the words were not formulated by me. Speaking of regurgitating other peoples ideas, I listened to Jordan Peterson talk about how Nietzsche described the kind of people who do this as Mirror People, or something along those lines. Mirror People reflect everything that comes into them, but produce no light of their own -- no original thought or expression. As a result, these are the exact people who mistake the menu for the meal, and the map for the territory. They are voyeurs, watching life go by without every jumping into the dance themselves. They are not people with ideas, they are people owned by ideas. Thats precisely how I feel currently -- Robin Williams might as well have been giving that famous Good Will Hunting speech directly to my soul. Having explored, at least a little bit, how this idea of being a Mirror Person applies to my life experience, I feel this build up of energy, like I know that I should take action and at least try -- even if I fail miserably, make A LOT of mistakes, embarrass myself, and probably cause some damage unintentionally -- to sort my life out and start living how I honestly feel I should live, but I really feel nervous and afraid. Im afraid of being vulnerable. Im afraid of being alone, and having my loneliness be made worse by acting and making the inevitable stupid mistakes that I will make. Battling with my fear, however, is my desperation to change the way I relate to my experience of life. Something in me does not want to live in fear and anxiety any more, it wants to act with honesty, bravery, and vulnerability. It wants to be bold, and laugh, and play, and love openly. It wants to relieve me of the tragedy that is a life lived too seriously. Kind of ironically, I seriously want to give everything to this thing in me that wants me to live like this. It doesn't feel okay to me anymore to be the kind of guy who treats the menu like the meal, or the map like the territory -- I'm tired of *reading* things about how to improve my life and cultivate a healthy way of expressing myself sexually. So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. I came across the challenge in the posts by /u/Ciaran_Callam and /u/runego, and I decided this was the perfect challenge to start proactively building a life where I express myself sexually in a healthy, productive way, and to overcome my fear of vulnerability and rejection. ** 100 Women in 50 Days ** I'm going to post here every day to keep myself accountable, and to get feedback from the awesome people in this community. Let's get into it. **Woman #1: Oxana** I do Capoeira, and I went to a class Thursday afternoon where there was a stunning new girl. I took initiative and went and asked her what her name was, introduced myself, then asked about her history with capoeira and what brought her here. We had a short but good conversation. Honestly, it was a pretty comfortable format where that sort of thing is expected, but it still felt good to take some initiative before anyone else and go talk to her. I had another short conversation with her after class, then gave her a hug goodbye and left. **Woman #2: Random Girl at a Club** Like I said, I went to an EDM show last night, and after getting on the dance floor I noticed a girl looking at me every few seconds. It was hard to tell if she was super attractive or not because of the light, and I started to get hesitant and nervous. After a few minutes of dancing around, she looked over again and had pretty open body language, so I moved closer and tried to say ""Hey, you and your friends look fun! What's your name?"" But as soon as I leaned over, she leaned in too and asked me if we (me and my friends) were all okay. I was pretty confused, since me and my friends were totally sober and were just dancing around pretty normally, so I asked her ""Huh?"" and she repeated herself. I just said yeah, then left the interaction because her body language and the way she was talking were giving me a weird feeling. *Reflection*: I didn't approach any more girls at that club. There were some that I saw that I would have liked to approach, but they were in groups of friends and that was intimidating enough to keep me from approaching. Honestly, I really struggle with approaching at bars/clubs. It's an area where I feel like I don't know how to open and initiate an interaction -- it's often so loud that trying to talk too much is exercise in futility. I should add that one things I've been practicing for several months now is going out with no alcohol and learning how to have fun. I love dancing, and I have a ton of fun at bars/clubs, it's just my nerves and excuses that, at least in the past, have kept me from approaching. Honestly, I think it's the higher chance of something sexual happening at these places (dancing/grinding, making out, taking her home) that makes these environments so intimidating for me. I almost feel more nervous about succeeding than I do about being rejected. This is definitely an area I need to work on. **Woman #3: Unknown** This is my first clear expression of sexual interest with an approach, and I feel pretty pumped about it. I was on campus at my university today when I saw a cute girl working with a project group at a table. I had to go meet some friends for a movie, so I thought I would approach her on the way out. My heart started pounding and I actually started sweating because I was so nervous. I didn't really feel like it was the format to start an in-depth conversation considering she was in the middle of a group of girls and was working (and I was nervous as hell), so I wrote my number on a piece of paper, walked over and said: Me: ""Excuse me. I know this is super random, but I thought you were really cute and I wanted to come say hi!"" Her: ""Thanks!"" A little surprised, but smiling. Me: ""Yeah, well I'm in a bit of hurry to go meet some people, but here's my number -- if you wanna go get coffee or something sometime, shoot me a text."" Her: *laughs* ""Uhm, yeah. Okay!"" Me: ""See ya!"" *Reflection*: I know this wasn't a great way to do things, but I'm super glad that I did anything at all. I was shitting my pants with nerves and starting to make excuses, so I did *something*. That's a huge win in my book, and I felt incredible afterwards. **Woman #4: Shannon** Committed to this challenge as I am, and only having approached one girl today, I went out to a local outdoor mall in the evening. This was a huge struggle for me -- even though its a great place to meet someone and there's loads of cute girls, most of them are in groups so the approach becomes very intimidating. I walked around for a while, went to a bookstore where I saw a really cute girl I should have approached but didn't, then walked around some more. I ended up going into a shop where a pretty cute girl was working. I said hi to her as I walked in, then proceeded to look around, but I knew I needed to approach. I took some time looking around, probably too much time, and then finally worked up the nerve to go talk to her. She was talking with one of her co-workers as they were putting clothes away, so I interrupted: Me: ""Excuse me."" Her: *didn't hear/see me"" Me: ""Excuse me"" a little louder Her: ""Hi!"" Me: ""I don't mean to interrupt for too long, and I know this super random, but I thought you were really cute and wanted to come say hi before I left."" Her: *laughing/smiling* ""Oh, thanks!"" Me: ""What's your name?"" Her: ""Shannon."" Me: ""Hi, Shannon. Nice to meet you, I'm Nate."" We shake hands. Me: ""Are you in classes over the summer?"" Her: ""No, I'm not, just working!"" Me: ""Gotcha. Do you go to [local university]?"" Her: ""Yeah, I do. I just finished my sophomore year."" Me: ""Oh, very nice!"" Her: ""What about you?"" Me: ""I just finished my senior year, but I'm sticking around for a Master's."" Her: ""Oh, that's cool!"" Me: ""Yeah! Well hey, I gotta go meet some people so I'm kind of in a hurry, but could I grab you phone number and we can go grab coffee sometime?"" Her: ""Oh! Yeah, sure!"" Got her number Me: ""Cool, well it was amazing to meet you Shannon."" Her: ""You too!"" Me: ""See ya!"" *Reflection*: First, I'm happy that I did anything at all because my heart was beating out of my chest and I was nervous as hell. Second, I'm happy I stuck around for a second to talk to her, even if the conversation was boring and we didn't really make an obvious emotional connection. I don't really expect anything to come of it, but that's fine. My win was just in approaching in the first place. "

So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Day 3 So none of my friends wanted to go out last night, but I still had to go make my two approaches, so I decided to go out alone. Just the idea of going out alone makes me nervous. I had a vision in my head of me going out, being to nervous to talk to anyone, and just roaming around for the night because I didn't want to be that guy who just hangs out alone at a bar. Behind this apprehension was fear, a fear that I'm not good enough to be liked by strangers -- that I'm not social enough, fun enough, or funny enough to add value to a group of people. I should add that a big realization that I made in the last 9 months is that I hadn't been a source of fun and enjoyment for myself for almost my entire life -- I was always reliant on someone else or some external circumstance to have fun or enjoy my time. I wanted to change that, so I started going out with no alcohol and really pushing myself to try and self-amuse, let go, and have fun, and I made a lot of progress. I know from the past several months that I can go out without alcohol and dance and talk to people and have fun. This fear I have of not being good enough is bull shit, but it's still there -- I've proven to myself that I can be sober and have fun with friends, but I haven't proven to myself that I can be sober and have fun with strangers. I think going out alone every once and a while will be important for me. Anyway let's get into it: I put on my NASA shirt, which is a really cool looking shirt and in the past has gotten some comments from people, and leave my house and drive to the street in my area with a bunch of bars. When I arrive I sat in my car for probably fifteen minutes, basically immobilized by apprehension. I sat in my car and smiled for a minute or so and reminded myself that I have total permission to be a blow out tonight. My marker for success is just trying. I walk around for about fifteen minutes working up the courage to approach someone. In the mean time, I was just practicing good eye contact and body language as I walked around -- I had a very slight smile on my face and I was trying to practice ""smizing"" #TyraBanks. Actually though, this is an awesome thing to think about and try, in my opinion, if you want to have eyes that appear engaged, fun, and awake. The trick that I discovered if you're wondering ""am I doing this right?"" is to look at your self in the mirror, and pay attention to how you upper eyelid covers your iris when you have a blank, serious face and when you smile -- what you will find is that when you have a serious, uninviting face, your upper eyelid droops a little bit and covered the top part of your iris, but when you smile, both your eyelids shift slightly so that your entire iris is in-view. Now, don't smile with your mouth, but engage the facial muscles around your eyes that cause your eyelids to lift slightly and stop covering your iris -- now you're smizing. Anyway, I stop on a corner and texted a friend that I was ""shitting my pants,"" and then I saw a guy I knew and a friend crossing the street. I went over and said hey to them, told them I was out alone, and they told me I should roll with them for the night. I'll add briefly that this prevented me from having to approach total strangers, which is the thing I feel a lot of fear about, but I also don't know these guys too well, so I think it was a good starting place. We head to the first bar, and I tell them about this challenge. They both thought it was awesome that I was going to try it, and one of the guys wanted to wing with me. This brings me to set #1: **Day 3, Woman #5: Emma** The two guys I'm with grab some drinks and we stand at some bar tables for a minute. I'll add briefly that this is an arcade bar, so there's lot's of old arcade games everywhere. This guy points out these two cute girls standing over by some games, and I tell him I'll go approach and he shakes my hand and says he'll come with me. This interaction ended up being kind of long, so I'm recalling the conversation as best I can. We walk over and I had no idea what the hell to say. As soon as we get there attention, I lift my hand and kind of point at them, and I was about to say something stupid like ""hey, we thought you were both really cute and wanted to come say hi."" One of the girls, however, interprets my hand raising as me pointing at the game behind them and asked if we were trying to get to the game. Instantly, I rolled with it: Girl #1: Are you trying to play? Me: Yeah, we actually came over here to challenge you two. *pointing at Frogger* Both Girls: *laugh* Girl #1: Frogger isn't really my game, I'm more of a ski ball person. Me: (*Keeping my feet where they are, I leaned back a little bit in disapproval)* That sounds like an excuse. Girl #1: *smiles and shrugs her shoulders* Since this conversation was long, I'm not gonna give the whole thing as a play by play. Here's what happened next: Then, my wing said he didn't know what ski ball was, and they both laughed and were teasing him about it, acting playfully shocked that he hadn't heard of one of the most popular arcade games ever. This led to us challenging each other to a game of ski ball. We all walk over to the machines, and my wing and Girl #1 start playing each other. Me and Emma sat at some stools next to the ski ball machines, and I teased her a little bit more about the challenge, asking her if they were going to hustle us or something. After a little back and forth, I asked for her name: Emma; she asked for mine, and I said ""Nate,"" but she misheard it as ""Fade."" We both laughed, and commented about some weirdly named people we had both met. I then told her that Fade should be name of my angsty, high school age alter-ego -- the part of me that wants to blast fall out boy in the car, and style my hair so that it falls in front of my eyes. She laughed and we talked some more. She then said that she got reserved a pool table, so we walked over there to set up. She asks me how much pool I play, and I jokingly tell here that I play at least two games a day, even though I've only played pool a handful of times. At this point my wing and Girl #1 come over, and the girls jokingly ask me if I work for NASA because of my shirt. I reply that, actually, I did work for NASA (I'm an aerospace engineer, and I interned at a NASA lab for a summer), and they were all surprised. *As a side note: I don't usually like talking about what I do, and in the past I have refrained from telling anyone what I study and what I'm doing because the context where I can say ""I worked for NASA and I'm getting a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering"" without it coming off as bragging and douchy is somewhat narrow. I've realized in the last year or so that although my ability to do what I have done has come from the intelligence that I inherited, I earned my degree and got to take part in these cool internships by struggling a lot, putting in ridiculous hours, and working my ass off, and that's its not something I should be ashamed of talking about out of the fear of seeming douchy and egotistical. Its a genuinely interesting part of my life that I should share when the opportunity arises, but not take advantage of it to make it seem like I'm better than anyone else.* We play pool, and I keep joking with them, and asked a little bit more about them -- what they studied (both were recent graduates), what their plans were for the summer, etc. Even though I hadn't really played pool before, some beginners luck came through and my first couple shots were actually pretty crazy -- I ended up shooting the cue across the table to have it bounce off a couple walls, and come back at a perfect angle to a ball that I wasn't really aiming for and hitting it in. Emma was like ""wtf"" and joked with me about hustling her. This happened 3 or 4 times, to the point where I was like ""wtf is happening."" I laughed at Emma and pointed at my NASA shirt, kind of implying a rocket scientist would be good at pool. Anyway, I find out Emma's leaving the country for the summer, and she flies out on Tuesday. Her and her friend were leaving to another bar, so I got her number and told her we should definitely hang when she gets back to the US. **Reflection:** This was an awesome interaction for me. The conversation flowed easily, and I felt like I went into a kind of flow where I was able to tease and make jokes pretty easily. It was really good experience to stay in an interaction and actually have fun with someone. In retrospect, however, I didn't escalate. I realized while we were playing pool that although I was flirting with Emma lightly, I wasn't pushing things forward very much, and I wasn't touching her physically almost at all -- the interaction was starting to become more platonic. At the end, I didn't set up the logistics for us to keep hanging out and go to a different bar together. This is definitely something I need to work on. **Day 3, Woman #6: Unknown** Me and these two guys go to a different bar, and they grab some drinks and we sit down at a table. After a few minutes, two fairly cute girls go to the bar behind us. Me and my wing decide to approach, but neither of us knew what to say. I told him we could ask them to settle and argument for us, and we decide to go with that. I ask where my wing is from and he said the east coast, so I said we should tell the girls we're trying to settle an argument about whether the east coast or west coast is the better place to live. We both walk over, and I touch one of the girls on the shoulder, keeping a little bit more than an arms length between us. Me: Excuse me, me and my friend are trying to settle and argument, and we're wondering if we can get your opinion. Girl: *Smiles a little bit, but didn't seem super interested* Sure. Me: Okay, so my friend here is from the east coast... Her: What part? Him: \[State\] Her: No way, that's where I'm from. She's from there too! *Points to friend* At this point, this girl's friend turns around from the bar, and gets in the conversation. The three of them talk about their state for awhile, and what parts of it they were from and what not. One of the girls asks us how we knew each other. My wing replies through a mutual friend, and I add that we had just met that night. I continue, joking, that we had become best friends instantly, and that when we met, we just had the most beautiful moment of eye contact, and that sealed the deal. It was like love at first sight. She didn't really find that amusing, and I started to get the vibe from her that she thought we were just more guys trying to get with them -- her body language was kind of closed off, and she was giving much indication of interest. After a few minutes, I could tell that the interaction was seriously dwindling, and these two girls had friends waiting for them. A guy came over with his phone out and pulled pulled one of the girls away. I tell the other girls that we didn't want to hold her up if her friends were waiting for her, but she stayed and talked to my wing. I left my wing to talk with her, and went back to our table. **Reflection:** It was a success just for approaching, and I'm happy about that. I'm not too sure what to take away from this set though, and I'd like your guys' opinion. **General:** This was my first night out with a wing man, and that actually worked really well. I've found that, like a lot of guys, I have a lot of trouble coming up with what to say. I find that compliments come pretty easy to me, but I think in some cases, like last night, being direct may not be the way to go. I'd love to hear your guys' opinion on opening in different scenarios, and what kinds of go to situational or observational openers you go for (ie comment about location, girl's body language, etc.), and also how you open with a wing. Thanks for reading! **3 days down, 47 days to go.** "

So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Day 4 Let me start this by saying that I failed to do any approaches today. I had a few opportunities, and I didn't take them. Here's how the day went. It's Father's Day, so I spend most of the day with family. Not having done my approaches, I decide to go to my local outdoor mall. Me and a friend get there and instantly as we round the corner, a super cute girl walks by and crosses the street before I had time to think -- I didn't approach. We go to a bookstore. Shortly after we get in there, its starts raining outside. At this point, I basically had to wait for a girl that I found attractive to come into the store, as I would have been soaking wet in a matter of minutes if I went outside. While looking at some books, I see a cute girl who comes over and starts checking out some books by me. I didn't get a great look at her before she walked over, and now I couldn't really see her face. I felt like I should just approach and say something regardless, but in the few moments it took me to hesitate, she put the book she was looking at down and walked out the store. No other attractive girls came in while I was there (that I saw). This isn't super surprising -- its Father's Day, I was at an outdoor mall, and it was raining pretty heavily. Not having approached anyone, and needing to get some groceries, I stop by a local grocery store on the way home for about 30 minutes. The store was dead, and no approaches happened. **Reflection:** The big lesson for me today is that hesitation and apprehension come at a huge cost. I spent probably 3+ hours yesterday trying to approach 2 girls, which is kind of ridiculous. In theory, I recognize that I could get through two approaches in a total of 10-30 minutes depending on where I am. Because I hesitated on two opportunities however, I ended up spending an enormous amount of time out, and left frustrated. In the future, I'm going to try to *just go* when an opportunity arises, and not stand there thinking about it. Easier said than done, though. "

So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Day 5 So after not approaching anyone yesterday, I felt a kind of ""failure momentum"" going into today. I had a couple instances where I could have approached, but my nerves got the best of me. Once or twice I started getting thoughts that this is unsustainable in the long run, that I probably couldn't finish this challenge, and that this was kind of a ridiculous thing to be doing. I even had some more pernicious thoughts come up about how in my attempts to change behavior in the past, I would give up not long after the initial wave of motivation faded away. But you know what I thought of? 1) I'm looking to permanently change the way I act, and that requires consistent effort over a long period of time -- and I know it's possible. Shit, I make my bed and floss everyday. If I've been able to floss everyday for the last 3 years, I can make approaching a habit too. 2) Talking to two girls a day requires maybe 5-10 minutes. The idea that its not possible or unsustainable is bull shit. If I don't go on instagram and talk to girls instead, I'd probably still save some time in my day. Anyway, let's get into this: **Day 5, Woman #7: Lauren** Its raining like hell outside, and I'm inside a building on my university campus. A seemingly cute girl walks over into an area close to me next to the coffee shop. About to head out of there, I pack up my bag and start walking. I almost didn't approach out of fear, but I took one step forward, and then another, and before I knew it I was standing next to her: Me: Excuse me? Her: Hi! Me: I'm on my way out of here, but I saw you walk in. I thought you were really cute and I wanted to come say hi before I left. Her: (*smiling/surprised)* Oh, well thank you! I continue to ask her some questions about what herself like what she studies, what year she is, but the quality of this interaction was definitely different than any I had made before. I still felt super nervous, but after I opened my mouth, I settled into a kind of excited/happy state and I was definitely a little higher energy, more friendly, and smiling more than I had in my previous approaches. I get her number after a few back and forths, and then I ask her if she remembers what my name was. She said no and laughed a little, so I took a step back and said ""oh my god, deleting this number"" sarcastically. She laughed, apologized and said she was terrible with names. I told her my name was Nate, and that I'd text her later. Then I left. **Reflection:** I think it's awesome that I'm starting to feel a little more comfortable in these interactions, and that I'm smiling and making small jokes. Overall, I felt like this was a decent approach. **Day 5, Woman #8: Nicole** After going to the gym, I stop by the grocery store to pick up a few things. I like looking through the supplement section, so I went there for a few minutes and while I was there, I spotted a seemingly cute girl out of the corner of my eye in the section across from me. Her hair was blonde and long, and it was hiding her face, but she had great style and a nice body. I waited a second, then before I knew if my feet were moving and I was walking towards her: Me: Excuse me? Her: Yeah? Me: I was just about to head out of here, but I thought you were really cute and wanted to come say hi before I left. Her: (*laughs a little, smiles)* Oh! Well... hi! *(sticks out hand)* Me: (*shake her hand and laugh)* What's your name? Her: Nicole. Me: Nice to meet you Nicole, I'm Nate. Do you go to \[local university\]? Her: No, actually, I go to \[university about 40 minutes away\]. Me: Oh, wow! You're a long way from home. Her: Yeah, I come here every Monday. Me: *(Observing that we are in the assorted nut/snack section)* I see, you drive all the way here every Monday to peruse the trail mix selection. Her: (*Laughs and goes along with it)* Oh, yeah, of course. Me: They don't make trail mix anywhere like they do at this particular grocery store. Her: *(Laughs)* Basically. I then ask her some question about university and what not, and close the interaction out by grabbing her number. Then off I went. **Reflection:** Again, I felt more comfortable in this interaction once I opened my mouth, and I actually kind of surprised myself that I was able to tease her and make her laugh, and how easy that was. Overall, decent interaction. **General:** One of the things I think has actually been helping a lot is watching stand-up comedy. I've found a couple comedians that make me laugh a lot (Dave Chapelle, Joe Rogan, Chris D'Elia), and I watched some of their stuff. It put me in a joking kind of mood, and I've noticed that I've been making a few more jokes than I usually do, and I feel like I'm in more of fun state of mind. What are your guys' thoughts about these approaches? Thanks for reading! **5 Days down, 45 to go**"

So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Day 6 I'm beginning to realize that the logistics of this challenge are... challenging. My day to day life puts me in an area where there certainly are girls, but not in an area where approaching is possible directly. I work as a research assistant at a university, so there are definitely cute girls taking summer classes here, the only problem is that they are only on campus from 9-5pm, which are the exact hours I'm stuck inside a building writing code. Having only approached one girl today, I spent almost two hours going from a grocery store to target to the outdoor mall in my area looking to get my other approach. I didn't see any girls at the grocery store or target (it was kind of late in the evening though), and the cute girls I did see at the outdoor mall were nested in groups of people or were obviously there with a SO. I'm now 3 approaches behind for the challenge. Given that day time logistics are tough for me, I may have to settle for 1-3 approaches during the day, and play catch up on the weekends. I think modifying my approach to this challenge in this way could be beneficial though: one of the things I really like that Mark Manson talks about in Models is honesty, and approaching honestly is probably the single most important thing to me. I'm not out here to ""practice picking up girls,"" so to speak, but I am out here to approach women I honestly find attractive, and to be honest, going out of my way and spending 2+ hours looking around for a girl to approach feels super needy and dishonest. I'd rather put my effort into slightly re-organizing my day so that the approaches can happen more naturally, and I could really use some advice from you guys on that front. I'm thinking maybe I take two 10-15 minute breaks in the morning and afternoon to take a walk around campus -- it'll be a good break my work and present me with more opportunities to approach. Additionally, maybe I park on the side of campus farther away from my building (not that much farther, maybe add another 5-10 minutes to my walk) so that I have a little more time outside before I get to my building. I'll have to experiment with this, but I'll make sure I keep you guys posted on what I try. Maybe this can help out some of you in a similar situation. Anyway, let's get into the day. **Day 6, Woman #9: Unknown** I went to a library on campus to do some work, and when I sat down I made eye contact with a familiar face -- I saw a girl I knew from track back in high school, but I've never really talked to her and haven't seen her in years. She was about to leave, so I packed up my stuff and walked over to her and friend who were sitting at a table. I'm not gonna give the play by play on this conversation because it was pretty short, and she was neutral/disinterested in talking to me. I asked her if she pole vaulted back in high school, and she said yes, then I proceeded to ask her some catch up questions (does she still do it, etc.), but she was giving short answers and obviously wasn't interested in catching up. She said it was cool to run into me, then she left. **Reflection:** The success here was just in doing the approach, especially because that's the part I'm still having trouble with. I don't think I necessarily did anything wrong here either, she just wasn't receptive -- no big deal. **Confirmed Date with Shannon** So I texted Shannon from Day 2, and we set up a date for tomorrow. The conversation went as follows: Me: Hey, Shannon! It's Nate! Me: I have a super important question for you Her: Yeah what's up! Me: How do you feel about fun dates with cute boys? Her: Honestly I'm more of a boring dates with ugly boys kinda gal, but I guess I could mix it up! Me: hahah You free tomorrow around 8pm? Let's grab some ice cream at \[local outdoor mall\]! Her: Yeah! And the rest is logistics. I'm excited because I'm actually looking forward to going out with this girl -- this isn't something I've felt recently, or very many times in my life. She's super cute by my book, and she seems pretty cool. Wish me luck! \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Journal Archive: [Days 1 &amp; 2](URL [Day 3](URL [Day 4](URL [Day 5](URL"

So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Day 7 - The Date Okay, so first off I didn't successfully approach any girls today -- I spent my entire morning inside and skipped lunch to finish a presentation I had to give in the afternoon. I ended up doing really well on my presentation, so that's pretty cool by itself. Anyway, I finish this presentation, get lunch, and go back to campus for about 30 minutes to try and do my approaches before I go to the gym and get ready for my date. You know that saying that each level has a new boss? That's what I'm experiencing -- if I have a few minutes to work up the courage to approach a girl who is sitting down somewhere, I can do it, but just spontaneously opening my mouth when walking past a girl is showing itself to be another anxiety block. I walked around my campus for those thirty minutes and I panicked out of approaching a couple girls. Feeling kind of frustrated, I went to the gym and went home to get ready for my date with a girl from day 2. I show up to the date (ice cream at local outdoor mall), see Shannon, walk up, give her a hug, and walk inside the ice cream store. We're talking and keeping things light, and the mindset I was in was that of familiarity -- how would I talk to her if she were one my long-time friends? S*ide Note on Familiarity*: I mentioned in an earlier post that I've spent a good amount of my time going out this last year focused solely on self-amusement. I realized I wasn't being my own source of fun and enjoyment or being very social -- I was relying on alcohol for that -- so I went out sober and learned how to have fun with people without alcohol. I did that (and I now prefer to go out without any alcohol, although I occasionally will have a drink or two), and one of the times I went out dancing, I met this incredible girl named Amy -- a stunning red head who was a great dancer, and she was hilarious and incredibly fun. I honestly don't think I've hit it off faster with any person in my life -- we absolutely ""clicked."" I end up finding out that she was in a relationship of almost 5 years (her BF is a super cool guy), but we became good friends and hang out regularly now. When I think of familiarity, I think of how I feel when I hang out with this girl. From the minute we started talking, it was like we'd been long-time friends and genuinely enjoyed each other's company, and that vibe hasn't gone away. I'm completely myself around her, and she thinks its hilarious, and vice-versa. That's what I channel when I meet new girls/people in general. Anyway, back to my date: me and this girl kind of hit it off, and we were obviously attracted to each other. We walked around the mall for about in hour and talked, then I asked her if she had any plans for the rest of the night, she said no, so I told her we should go get some beer and watch a movie at my place. She agreed, and we left. We get to my place, have some drinks, and start a movie. The physical contact barrier hadn't totally been broken yet, so I used stories as an opportunity to do that. We we're talking about scary movies, so I started telling this story of how I watched the Grudge when I was 7-8 years old and it scarred me for years. Just prior to getting into the story though, I told her something stupid with a smile on my face like, ""This story is traumatizing -- I think I'm gonna need you to hold my hand."" From there, the physical stuff escalated. She's a talker during movies, and she told me that if she's talking to much that I should just tell her to shut up. We're cuddling and she's talking, so I tell her to shut up and I kiss her. We make out, I fumble miserably getting her bra off (remember the virgin thing? lol), but I totally owned it and made a stupid joke about my worthless aerospace engineering degree. She laughed and took her bra off, then I took my shirt off and we kept making out. Eventually, things started to get very sexual, and she said she had bad news, and that it was the only bad news a girl could have. I tell her, laughing, ""no worries, there's no bad news tonight"" then kissed her again. We end up hanging out, cuddling, and talking in my bed till like 2am, and then I drove her home. I didn't bring up my virginity, although I will if we hang out again and things get sexual. Being honest is super important to me, and I want her to be able to make the decision about whether she wants to take someone's virginity. If not, no worries. # Day 8 - Symptoms So once again I didn't have an successful approaches on Thursday. I was busy working during the day, then I had a Capoeira class at night, but I was going out with some friends afterwards, so I figured I do my approaches there. One of the things I need to add in here, because its relevant, is that I started taking a medication (Propecia/Finasteride) last week because I caught early signs of a receding hairline and I'd like to keep my hair as long as I can (I'm 21). If you're not aware, finasteride prevents your body from converting testosterone into the more potent hormone Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (DHT, on some level, is responsible for the systematic death of hair follicles known as male pattern baldness), so it screws with your hormones and a lot of guys get mild side effects, and some small percentage of men get severe side effects that don't get better after stopping the medication (depression, ED, loss of libido, etc.). It's a super controversial drug, even though *most* men (70-85&amp;#37;) don't get *any* negative side effects. Anyway, I've been having side effects since starting the drug, and they've gotten worse over the week: I've noticed a significant decrease in my libido these last two days; I've been having trouble concentrating; I've been losing my train of thought when talking, which is very unlike me; it feels like my blood pressure is low (like I just ate thanksgiving dinner and stood up too quickly, but all the time); I've been having mood swings (only from neutral to negative emotions and back); I'm having trouble falling asleep at night (I haven't had insomnia in years); and I have waves of fatigue/tiredness (possibly due to insomnia). I've since stopped taking the drug and I'm going to see my GP to talk about continuing/quitting the medication. But as of this day, I'm on the medication, and I went out with my friends even though I wasn't feeling well -- I thought going out, moving, and talking to people might make me feel better. However, after going out, I started getting waves of tiredness and I really didn't have any interest in talking to girls. I end up calling it a night and heading home. # Day 9 - More Numbers **Day 9, Woman #10:** I'm feeling much better in the afternoon today, and my friend that I mentioned in the familiarity section in Day 7 invited me over to have a wine/movie night with her and a bunch of people. I go over, and one of the girls who came over was stunning -- super cute yoga teacher, smart, and gave off this incredibly kind vibe. I talk to her for a while through out the night but she was a little on the shy side and I had to do a good amount of the work to keep the conversation funny and interesting. This was a good challenge, and I actually enjoyed it -- in the past (meaning several months ago), I wouldn't have been able to keep a conversation going even if I wanted to, let alone keep it funny and interesting. I surprised myself that I was doing that, and I think it's a good sign that I'm becoming more socially capable and comfortable. Anyway She gave some IOI's throughout the night, particularly with eye contact -- I caught her looking at me when everyone in the group laughed about something, stuff like that. We're all about to go to the bars and dance, but she has to teach a yoga class in the morning, so she parts ways. After she says bye to people, I tell her to wait up, and I catch up with her: Me: ""Hey, I have a question for you."" Her: ""Yeah?"" and keeps walking. Me: I walk next to her and say, ""How do you feel about fun dates with cute boys?"" Her: She stops, turns to me smiling, and laughed a little. ""Well it depends what you mean.."" Me: *About to respond* Her: ""I mean, I'm kind of seeing someone right now, but it's not serious..."" Me: *Smiling,* ""I'll tell you what, let me get your number and we'll figure something out."" She agrees, so I get her number and we part ways. *Reflection:* I'm into this girl -- she's very ""my type."" I've never been in this kind of situation though, where a girl says that she has something with another guy even if it's not serious. I feel as though I should just treat it like any other situation -- she was interested, I got her number, so I'll text her to set up a date and see if she wants to meet up. If she's interested, she'll come; if she feels conflicted and says no because she's seeing someone else and she likes him, then good on her for being honest with her values, and no hard feelings. Honestly, her standing up for her values would only make me more attracted. **Day 9, Woman #11:** I get to the bars, and while in line I run into a cute girl I had a class with a long time ago who just recently turned 21. I was already in a fun, social mood, and I greeted her enthusiastically. She immediately hugged me (keep in mind I had a class with this girl, but we never really talked) and started asking me questions. I had just passed the bouncer and I was kind of in the way of the entrance, so I told her I would see her inside. I'm on the dance floor and she comes in with her friends. We see each other, and she hugs me again and we talk. I ask her if she's around for the summer, and she says yes, so I tell her we should hang out soon. She gives an enthusiastic ""Yeah!"" and I ask her for her number. She gives me her number, we talk a little more, than she goes back to meet up with her friends. *Reflection:* This wasn't a pure cold approach since me and this girl met each other a few years ago, but we talked very little throughout that class, so I wouldn't even classify her as an acquaintance. The thing that stands out to me about this particular interaction is that the interaction flowed incredibly smoothly. I'd been having fun all night, and just got a girl's number, and this other girl basically just came over and hugged me. I was showing how much fun I was having with my smile and my energy, and she just seamlessly joined it. It was pretty awesome. This also goes to show the value of surrounding yourself with people you enjoy spending time with also. I was having a lot of fun with the people I was with, and it showed. **General:** So due to some external circumstances (work, medication side affects and feeling shitty) and some anxiety on my part, I haven't been able to keep up with approaching 2 girls a day. Another factor that's playing into this is honesty, though -- I don't want to approach a girl for ""practice"" that I'm not honestly interested in. I don't like this idea of treating people *only* as a means to an end. Obviously, I am engaging with women with the goal in mind of becoming better with women in general, so in that way the women I approach are a kind of means to an end, but I can also do that in an honest way, where I approach women I am *honestly* attracted to and genuinely interested in getting to know better. With that being said, I won't force myself to approach a women I don't honestly find attractive and express sexual interest just to meet my quota for the day, even if that means not getting to 100 women by the end of 50 days. I'm still committed to approaching however many attractive women I see, however.

Something in me does not want to live in fear and anxiety any more, it wants to act with honesty, bravery, and vulnerability. It wants to be bold, and laugh, and play, and love openly. It wants to relieve me of the tragedy that is a life lived too seriously. Kind of ironically, I seriously want to give everything to this thing in me that wants me to live like this. It doesn't feel okay to me anymore to be the kind of guy who treats the menu like the meal, or the map like the territory -- I'm tired of *reading* things about how to improve my life and cultivate a healthy way of expressing myself sexually. So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Day 10 &amp; 11 Okay, so I didn't approach any girls on Sunday -- I spent the day with project groups and then hanging with some friends making pancakes, hot tubbing, and watching some TV shows. Honestly, it was a super fun day and part of my broader goal is to be more social, so this wasn't a ""failure"" day in my book -- at all. Now, into today, which is perhaps a lesson behind the ""don't shit where you gym"" idea. This afternoon, I went to the rec center on my campus to go to the gym. First approach: **Day 11, Woman #12:** I do Capoeira (afro-brazilian martial art), so I usually start my workout days with some handstand work and what not. I go into an empty studio and do some handstand stuff, and about halfway through my usual stuff these two girls walk in. I ask them if there was a class in the studio, they said something like ""no, is it cool if we're in here?"" and I said ""yeah, of course."" After some point, after I've been doing handstand stuff in front of these girls for like 10 minutes, one of the girls gets up and starts doing handstands. I make a comment that her handstands were pretty good, and she adds back that she used to be on the cheer team for the university. I briefly tell them about Capoeira, and how me and a friend started a club on campus that has free classes once a week if they wanted to come check it out. Fast forward a little bit, one of the friends leaves, and the other one stays. On my way out, I say ""Excuse me. If you're interested, I can grab your number and text you about our next class."" She agrees, and then I talk to her for a few minutes after grabbing her number. Then I was out of there. *Reflection:* This set actually felt pretty natural. I've read on here that you shouldn't approach and get numbers at the gym (for various reasons), but this number kind of fell into my lap. This also wasn't a clear ""this is a date"" kind of thing, but I think it was okay: I invited her, as a cool guy she met, to come try something new and fun. That's a victory in my book. **Day 12, Woman #13:** This is my most intense and perhaps slightly embarrassing approach to date (hooray for finally embarrassing myself!!). Heading out of the gym, I see this absolutely stunning girl (solid 9) working at the front desk. She's talking with two gym bros who work there and were hanging out behind the desk. Kind of an intimidating set, but I decide to approach 'cause #fuckit. Me: Excuse me? Her: Hi Me: Hey, I know this is super random, but I thought you were really cute and I wanted to say hi! Her: *smiling/laughing* Well, hi! Me: What's your name? Her: \[insert name here\] Me: Nice to meet you, I'm Nate. At this point, everyone behind the desk was looking at me, and I definitely felt nervous. I rolled with the conversation though, and asked her some questions about what she studied, what she wants to do now that she graduated, etc. After a few minutes of decent conversation, I said: Me: I have a question for you. Her: Yeah? Me: How do you feel about fun dates with cute boys? Her: *laughs* Well, I'm actually kind of seeing someone right now. Me: *laughing/smiling* Oh, okay, well does he let you have friends? Her: *laughing/surprised/sarcastic* Obviously, like he's the one who controls that! At this point, my nerves were getting in the way and I wasn't feeling particularly collected. I ended up saying something like I'll see you around then, and then she said: Her: You're ballsy. Me: *laughing* Thanks. I'll see you around. *Reflection:* So this was my first ""I have a boyfriend"" rejection, and, not knowing what to say, I 100&amp;#37; used a line in response that I got from a youtube video (very debatable choice, but the past is the past). Additionally, after leaving I recognized that line could have come off as kind of sexist and/or demeaning (implying that her boyfriend controls her), and I feel weird about saying that. This is a cool moment though, all things considered, because I said something risky, possible offensive, and now my neediness is rearing its head. I'm having thoughts/feeling surrounding how what I said could have been interpreted negatively, and made me seem like a sexist or an asshole, and I also had serious thoughts about apologizing if that came off as demeaning, particularly because I *will* see her again. Here's me thinking through some options: * **Apologize/Clarify:** Next time I see her (likely this week), I say something like ""Hey, I realized that joke I made about that guy letting you have friends could have come off as demeaning on accident, so I wanted to make it clear that it was just a joke."" My thoughts about doing that are conflicted though (see below). * **Do Nothing:** I don't act like what I said was a big deal, and next time I see her I just smile and say hi, then go about my business. First off, what do I think a confident, secure man do? Well, he would probably have already forgotten about what he said since he meant it as a joke and he's not going to apologize for what he said, even if it was interpreted wrong -- something like that. Or, realizing that he may have said something he didn't mean, he's honest about how it could have been misinterpreted and clears that up without ""apologizing"" for saying it. Not super sure here though. Secondly, what would a needy man do? Well, he'd be emotionally distraught about saying something that could have possibly caused others to view him in a negative light, and he would apologize the first chance he got because he overvalues other people's opinions of him, doesn't correctly acknowledge how little other people think about him anyway, and severely overestimates how much impact saying one stupid thing actually has in a context like this. I know this is exactly what a needy man would do because its exactly what I've wanted to do since realizing what I said could have come off badly. What do you guys think? Do you have a perspective/opinion that supports going the apology route, or do you think it's no big deal and I'm way overthinking it? Thanks for reading!"

So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Days 12, 13, and 14: A Big Step If you've been reading my updates, then you'll know that I've been able to approach women in scenarios where I have a minute to sit there and work up the nerve, but when I'm out walking around I just choke because of the intense anxiety. Another thing I've noticed is the surge of negative emotion that has come up has a result the multiple days I've had where I don't do any approaches. Its true that some days the opportunity may not be there for one reason or another (work, other plans, I don't come across any girl I'm honestly attracted to, etc.), which is fine, but I've now had several days where I actually went out with the intention of approaching and didn't do it. Two days ago was one of those days (day 12). I actually went out to a crowded, popular outdoor mall with the intention of doing my two approaches, but ended up walking a couple laps and going home because I choked on one approach, and then choked on the other opportunities as well. I've been aware as feelings of failure and giving up have arisen, as well as excuses and thoughts trying to rationalize why I shouldn't be approaching women like I am, or why I should give up this challenge (I don't actually want to be doing thing, this is way too much time and effort, doing this as a numbers game is unhealthy and dishonest, I'm only building bad habits of relating to women this way, etc.). Two nights ago and yesterday (Day 13), however, I sat and thought about this challenge. I reflected on what my goals were at the beginning of this challenge -- what was my ""why"" when I started. My goals are to build courage in the face of vulnerability, to learn to act despite the presence of negative emotions like fear and anxiety, to learn to comfortable with expressing myself sexually, to open up opportunities for amazing, meaningful connections and experiences with women, and to regain trust in that I will do what I say I'm going to do. Reflecting on these goals were a good reminder that so long as these goals are at the core of what I do, nothing but good things can come from this -- and also that, given these goals are a major part of the kind of life I feel I should live, there really is nothing better I could be spending time working on. Let's get into it. **Day 13, Approach #14: Sophia** So I go out again to this outdoor mall, and I sat in my car for a minute. Excuses were raging through my head and so was apprehension. After a second, I realized I was just sitting there wasting time by making excuses, so I started counting down from 5 (#MelRobbins) and before I hit 1 I was out of my car and walking. *Side Note:* I've taken several cold shower challenges in the past (and I'm currently doing one), and one of the things I did was right before I would step in, when excuses are raging and I feel anxiety and apprehension, I count down from 3, and step the fuck in. I would do this *every* time. I'm sure someone has posted on this sub about cold showers before, but part of the philosophy of cold showers is to look discomfort, anxiety, apprehension, and excuses in the face, and do it any way. It's very similar to approaching women, in that aspect. Back to the story: I go to cross the street and immediately there is this stunning brunette walking towards me holding a a drink and a take-home box. Without even thinking about it, I stopped her: Me: Excuse me. Her: Yeah? Me: I know this is random, but I really liked your look and I wanted to stop you and say hi! Her: *smiling* Oh my gosh, thank you! Me: *laughing* Yeah. (I noticed by her body language that she was intent on heading somewhere) Are you in a hurry? I don't want to keep you if you've got somewhere to be. Her: Ehh, yes and no. Me: What's your name? Her: Sophia. Me: Nice to meet you Sophia, I'm Nate. I'd shake your hand but.. *kind of laughing, acknowledging her full hands* Her: Oh! *frees up hand and shakes my hand.* Nice to meet you. *Then she started walking away..* Have a good night! Me: You too. *Reflection:* I'm just super happy that I actually opened my mouth. It's something I've read a lot before, particularly on here, but this is the first time I just approached without thinking about it at all. I think I had her interest for a moment, but instead of acknowledging the hand shake thing, I think I should have moved on and just asked for her number, especially since I could tell she was on her way somewhere. **Day 13, Approach #15: Unknown** Very shortly after I leaving the first interaction, I see a cute girl in a black dress walking in the opposite direction of me, she's crossing to the other side of the mall, and I lightly jog to catch up with her: Me: Excuse me? Her: *didn't hear* Me: Excuse me? Her: *turning around and looking at me* Me: Hey, I know this is really random, but I thought you were cute and wanted to say hi. Then, as soon as I finished my sentence, a guy comes and stands next to her. Me: Oh, are you here with him? Her: *not really registering what was going on* Me: *turning attention to the guy* Are you here with her? (note that this happened super quick, wasn't awkward at all) Him: Yeah Me: Oh, cool! I thought she was cute, so I wanted to say hi. Him: *laughs* Yeah, she is super cute Me: *laughing/walking away* Have a good night guys. *Reflection:* Overall, I'm pretty happy with this interaction. This is the first time I've had another person bust into the interaction, but I handled it with a smile and good energy, and the interaction didn't feel awkward, just kind of random. Also, guess how long both of these approaches took, combined??? ***5 minutes*** Onto Day 14: I went out twice today (for about 15-20 minutes each) to aforementioned outdoor mall, but I didn't run into any girls I was honestly attracted to. The second time I went there was around 10:30pm, so there were definitely a lot of people there, and definitely a lot of really cute girls, but most were inside the bars and not out walking around. I had to work kind of late tonight, so that's why I got there at a weird time. I don't feel comfortable walking into bars by myself and approaching girls there -- so I guess that's the next step, right? # General I honestly feel like I made huge progress these last couple days by successfully doing two of these spontaneous ""I literally just saw you 5 seconds before I opened my mouth"" kind of approaches. These kinds of situations are forcing me to get out of my head, stop thinking, and just do it. Even though I'm obviously behind on the whole 2 girls a day thing, I feel like I just caught a massive tailwind since I've proven to myself that I can go out and approach as the opportunity presents itself, and that I could pretty easily do 5-10 approaches in a matter of 15-30 minutes. We'll see where this takes me. Thanks for reading! "

However I have yet to encounter a good reaction of me sharing vulnerabilities and weakness with romantic interests/ partners. Even just talking about past mistakes seems to be a major turnoff. Its like the idea that you might not be at your A game every day and also may have traumas and insecurities dries up pussy instantaneously. It never has deepened any relationship I had. Not even with my sisters. Sad cause it sounds so good in theory. Anyone have different experiences? 
111,vulnerability,seduction,Some counter-intuitive tips for game that most guys are getting wrong,17,8vm9i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8vm9i2/some_counterintuitive_tips_for_game_that_most/,2018-07-03 07:05:55,"1 - You dont need to be an alpha. You just need to have a strong sense of self respect, be capable of making decisions, and understand how to set and enforce boundaries. 2 - Confidently expressing vulnerability is the sexiest thing a high value man can do. You cant have connection without vulnerability. You wont fuck a lot of women you dont connect with. 3 - Actively pursuing women who you think are likely to have similar interests and values as yourself will make your hit rate go up dramatically. If youre an introverted gamer, dont go for the overly dolled up club girl. Go to a hipster dive bar. There are plenty of hot ass girls that play games or are at least cool with them. 4 - Double texting is okay. Neediness is not. Understand the difference. 5 - Girls like dorks. They just dont like needy guys. Girls like nice guys. They just dont like needy guys. 6 - Dont just take rejection gracefully - respect a womans decision to reject you. Head over to r/creepypms or r/niceguys and read. Women expect most dudes they reject to flip out on them. By not flipping out on them, youre showing them that youre better than 90% of the dudes they meet. To take this further, if a woman rejects you, genuinely wish her a good day and let her know there are no hard feelings. If you actually adopt this attitude, youll begin to give off positive and safe vibes, and your approach success rate will go up. 7 - Sub communication is everything. Everything you say, and even things you dont say, is a form of communication. And honestly, you cant fake this shit. You communicate when you put clothes on. You communicate when you do or dont make eye contact as you say something. You communicate when you hesitate to approach. Stop trying to have the perfect opener. Stop trying to have the perfect level of wittiness. Boring ass conversation about her job can be amazing if you just have good sub communication. 8 - Be a good fucking listener. You dont have to be constantly entertaining her. Listening empathetically creates connection. See #2. 9 - Focus on her emotions. Ask her how something made her feel instead of if she liked something. Ask her about her feelings. Tell her about your feelings. Express emotions. Tell her about the time you cried in a movie. Women love emotions. They hate guys who are emotionally walled off. Just dont be NEEDY and emotions are fine. 10 - Show intent. Whether youre direct or indirect doesnt matter verbally because your sub communication should ALWAYS be direct. Kino escalation. Eye contact. Smiling. Listening. You are a man who goes for what he is interested in. You are interested in her, so show some fucking intent. Stop hiding it out of fear of rejection. Stop hiding it because youre afraid that you have to push pull and play games. These things will come naturally and appropriately if you first just show intent and have fun."

So I'm doing something about it. I'm taking *action*. Today. # Days 15 &amp; 16 This week, I'm starting to experience first-hand some of the principles a lot of guys will talk about, like being ""in-state,"" building momentum, and setting your goals in a place where you still achieve success. Here's a brief overview of what I've been experiencing. **Warming Up, Building State, and Momentum:** At my experience level, a cold day game approach is not easy. It's getting better, but it's like a 5 rep max for me -- it's really pushing me. And if you're trying to 5 rep max your squat, for example, you would never walk into the gym cold, get under the bar, and just try to do it. You would warm up -- perhaps by going for a jog, doing some mobility work, and then building up to your weight. Similarly, going up to a women totally cold (ie, ""I was just in a windowless room programming for 8 hours today and haven't talked to anyone"") and then waiting until I open my mouth to try to shift into that confident/smiling/good energy/sociable gear is a recipe for awkward interactions. Queue real-world examples: **Day 15, Approach #16** I had a somewhat sudden increase in my financial responsibilities this last week, so I had to work Thursday, Friday, and Saturday to earn some extra cash. I ended up going out with a few friends on Friday night for about an hour to grab a drink and hang out, and while I'm out, I decide to try to do my approaches. I'm coming off the tail of a bad week of approaches, and I'm seriously behind on my goal. The main thing that I'm noticing is that I feel frustratingly similar to how I did when I started this challenge: nervous, anxious, and lacking in excitement and general confidence. Anyway, I'm walking around and I see a cute girl sitting with her friend over by some people drumming (remember, outdoor mall). As I see them, part of me knew I just need to turn my feet and start walking toward them, but being kind of nervous and anxious, I walked a little past them and almost kept walking before I stopped, said fuck it, and walked over to them. Me: Excuse me? *both girls look* Me: *To the cute one* Hi, I know this is kind of random, but I thought you we're cute and I wanted to come say hi. Her: *laughing* Hi. Me: What's your name? Her: \[Name\] Me: Nice to meet you, I'm Nate. What's your name? *to her friend* Friend: \[interesting/unique name\] Me: Oh, wow, that's a very unique. I've never met anyone with your name. *kind of laughing* At this point, they were not giving off any obvious IOI's, and while the girl I liked was not being closed off, she was also not showing through her body language that she was particularly interested (ie, her shoulder remained slightly turned towards the drummers she was watching). Me: *acknowledging drummers* Do you guys know anything about them? Her: No, not really, we're kind of just waiting for things to pick up around here. Me: Gotcha. I think they might be Hindu (referring to drummers). I got stopped earlier by a guy asking me if I wanted some meditation books. But to be honest, I had no idea that Hindus were such good drummers Her: *shaking her head* Yeah, I don't know. Me: Well look, I gotta go meet up with some people, but I can grab your number? Her: Are you guys going somewhere tonight? Me: Honestly, I don't know. Plans are kind of up in the air. Her: Oh, okay. Me: So can I grab your number? Her: Sure. *types in number* Me: Can you remind me your name again? Her: \[Name\] Me: Do you remember my name? Her: Uhhhh.... no *laughing* Me: Oh my god. *laughing/acting upset* Me: I can't be upset though because I did the same thing. I gotta run, have a good night! Then I left feeling almost worse than before I did the approach, and decided to leave. *Reflection:* That conversation didn't go great, and the interaction in general felt kind of low energy, and a bit awkward and try-hard on my part. I don't think the observation about the drummers was bad at all, they just didn't seem that interested, but instead of trying to ask a question about the girls, I moved straight into asking for her number before establishing much of a connection. I then actually asked for her number *twice,* which, in hindsight, probably came off as super needy, and like I just wanted to get her number and run. Alternatively, after she asked if we were going out, I should have pulled out my phone and handed to her, saying something like ""I'm not sure, but I'll text you if we do."" That could have replaced the second phone number question entirely. Looking at what I did well though: 1) I actually approached and 2) I did actually make her laugh with the whole forgetting my name thing before I left. Additionally, I texted her and she didn't remember who I was by my name (bad sign). I told her my name, and she remembered. I proceeded to ask her out, and didn't get a response back (was expecting this based on the quality of the interaction, but I went for it anyway). Did you think that one was bad? Here's one better. **Day 16, Approach #17** Before I went out yesterday to work, I went to my local outdoor mall to grab an ice coffee and try to do my approaches. Immediately upon arriving I see a girl in a white jumper that looked amazing, but I didn't approach. Again, coming off a bad week of not approaching and giving in to excuses, and then having an awkward interaction last night has seriously taken a shot at my confidence and increased my nerves/anxiety. I'm aware of it though, and I know that I'm capable and just need to get out of my funk. I walk into the coffee shop and see a stunning girl working on her computer near the door. I grab my coffee and on my way out, I walk towards her and open. Throughout this conversation, I was very nervous and I don't think I smiled much or gave off any indication of a good energy, so read through this knowing I'm talking like that: Me: Excuse me? Her: Hi. Me: Hey, I saw you when I walked in and I thought you were really cute, so I wanted to say hi. Her: Oh, hi! Me: What's your name? Her: \[Very cool name\] Me: Nice to meet you, I'm Nate. *shake hands* Me: *noticing her crutches and leg brace* Me: Do you mind me asking what happened to your leg? Her: Oh, I actually just had hip surgery. Me: Oh, wow, that's really intense. Her: Yeah, I'm fine though. (She said this with an almost annoyed tone, as if she was tired of being asked that or something like that) Me: Gotcha. At this point I was feeling nervous and nothing was coming to mind about what to say, so I just went into something. Queue ""questions of doom"" Me: What're you working on? Her: \[Some publishing thing here\] Me: Oh, very nice. Do you enjoy it? *Her phone starts ringing, it's her mom* Her: Oh, it's my mom. *Answers phone* At this point, I honestly didn't know what to do. I thought maybe I should stick around for a second to see if she would just tell her mom she was talking to someone, or really quickly see what she wanted then end the call. I hung around for about 20-30 seconds, then pointed at the door and told her I had to go. *Reflection:* This was by far my most awkward approach, but it was entirely my doing. She was the first person I had really talked to all day, and I really wasn't carrying myself with good energy, and that carried straight over into the interaction. I made a classic rookie mistake too, I think, by immediately beginning the conversation with a question about her injury -- basically starting the interaction by noting something negative. Then, I choked and went into asking generic questions just to try to say something at all. These approaches may have been awkward, but, like I've said a couple times, I've got to be okay with not having every interaction be excellent. I'm obviously not trying to make things awkward, but shit happens and I just need to learn from those interactions and keep moving forward. I've got more to say, but this is already super long so I'm gonna cut it off here. Thanks for reading!"

What is it about his method that is supposed to make a girl want to sleep with you? Old school game has things like DHV stories, pushpull, negs, routines etc (which may or may not be completely bullshit in practice) but at least you can at least convince yourself that you have some tools to make some girl attracted to you.

We're in a really intimate and exciting relationship. She's 18 and I'm 20, we're both virgins. A pretty ""sexual"" girl to be honest: she only had one relationship when really young, no experience when It comes to sex, but quickly got confortable talking sex and escalating, but we never got past oral. I've been trying to gently initiate sex with teasing, exciting her more and more.. she got a bit more confortable with contact as weeks passed, but still shows lots of resistance, oddly for pretty common things (lying on her belly for too long, going doggy, completely removing her panties..). I can tell she's pretty insecure about her body in general (although she's fine as hell) and for instance never wants to remove her bra or show her breasts. (Looks like she has some serious insecurity about them) that's an example among others. All these things aside, for a long time she explained to me she had no experience in sex and had many reasons not to have sex for now, without ever simply telling me she wasn't ready. It was always confusing. Even though I knew something was conflicted within herself.. I put that on behalf of her immaturity. Sometimes she cried, telling me she was fearing losing me more and more as she felt she was making me wait for sex, thinking I would get bored and dump her. One day she told me she could not ""afford"" to have sex, that even if she had the sex drive for it, something deep inside her would tell her not to go any further. From that day on, I quickly understood one side of her wanted to go further, but another was stopping her in her momentum. It was not her being totally platonic. She wanted me but was conflicted. I always told her ""whatever it is, just listen to yourself and tell me if you're not ready for that.""  **But finally**, a few days ago, we went to bed together and she opened up. She told me she's afraid of being hurt. She said she fears losing me once we have sex. That giving me her virginity means so much to her, that her first time with me is like giving me a part of herself, and she would be devastated if l got to leave her later on. She told me she loves me so much that she could have sex right now without hesitation, but deep inside there's this resistance that tries to protect her from being hurt later on. She was bursting in tears. I'm no psychologist but it looks like she sees sex as a threat to our relationship future (me leaving her once I'm ""satisfied"" - I guess) rather that a way for us to connect even deeper and strengthen our love for each other. As if sex would trigger in me the need to see other women, to move on. This is nonsense of course, but how to make her understand that? Before you ask, I think I'm a very caring and loving person, that shows lots of affection when needed and she *knows* I care for her. **But again there's this deep resistance that prevents her from listening to her own desires and just letting go.** I also understood that her playful teases, stops, her preventing me from going further, backing off when it gets very hot or physically resisting when I try to move her in the bed, and saying she's not an easy girl and that I ""won't always get what I want"" - while looking like her trying to be a challenge - all come from this ""self-protection"" (a world she used many times) that comes from a deep insecurity, and not a lack of desire for me. I was wrongly taking it personally in the beginning, but finally understood the use of this ""protection"" word - not protecting her integrity - protecting her emotional stability if ever she got hurt by me after we have our first time. I think this looks like a weird syndrome where the girl thinks that giving her body equals losing all her self-respect and becoming too vulnerable. She's afraid of this vulnerability. She ""withdraws"" sex to keep that vulnerability away for now. **I don't know if this phenomenon is common in inexperienced girls but I'd like to help her getting rid of this state of mind.** I already made her understand I care a lot for her and that I'd never make sex my only source of satisfaction with her (that's obvious... I would have dumped her months ago if it was the case). I really love her and she knows it. But there's this part of her definitely doing more harm than good to both of us. Have any of you experienced this? Thanks for your help guys."
115,vulnerability,seduction,The best way to show her you're willing to walk away?,9,8xuhnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8xuhnn/the_best_way_to_show_her_youre_willing_to_walk/,2018-07-11 09:36:29,"I've occasionally gotten into situations where things are going well with a girl  having lots of fun together, good sex, lots of teasing, healthy emotional vulnerability  and then she starts to pull flaky shit. She'll begin to be unresponsive when you try to set up the next meet, say she'll ""let you know"" about plans and never follow up, or cancel day-of for bullshit reasons. At this point, pursuing further only shows her that if she walks all over your boundaries, you'll chase her. I think in these cases the only thing to do is to show you're willing to walk away without ending things (yet). However, I'm not really sure what the best course of action is. Here are three options that I think are pretty good: **Option 1** is to simply go silent. Stop texting her altogether, and wait for her to start pursuing you. I think this is often a good option, though it can require some willpower to not reach out. If she doesn't ever reach out, then maybe in like three weeks you can ping her with something dumb and low-commitment, but she probably just isn't interested. **Option 2** is to pull something Mark Manson suggests in *Models*. He writes that if a girl won't agree to go out with him or make definite plans: &gt; I would have told her flat out that if she wasnt excited to be on a date with me, then Id rather her save us both the time and not show up. This might seem a bit harsh and I've never used it myself. But I think the advantage is that you know right away where you stand. Either she gives you a 'no' or she sincerely lets you know she's sorry. I'd chalk up anything else as a loss. The downside is that it might seem needy in a weird sort of way, like you're demanding validation that she likes you, but I think this is balanced by the fact that you're suggesting you end things. **Option 3** is to do what this brilliant man [suggested](URL if she won't make definite plans, then say: &gt; hey didn't hear back from you so i went ahead and made other plans. I'll make it up to you another time, promise. xo I've used this a few times to great effect  it shows you're not going to wait around for her and that you have other things going on in your life (assuming you're telling the truth, which you should be). The downside is that if she really was going to let you know about a definite time to hang out or was planning to get back to you, you've cockblocked yourself. But that's a risk you have to take sometimes. ---- I'd be interested to hear what other people like to do in this sort of situation. What approach works best in your experience?"
116,vulnerability,seduction,Daytime 35yo guy Cold Approach LOG,11,8jns63,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8jns63/daytime_35yo_guy_cold_approach_log/,2018-05-16 04:13:58,"Hi Guys. 35yo male from south of Spain here. So, I can't complain womenwise, I've been with around 30 different women throughout my life. Most of them very pretty and interesting women. Nevertheless, I always thought I could have approached and gotten many more women that I have in my life if I hadn't pussied out in many ocassions and also if I learned more seduction skills. I consider myself quite attractive and many of my girlfriends say I'm quite a Casanova, well, it depends on the situation. If it is a situation I have in control with a girl that I feel more or less attracted to, yes. But if it's a girl a really really feel attracted to...I shit my pants. I decided to take this seriously. To face my demons, to take courage and get out of my confort zone. Life is very short, I'm already 35 and I want to enjoy it to the top in all ways, and that includes women. I have my own business doing something I love, I work around 5-6 hours a day and the rest of the day I just do whatever I feel like doing. Than included playing flamenco guitar, practicing Yoga, eating healthy etc. So, I read ""MODELS"". Great book! Some of the things / skills I red I already have them naturally, many other I don't. Now I have started ""The Mystery method"", very interesting indeed. I am taking notes on my computer and studying the philosophy and strategies behind the art of seduction. As we all know, theory is good, but practice makes the master. So I decided to start practicing even though I still have quite a lot of theory to learn. Anyways, I have started with the 30 day cold approach challenge. And let me tell you, it is more difficult than I thought. You really need the balls to approach a women in midday in the middle of the street. I'm keeping a LOG so I can learn from my mistakes and note down everything that could be of use. Day 1. I was taking some money out from the ATM and saw a really attractive 22-24 yo girl walking with 2 friends. When she walked pass me I told her: - Excuse me...I just wanted to tell you that I find you really attractive She replied - Thank you! And off she left with her friends laughing. Shhhit I felt my heart beating as hard as a hammer! What an adrenaline pump! I didn't have the guts to keep the conversation going but anyway...it was something. My first approach. Day 2. That was today. I set my objective of the day: 2 cold approaches. The first one happened again in the middle of a busy street. A beautiful 22-24yo that looked kind of Rumanian / Bulgarian ..don't know...anyway she looked kinda of from the east. I approached her and said with a really shy voice and unnatural pauses: - Excuse me...I'm sorry to bother you....in the middle of the street but I just had to speak with you... She replied: - Why do you need to talk woth me? Me - Because I find you very interesting. Her - Oh...yeah...ok...but my brother is waiting I'm sorry. Me - I'm sorry, I didn't want to scare you off by talking to you in the middle of the street. Her - Oh....nono...don't worry...it's just my brother, he is waiting for me. Me - Ok bye... Her - Bye! So, things that I learned from this interaction. I need to learn to be more direct and no apologies. But of course, I was really nervous so it is normal. With time I think this will improve. The second cold approach went....uumm....quite bad. So, I tried to change my cold approach tactic by saying one of these pre-learned openers: ""Excuse me...are you from here? Can you help find....your telephone number"" I read this somewhere online and decided to use it...here is what happenned: I was in the city centre (I live there), busy street and saw a really attractive 30yo woman on the other side of the street. I crossed the street and asked her: - Excuse me...are you from here? Her - Yes I am! Me - Great! Listen, I'm looking for... I turned my head away as if I was looking for something, and then turned my head towards her, deepened my voice, tried to sound sexy and said: - Your phone number... God, you should have seen her face...she opened her eyes with terror turned around and left quite in a hurry...I kept standing there feeling like a fucking stalker...shit...I was paralysed...hoping nobody around had heard me... I left quickly and started laughing at the whole situation. I tried to sound sexy but, it is true, I sounded like a complete phsyco! hahaha.... Anyway, I learned that there is a very thin line between sounding cool and chilled and total awkwardness. Tomorrow I'll do 2 more cold approaches but I think I'll just go a little more natural until I make some progress and feel more confortable with rejection and showing vulnerability. I'll probably just say ""Hi, I find you very interesting so I came to say hi"" or something like this. Any comments, tips are appreciated. I hope this is the right place to post this as I think that my experience as a newbie could help everyone. Cheers "
117,vulnerability,seduction,[FR] Photoshoot turned date per mutual sexual tension; then I botched it,8,8lc3e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8lc3e7/fr_photoshoot_turned_date_per_mutual_sexual/,2018-05-23 04:00:42,"*I haven't posted on here in years, my apologies for any lack of aesthetically pleasing formatting, but do make suggestions* I'm an amateur photographer (21/M) with a lot of experience in shooting portraits. A couple weeks ago I attended a well-populated daytime event with my camera to shoot for a family member. As I was shooting, a beautiful woman in her mid-twenties made a friendly comment, so I decided to engage in conversation. I asked if she was living in the city, as I recently moved an hour away. She was, and it didn't seem worth it to express romantic interest especially as my family was watching the whole interaction. My default plan B in this situation is to ask if a woman would like to do a photoshoot (I'll talk about the ethics of this later on). She said 'sure!' and gave me her full name and number, enthused by my confident approach, especially as my family member confirmed that I'm not a creep. I wrapped up my final school assignments and texted her a week later, apologizing for the delay and asking for a compatible time to shoot. We found a time that worked and she had a few questions. I truthfully explained what I had in mind; ""I value meaningful connections so I like to meet in a coffeeshop where we can talk a bit about ourselves, what we value, and what sort of photos we'd like to shoot that day, depending on mood and weather."" I explained that we'd be shooting outdoors for fun, looking for natural light and keeping it casual. I advised that she wear whatever makes her feel confident in front of the camera and I'd do my best to make her feel comfortable and relaxed. I genuinely was only expecting to get a fun photoshoot out of this, and as with any woman who's being vulnerable in front of my camera, I only consider taking it further it there are clear indicators of interest (IOIs) and sexual tension. We met at the coffee shop and I wasn't in the best physical state after a lack of sleep, early arrival in the city, and one-too-many cups of coffee. I adapted anyway and our initial interaction quickly evolved from a photographer-model business-y sort of interaction, to two open-minded individuals who've let their guard down. Within an hour of walking around downtown and shooting, she made it clear that she trusted me (with watching or holding her bag, when walking up an enclosed parking garage stairway, etc). I have a generally flirty personality if I have any sort of sexual or romantic feelings in general, but it's not overt and certainly not overbearing or boundary-crossing when in a platonic or neutral setting. With this and our mutual trust in mind, I was sure to counter her jokes, neg her when appropriate (she danced around the parking garage barefoot and I mentioned she had dancer feet), and initiated light kino while walking (brushing arms, increasingly less distance between us as we became more comfortable). We reached a large plot of grass in the center of the city and I directed her to sit on the grass. At this point we'd cultivated a warm rapport. I mirrored her and eventually we were both laying down, maybe 7 feet apart with my 50mm lens, and boom... the tension reached a point as it has in past photoshoots, and through my viewfinder I see *the bedroom eyes.* Whether they were for the lens or for me, it's never apparent until I pull away from the viewfinder and see if it persists. I told her to turn more toward me, took a few shots, then sat up while maintaining eye contact. I looked away to contemplate what I saw, then re-engaged and she still had the look. I was clearly considering something and she called me out on it: ""What's missing from this?"" Still hesitant to push it past a platonic outing, I replied that was ""just incredibly beautiful and I was grateful to have the opportunity to shoot with [her.]"" At this point she took the lead and gave a bit of philosophy, something like ""Well, we just met and we're not friends, so naturally this could be anything. Maybe you should come kiss me and find out."" I entered this with no expectations other than to have fun and make a meaningful connection, and here was a nice surprise to take it further. We kissed and then discussed that ""this is a date,"" a tricky and somewhat risky shift when doing photography even when it's not for business. Our conversation became increasingly flirty and sexual as we shot, but we were both careful to continue having real conversation. She began grilling me on my daily life, what my parents think of my school/career path, all the shit-test questions... I answered them truthfully and confidently, and maybe she wasn't so into my answers for whatever reason as the vibe faded a bit. I took the lead and said we should spend our last hour in a new setting, and took her to a major landmark in the city, an admittedly romantic spot. We sat down and I brought up the conversation of ""what's your relationship status like,"" and she mentioned that she's currently sort-of seeing her boss after cheating on her longtime boyfriend for his absence, but she's technically single and going with the flow. This was a turn-off amongst a few other incompatibilities, but I continued to give my status in sex and relationships. *** This is where I botched the date and re-learned an incredibly important lesson. In the past year or so I've needed Brene Brown's *Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead* to transform my life in a healthy manner and recover from past trauma. I've also dove into Mark Manson's *Models* recently which teaches a means of seduction through vulnerability (in reference to Brown's work) and non-neediness. I consider these more valuable than the manipulative, short-term, ""pick-up"" nature of this community which Manson is so against, though I've recently realized that there has to be a healthy balance. As a side note I've begun reading Neil Strauss's *The Game* for context and more objective approach to meeting women, but it wasn't enough to go into this date with something other than a vulnerable, truly authentic mindset. I said too much. I explained that my buddy and I have been going out on weekends to try and meet people, women, in the city I moved to. This wasn't inherently horrible. I elaborated and mentioned that we both need to feel more comfortable and confident in group settings and in approaching women (!!!), and somehow it fell out my mouth that we've been stopped up by doing too much *talking* and *reading* about the topic, than acting. She audibly and accidentally burst into laughter, then covered her mouth. She said ""I'm sorry,"" and I held my shit in. I managed through the growing anxiety and knowing I'd exposed too much of myself for the sake of killing any strategy or 'game,' and she was no longer attracted. It was a loss, and she drove me back to my car. We left amicably and casually though it was certainly awkward. I promised I'd send her to edited photos if she still wanted them, as that was my original intention anyway. The key takeaway here should be clear: **do not get meta about seduction when you're trying to seduce!** God, this felt like such a rookie mistake to make but when you're fully immersed in a mindset of authenticity and vulnerability, it's easy to say too much. Be authentic and vulnerable about literally anything and everything which will weed out potentially incompatible dates **but** the conversation of ""yeah, I'm trying to become better and pulling women."" I'm sure there are exceptions to this rule and some women would be more understanding and possibly not even turned off by the sort of self-improvement dream-chasing we do here. In general, keep a sense of mystery and don't spill your all-encompassing list of insecurities, intentions, and areas of improvement on the first date. *** That's the majority of what I have for you. I did want to ask for your advice. In the middle of the evening we acknowledged the shift from photoshoot to photoshoot-date. At the end of the evening, she became increasingly skeptical of the evening and challenged why I hadn't just asked her on a date in the first place. At this point my values and ethics were being challenged, and this isn't the first time I've been faced with these ideas. A few years ago I was meeting a ton of people through the lens of my camera, some who I clearly asked on dates, others who started as photoshoots and mutuality turned it into something more. My friendgroup back then would constantly joke about how I'm pulling tail with my camera and I surround myself with the beautiful ""models"" I shoot on my Instagram. They weren't wrong, but I only ever pursue something more when the tension is there, and only when the girl takes the lead and wants to shift the context. I gave my rebuttal as mentioned in the first paragraph above; it didn't seem appropriate to ask her on a date, and if it were to turn into something more, it could be something more. I think we both then realized that **I was giving a rebuttal** and it this point it was like an argument. The mood was killed entirely and I was grateful to have an ethics question for you anyone willing to discuss: Is it wrong to use my camera and artistic skill to meet people and potentially turn it into something romantic/sexual if the conditions are right? Much of the feminist community on Instagram often talks about this, how ""photographers"" who are decent at portraits have a chance to work with women and then it turns into something more. I don't see how the blame is put on me if they're attracted to me and natural sexual tension creates a different context mid-photoshoot. As the photographer and lead, I'll say something authentic and powerful if the sexual tension is too high, and if it's a mutual thing, the woman might turn it into something more. With this date that explicitly happened. I don't understand what the issue is if feelings are mutual and everything that's done is consensual. Thanks for reading and I'd love to hear your thoughts!"
118,vulnerability,seduction,"Attraction is on-point, but looks-match builds resistance. WTF?",6,8os7at,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8os7at/attraction_is_onpoint_but_looksmatch_builds/,2018-06-06 02:27:19,"Hey guys. I'd like to present you a situation and tell me your thoughts about it. While, for me, it occurred through a particular girl, I don't believe it is an isolated case and it challenges the principles of the game. OK. Story time: I met that girl at a dance party. We danced and we laughed and I got her number. Then I saw her again at another party and she gave me enough signals to dare to ask her out. We went out and I understood that she is a very closed person with great difficulties with expressing her feelings and bonding with people (because she represses her feelings too much. Wasn't sure as to why she did that then). Nonetheless, we had a great time, but she rejected the kiss-close saying that it is not what she is looking for and she is sorry for giving me wrong signals. Rejection felt like shit, but I took it like a man and stopped texting her so as to move on. Some weeks later, she wants to interact again, so I roll with it. The following month we went at 2-3 dance parties (I drove her because she does not have a car), we dance and we are having a great time. At some point, she even took the liberty to ask me out herself. We went to a second date which was awesome despite of a somewhat dark atmosphere. She talked about herself and her situation which is kinda tough (a health problem, family issues, her ex, bad financial, etc.). I assumed it was all quite over-dramatized, but they did somewhat explained as to why she keeps herself at a distance from everyone. Nonetheless, I respected her situation and didn't turn it sexual this time. During this month, I kept ""gaming"" her. I kept teasing her, but also kept my frame. For example I denied her proposition of a date and wished to reschedule it in my own terms. When we spoke, I was the one who steered the conversation to what topic I wanted. I also drew boundaries in her interaction with me (e.g. ""don't say that word to me, I don't like it"", ""I don't want to talk this late. We'll talk tomorrow"", etc.). All of which really got in her nerves... And I also did other stuff regarding keeping frame, being the leader, push-pull and teasing, etc., up to the point that I felt a bit like an asshole... But it all seemed to work because she kept investing (reacting to teasing, sending me texts/calling first, telling me that she has a great time when with me, asking me to go out herself, etc.). Nonetheless, because of the initial rejection, I was now very cautious. Last weekend, we go out to a dance party again. She brings a couple of friends and I bring one guy friend of mine. Long story short, when we got alone, she told me that she is kinds attracted to my friend. Plus, that she knows what I want from her but she does not share the same feelings because she sees me only as a friend. Boom! What statements! Still, I wasn't convinced. Maybe she just wanted to ""get back to me"" for irritating her during all this time. As we drove back, I did a thing that really got into her nerves (I am not going to explain it now), and she kept texting me all night asking what was the purpose of that thing. I set a boundary again ""We will speak tomorrow. Go to sleep now"", which triggered her even more. Her brain had become like a jam. Next day, she texts me ""good morning"" and we decide to meet. She told me that everything she has said to me till now is true, including what she told me last night. I told her that I don't see her as a friend and that I already expressed my feelings towards her (which have not changed). I told her that we cannot keep going out as just friends while I keep imagining stuff I wanna do with her, or hearing about the boys she likes, etc. So I proposed that, no matter how good company we were to each other, we should not speak again (unless she changes her mind). I told her that many of her actions revealed her true feelings about me and I could not accept that she ""only saw me as a friend"". Long story short, I made her admit that she likes me. That she REALLY likes me. For example, she admitted that each time I dropped her off at her house, she only wanted to grab and kiss me. **""God! why am I SO attracted to you?""** she also exclaimed a couple of times. The problem was that she had issues that she didn't want to burden me with. Due to these issues and her mental complexes, she had essentially decided to separate herself from all people except her close family and maybe a couple of friends, and avoid bonding with anyone. Drama queen much? The interesting part is that, while both her mouth and her eyes told me that she really likes me, she also admitted that she kinda does not see me as very physically attractive. She indirectly told me that I am not very ""charming"" or ""manly"" in the objective sense. I guess both of these are true. I used to be skinny and short AF, nerdy, pasty-white, with no communication skills and an awful wardrobe. Despite fixing whatever could be fixed, genetics still kept me somewhat skinny and short (AF) with a balding head and an ugly face. She admitted that this could be a problem in the long run when she might have to introduce me as her boyfriend. I wanted to kick her out of the car at that point. She pressed a VERY sensitive matter but she wasn't wrong after all. A matter that I believed I had gone past, but it turns out that I'll never will. (Moreover, the next days I learned that a female friend of hers also commended to her that she deserves someone better than me. I assume in terms of looks). Needless to say, I felt that whatever confidence I had managed to gather up all these years started to shake. Was she telling the truth or was it some kind of a end-game shit-test again? Maybe both. Despite all that, I suggested that it was the most stupid thing for two people to both want something, but not going after that. So we made out in the car that evening. Next morning she texted me that she hasn't changed her mind about what happened and she wants to see me again. It occurred to me that if I hadn't pressed through her resistances, haven't disregarded her ""friend-zone"" statements, and hadn't insisted for a ""plea"", nothing would have happened, even though deep down she wanted it. In fact, it occurred to me that not only she needed someone to lead her through the seduction and **assume the responsibility**, but also to essentially **guide her through her own feelings**. --- So this brought up an interesting issue in my head. The girl is clearly attracted. Why? Because **it is all a game of feelings**. Her mind goes haywire each time she interacts with me. Not necessarily always in a good way, but she is challenged nonetheless. I don't want to say that I strictly ""gamed"" her, but through seddit, and RSD, mystery, and other resources, I built a mindset that wasn't so much about canned lines, date games, interaction flowcharts, etc. but rather helped me observe and understand patterns in woman behavior. Patterns, words, and actions that would have left me otherwise clueless and would have led me to fail every shit-test. So I may not have looked like an alpha male, but I surely tried to act like a one. E.g. it helped me understand how important is **keeping frame** but also **showing vulnerability**, both if which had a tremendous effect on her behavior. It also helped me understand that the game should be played on my terms and how important is to **not be overly available** (even to the point of borderline frustratingly unavailable) and for every step you take back, two more must be forward (push-pull) otherwise she gets too irritated or bored. On the other hand, **feelings may be in-place alright, but looks may be not, and never will**. Some girls will be so much carried away by their feelings that they won't mind. Others will keep pondering about it and so build resistances. Isn't this something that sedditors would take into account? if so, in what way? what can be done about it? Let's not forget that all this male improvement industry and most particularly ""game"" essentially have the bulk of their audience in average and sub-average men who struggle with girls, mainly because of looks. So they need to compensate. Good-looking people have to be mentally handicappedin order to not go through mating process with relative ease. E.g. I know a tall, blue-eyed square-jawed guy who is literally the most awkward, shy and Nice(TM) guy I know (scared of his own shadow, let alone talking to girls), yet I know that a couple of my female friends are drooling over him, despite knowing how awkward and beta he is (not that he is going to make a move anyway). But for others, below average people, they have to rely on eliciting feelings through other means, and still encounter the resistance of incompatible looks-match. Has any of you went through that stage? How do you deal with it? For me, it is a blow in my confidence knowing that even though I can get a girl attracted to the point of grabbing and kissing me, the sub-optimal appearance is always going to hinder how ""seriously"" a girl sees me. tl;dr: I started seeing a chick some time ago. She got attracted to me through the feelings she gets while interacting with me (vulnerability, matureness, frame, teasing, push-pull). but she admitted that she does not regard me as physically attractive and she is scared that at some point this is going to back-fire. This raises an issue with seduction and ""game"" as to the fact that no matter how much attracted the girl gets, you may never go through the looks-matching barrier and whatever that means."
119,vulnerability,seduction,Some advice for conversational direction.,4,8pcfg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8pcfg7/some_advice_for_conversational_direction/,2018-06-08 03:53:46,"This post was inspired by the ""asking 2 women out a day for 50 days"" post"". OP had mentioned that you should talk to woman as if they were your mom or sister. I don't mean to brag in any way but I've had my success with women as a 22 year old (casually dating in college and 2 longer relationships) and I think this advice is fantastic. I never thought about it, but it really is the way i talk to most women when i meet them. When i talk to my mom, the conversation many times has no direction. It tends to go everywhere, and shes very receptive (some women may not be obviously). She listens to whatever I say no matter how stupid it may be an always give her thoughts back. The assumption is that you should believe they will be receptive just like your mom. You can dictate their interest through this and best of all, you get to control what you speak about, whatever is on your mind. Also vulnerability. It is always good to be vulnerable and when I speak to my mom that side of me is in display when it needs to be. Girls like this; they feel that you trust them more when you show this emotional side. Personally i feel that this not only shows your true self (speaking as if you were to your mom/ someone very close), but it shows if the girl likes the ""real"" you. Just my 2 cents, anyone have any ideas or anything they want to add? "

This may or may not apply to you and your situation, contingent upon your physical looks, intelligence, things you know about, things that make you unique etc. I had no sexual encounters in high school. I didn't even have a girlfriend in high school. There was one girl I REALLY liked, but we didn't start dating until I started college...she was two years younger than I and we dated for four years. I was really happy that I had a girlfriend at the time...we had a lot of sex and we had a lot of fun. Eventually it ended in my early twenties; I was devastated at first, but also realized I wanted to explore more casual sex. I started to read about running game, PUA, NLP etc etc. It never worked. It always felt like an act...because I guess it was an act. Negging, push\-pull, and on and on...if I could see through it even reading about it, how did I not expect the women I was talking to not to also see right through it. At time the time, I remember bringing it up to someone who was really seasoned and had plenty of sex; not just one night stands, but he really experienced a lot of women intimately...courting them and knowing them sexually and emotionally. He told me point blank: ""That PUA stuff is absolute bullshit, and only kind of works for either ugly dudes or boring dudes...just be nice, but don't be a pussy"". Fast forward a few years, in which I had a lot of life experiences in the process. In those few years, I played a lot of music, had so many different ventures that I thought would be my life path, and I read so much philosophy, esoteric literature, economic literature...everything I could get my hands on. I also felt like I just got more attractive as I got into my mid twenties...physically, I wasn't a boy anymore, and intellectually, I had so much to talk about. I hadn't read anything to do with gaming women, or PUA, and it wasn't even a thought in my mind. My life wasn't even put together...I was a college graduate working at Whole Foods and living with my parents. But, I started talking to women. I didn't try to say the right thing, or temper my interest in them, or neg them or anything of the sort. I just talked to them...showed interest, and was NICE. I showed my uniqueness to them, I didn't hide it. I showed them and talked about things with them that SHOULD be off limits so early into a friendship or relationship. My interests, approach, and personality were never contrived or easily defined/pigeonholed. And, I'd be willing to bet that if you showed that of yourselves, it would be similar. Anyway, I had relationships and sex with three different women who worked at the same WFs within a 6 month span. All I did was be myself. It took me 3\-5 years to cultivate myself: my personality, interests, knowledge, vocabulary, my physical appearance, and physique etc. At that point, I never ran game again...I never ""negged"" again. Over the last 5 years, about 7/10 times if saw a woman and said to myself, ""I want to know that girl and be intimate with her""...and I made the move, and fostered it over the course of a couple of weeks...I would end up dating and having a relationship with her. Here's where this does NOT work EVER for me: I have never been to a bar and taken a girl home in one night. I rarely have just one time encounters. This is where this works or me: if she is a colleague, a friend of a friend, etc. I never manipulate...I never run game...I show vulnerability, uniqueness, intelligence, and empathy the best I can. I know the rules say not to discuss physical looks, but I do feel that game techniques often go horribly wrong if you're a genuinely good looking, in shape dude...you just come off as aloof and arrogant.

121,vulnerability,seduction,This movie clip is a visual representation from what I learned in Models by Mark Manson.,11,8eib38,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8eib38/this_movie_clip_is_a_visual_representation_from/,2018-04-24 16:12:46,"Link: URL Either your going to make the connection I am trying to get across or I am going to be laughed off this subreddit, so bare with me. I was watching American Sniper and stumbled upon the scene where Chris Kyle meets his future wife at the bar. Throughout the year I've been reading Models by Mark Manson and seeking ways I can improve myself due to the inability that me and everyone on this sub has of not being able to fully express ourselves (vulnerability). I spent a lot of time reading this sub and books on game, and I came to the conclusion that Models and Troy Francis books are the most efficient, straightforward, no bullshit advice (for me at least). As I was watching this movie, all the concepts that Mark touches upon helped tie together in this one clip. It gave me a visual representation of what Mark was trying to convey and everything has now clicked with me. In the clip, Chris walks up to Taya, fully demonstrating his boldness to approach (Mark says that boldness is the key ingredient to maximizing dating life). As they converse, the conversational advice that Mark gives (cold reading) is done. Taya makes the assumption he is in the army while Chris tells her he looks sad along with other comments. But the biggest takeaway is Chris's low level of investment he has when he first meets Taya that Mark put a heavy emphasis on in his book. Once Chris and Taya start drinking, Chris reveals he is a seal. Taya tells him that all Seals are pricks and she would never date one. Obviously this is a shit test, but Marks point of having strong boundaries and willingness to walk away is demonstrated very clearly. Chris cuts her off, disagrees with what she is saying and implies hes not going to tolerate her disrespect and excuses himself willingly. Throughout Models, Mark talks about being willing to excuse himself from a girl that doesn't meet your values, and by demonstrating your willingness to be rejected and walk away makes you more attractive, which can be scene at 2:47 when Taya bites her lip as Chris walks away. Overall, this scene tied together what Mark tried to convey in his book. No scripts or pick up lines, being bold in approaching, low level investment, cold reading, lifestyle (Navy Seals) and vulnerability. I know its just a movie and shouldn't be taken too literally, but I think it defiantly helps understand the book. This is the most absurd thing I have every analyzed, but it helped me too much and hopefully will help you as well. Cheers, Mr.Fab "

I've gotten some attention from girls, mostly to the effect of asking for my name, got some kisses, I got laid with one girl in my entire life (lol), I can tell sometimes that college girls might think I'm good looking but since I am youthful looking they also sense the vulnerability and try to take me down a notch. The seductive move is to respond unfazed and take THEM down a notch, but while I'm here I figure I'd try to get some input on my looks.

"" ""Actually I know you don't love me"" ""- ..But maybe it's just that.. you know you can tell me if it's the case.. - What? ""Maybe you don't really love me after all"" (then stares deep in the eyes) I know she's playing when she acts like this. But this needy, loving, almost childish behavior boggles me. Maybe it's her way to ask for love, I don't know. Most of the time I kiss her hard as a pledge of answer but right after she insists: ""so? I'm waiting for your reply"" like she perfectly knows the answer but wants to *hear* it. ""- how do you love me??"" -You don't have a clue"" That's really cliche but I've already replied this once or twice. She wants some kind of ""proof"" of love from me but the more I will give her what she wants the less she will ask for it. That's not something I want. *I like the current state our relationship is in: she asks for more love and affection, and not the opposite.*  So this emotional investment &amp; vulnerability question comes to mind: How do I manage my vulnerability and honestly show my feelings (we're in a relationship, FFS) to her without falling in the trap of the needy beta that shows too much love and gets boring? Where to draw the line? Thanks guys and sorry for the nooby question. "
124,vulnerability,seduction,[FR] By some random stroke of luck and some effort on my end I got her number.,1,7xgftp,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/7xgftp/fr_by_some_random_stroke_of_luck_and_some_effort/,2018-02-14 18:39:51,"So in one of my business classes, there was a very cute girl in my class that I approached once very briefly and then didn't do much afterwards. I decided to move on from it and after a week or two after I thought I'd just drop it, but by a crazy sort of events (giving the TLDR here) an older lady managed to get us talking then left us alone while we talked. As we were walking to the parking garage, I used some things I learned from Models by Mark Manson (highly recommended, found it on reddit and it has completely changed my perspective) and decided to just throw out something completely random to begin conversation with her as we were walking. I mentioned to her how she looked like a different nationality and she laughed and corrected me and we talked for around 15-20 minutes. Throughout the conversation, I tried to expose myself to her to get her to feel comfortable and definitely tried to include her as much as I could. Talked about personal things such as travel, school ambition/goals and other small stories that made her talk more. I realized what the book was true, it's not so much your words, its all about your intentions and my full intention was to get to know her better to see if she could be compatible with ME. This changed my perspective as I've haven't had a strong conversation with a girl I just began talking to. I also stood up straight, made very good body language and she reciprocated, she stood facing towards me, talking, smiling and was engaged until I told her I had to get going. I eventually asked for her number and she gladly gave it to me, full name and all. I did mess up and not ask her out straight away, especially since I knew there was an amazing art exhibit in town the next day. Few days later, text her a bit with the full intention of asking her out, make some good banter, joke about lots of things about travelling (I tossed in a sexual comment or two and she had a laugh about it and joked too.) and it was smooth. I transitioned greatly into asking her out for a band in town and she said she was busy with school (she mentioned when we talked in the parking lot how she's working hard this semester and not slacking) and told me about some papers, midterms and other things she's studying for, all fairly specific so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I told her maybe after midterms so I'll message her next weekend and if its still a ""busy"" then move on. Learned a lot though! My first actual FR with my new knowledge from Models and I feel like it definitely helped. TLDR: Stroke of luck, managed to talk one on one with a girl I found cute, used a strong combination of body language, vulnerability and interesting topics we both relate to that kept her interested. Blundered by asking for number instead of date, talked to her a bit after, says she's busy with specific schoolwork she mentioned beforehand. Will ask just once more next week to give it a shot and move on if not. "

I was just the badass in college who played the ""don't give a fuck"" role, and it got attraction but not a lot of lays. I'm working on showing intent and being more direct. I feel like I'm boring chicks being too direct about my intentions. Idk. I wish I didn't feel like I needed a system for all of this.

You will plan ahead, procrastinate and then re-plan and then procrastinate again, and then decide you need to read this book a couple more times -- all because you're scared to death of simply being vulnerable. Maybe you've already spent months or years avoiding taking action because you're afraid of the consequences. Maybe you've put off that career change, that wardrobe upgrade, joining that dating site. Maybe you've missed opportunities with women who liked you because you were too afraid to make a move. Maybe you convinced yourself that you need to ""know how"" first. Maybe you convinced yourself that you needed to see someone else do it first. These are all forms of avoidance. And they all come from a deep-seated neediness, and that neediness can only be cured through making yourself more vulnerable. And at first, that vulnerability is going to hurt. You can't skip it.

I thougth that if someone asks me who I lost my virginity to and I don't tell the truth then I am needy. Turns up that I understood neediness wrong. Now there is the concept of vulnerabillity. In ""Models"" it means to not being afraid to show myself and share myself and get myself into a position of being rejected. My question is the same. What does he mean by vulnerability? What if I have a secret about myself? Something that I don't like sharing? (For example the fact that I lost my virginity to a hooker, or the fact that I never kissed a girl). What do you think?"

Im in New England, so its quite cold here. My objective when looking for a coffee shop was to **look for one that would allow me to sit next to her to easily initiate kino.** I lucked out and found one close to her house. In this exact situation, i wanted a spot that had this type of seating *indoors*. **If it were the summer, youd wanna get a spot that has outdoor seating.**  I wanted to have sex. The logistics were super skewed out of my favor, as her parents were home and mine were, also. **Car sex is reportedly terrible**, so i ruled it out. The only chance i had was at the spot in a parking lot she brought me  **Initially, i really led the conversation** and realized i would have to do so **until a certain level of comfort was established**, which got her to ultimately talk more and feel comfortable enough to open up (sometimes about heavy and crazy topics that i didnt expect to touch upon). Throughout the ENTIRE date, my confidence did not falter once. It was absolutely on-point. **Keep your confidence levels high and never let them drop, exposing vulnerability.** At the coffee shop, i **initiated light kino**, using playful, light touches on the upper arm with the back of my hand and also touching her forearm with my hand when negging or before beginning to tell a relevant story. **I negged her a LOT** the whole time, but **in amounts that were appropriate and never over-the-top.** When we left the coffee shop, she commented that she hated crossing the street, so i jokingly offered to hold her hand, which was the *perfect* escalation of kino. I was gonna hold her hand in the car, but the situation presented itself so i took advantage.  We went to the spot, and by then, Id already established a lot of comfort, so i just went and kissed her. It went super well and i didnt encounter any resistance. I repeatedly kissed her throughout the night, and I also occasionally **held back before actually touching lips and kissing to see if she would kiss first,** which she did multiple times. She allowed my hand to go really high up her thigh, so there was a chance i couldve gone further, but i hesitated, and that probably was the only thing i did wrong. **Escalate until she says no explicitly and/or does not allow you to do said action.** I did this wrong, but realized it looking back. After k-closing and making out for a bit, she had to be home by a certain time, so i brought her home, holding the inside of her thigh and occasionally holding her hand as we drove back. Ended the night with another kiss she went in for.  Since i was confident the whole time, everything i said and did came off in a great way. I didnt care about what i said but said it confidently and playfully. She herself admitted that i was very confident. The big thing i got out of this interaction was to **not be afraid to escalate. Assume interest and escalation will be easy. Stop when she makes it obvious that she does NOT want to go further.** **This is super important.** Had i escalated a bit more, i may have been able to have sex. Even though it would have been in a car, it wouldve been an even greater way to close. Edit: messed up the bolding of advice. "
130,vulnerability,seduction,[FR] First successful daytime approach w/ instadate!,163,7v9f9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/7v9f9x/fr_first_successful_daytime_approach_w_instadate/,2018-02-05 07:41:29,"Hey everyone, For background, I'm a reasonably attractive student on a college campus. Been unsatisfied with online dating, so about six months ago I decided to ditch it all and get good at approaching and flirting in person. I've done most of my approaching at bars at night, but been trying to get good at approaching during the day. The approach was Saturday afternoon at around 12pm. Watched some daygame infield videos for half an hour or so for inspiration. I went onto campus specifically to get lunch and do a few approaches before heading off to work. Walked into my favorite little Chinese restaurant and got into line to order. While waiting, I looked around and made eye contact with a cute girl in big glasses sitting by herself back near the entrance. Made a note of this. I ordered and sat down at a table to wait until my number was called (it's usually quick here, so I wasn't worried about her leaving or anything). Told myself I would approach on the way out. Took some deep breaths to stay calm. They called my number, I got up to get my order. On the way out, we made eye contact again. Didn't let myself think about it further. Approached her and tried to speak calm and slowly. ""Excuse me,"" I said. ""This is kind of forward, but I was standing there in line and saw you sitting here with your cute glasses and thought you seemed interesting. So I thought I would come introduce myself and say hi."" (Or something like that, I was so nervous I don't completely remember.) She smiled and said awe and thanks! She asked me my name (big IOI) and we exchanged quick conversation about being students, what we were studying, etc. She had a dining-in tray and so I commented that it was shame for her to be eating alone. She said she just finished a final and was just here to have lunch real quick before going to work. Told her I was was just grabbing lunch before work as well. Followed with, ""You know, this is kind of spontaneous, but would you mind if I joined you? I can't stay long, but it's always nice to have someone to eat with. It's totally fine if not."" She said yes, and we talked for about 20 more minutes. Lots of engagement and questions from her. Eventually checked my watch and thanked her for the company. We got up and exchanged numbers. Text her afterwards and she responded! We set up a date for Wednesday. Later that night I told a couple female friends what happened and one said it was the ""most adult dating move"" she's ever heard of. I'm still kind of surprised myself, I've spent years of being frustrated/unsure how to proceed when I see an attractive and interesting women during the day. Some thoughts on things that helped make the approach successful: 1. **This sub.** Seriously, wish I had found out about this place years ago. 2. **Watching James Tusk videos on daytime approaching.** I've found Tusk's videos on infield approach to be no-bullshit and repeatable ways to approach women honestly while embracing vulnerability and the possibility of rejection. I watch a few vids I have tabbed to inspire and get in the right mindset when I'm on the bus or thinking of approaching that day. 3. **Setting aside time to specifically practice approaching.** I always tell myself I'll daytime approach, but I'm usually busy with school/work and it's easy to make excuses. Need to get better at this, but setting aside time before my day began specifically to approach was a huge help. Not sure why I haven't thought to try this before. 4. **Non-verbals.** I don't remember much of the words of the convo itself because I was nervous and hung over from the night before. But I spoke slowly and deliberately and held eye contact well. 5. **Noticing**. Noticed her IOIs, which made it much easier to approach and escalate. Thanks for all the inspiration Seddit! Keep approaching and keep improving folks. "

So, this year a girl I saw that worked at a gym I went to this past summer, I saw her a few times before talking to her, and things went well. We saw each other on campus a few times, and I had chit chat with her and so on. I was attracted to her on looks at first sight, but after talking to her, I liked her personality and thought of her as a friend instead. So 2 months go by, we speak in person around 1 time per week and hug after we leave. She's the only girl that I've been vulnerable with, opening up about my past depression, deaths in the family, etc, which she reciprocated talking about her upbringing. And I was fine with being friends which wasn't my original intention, but after a few weeks I accepted that myself. However, one time out of the blue, she asks me if I like her. Specifically ""Not to be a dick about this, but do you like me?"" I didn't tell the full truth that at first I did, but then changed my mind, I simply said ""I'm sort of seeing someone right now, and I always saw you as a friend."" I had a feeling she was going to give me a LJBF talk, with that coming on, so I maintained the frame and essentially rejected her, but whatever. Now here is where this gets interesting. Since then, we haven't talked at all save for a very short conversation, mostly of pleasantries, when we met at the club meeting (we're in the same athletic club) a few weeks back. I do feel like a dick by flirting with her for a bit and hugging her a bit too much when after a while I had no intention of being anything aside from a friend. However, I do value her as a person and I'm a bit sad that it is this way where we ignore each other mostly when we make eye contact etc. So, how can I change this so at least I'm not hated by another woman in this world? tl;dr Approached a girl over the summer, talked her up a bit, used light kino +vulnerability, liked her more as a friend, she then asks me do I like her, I say no and then we've barely talked since.

If I'm going to be honest, what I want beside attracting amazing women is respect from people around me. I want them to see me as a facinating and interesting, funny and charming guy. I get that all naturals instinctively follow the principles from Models. My entire life I've seen these people and want to become one of them. I get that it's all about vulnerability, opening up and exposing yourself AND doing so with the right intentions (i.e. not trying to impress, or to give people a false picture of you). But I find it so fucking hard. Today I met some a large group of friends to do some sports. I was trying to be vulnerable, to come up with interesting things to say, to give compliments, etc. But I felt so strange, like I was being super imposing and that people would see me as weird. I think it's because I had the wrong intentions. I did and said all those things so that my friends would think of me in a new way. On Mark's site, [this article](URL says: ""When it comes to being non-needy, if you are trying to be non-needy so you can be more attractive, then youre paradoxically being needy. I know that sentence probably made your brain explode, so lets try it again. You should adopt non-needy behaviors because you care about yourself and want to improve yourself. Attracting women should be a side-effect of that desire."" I think I'm TRYING to be vulnerable (without genuinly being so) in order to get people to think of me in some way. That's why I feel weird and it doesn't go well. I'm not being vulnerable because I don't genuinly want to improve, and I don't have a genuine desire to invest in myself. This seriously makes my brain go ""GAAAAHHGHHDFHDFG"". What the fuck am I supposed to do? Am I stuck being the low status guy without women in my life? I'm feeling so fucking lost and desperate.

I read a lot of fuckin books so you dont have to. This is geared mostly towards the bar scene (I'm in college, so I wrote it from a college bar perspective).  Watch/listen to standup comedy before you go out. Not only will this put you in a good mood, it will also give you some jokes you could use.  Stand out in the crowd. Dont be a peacock, but wear something that is a conversation piece. For example: a unique shirt, a hat for a specific sports team (not IU/your school), just a tastefully unique item that a girl can start a conversation over.  As soon as you learn whoevers name youre talking to, use their name as many times as possible. People absolutely love hearing their name.  Make them feel important. Let them tell their own narrative, and ask questions about it that furthers conversation. Say as little about yourself as possible.  If you run out of conversation, parrot back something she just said and reignite that flame. If she was just talking about work, and the conversation stops, So what was your favorite part of your work? You just bought yourself five more minutes of content.  Be prepared to have something about yourself that she will remember, usually pairs well with your hometown, especially if youre from an obscure place. yeah Im from Louisville, have you ever been to the Kentucky Derby?.  Body language speaks more than words. Stand tall and confident. Touching is one of the most subliminal signs of attraction, kino. See if she grabs your hand, rubs into you, anything really. If its going well, and she hasnt already, initiate physical contact. High five, anything really.  If you get her number, text her that night. She might not remember you tomorrow.  Abundance theory: Hot girls get hit on by so many dudes that they dont really care if something doesnt work out with a guy theyre currently attracted to at the bar. Apply this theory to yourself. If you strike out with one girl, theres 20,000 more hot girls within a couple square miles.  Vulnerability ties into this. It doesnt have to do with putting your feelings out there. It has to do with not being afraid to strike out. Major focal point of the Manson readings.  Dont talk negatively about anything or anyone. Even if she does, just refrain from it. If you say ah fuck the colts even if playful, it could shut you down.  Find something that you are really interested or care about, and pursue it 100%. Girls get wildly attracted to a man who chases their ambitions. Even if its something like bourbon knowledge, the fact that you are really into something shows that you give a fuck.  Try to watch a documentary everyday. Instead of just throwing on some family guy before bed, I watch a vice documentary on youtube or something similar. You can build a lot of basic knowledge about a lot of things, and thats always nice to have in your toolbox.  Treat every person you speak to as a childhood friend. Theres no nervousness in talking to someone you grew up with. Carry that mindset into starting a conversation with a total stranger.  Reserve your smile. Obviously have a friendly, welcoming look on your face, but dont smile immediately, wait until the girl has earned a smile. This will make it 20x more genuine.  Incompatibility is simply a factor of life- your goal must not be to attract as many women as possible, but rather to screen for women with a high probability to being attracted to you.  The vast majority of girls you meet will be either neutral or unreceptive of you.  The percentage of women who are Receptive to you will increase proportionally to the quality of your lifestyle, your social status, and your looks. The percentage of women that youre able to move from Neutral to Receptive will be proportional to how good your game is, or how well youre able to communicate and express yourself with women. And your ability to sort through each type of women and meet as many as possible will be determined by how fearless and bold you are when it comes to meeting women. Pretty direct quote out of the book Models by Mark Manson.  When making plans with a girl, make the plans. Instead of putting her in a situation where she has to choose, choose for her. Have you ever asked a girl where she wants to wat&gt;? Same shit.2 Instead of What do you want to do tonight? it should be Were going to Roys, be ready at 10!  Signs a girl is in to you: o She ignores her friends to talk to you o She introduces you to said friends o When you ask her on a date, she offers an idea of a place to go o She touches you unprovoked o She makes strong eye contact with you, and doesnt break it  Art of Charm podcast has a very precise breakdown on how to pull. It is roughly this (modified for the college bar scene): o 1. Make eye contact. Dont be a creep, but if you accidentally make eye contact more than once in a crowded bar, its not an accident. Talk to her. o 2. Introduce yourself. It doesnt really matter what you say, just apply the knowledge from above. o 3. Befriend her friends. Girls dont just go to the bars by themselves, they go out with friends who may or may not be cool with their friend getting hit on. Again, remembering names are so important. o 4. Isolate. If things are going well, ask her to get a drink with you! This is an opportunity to see if things are working for you or not. You can really sweeten the pot by asking if any of her friends want a drink too. This shows that you are a generous, thoughtful guy, and will make her friends have a slight bit more approval of you. o 5. This is really up to you. You have a long term higher success chance by getting her number and making plans with her. But, if you wanna roll the dice on shacking that night, more power to ya.  The Charisma Theory- Olivia Fox Cabane o Presence + Power + Warmth = Charisma  Presence is the aura you give off. Say person A is engaged in conversation with you and genuinely wants to know more. Person B is glancing at their phone, slouching over. That is presence. It also has a social media/texting application. If youre tweeting gay shit or posing weak Instagram photos, thats not a dominating presence. Mentally audit everything youre considering posting. Dont text back right away either. As junior high as that sounds, make yourself seem busy, important, high value.  Power is the ability you have to make a difference in whatever you want, and the lack of fear in doing it. All the boys drinking natty but you wanna drink wine? Fuck it. Do you. While it might be a gay move, a girl will respect your decision to be your own man. Be comfortable with yourself. Influence the world around you. Dont be a dick or power trip, but dont be afraid to be yourself. Ties back into the previous point of investing yourself 100% into something you care about.  Warmth- Make her feel important. Sound familiar? Ask yourself how you would feel in her position at that very moment. The chain of events that led up to you two talking at that moment. Some real introspective shit. Look past her imperfections and show that youre genuinely interested in her, assuming you are. Just dont be too generous with this, as too much can make you come off as an eager-pleasure, a real kiss ass, etc. In Conclusion:  Dont be shy. Pretty obvious.  Confidence will move mountains.  You cannot be an attractive and life-changing presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others.  If a girl rejects you, move on. Tenacity makes you a creep in this situation.  Give her opportunities to talk to you  Be a good listener  Cater the conversation towards her interests  Make her feel important  Confidence and body language are significantly more important than words  Physical contact is important, no matter how insignificant it may seem  Girls spend hours getting dressed up to go out. A compliment on their appearance isnt as creepy as it may be to someone with approach anxiety.  Be mindful of your presence  Introduce, befriend, isolate  Make yourself high value  It is less about what you say, but more about how you say it.

137,vulnerability,seduction,How to be vulnerable but not needy,105,7jg6xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/7jg6xf/how_to_be_vulnerable_but_not_needy/,2017-12-13 13:49:39,"I posted about this as a video a month ago but I feel like it would be good to do a written version. One of the traits that is rarely discussed on this forum or in the pick up community in general is vulnerability. Not only is **this a trait that women consistently find very attractive but its something that ALL of us on this forum must be when we come here and post.** Its an insanely important trait, which luckily women also find attractive. However most people try and avoid it as much as possible, (especially spammy pick up artists, who are far too quick to label other men as pussies). A big reason for this is fear of being seen as needy, which is a legitimate fear that I had when I was starting out years ago. The key to being vulnerable but not needy is when you are being vulnerable with a girl dont need anything from her. **If she can tell in your voice that you want her to feel sorry for you or fix your problems, then this is needy and not at all attractive.** What is attractive is showing your human side and being ok with your insecurities. Not seeking her validation. **Women always have a kind of fantasy around the wounded warrior.** *Being vulnerable, in itself, is not attractive but the wounded warrior is because he already has other things going for him.* The warrior is strong, but the wounded warrior is also human and humans we can connect with. So, the next time you are vulnerable with a girl e.g. (admitting that you were nervous or scared in a situation) if you say it with confidence she will assume that you are that warrior who feels real emotions but has a handle on them. **Women are NOT looking for emotionally unstable men.** People who are emotionally unstable are like babies, in that they require attention and cannot fend for themselves. Women dont want a baby they want a man. I got this wrong so many times by pretending I had all the answers and coming off as a complete asshole rather than someone who had the guts to tell a girl he liked her. It took me years of doing this pick up stuff for me to be comfortable enough to be able to say I like you to a girl and not need any validation return. In fact, I wouldnt even utter those words, period. **I was getting a new girl every week and still didnt have the guts to be open.** Its funny how you have to have confidence to be vulnerable but thats how it is. Practicing this has allowed me to deal with my issues and connect with not just girls but also people in general. It sounds insane how this could work for hot girls even when you are out just trying to get laid but being able to be open and connect with someone on a personal level rather than being huddled in your own shell makes so much of a difference. **These days I get laid more than I did back then with not even a third of the effort.** I had all the other aspects of game down but being vulnerable in the right way showed the most improvement. The way I got better was I practiced being more vulnerable with those around me. I used my close friends and family first as they would not use this as an opportunity to attack me. I then focused on being more open when I was out and not pretending like I always had all the answers. It took a lot less energy, was more enjoyable and improved my results. **Not being able to admit when you are nervous, or sad, or unsure of something is a sign of emotional immaturity.** I really think this topic should be explored more but *here is what I had to say about it and heres a video I had on the subject a little while back* URL I come out with more videos on topics like these every week, along with infield stuff as well.

138,vulnerability,seduction,"""Do You Do this a lot?"" The problem with having the self image of 'A player' and how to potentially reduce flakes",4,7721gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/7721gi/do_you_do_this_a_lot_the_problem_with_having_the/,2017-10-18 09:03:45,"Good afternoon, everyone, Max here. Ive been in the game for a while now, however, Ive recently quit and came back after having a LTR for a year and a half. What Ive noticed is that most of my results came in the beginning of the approach cycle where I DIDNT have an identification with being a player, and this has been my biggest sticking point even now, and Ive decided to overcome it. This post has been written for those of you (me included, ultimately Im writing this post to help myself gather my thoughts on this subject) who after learning game, and start getting results begin Identifying with a player. Being praised by friends for being able to cold approach and get numbers, make outs, etc and seeing positive reactions from the girls amplifies the egoistic identification of being a player. Now, what exactly do I mean by this? If youve ever heard a girl say to you Do you do this a lot? or something of a similar nature, youre probably coming off as a player. But Max? Isnt coming off as a player a good thing? Arent girls ultimately attracted to players? Its true, you are able to create a lot of attraction due to knowing exactly what to respond to what the girls say. However, by spiking up the attraction, we tend to miss out on creating comfort, an emotional connection, and ultimately being ourselves. Aside from this, those with the Player Identification usually keep talking and talking in an interaction as the girl responds positively, and the girl ultimately does not invest in the interaction, leading to a lot of flakes, and ultimately not being able to close. Whats wrong with being smooth? Generally, being smooth is generally looked at as being a good thing. Having all the funny comebacks to everything the girl says, doing everything Right. However, ultimately this smoothness is a faade because its a personality that has been adopted as a result of engaging in pick up. Me personally, Im an extrovert, a very good talker, however, Im not a smooth player when Im with my best friends and being myself. First of all, being a player conveys no vulnerabilities, or weaknesses. To the girl, being smooth all the time seems almost mechanic, as if youve trained yourself to be this way (and you have, especially if you approach a high volume of women, and being smooth becomes almost inevitable after having to deal with the exact same responses over and over again). On a deep level, being a player who knows the right comeback stems from wanting to prevent bad responses from girls (I.e. if youre making a girl laugh with everything you say because you know the right lines will prevent any awkward moments, or bad reactions from the girl). By preventing bad responses as such, and not letting the girl speak most of the time, you end up being viewed simply as a positive emotion. As a guy who elicited fun and excitement for this girl, but nothing else. You will find that you will not receive texts back from girls, and girls will not call you back, or answer your phone calls as a result of them not being able to invest in a conversation. So what do you want me to do about it? Max? Should I stop being smooth? Im currently experimenting with this myself, and I do encourage you to do your own experimentation, and not necessarily follow my own plan for solving this issue. First of all, realize that you need to drop being smooth and embrace chaos. There may be awkward silences that can put you in an uncomfortable situation. You may not have the girl being super responsive, and attracted to you as you would if you were smooth. But, by putting yourself and personality on the line, and showing vulnerability, and truly being open to getting rejected, you will come off not as a positive emotion, but a normal guy that she would be able to remember. As you embrace the awkward silences, and embrace being yourself and not worrying about being smooth you cultivate natural confidence of being Okay with being completely yourself. Furthermore, clear your intention. Having the frame of Im just curious about her and want to meet her will help you in having a more fluid, natural conversation, as opposed to throwing smooth lines all over the place. The last subject of concern for this post, is the difference between the Going for the win vs trying not to lose mentalities. By being smooth, you are adopting the Trying not to lose mentality. Why? Because your smoothness will grant you artificial validation from women at the moment (they will laugh, smile, and agree to go out with you in the spur of the moment) yet flake on you later. Youre going for the positive reactions from the girls (I.e. not getting embarrassed or hurting your ego as a result, and ultimately getting instant gratification from artificial validation) as opposed to taking the girl home or making her your girlfriend, or the whole plates spinning thing. TL;DR: Adopt a Going for the win vs avoiding loss mentality, let the girl do some talking (and ultimately investing), BE YOURSELF instead of putting up the faade of a player. . "

I'm much more confident and assertive, and this has led me to get a lot more female attention than ever before. But that's more around hookupsmy goal, of course, is to find a nice girl to date. I'm on a premed track with plans to go into academia, so odds are that my dating life will be centered around the people at my hospital/university. And I'm totally okay with that. But I've found that dating in collegeand what I expect dating to be in medical school and onwardis much different than the scenarios discussed often here. Most of my friends that are girls complain about guys that are way too forward about dating. From what they say, they'd rather guys first become their friends before moving onto anything dating-related. So how do we balance some of Mark Manson's principlesthose of vulnerability and being forwardwith our natural desire to befriend those that we are interested in and seeing ""where things go from there?"" Are the two mutually exclusive? I hear people in this sub talk a lot about how becoming friends first might put you more into the friend zone and how the solution is instead to just be more direct. But I don't think this is really possible from what I've observed in college. Any advice would be appreciated!"
141,vulnerability,seduction,A question about the concept of vulnerability (From the book Models by Mark Manson,3,7b5lui,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/7b5lui/a_question_about_the_concept_of_vulnerability/,2017-11-07 01:54:35,"Sup. I have a question regarding the concept of vulnerability. I took it from Mark Manson's (Models) and I would like you guys to help me with it. Mark talks about being ready to make myself vulnerable, getting ready to get rejected, getting ready get criticized. He talks about being okay with who I am and not letting other's people perception take over mine. Now there's a problem. What if there are some shameful things that I don't want to share? Things that I am afraid of telling to people? For example, I am afraid of telling people I smoked marijuanna, I am afraid of telling people that I lost my virginity to a hooker. I am afraid of people knowing that I lost my virginity to a hooker, the act is not really socialy acceptable and I don't know what to do. Think about it, if I am afraid of telling people that I did it then it is neediness, I am afraid of their perception of me, aren't I? I really like the book and I want to be vulnerable, I think it's great, but maybe I misunderstood it. "

They're always the first to message others or make plans with others. But nobody ever messages them first or invites them out to things. To be honest, my strength has never been inviting people out to things. But I've always been the one that gets hit up and invited to cool events. This month, I've gone to a hilarious karaoke bar in JapanTown, 25-cent-wing Wednesdays in the Mission, drinks with my CEO friend, bars I've never explored, a soul-food brunch with friends, a Lake Tahoe weekend getaway, and more. I have three rules and one mindset to share. These have helped me develop a tremendous social and dating life where I'm constantly meeting new people. --- **Rule #1: Never say no to a social situation.** If you're just starting off, and want to build serious social momentum, start with this rule. This rule alone has gotten me out of nasty ruts where I felt my life was shit (think sleeping 16 hours a day because your life is so boring). Open yourself up to all possibilities. Become a ""yes man"". The more you say yes, the more inclined people become to invite you out again. Nobody likes being told no. (And never underestimate the vulnerability it takes for someone else to hit you up first, either.) Accept invites like you'd accept free cash. No matter how menial, lame, or boring the social event might be... Go. I don't care if you don't feel like it. Just go. When you become a socialite with not enough time on your hands, that's when you can become more selective. Assuming you don't have much going on right now, never say no to social situations. --- **Rule #2: ""Hit me up.""** Write this phrase down. It's your new favorite phrase. If you've got a personal Bible of your life, add this line to it. *""Hit me up.""* Always encourage others to invite you out to things. Always. Become too available. Be down for ANYTHING. People WANT to invite others to places. They're just afraid of being told ""no"" or wasting someone's time. Make sure you make it a ""safe bet"" for others to hit you up. You want others to always feel comfortable inviting you to places because you're always ""down"". You WANT to be the guy who's ""down for anything"". Overheard a homie in class talking about going to a party this weekend? You say, *""Hit me up if you need a Beer Pong, bro.""* Overheard friends planning a hike this weekend? You say, *""Hit me up if you guys need a handsome fellow with a greasy mustache to join.""* I'm being silly, but you get the point. Make yourself readily available to anything and everything. --- **Rule #3: Adopt social media.** Pick one. Instagram or Snapchat. Whichever you prefer, roll with it. You've got to be where the fish are. And in the social scene, everyone is on either Snapchat or Instagram. Furthermore, in the social scene, you can't isolate yourself. You've got to constantly be a presence and be someone others are aware of. Make your presence known. Be top of mind for people. Post Snapchat or Instagram stories. Send pictures to people. Constantly be interacting with others. It's a way of building relationships and social capital. --- **Rule #4: People want to meet new people.** This is more of a mindset rather than a rule. People want to meet new people. It's exciting for others to grow their social circle and potentially bring someone new to the table. People are bored of the same people and friendships always doing the same shit. You're the cool guy they've been imagining in their heads to come save them from boredom. Assuming you're a decent human being, you should have no problem getting admitted into many, many social circles. Whenever I'm invited out to events or parties, I know they aren't doing it out of pity for me. *They're doing it for themselves*. I'm the breath of fresh air they desperately need. And assuming you can bring some value to the table (aka having decent conversation skills, okay humor, and good vibes)... You'll be the breath of fresh air they've been hoping for. They'll be excited to have you join them. --- Well, that's it for me. I've been focusing my pickup game a lot more on building my social life. I figure it's better if I've got a social life where I'm constantly being exposed to new people, there's almost no need to do the hard things like cold approach. It's like business and cold calling. Why would you make a cold call when someone from your network can introduce you to the important people instead? I want to build a social life of abundance and relationships where I'm meeting tons of people naturally, rather than be roaming the streets of San Francisco cold approaching for little to no results. I've got a ton of additional resources that may be interesting to you guys: 1. [My top 10 tips](URL on building a social circle from scratch. 2.

144,vulnerability,seduction,Can someone who has read all of Casanova's memoirs sum up all of his seductions and respective results in a nutshell or cheat sheet?,3,72kb9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/72kb9s/can_someone_who_has_read_all_of_casanovas_memoirs/,2017-09-26 23:26:11,"I only got as far as the picnic with the wife who had a boring husband. I'm trying to google this right now but all the results I get are mostly commercial PUA articles with advertisements or guides for sale. Here's what I remember so far: The girl who pretended she was possessed by a demon: Casanova kissed this girl when they were kids. There was another dude who lived in the same house who punched him in the stomach trying to steal her away from him. The girl who showed Casanova her boobs while on the same bed: Casanova befriended this girl first, talking about all sorts of things. One day Casanova decided not to be friends with her anymore lest his libidinal emotions for her implode. While confessing this to her, he cried (PUA vulnerability). She wiped the tears away from him, took off her shirt, and made out with him on a cushy bed for hours and hours. They parted ways, and I believe Casanova said she later became a prostitute when they met again at an older age. The girl who climbed some boxes to reach Casanova's balcony in the middle of the night when they could have both gotten in trouble: Casanova exchanged eye contact with this girl across a living complex. She was below, Casanova was above. He dropped a blank letter down to the floor to see if she would pick it up. She did, so he dropped a written letter down to the floor again, and she picked that one up too. The second letter told her to meet him at his balcony at a specific time that same night, and how she could climb those boxes to reach him. Later that night they talked about their lives and kissed. I believe Casanova suggested he also reached for her chest. The girl who cried without makeup: When Casanova met this girl, Casanova waited until they were sitting down together, then took her hand and placed it on his clothed crotch. Later (I forget how long), Casanova went to her house. She had no makeup and cried and said her family was poor, and Casanova kissed her to comfort her. The bisexual sisters: I think Casanova met these two sisters while traveling. When they stopped at a hotel, there was some raucous activity outside and one of the sisters' bedframes broke. Later that night, Casanova was able to convince both sisters to kiss each other and make out with him. I totally forget how he was able to accomplish this. The girl who gave Casanova a copy of her own house key: Casanova talked this girl into making out with him in the attic by mentioning something about friends and/or God. I totally forgot what, I read this passage like 5 years ago. The Marchioness: Casanova met this woman at a ball or party and made some witty banter with her and a group of friends. I totally forgot what he said. Later he wrote poems for a male religious officer who would pretend they were his when reciting them to the Marchioness. Later, when all three were sitting down together, Casanova recited a poem of the same quality. I forgot what it read, but I believe the Marchioness was impressed. She later excused herself out onto the balcony (?) and Casanova followed. Some romantic talk ensued from Casanova, and they both kissed. Casanova admitted he could not go further than a kiss. The wife with the boring husband (lawyer?): Casanova met this woman and her husband while riding a carriage to a town or city, I forget which one. They shared dinner together at a hotel and Casanova openly hit on his wife with some witty banter. The next day, they took a walk together (with some coffee?) before meeting back with her husband (before he woke up?). A few days or weeks later, Casanova visited them again in their house (?) and went out for a picnic or something at or park or something. They wandered off alone to where the husband couldn't see them (PUA isolation), under a tree, on a blanket I think, and made out and had sex. Forgive me if these are not in chronological order.

Be strong for the most part, and say emotional things (I love you, I miss you) but less than the girl does. Does this mean I can't be emotionally vulnerable around a girl that I've been dating? I realize that I have my own needs. Of course, I would not put all of my troubles and burden on someone I'm dating; that would be too much for them to handle and is unhealthy. I am, on the outside, a successful person. I have a well-respected professional job, live on my own, am financially secure, and have my own hobbies. I am in shape and I've been told I'm attractive. I live in a smaller town and am a racial minority so dating can be a little challenging, but I understand that living here is not a forever thing. When I first start dating a girl, I have enough self-respect to walk away if it's not working out, I don't smother them, I have no problem with them seeing other people. Once I get emotionally invested though, it's different. I read stuff here all the time about how guys are okay with nonmonogamy and how they would love to sleep with all sorts of other women. I realize I don't own anyone, including the person I'm dating, and they are free to do as they please but it really hurts my feelings when I feel like they are seeing others. I have to admit, I do get insecure and jealous, and usually just try to ignore those feelings and never bring it up to the girl because of how attraction killing that is. But it eats me up inside. I have lots of sleepless nights. Am I allowed to tell someone I'm seeing that I feel insecure and sometimes wish for a little more reassurance from them? I get that a big part of this is a me problem. I think that I have depression and I will be getting help for that. "

(check out pickup decoded for an example of this)** &amp;nbsp; Ive been actively practicing pickup for five years now. Ive read all the books, watched all the videos, and bought all the products. When thinking about what content I came across that really made an impact, theres a few things that stand out. I want to share with you those nuggets of gold buried beneath the mountain of bullshit so that you can accelerate your results. &amp;nbsp; **Books** &amp;nbsp; **Models by Mark Manson** &amp;nbsp; Probably the most talked about seduction book on Reddit, and for good reason. This book isnt about techniques to trick a girl into sleeping with you, its about becoming a man of value who women will want to sleep with. I disagree with a few the points in the book, but for the most part its a lot of very solid mindset advice. After reading this book you will think differently about women and sexuality, in a way that will open a lot of doors for you (the sections about vulnerability and womens desire to be desired are particularly interesting). Highly recommended. &amp;nbsp; **The Trial: transform your dating life in eight weeks by Avery Hayden** &amp;nbsp; This is a shorter book, what I particularly like about it, is that its 100% action based. It teaches concepts about attraction, mindsets, etc. But this book is like a p90x for dating more than anything. Its a step-by-step process you can follow to get your dating life handled. &amp;nbsp; What stands out is that the challenges are well thought out, and the book teaches you how to learn from your pickup sessions effectively. In fact, it gives examples of a student going through the process, and its kind of like youre going through the challenges with them. Very cool idea, and I recommend this book because its very important to have structure around this, otherwise its very easy to go months or even years without making real progress (as Ive seen happen to many, many guys). &amp;nbsp; The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene &amp;nbsp; This book is incredibly well written, and it is fascinating. Its not so much about how to sleep with someone, as it is a book about how to make people fall in love. It uses powerful historical examples to illustrate how to really get people to invest in you. &amp;nbsp; Ive read this book at least 6 times, and I have to say of all the books Ive read this is the one book thats challenged my assumptions about how people tick more than any other. &amp;nbsp; The Videos &amp;nbsp; Frankly, a lot of the pickup channels on YouTube are cringey, theres only a few channels that are really worth diving into. &amp;nbsp; However, there are a few videos that are not only mind blowing, but capable of making a real difference in how you approach game. &amp;nbsp; The first one is: URL &amp;nbsp; This video is by the infamous Julien Blanc, and although its relatively short, it makes a very important point. Essentially, Julien explains that pickup is largely a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you believe you are attractive, women will feel that off you, and theres a much higher chance they will be attracted to you. If you believe youre unattractive, girls will feel that off of you, and run for the hills. &amp;nbsp; This video gives you a very practical strategy for intentionally mindfucking yourself into believe you are more attractive, so that- by extension- girls find you more attractive. &amp;nbsp; Tylers six steps to a consistently killer night: URL &amp;nbsp; This video lays out a very specific process you can follow when you go out so that you are not only very likely to have success with women, but also to have a great time in the process. &amp;nbsp; The video basically teaches you how to get in what psychologists call a flow state, and having used these steps for years now, I can say with confidence that there is real merit to these steps. &amp;nbsp; FIND WINGS &amp;nbsp; Its hypothetically possible to learn pickup on your own, but its not something Ive ever seen happen. Having wings is really helpful, especially when youre new. Even if youve never approached a girl, when you start hanging out with guys who do approach girls, youll start to feel pressured to do so because the people around you are doing it: peer pressure at its finest. Surrounding yourself with people with similar goals and motivations is extremely powerful, and theres really no excuse to not have some wings you know to go out with. With the internet its not hard to find wings, theres an inner circle group for every major city that you can join. Then you message people on the group or post to the page to start going out with people. Some of them will be weirdos, some will suck, but others will be genuinely cool dudes who are really trying to get this area of their life handled. TO find these groups on facebook, just look up: RSD Inner circle  Your city. Personally, I tried to learn this on my own, but I failed pretty hard until I met some wings. Those are, in my opinion, some of the best resources for learning game, check them out, let me know what you think. (And if theres something you think that needs to be on the list that Ive omitted feel free to suggest it) "

Things I want to change: 1. The whole concept of escalation - this puts pressure on us to do something 'different', 'better' rather than just progressing. E.g. If I put my hand on a girls knee I sense this tiny pause in my experience as my mind perceives the situation to see how that was received. 2. Indifference 3. Cheeky/playful - I am really good at building rapport through deep communication, eye contact, vulnerability, all that. Less so with being cheeky and playful, although this is beginning to come through I'm looking for the best recommendations. I've got a video series to go through in a couple of days that uses female instructors which will provide more unconscious learnings. We all have rules which are a bit different to a belief. I see a belief as almost like a category e.g. We see a beautiful girl and might think she's too good for us. When in actual fact we're simply comparing our self-image to her with a rule that results in a feeling. The rule isn't really a logical thing but it could be worded as example - 'The bigger the (perceived) gap in our attractiveness the less confidence I have'. The brain can then go into fight/flight resulting in us either 'trying' to win her or leaving. Would love some tools/practices around either removing/changing these or installing new rules :) Thanks guys!"
148,vulnerability,seduction,Developing God Tier Eye Contact | The real reason why you can't maintain strong eye contact with a women,250,6ssb9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/6ssb9b/developing_god_tier_eye_contact_the_real_reason/,2017-08-10 19:58:03,"##**The Eye Contact Problem**## I was on YouTube the other day when I stumbled across a video titled Video For Practicing Eye Contact. Surprisingly these types of video generate millions of views These videos usually have a beautiful girl looking at the camera, your challenge being to maintain eye contact? Wtf [**TLDR: Video Post**](URL Enough bullshit, its time for people to really understand the truth about eye contact. Failure to hold eye contact is a deep-seated issue; its not a technical one. The reason people cant maintain eye contact isnt due to the fact that they dont know how its because of the beliefs they hold that lead them to feel uncomfortable. Social Conditioning: Dont show attraction! Men have been emasculated by society. Many men feel ashamed of their own masculinity. They somehow feel that showing interest in a woman is wrong or taboo. They will go to great lengths to avoid eye contact with women. I partly blame these new age Feminazis for fucking up the biological male and female sexual chemistry (nothing against proper feminists). ##**The Deeper Issue**## More often than not, a failure to hold eye contact with a woman derives from an issue within. They say that the eyes are the gates to the soul, so when someone looks deep into our eyes a part of us feel vulnerable. This vulnerability is amplified if there are some unresolved issues within **yourself**! If you have a hint of self-loathing or low self-esteem, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. If you are not living your life in accordance with higher ideals, if you are not aligned with your personal values and ethics, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. Most potent of all, if you are ashamed of yourself, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. Geeks that masturbate to their favourite anime character in their mum's basements at 3 AM will almost certainly never have good eye contact with a woman. People that engage in fraudulent activities (unless sociopaths) never have good eye contact. The issue isnt technical, as you can see its deeper than that. Confident Eye contact Having you shit together entails:  Having a clear mission in life  Having set values  Having personal ethics  Embracing your masculine energy  Having set boundaries A confident man with his shit together will never have an issue with eye contact. He will be comfortable with himself and feel at ease during a conversation. Why would you feel scared or vulnerable when youre at peace with yourself? How could a woman threaten you with her sexual essence? It cant happen for the confident man. ##**Steps to Building Eye-Contact**## Here are some real practical steps to help you build your eye contact. **1.** Dont watch fucking practice eye contact videos on YouTube **2.** Find out what deeper issue is causing the eye contact problem and promise yourself to resolve it. **3.** Start practising eye contact on **REAL** people, if you are nervous look at the spot between their eyebrows. You should, however, move onto their eyes. **4.** Dont stare; use appropriate breaks during the conversation (usually every 5-10 seconds but depends on the person you are talking to). **5.** Focus on one eye, you cant focus on both at the same time (try it). **6.** When talking to a group, spread your eye contact evenly amongst each person. Dont block anyone out and focus too intensely on one person. **7.** Dont open your eyes too wide like a fish, you can blink this isnt a staring competition. **8.** If you are feeling awkward, thats good. You are getting out of your comfort zone; soon this shit will be a breeze. **9.** Prosper ##**Game changer**## Once you improve your eye contact you will notice more women being attracted to you. Eye-contact is one of the best non-verbal cues for confidence. When you can talk to a girl while looking her dead in the eyes you stand out. You stand out because most emasculated men are ashamed to do it. They cant do it. Now I want you to go out there and experiment with this. If it helped you, come back to this thread and share your success story. "

I don't have any experience in it. Never had sex. I was just wondering if I should focus on trying to get laid or trying to connect with women, find a girl I like and try to be in a good relationship. I read Models by Mark Manson and I really liked the idea of vulnerability. The problem is that the book is focusing on getting fullfilling relationships than getting laid (no problem with that) and Manson stated clearly in the book that being vulnerable (showing weakness, insecurities etc...) just to get laid is a form of neediness, and I think he is correct. I really want to experience sex to be honest. I don't like all the routine bullshit that I see on the internet. It's super neediness and it gives a huge headache. I know that the vast major of the relationships in my age don't last that long. I don't know what I should do."

It may seem counter-intuitive, but I believe that we find the best partners when were not looking for them. If were desperate to be in a relationship, we become less aware of other peoples flawsand we sometimes settle for relationships that arent good for us. Seeing multiple women at the same time is my default setting because I can maintain close relationships while still leaving myself open to finding the one. I always know very quickly whether or not Im willing to get serious with a new partner, and the answer is usually no. But that doesnt mean that its unhealthy (for me or for her) to continue that relationship. I dont really like sleeping with women when I dont feel anything for them. It happens, and it can be fun, but it also feels kind of empty because it doesnt fulfill my need for emotional connection. I tend to get really close with the women I *am* seeing. I dont keep secretsI share everything. Theres even a degree of love there. Im just not *in love* with them. I have fallen in love with two gorgeous women in my life, and both of those serious relationships began while I was seeing several other women. It felt different with them almost immediately and I just knew I wanted more. I genuinely lost the desire to see different women, so I stopped to focus on one. But women like that are incredibly rare because Im incredibly picky. So, Ive learned to safely navigate the minefield of maintaining multiple relationships, the honest way. **You can do this without being a dick** Most women will tell you they wouldnt date a man whos seeing other women (and most women reading this are probably thinking the same thing). But that hasnt been my experience. Imagine if they suddenly met a guy, the first guy in a long time, who genuinely listened to them, opened up to them, gave them positive new experiences, and made them feel valued. In that situation, the only things missing are monogamy and long-term commitment. If theres still trust, acceptance, vulnerability, playfulness, creativity, and respect, though  its an extremely healthy relationship. And in order to date multiple women the honest way, THATS the way you have to do it. Theres a certain stigma around men who date multiple women because so many do it dishonestly. Some of my female friends jokingly tell me that Im a bad guy (with a wink), or give me a cheeky tsk tsk as if Im getting away with doing something naughty  because *polygamy* is so strongly connected in their minds with *lying*. But if no ones lying and no ones getting hurt wheres the naughtiness? When you tell a woman youre seeing other women, its not really the other women thing theyre afraid of. Theyre mostly afraid that: * You dont value them as a person. * You just want to use them for sex. * Youll disappear without a trace when the next woman comes along. The seeing other women thing is a trigger for those fears, so most guys feel guilty doing it. But if youre being honest and you actually give a shit, youre not only being ethical, youre being completely fair to them. **Break the news as early as possible** I find myself initiating the following conversation frequently, in one form or another: *I want to tell you something: Im not looking for a serious relationship, and Im seeing other women.* It was difficult to bring this up when Id never done it before because I was afraid of being rejected. I remember battling with the decision for the first time. *Do I really need to tell her before we have sex? What if she puts her clothes back on and leaves? What if she thinks I led her on and tells everyone Im an asshole?* But Ive learned that its always better to be honest and upfront about my intentions early on in new relationships. After having had the above conversation dozens of times, not one of my what ifs have ever materialized. In fact, the conversation always goes positively and we usually keep seeing each other without having to hide anything. But whether or not we do keep seeing each other, women always appreciate the honesty and we remain close friends either way. Their initial reaction when I tell them Im seeing other women (or that I plan on seeing other women) is always one of two: * 1) Indifference * or 2) Temporary confusion Those who feel indifferent when you break the news are usually seeing other men themselves. Or they just already assumed you were seeing other women, and its a total non-issue for them. Confusion, on the other hand, arises when they had different ideas for the relationship. Theyd assumed I wasnt seeing anyone else and built their feelings for me based on that assumption. It makes sense that theyd have to revisit those feelings before deciding how they want to continue. Its more gentlemanly, for that reason, to bring up this conversation before you have sex with them. You can ask, Hey, do you want to talk about where this is going or are you all good? (Thats if theyre not already tearing your clothes off on the first night, because that kind of answers the question in itself.) If you get the confused reaction when you break the news, the best thing to do is give them space and time to think. More often than not, theyll come back within a couple of days deciding that theyre okay with the situation. Or sometimes theyll decide theyre not okay with it and then change their mind a week later. Or sometimes theyll decide that it doesnt work for them at all, and thats totally fine, too. A confident man with integrity would rather lose a girl by being honest than keep her around under false pretenses and end up hurting her later. Its the latter behavior that creates the stigma around men who date multiple women. If everyone was honest, the stigma wouldnt exist. Dishonesty just isnt worth the emotional toll  on either of you. **It cant just be about the sex** If you really care about the women youre seeing it has to be about the human connection. You have to genuinely enjoy spending time with each woman when youre not f*cking, and you have to be able to successfully communicate those feelings to them. I never try to convince women to have sex with me because I dont want to (or need to) have sex if she doesnt want to as well. Sex is better when you *share* it with someone. Its worse when its something they give you. If I focus on enjoying their personality, their quirks, their thoughts, ideas, hopes, dreams, and sexuality (different from sex), theyll eventually want to have sex, and then I will, too. Sometimes a woman will be hesitant to come home with me because shes worried I just want sex and may not actually like her as a person. I tell her sex is off the table for tonight and she says, Thats what all guys say. But I mean it. After hours of cuddling and conversation she usually wants sex, but I keep my word and tell her, Next time. The we wont have sex line is a shitty way to manipulate women into changing their minds, but its a good way to build trust and show her that you *do* enjoy spending time with her. Honesty is the key to dating several women at the same time without guilt and without stress. And being a high-value man with the above qualities (integrity, acceptance, vulnerability, playfulness, creativity, and respect) is the key to attracting high-value women. Theres a lot of depth to that statement, so if youre interested Ill write a followup article that shows you how to convey your high value in the context of dating multiple women, and also how to show women that you like them as a person. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions about that, or about maintaining relationships with several women at the same time. P.S. As a yardstick maintaining relationships with 2-3 women at a time can be great. More than that is too many (from my experience) because there just isnt enough time in a week to invest in each of them.

Recently some high-profile Psychologists have come to the conclusion that one of (if not the biggest) turn on for women is their desire to be desired. &amp;nbsp; Evolutionary psychologists believe women desire to be desired because intense desire from a man signals his faithfulness. Evolutionary psychologist David Buss explains this through an unlikely source, romance novels, Readers identify with the heroine as a powerful and compelling object of male sexual desire. The heroine has sexual control because the heros overwhelming passion for her ensures his sexual fidelity to her. In essence, the hero becomes dependent on the sexually powerful heroine. &amp;nbsp; Women have an unconscious desire for a man who is so sexually attracted to her that he loses control of himself. This signals to her that when she mates with him, he wont abandon ship and leave her to take care of a helpless child alone. This explains why rape fantasies are so common among women. Its not because rape is intrinsically sexy, its because for a man to rape a woman, he must be so desirous of her that he would risk everything, his entire life, just to have her. &amp;nbsp; What triggers a womans desire to be desire is what is sometimes called sexual intent. Ive seen time and time again, that strong intent, by itself, is a huge turn on for a woman. She can feel it in her bones when you have a genuine, confident desire for her, and it makes her feel the same towards you. &amp;nbsp; Its the most powerful trigger for sexual attraction there is, and when you feel a strong sexual intent, you will be shocked at the ways women respond to you. Theyll start saying things like, We shouldnt be left alone in a room together or, I havent felt butterflies like that in years. Intent is what sweeps a woman off her feet. &amp;nbsp; Intent can seem like a woo-woo concept, but its well grounded in experience. To understand what intent means, consciously think of a sexy naked chick. You will (hopefully) feel turned on when you do this. Thats using intent. Intent is simply your desire to project a certain feeling, whether it be a tingling sensation to your hand, or a feeling of sexual desire to a woman. No, youre not sending her magical seductive laser beams, youre simply projecting your desire for her, and she can feel it. Just like you can feel when someones angry at you, you can feel when someone desires you sexually. Intent isnt a Jedi mind trick, its an extension of your state of mind. If youre feeling anxious and unentitled, women will feel that off of you, and no matter how much you affirm to yourself, I am projecting a strong sexual intent, its not going to work unless you feel that way internally. &amp;nbsp; Intent is a consequence of the actions you take. If you spend your night out approaching women and putting on a pickup shtick or being an entertainer, youre walling yourself out from projecting any genuine emotion to the people you interact with. &amp;nbsp; Intent requires a lot of vulnerability. To start projecting your intent, what you need to do is to start making yourself more vulnerable. I do this by making a very direct statement of intent even when Im uncomfortable doing so. If Im talking to a girl, and Im feeling defensive and nervous, I will say something like, Sorry Im being kidna weird, honestly Im just feeling nervous because youre intimidatingly attractive. &amp;nbsp; As soon as I say this, I feel the weight that was previously making me defensive and anxious lift off my shoulders. By making myself vulnerable I free myself to feel genuine intent. Oftentimes, the interaction with the girl who I am vulnerable with turns around, too. Sometimes it doesnt, but either way, my night is always better for it because I get over my fear of letting women know Im attracted to them, and in so doing I let myself feel attracted to them emotionally. &amp;nbsp; Tl;dr- intent is simply your emotional desire for a specific outcome (with a woman). We dont show intent because were afraid of getting rejected if we make ourselves vulnerable. To change this, make vulnerable statements of intent, tell a girl she is so attractive that shes making you feel nervous.

Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge (and Everything in Between) (pp. 206-207). Henry Holt and Co.. Kindle Edition. A Plausible explanation is that being submissive can cause a woman to feel sexually desirable, and her sexual desirability, in turn, gives her power and control over her partner. Overall, we found that two reasons women gave for having sex I wanted to submit to my partner and I wanted to gain control of the person were related; statistically, they clustered together, suggesting that sexual submission can in fact be a means of gaining control.

153,vulnerability,seduction,Why You Should Actively Seek Out Socially Tension,17,6f5arq,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/6f5arq/why_you_should_actively_seek_out_socially_tension/,2017-06-04 13:20:37,"**We live among a generation of men who are so afraid of social confrontation that they avoid assertiveness like its a plague.** &amp;nbsp; Weve learned to value pleasantness over honesty and vulnerability. We keep it to ourselves when we disagree with someone, we keep it to ourselves when we want to say something controversial, and we keep it to ourselves when we have a crush because we are afraid of the social consequences of vulnerability. &amp;nbsp; We dont admit to ourselves that we do this, because to do so would be to accept a narrative that your ego is extremely fragile and easily damaged, which is a narrative that your ego is far too fragile to accept. &amp;nbsp; When attempting to become more aware of your own limiting beliefs, analyzing your thoughts is an important tool. It does have limitations, though. Your thoughts are not nearly as trustworthy as youd like to believe. &amp;nbsp; Your conscious thoughts explain your emotions in a way that reinforces your self-concept. If you have a negative belief about yourself, your thoughts will be warped by that belief. Its important to question your thoughts, but the most effective tool for doing so is often through reading your emotions. For example, if you believed that rejection wasnt a big deal, the following would be easy for you: Go to your college campus, a mall, or a bar and make new friends. Introduce yourself to at least three people. &amp;nbsp; For most people, this challenge isnt just hard, it triggers paralyzing anxiety. Hell, I tried this when I was eighteen. I still hadnt even kissed a girl so I gave myself a mission to approach women in hopes that I could get a date. &amp;nbsp; I went with a friend, we gave each other four hours to get some girls numbers at our university campus. We were both nervous, but we figured with four hours wed be able to make something happen. &amp;nbsp; As we walked around the campus, we saw girls we wanted to approach, but we always had an excuse: Shes too tall. Shes in a hurry. Shes looking at her laptop. She looks like a lesbian. Etc. &amp;nbsp; Most of these excuses were bullshit, but they were compelling to us because they provided an opportunity to avoid our paralyzing fear of social tension and rejection. &amp;nbsp; After we spent two hours meandering around the campus, we had a realization: this wasnt going to work, we needed to change our approach. We decided to make our task easier by using a crutch. We absconded to a nearby corner store and bought two Four Lokos (which if you dont know, are 24 oz beer-like drinks with 12% alcohol content). This was enough to get us both drunk. We slammed down the drinks and felt reinvigorated due to the social lubrication. &amp;nbsp; We returned to campus midday, drunk, and we repeated the same pattern (only this time we felt like idiots because we were drunk in the middle of the day). After two more hours of meandering around campus we walked home severely disappointed in ourselves. &amp;nbsp; We both avoided trying to meet women again for months. This should be an embarrassing anecdote that highlights an unusual social phobia that was shared by my friend and me. But its not, because our social anxiety was in no way unusual. Its the norm. Ive seen it time and time again, most guys become paralyzed with fear at the thought of saying hello to a stranger. &amp;nbsp; Logically, this behavior is absurd, theres nothing to be afraid of from approaching a girl. The worst-case scenario is that she isnt interested in talking to you and brushes you off. So what? Our egos are a lot more fragile than we like to think (our ego has a strong desire to think that it isnt fragile). We give the simple act of meeting strangers tremendous meaning, thinking that if were rejected well be humiliated or our reputation will be ruined. &amp;nbsp; The more desperately you avoid rejection, the more emotionally painful the thought of rejection will become. A man with deep inner confidence doesnt care about or avoid rejection; he has experienced it enough in the real world that it no longer means anything to him. Hes okay with risking a socially tense moment by being assertive because hes been assertive enough times that he cant possibly buy into the delusion that boldness can lead to painful consequences. A man of confidence is able to accept the fact that a stranger might be uninterested in meeting him, that his boss might not give him that raise, or that his crush might not like him back. Because hes okay with the idea of rejection, it doesnt mean anything. Therefore, what for most people would be emotionally paralyzing is a non-event for him. He doesnt have an emotional need to be pleasing. &amp;nbsp; We dont protect ourselves from real social consequences; we protect ourselves from imagined social consequences. We do this so effectively that many people NEVER put themselves in a vulnerable position. The truth though, is that by protecting ourselves from rejection so desperately, we constantly reject ourselves. &amp;nbsp; If youre afraid a girl wont like you, you make her lose interest in you by playing it safe with her. If youre worried people wont like you enough, you make yourself less likeable by trying too hard to make people like you. Modern men put so much effort into keeping a pleasing mask on that they forget theres something better beneath that mask. In college, I had a friend who gave zero fucks. What would have been extremely embarrassing for most people, was just a fun anecdote for him. Once, he walked up to his TA and asked her on a date in front of hundreds of students. He got brutally rejected, but the next day he told us the story while laughing about it. &amp;nbsp; I also had a TA I was attracted to. Unlike my friend, I wanted to ask her out in a pleasing way. I planned my big move throughout the semester. I considered asking her out during office hours, but I thought that would be too awkward for her. I told myself Id wait until the last day of class and then ask her out when it ended. &amp;nbsp; After class, I sat in the hall and told myself I would wait for her to leave and then Id ask her on a date (I didnt want to embarrass her in front of her students, after all). Of course, I hesitated and never ended up taking the risk. If I had asked her out, she probably would have rejected me, but so what? I cared so much about whether or not I got rejected, that I rejected myself. I rationalized excuses that were profoundly stupid for an entire semester of college. If I had just stepped up, I would have had an anecdote about getting rejected that I could have laughed about later. &amp;nbsp; Or, I might have gotten her number and ended up dating her. Now theres no way to know. &amp;nbsp; Since then, I made a rule for myself that has led to crazy (and sometimes embarrassing) stories. Whenever I get a gut feeling for a moment that I should approach a particular stranger, or ask someone out, or do anything that causes me to feel emotional resistance, I ask myself, What would make the better memory? &amp;nbsp; I dont always take action because of the question, but when I do, I never regret it. The answer to that question is almost always the best course of action to take. For More, check out: URL Facebook page: URL"
154,vulnerability,seduction,How to Embrace Your Flaws,48,6f8txr,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/6f8txr/how_to_embrace_your_flaws/,2017-06-05 04:17:50,"**Acting like you dont care what people think is a symptom of caring way too much.** &amp;nbsp; Listening to criticism and social feedback, and thinking about it objectively, on the other hand, is a symptom of deep self-confidence. &amp;nbsp; This kind of honest scrutiny is difficult because its when we feel the most fragile parts of our self-image are under attack that we get emotionally reactive. &amp;nbsp; Those fragile points of vulnerability are the parts of our identity we defend most vigorously. The flaws you need to become aware of most are those that are the hardest to accept because they dont fit into your self-concept. Accomplishing this is fundamentally challenging, but extremely powerful. &amp;nbsp; Not too long ago, my friends started to call me overly competitive. Instead of saying, What makes you think that? I would reply with an offhanded (and intentionally cocky) response like, A god does not compete with mortals. &amp;nbsp; I was sarcastic so I could avoid confronting the issue. I didnt respond with an open mind when I got called out on a bad social habit, that deep down, I knew I needed to change. I dealt with my exposed insecurity by brushing it under the rug with sarcasm. Addressing this issue with an open mind was the only way to overcome my biggest insecurities, but I blinded myself to the possibility that it was even an issue. &amp;nbsp; Months after I had begun getting called out on my hyper-competitiveness, I finally saw my insecurities rear their ugly head. I was in a small college writing class, and one student was answering most of the discussion questions. His answers were well thought-out and added substantial value to the discussion. But I got frustrated, I told myself he was an attention whore and that he should let other people contribute more. &amp;nbsp; In reality, he wasnt an attention whore. Most of the other students didnt even have something to contribute. I wasnt frustrated because he was hungry for attention, I was frustrated because I was hungry for attention. I saw the class as a social competition, and he was winning. I had an emotional need to be the main guy in the class. I was jealous that someone else was charismatic, engaging, and intelligent. I was butthurt by the fact that he was offering more to the discussion than I was. &amp;nbsp; Until I realized what I was doing in that class, all the emotions I felt and decisions I made because of my machismo-infused competitiveness went completely unnoticed by me. Beforehand, when people complained that I was too competitive, I consciously assumed they were jealous of me in some way (the irony is that even my thinking about my competitiveness was competitive without my awareness). &amp;nbsp; Blindspots to our own flaws are completely natural, and you cant expect to be so perfectly aware that you have a totally accurate self-image. However, it is possible to become more aware of your flaws and bad social habits, but it requires a counterintuitive approach. Remember that when you feel uncomfortable, the dialogue you tell yourself cannot be trusted because criticism and self-doubt put your ego on defense. Unfortunately, the voice in your head prioritizes the protection of your current self-image over open-minded self-reflection. &amp;nbsp; Instead, listen to your emotions. Whatever makes you emotionally reactive can become a goldmine for personal growth. When an interaction makes you angry, anxious, jealous, etc., thats when you can be sure you have insecure self-beliefs that you are not consciously aware of. Listen to your emotions much more closely than to the voice in your head. &amp;nbsp; Admit to yourself that the fact you are upset is telling you something that you probably dont want to hear. Once you come from this vulnerable, open-minded starting point, then and only then, you can start to accurately analyze what is causing you to feel emotional discomfort. &amp;nbsp; This process is difficult in a culture that teaches people to place blame on everyone but themselves. However, when you start assuming responsibility for your emotional reactions to people, situations, and criticism, you can accurately root out the instances when you are (at least partially) at fault. There are instances in which your emotional reactivity is warranted, but usually, emotional discomfort is indicative of something you should be working on internally. &amp;nbsp; What frustrates us about others tends to be what were afraid of in ourselves. If you hate men who regularly sleep with girls on the first date, most likely youre either secretly jealous and unable to admit this to yourself, or you think that what hes doing is disrespectful and youre afraid that youre capable of acting the same way if youre not careful. Either way, this is saying a lot about your values and your insecurities, and very little about the other person. &amp;nbsp; I have a friend who is extremely uncomfortable around anyone whos a bit socially awkward. He will complain about how weird some guys are and treat them like shit. In his mind, this treatment is fair; these socially awkward people deserve to be treated poorly because theyre awkward. But what he doesnt admit to himself is that he is terrified of being socially awkward himself. These people trigger him not because theyre socially awkward, but because hes afraid of the possibility that he might be socially awkward too. This is an example of what famed psychologist Carl Jung calls the shadow. The shadow is all of the pieces of our identity/ego that we keep hidden from ourselves. My friend is so terrified of being awkward, that he will not do anything that makes him feel vulnerable. In fact, he will regularly dare me to pull unusual stunts in public when we go out, like approaching a girl with an awkward pickup line (Is it hot in here? Or is that just the holy spirit burning inside of you?). &amp;nbsp; Numerous times after completing my challenge, I gave him a similar task and he always became visibly nervous and refuses to do it. To this day, he hasnt done a single thing that he thought was socially uncalibrated, even when offered money to do so as a bet. &amp;nbsp; His fear of being socially awkward is understandable (yet irrational), but what makes it so powerful is that he wont admit to himself that he has this fear. The only way he can come to terms with his own insecurities is by assuming that his emotional discomfort is reflective of his own flaws instead of placing the blame on others. &amp;nbsp; Realizations likes this catalyze significant change, yet this is always emotionally challenging. It requires a mindset shift towards your own negative emotions. You must realize that emotional resistance isnt something to avoid, but something to lean into and learn from. Negative emotions arent bad, theyre revealing a point of vulnerability in your own self-concept. &amp;nbsp; Negative emotions are signposts for your own neurotic and insecure beliefs, and theyre screaming at you to become aware of this to make a change. As soon as you see these emotions as signals, as opportunities for growth, they transform from something to be avoided, to something to be sought out purposefully.

155,vulnerability,seduction,"An interpretation of Mark Manson's explanation on showing your rough edges, vulnerability and confidence.",4,6fos6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/6fos6r/an_interpretation_of_mark_mansons_explanation_on/,2017-06-07 07:07:14,"So yesterday, I was going through my notes on Mark Manson's book, Models and I came to the section on Showing your rough edges. He basically says expose who you are and share who you are without inhibition. It got me thinking. What does this mean? Then it hit me. Stop worrying so much about your lack of confidence and your social anxiety. Embrace the fact that you're not confident. Instead holding this idealized image of yourself where you're always perfectly confident, comfortable and self expressive, embrace the fact that in some situations you lack of confidence and act nervous. Be unafraid of looking and acting unconfident. You stutter and have sweaty palms when talking to women? Shit, embrace that fully. Stutter your way through interactions without holding yourself to the standard of being that guy who is smooth with his words. Will some girls reject you for your lack of confidence? Of course! That goes without saying but like Mark says , it just means you two aren't compatible. You are at a point in your journey which may not be complementary of where she is in her life. Accept that. Some girls will find you attractive though. Why? Because you're taking action and moving with honest intention. You're being vulnerable and embracing your weaknesses (of anxiety and unconfidence) and guess what? The more often you embrace this vulnerability, the more confident and comfortable you'll get in yourself. Anyway I'd never looked at it like this before. I had made gaining confidence, just another quest for perfectionism. I hope this is understandable and helps someone out there."
156,vulnerability,seduction,"Confused by constant rejection of my dates - long post, really need advice",1,66owu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/66owu4/confused_by_constant_rejection_of_my_dates_long/,2017-04-21 22:36:54,"I would have never ever believed that Im going to write this. Time to be humble and accept the reality! **Problem: I get lot of dates (I really hate ranking people, but to give info would say mainly 7-9s from Tinder). Not single one of my dates seems interested seeing me more than once or twice.** **Some background:** Im male in my late 20s in Northern Europe. Got out of a long relationship (that started while I was very young) some time ago and was quickly 100% past it. I thought I have a good value in the market and I was really enthusiastic about meeting new girls. **Reality:** I think I have it all. Well not all, but enough. But girls are just not interested in meeting me after first or second dates. Also I get constantly very good vibes and signs, but then the girl just ends it without too much explanation. I go more into details later. Im very analytical person and I have thought everything that I can think of, but I cant still figure out what is the reason. The girls that I have requested pure brutal opinion have not been able to bring up anything that I could grab on. They literally say Im great, inspiring, I have a amazing lifestyle, Im different etc. Yeah you are thinking about friendzone. Nope. At least most. Read the date reports from later. If I look at common problems I actually seem to come out strong in almost every category. **Neediness.** This just cant be the problem. Well I actually missed a one girl because I was so non-needy. She told me Im lovely and wanted to meet again, but she was sick at that moment. I told her to let me know when she is back to normal and wants to meet. She said sure. Never texted. I asked some weeks later what happened and she said that some other (needy) guy just kept desperately texting her which won her. **Lifestyle, social status.** Well Im doing very well and while I never brag about money or anything like that the girls must be aware Im doing ok (good clean clothing, most have seen my car, some have been in my house which is pretty good). Also what Im doing for a job is pretty rare, but a cool thing. It makes me look slightly bad boy and smart same time and makes amazing lifestyle possible. I travel a lot where I want and work when I want. I dont wanna say what I do, but I imagine it to be one of the few jobs that raise genuine interest from girls. **My social skills.** From feedback of people who know me I believe this cant be the problem. I make almost literally every girl laugh, smile and open about her life and opinions within first date. I feel confident and Im not nervous in meetings besides the normal very very small meeting-new-person-type of positive nervousness. Of course constant rejection impacts me but I still feel very confident about who I am. **Appearance.** I have received compliments about my clothing and I get a lot of Tinder matches while swiping only for top 10-20%. I do work out/sports 6 times a week. So definitely not this one also. **Game/avoiding friendzone.** This was once a slight problem, but lately I have had no problems getting kissing going within second dates. **So to put it together:** I work harder than anyone to improve myself, I live active cool lifestyle, have success and lot of friends, Im interested in many topics and can have a great convos with most people and still can avoid friendzone. Im super honest, but havent notice that I would have freaked out a girl yet. Im strong and confident in discussions, but also showing my vulnerability when the occasion arises. I dont watch porn and I dont masturbate. I do only cold showers. Well if these things are not enough for girls, at least Im generally really happy and positive which obviously is in the end the the thing that really matters. But girls are very essential part of good life and the only thing that at the moment is the part of my life that I feel unhappy about. I definitely have weaknesses. Many. Like a not so deep voice. Or somewhat small social circle/its hard to meet new girls. But after going trough my weaknesses the answers seem not to be there. Like the fact that its hard for me to meet girls is not a problem because arranging the dates is not the problem here. *I think I need to go more into detail how things actually go. Here are my last four dates.* **My last date:** First date. Tinder. Coffee. She laughs a lot, ask questions, tells about her life and opinions. There was a point where the date should or could have naturally ended but I had 30 mins spare time and I dont even know if I asked before she agreed to go also for a quick tee for other place. After that tee I kissed her to the cheek during goodbyes. I had something to do at that point which she was aware many days before. So I could only text her like 3 hours later. Thanked for the nice dates. She thanked too and said goodnight. I asked if she wants to meet again. The reply is the usual one: I had good time but I dont know what I want. Maybe better if we dont see. But it was cool to meet and get to know you, you are a nice person Okay that was boring one, I just didnt impress her. It happens, move on. But next ones are I dont even know that to think. **The second last date:** First date went well though nothing really happened yet. During second date in my place we started kissing and making out. She said she is on period and cant have sex. I told her this is not too bad either and kissed her again. It made her smile. We spend many hours where we talk about many interesting subjects just to stop every once in a while to do some kissing. I also gently hold her around her knee area and feet while we are on my sofa and her legs are on my lap. I drive her home. We kiss multiple times. We agree to date exclusively. I had dates with other girls lined up within couple of days. I cancel those. Later that same night and during the next day we agree next meeting for next weekend. We chat like message or two every day, mainly because she is online on chat app very rarely. The day comes. She cancels the same day saying she needs to go work because someone else is sick. I try to ask if other day is good for her. Silence until midnight when she sends this exact message: Her: I have to say, when we met on Sunday, I got really distressed (not sure if this is the proper translation) about the physical contact and I could tell it straight that night. I had a really nice time with you, but I wanna take it really slow At this point Im like wtf. I mean - pardon my language - I fucking kissed her, not even very intensely and touched her feet lightly around knee area. She responded well to everything. And I want to point out her youth/past is kinda rough and she is definitely not any kinda angel virgin. Well, this is the point I felt more lost that I have ever felt in my life. I mean I guess there is shit tests, but this seem not to be one. Well I kinda know it is a lost case at this point, but I really liked the girl and so I try again. I did not apologize so if it was a shit test this is the right approach. Also I had nothing to apologize for. But same time I make her feel like she can be direct with me whatever she has in mind. She goes out in other town with her friends. Next day it seems like there might be a chance when she starts telling about her last night and asks what I have been doing. When I try to suggest a day time coffee for upcoming week she responds: Her: I dont know, this havent happened before or I havent had feelings like this before. I really enjoyed time with you. Maybe this distress or whatever it is means better not to see This point I just wanna find out if there is anything more to it. So I slightly provocate her by giving her a deserved shit about how she gave me false promises. It kinda worked because she both apologized (felt sincere) and admitted handling it shitty manner, but also got a bit mad since she felt I was judging how she had right to feel. I calm her down explaining myself a bit and ask her if there is anything, like ANY difference between me and the guys she felt sexual interest towards. Yeah I know, never ask a girl these kinda things  they work on feeling. Anyway, she says she is gonna write me after her work. The whole day was like waiting for Christmas. The night comes and she sends this: Well, actually after thinking about it this whole day I just cant figure out anything. It is really hard to believe this happened to you as many times in a row as you say? **Third last date:** Quick but good first date. She proposes to see again. Second date we kiss quickly outside and come inside to my place. This time I left it just for kisses, didnt try to go for sex  just got the feeling it wasnt right time yet and we both had training coming in the evening. After my training happens a funny thing, we kinda train quite near and I spot her waiting for bus after her training. I of course give her a ride. We talk and kiss before she leaves my car. We text and she is enthusiastic about seeing again. Tuesday afternoon seems fine for both of us. Thats fine but I ask if she is free any nights. Her: Well actually I dont have my calender with me (she was spending day in another city) but the next weeks nights are pretty full and I have week of lot of job coming. It can be difficult to see during the next week, but I will check again tomorrow!  Me: Okay, actually the afternoons are better for me also  night would be just more fun I feel like Her Yeah well I check again tomorrow, now too late for my brains to work anymore. I will text you tomorrow, good night! Me: Sure, good night! Next day, Monday.. Her: Huh what a day, but now Im with my calendar. This week is pretty bad, but lets figure out something for next week Me: okay, give me a text when you know more about the dates  Her: Yeah lets do so. I somehow dont have too much energy for anything since my grandpa is in bad shape but I will get back to you I wished her power to carry on in words that are hard to translate. Her: Thanks a lot Surprise surprise she never sends me a message. After a week is gone I send a message How are you doing? Still interested in meeting It is in unseen-status in whatsapp though she is online often. **Fourth last date:** Nice date, coffee, she laughed a lot since I was coming up with good stuff more than usually, date ended with a kiss on the cheek. Somehow I still didnt have her number (which I 99% time get way before dates), the girl was from Tinder. So I get her number and whatsapp convo goes like this: Me: (continues from tinder convo) Yeah, this is better! Hey give me a message when you know about days fitting you so we can figure out a good day for both of us. Her: Yes lets check some day for next week :) Me: Yeah, text me :) Enjoy your rest of the weekend! That message is still on unseen status in whatsapp. --- This post is way too long already, but same result has now happened with 10+ girls. **I have some hypothesis** 1) **I have been just extremely unlucky** 2) **I might have some leaks in first date flirting/gaming.** I have nothing against first date sex, but I would prefer more than one night relationships. So going for kiss very quickly seems just not right if we are still on stage where the other person feels pretty much like a stranger. At the end of long first dates or beginning of second dates I feel usually good about going for kiss. This cant be problem, right? Unless I only want first date sex which is not the case. What I think I could do though, is to flirt more during first dates. Oh and I kino everyone a lot. 3) **There is something in me that isnt appealing for girls.** Due to long term relationship I was long out of the game/market so I still have kinda small amount of feedback overall. Even though I have a good self esteem and I still believe Im great, Im very humble in improving myself. It is not a problem to admit Im getting frustrated and facing a huge challenge. The day I dont learn anything is a wasted day and a day I think I know stuff is a day I dont know anything. Now Im in a rare situation where I cant seem to really figure it out by myself. So Im asking for anything. Not just straight answers, but just something that I could use to find the answers myself. --- Also my experiences have opened my eyes a lot for what other people are going through. What I can say to all of you is that work on yourself and your dreams first. They say the girls will follow. Well, Im not so sure about that one anymore, but I can guarantee that happiness will follow. If you are happy (but not too happy) with yourself then you can take all the hits, all the rejection and all the shit that inevitably is part of life and still smile in the end of the day. **Thanks and stay strong brothers!** "
157,vulnerability,seduction,How to be confident,31,66pzuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/66pzuh/how_to_be_confident/,2017-04-22 01:44:04,"The internet is full of articles and videos that supposedly teach how to be confident. Most of this shit is useless because confidence is an incredibly complex subject and takes sustained work to develop and maintain. There is no magic formula for confidence, and it can easily be lost. This article is my attempt, but dont rely on it. Confidence is a complex mixture of positive thoughts and emotions. Actions create emotions, emotions create thoughts, and emotions and thoughts together create action. The emotions-thoughts-actions axis can either be a virtuous cycle, each improving the others, or it can be a negative cycle, each making the next thing shittier. I seek here to explain how to create a virtuous cycle of confidence. The first part of this article discusses confidence in general, and the second part discusses confidence in the context of getting laid. I can summarize the main points of this essay as follows: 1) Confidence is faith that you will succeed at whatever you do. To have faith, you must see reality as governed by rationality and logic, and that all you need to do is use this rationality to achieve your goals. You must not see as reality as out to get you. 2) To become confident you must re-wire your brains reward pathways such that you feel excited when you see a new challenge, rather than anxious and despairing. 3) To re-wire your brains reward pathways you must continually undertake new challenges outside your comfort zone and succeed at them. 4) To power through challenges, you must feel joy. 5) To feel confident, you must not feel controlled by anybody, especially people your mind perceives as alpha males. **Confidence is faith** The word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith) (literally with faith). In other words, confidence is faith you will succeed in whatever you try to do. Faith is a belief that something is true even if you dont have hard information confirming its truth. If I knew for a fact that a girl liked me, and I approached her, thats not confidence. If I approach a girl I already know likes me, Im no more confident than a guy eating a doughnut because he knows it will taste good. Obviously, it is easier to have confidence and faith when you have information to base it on. Everyone is confident the sun will rise tomorrow because it has risen every day of their life. But if you only base your confidence on things you are sure of you will live in a narrow comfort zone like most people do. Most people only feel confident if they already know they will succeed or if theyve seen somebody else overcome that challenge. There are doctors who can do brain surgery but are deathly afraid to approach a woman in a bar. There are rock stars who can play a show in front of thousands of people but break a sweat trying to do their taxes. But why have faith? Why should you believe you will succeed at getting rich, getting laid, and being happy if most people fail at those things and youve never succeeded at them? Heres why: Just having faith, by itself, makes you more likely to succeed. And the more faith you have, the more likely you are to succeed. If that sounds like the plot of that dumbass book The Secret, it is. Its also the foundation of many religions and philosophies. But there is a rational reason why this is true that doesnt depend on God or magic. Faith helps you succeed because the main thing that stops you from achieving your goals is your own emotions. Most shit is a lot easier than you think it is. Getting hot girls to fuck you? Becoming a billionaire? Brain surgery? That stuff is hard, but how hard is it really? For almost anything you want to do, there is a stupid, fat, douchebag somewhere that is awesome at that thing. There are literally millions of people that are dumber and lazier than you that easily do the thing that you think is so hard. Most of the time, the challenge is in your own mind. A famous entrepreneur once told me that you can learn almost any business in 4 months. Malcolm Gladwell says you can become world class in any field if you do it for 10,000 hours, which is only about 4 years of working a full time job  not really that long to become the best in the world. As far as anybody can tell, the world is governed by rational rules that predictably operate based on logic. To succeed at anything, all you need to do is learn these rules and use them to succeed. Viewed this way, the only challenge is our own emotions: we get bored, afraid, distracted, impatient, anxious, intimidated, depressed, overworked, stressed out, sleepy, obsessed with the wrong details, lazy, angry, frustrated, etc I call these the despairing emotions. You can take any task, break it up into a series of little parts, put one foot in front of the other, and eventually succeed. All you need to do is be rational, be prepared, and put the time and effort in. Everything in the world works like this  there is no magic. Even luck is very limited compared to what we make happen. Usually when we think something is too hard for us, our despair is hijacking our rational brain and making us think thoughts that we believe are rational but are really just justifications and expressions of our despair. When a heroin addict makes excuses to start doing heroin again, or when an entrepreneur decides to quit their business because its too hard, they think they are being influenced by rational thoughts, but really they are just being influenced by despair. Faith and confidence overcome our weak emotions. We power through challenges because our motivated emotions outweigh our despair, or at the very least, our intellectual thoughts manage and control our despairing emotions so that they do not cripple us. Successful people feel excitement and pleasure at doing their work whereas unsuccessful people feel fear, anxiety, dread, boredom, etc And humans are wired to seek good feelings, so when we feel depressed and anxious we quickly run to fix is our shitty feelings  drugs, alcohol, porn, and other distractions. Every time you encounter a challenge, your brain subconsciously does a complex cost-benefit analysis. You calculate the chance of success and the good feelings that come with it, and weigh that against the chance of failure and the bad feelings that come from failure. If your brain feels like you are more likely to feel bad, your despairing emotions will cripple you and make you not want to do it. Of course, this is bullshit. Your brain usually has no idea what the actual chances of success and failure are, nor does it know how you will actually feel after you succeed or fail, so its complex calculation is based on feelings from the past. Confidence requires rewiring your brain so that when it does the cost-benefit analysis, the excited emotions outweigh the despairing emotions. The easiest way to rewire your reward system is to succeed at things, so that, going forward, your brain feels like it will succeed again. But like I said, if you base your confidence on past successes you will never grow. True, ultimate, confidence is when you have faith that you will succeed at ANYTHING you try, even if youve never done it and it is something most people would think is insanely difficult. Im not selling magic. There are some things you will never accomplish, no matter how confident you are. You cant build a perpetual motion machine because it is probably impossible under the rules of physics. Most of you will never fuck Kate Upton, no matter how much you think you can. There is nothing wrong with thinking that something is impossible, or not worth the effort, or not the right thing for you at that time, but you must make that determination based on a rational calculation rather than your feelings. Most of what we think is impossible is actually very doable, we have just been tricked by our despair. Sometimes we just do not have enough information to make a rational calculation, and we must leap into the darkness. My dad had a theory that stupid people were often more successful than smart people, because smart people did intelligent cost-benefit calculations whenever they decided to take a life risk, whereas stupid people just jumped ahead and took the risk. When we leap into the darkness we must have faith that we will succeed. We also need faith that if we fail we will be fine and that failure helps us because it lightens the darkness and gives us guidance for the next try. We also need a plan to land on our feet if we fail. The rest of this article is dedicated to trying to teach you how to rewire your brain to feel excited about new challenges rather than scared. You can try to grit your teeth and fight your emotions 24/7, but you should also work to transform your emotions. **Faith and reality** Your goal is to re-wire your reward system so that you feel excited tackling any new challenge, even if it is outside your comfort zone. You need faith because you have no way of knowing for sure that you will succeed at any new challenge and without faith you will be crippled with uncertainty, anxiety and existential despair. Faith is tied to your view of reality. Philosophers and psychologists have long understood that people have a tendency to subconsciously feel like reality has intentions like a person. People will feel like the world is out to get them, a small group of elders control everything, life hates them, they have bad luck, or they have demons, etc Its obviously stupid to say I think reality has thoughts and feelings and hates me, but thats how a lot of people subconsciously think. I call this the anthromorphization fallacy. I believe this fallacy comes from our ape mind. Apes evolved to obey the alpha male, because it is better for the tribe to have one leader rather than everybody doing their own thing. To enforce this obedience, evolution produced anxiety, which we feel whenever we feel like we are disobeying or upsetting the alpha male. Anxiety and depression are designed to keep us in line and make us feel powerless, paralyzed and weak whenever we want to do something that might offend the alpha male. Human are apes with rational brains that magnify and distort our ape feelings. We can subconsciously see the entire world as an alpha male, and feel a generalized anxiety about everything. This is why some people are negative about everything, scared of simple tasks like driving, randomly freak out at small things, and just generally have dark thoughts. Religion tries to fight the anthromorphization fallacy by pretending like reality is governed by God, which is essentially an alpha male that controls everything in reality and will be nice to you if you do some easy, meaningless rituals. I believe in God and I think it helps my anxiety. If you dont want to believe in God, thats fine, but at the very least you have to stop yourself from thinking that reality has a mind and it wants you to fail. At most, you can rationally say that, aside from ascertainable laws (the law of gravity, E=mc2, etc), reality is basically random and chaotic and is neutral towards you. And if you are currently alive and breathing, you have to admit that reality has been at least somewhat good to you. Once you accept that reality is not your enemy, and may even be your friend, you can have faith that you will succeed at anything. Your despairing emotions will try to trick you into thinking you will fail, but they are irrational, often caused by the fear of some mental alpha male that may not even exist. How would your weak, human brain know anything about the nature of reality anyway? Many people, including myself, have realized the falsity of our despairing emotions after using psychedelic drugs, which chemically turn off our despairing emotions and make us feel like the universe loves us. Im not saying that you can simply turn off your despairing emotions by simply believing that reality is your friend. You cant turn off any emotion that is rooted in your biology, any more than you can turn off your sex drive. But the first step in controlling a demon is realizing that its there and thats it a demon. If you practice mindfulness, you will catch yourself being lied to by your despairing emotions and you will realize your thoughts are irrational. I dont want to overstate my case here. A subconscious cosmic alpha male is not the only source of despair. A lot of things can create anxiety and depression, and science has not even completely figured out those emotions. Anxiety can be caused by chemical balances, living in a dirty house, post-traumatic stress, bad life experiences, etc... But I believe that fear of alpha males, real and imagined, is a big source of despair for many people. **Real alpha males** People have a subconscious fear of the cosmic alpha male that controls the world partly because actual alpha males bullied them, made them feel inferior, and induced subconscious beta emotions. These guys include your father, your teachers, your coach, your pastor, the cool kids at your high school, the President of the United States, the Federal Reserve bank, the media, society, Brad Pitt, and famous celebrities whose art and persona is designed to make regular guys feel inferior. These are just regular guys trying to make it through life just like you, but their ego, selfishness, stupidity, negligence, and bad judgment has scarred your self-esteem. These guys arent necessarily alpha males, but they felt like it to you, at least when they affected you. Their combined efforts have congealed in your brain to give you a fear of alpha males and reality in general. Women may have also made you feel emasculated, not because they wanted to emasculate you but because they were testing you to see if you were worthy of their delicious pussy. All men fear some alpha male. The head of the Crips gang in Los Angeles is the alpha male of the thug/gangster world, but he subconsciously sees a nerdy banker as the alpha male because the nerdy banker makes much more money and lives a better life than him, and the Crip leader is too scared to go to school and try to compete with the nerdy banker. The nerdy banker, in turn, sees another group of men as alpha to him, etc A key to becoming confident is releasing yourself from the control that both real and imagined alpha males have over you. To do this, you must not give a single fuck what anybody thinks about you. Your actions should be governed by truth and a rational analysis of what is best for you, not your need to feel validated and accepted. The moment you care what others think of you, you constrain your behavior to gain their approval and feel despair when they deny it. And when you constrain your behavior, you show to yourself, them and the world that you can be perturbed and thrown off of your mission. And if you can be thrown off of your mission, then you no longer have the ability to succeed at anything. Many men link confidence to their tangible existence. A lot of guys say to me: Im not confident because Im fat, or I dont have enough money, or Im awkward, etc Thats the wrong way to look at it. Your confidence should not be based on any tangible thing you have, but rather your inability to be controlled, because a man who cannot be controlled and can also obtain anything. If a woman said to you that she only feels confident when shes wearing make-up, you wouldnt think that that woman was confident: you would think that she is deeply insecure. A truly confident woman would be confident even if she was in a disfiguring accident that made her face look like ground beef. True confidence is the intellectual belief and the emotional feeling that you are awesome just because you are you, and that you will succeed because you dont care what anybody thinks, you cant be controlled, and will not fall victim to despair. Confidence has its own intrinsic value: I feel confident because I know I am confident. I know I am confident because I dont care what other people think, and therefore nobody can perturb me from my mission, and if nobody can perturb me from my mission, I am guaranteed to succeed. **Happiness** Happiness is both a result and cause of confidence. As I said earlier, humans are wired to seek good feelings, so if you are unhappy your brain will get distracted and chase sources of cheap happiness (TV, women, drugs, trashy internet, etc...). Your goal is to get your happiness from accomplishing your goals and defeating challenges, rather than cheap happiness. If you face every challenge with joy, you will be more motivated. You may be a fundamentally unhappy person. Maybe youre depressed, or anxious, or have had a hard life. But there must have been at least one time in your life when you felt joy. If you can induce that feeling in yourself when you are pursuing your goals, or at least fake it, you will do better. One of my favorite quotes is from a rabbi who said that how can I feel joy when my house has burnt down? I feel sad for a little, and then when I start rebuilding it, I feel joy with every brick I lay. The upshot of this is that you should always be having fun. No matter how hard your life is, or what bad thing just happened to you, you need to have a social schedule where you are going out, doing things that make you feel good, fucking girls, hanging out with friends, etc... Obviously, you shouldnt let your fun times take over your life or do anything self-destructive, but I disagree with the idea that success requires sustained misery. Being happy also requires eating well, getting enough sleep, and eliminating sources of negativity and distraction from your life. If you have a friend who consistently makes you feel like shit, or a woman who brings you more pain than happiness, cut them out. They are bad for you. Happiness is a result of confidence because confident people are more successful, and your confidence proves to you that you can succeed at anything. Getting rid of your fear of the alpha male also makes you happy because you no longer need to rely on anybody else for happiness. Human beings are actually very simple beings. All we need is a little bit of food, decent shelter, one vagina to put your dick in (you should reject the societal notion that you cant be happy unless you fuck lots of girls), and love. All of our other fake desires are rooted in our need for the love of others. We mostly desire luxury things like nice cars, mansions or designer clothes because we think it will cause other people to love us and care about us. A truly confident man knows that he will be loved no matter what he has or who he is, because his value comes from being imperturbable and a model for others. And if people want to deny him love based on his material circumstances, then thats their problem, not his. Im not saying that nice cars, mansions and nice clothes are bad things. I enjoy all those things. Im also not saying that women dont care about tangibles. Women definitely do care about how you look, how you dress, how much money you have, etc... There are some women that will just never fuck a short, bald poor guy no matter how much game he has. But your own confidence and self-esteem should not depend on your tangibles. You should live your most awesome life. If girls like you, great. If not, no problem. **Can you really not care what people think?** Its impossible to truly not care what anybody thinks of you. Human beings are social animals, and we evolved to form emotional connections with other people and to care what they think of us. We need sex, affection and human contact. The only way to truly not care about the opinions of others is to either be a psychopath or a hermit that lives in the woods. Im not saying that you should cut off contact from all other humans. Im saying you should engage in mutually beneficial relationships with people, where you exchange the things humans need to exchange (love, friendship, affection, fun times, etc), WITHOUT LETTING THEM CONTROL YOU and without becoming submissive. To prevent people from controlling you, or abusing your, or manipulating you, or taking advantage of you, you must have a strong set of boundaries. Boundaries are rules for yourself that you will not allow others to break. A confident man is confident his rules are morally correct and makes others bend to his moral guidelines, not vice versa. If you have faith in your principles and stand by them, you cannot be manipulated by women or by society into acting against your own interests, doing the wrong thing, or chasing stupid trophies like nice cars and shit. I'm not here to push a certain type of morality on you, and I think many set of rules can be ""correct"" depending on your situatiion, the people you are dealing with, and your personal preferences. What's important is not having this or that set of rules, but generally having unbreakable principles. You should constantly reevaluate your rules and changing them if they are ""wrong"" and/or not conducive to the type of life you want to live. You should also be open to reasonable arguments by third parties that your rules may be wrong. **The good life** An important part of being confident is having a clear vision of what you consider to be the good life. Nobody can control you if you are happily pursuing the good life. This vision is a set of priorities and beliefs about the world that guide what you seek and care about. For example, if a hot girl tries to pressure me to do cocaine I say no because cocaine contradicts my vision of the good life because of its harmful effects. This sounds like third grade health education, but it is amazing that many adults can be peer pressured simply because they dont have their own vision of the good life. I know rich, successful adult men that have become cokeheads because the beautiful women they were pressured by hot girls to do it. Its absolutely fucking incredible that a millionaire Silicon Valley CEO can be peer pressured by a bartender into doing cocaine but it happens all the fucking time. And because that guy had no vision of the good life, he is now addicted and does cocaine even when those girls are not around. Your boundaries and your vision of the good life are connected. I set boundaries because I am pursuing a certain life, and if you get in the way, you are dismissed. For example, my vision of the good life involves waking up early to work out and work on my businesses. Many people (usually trashy girls not doing anything useful with their lives) dont understand that vision and try to pressure me into staying out late. No matter how beautiful they are or how close I am to getting pussy, I say no and go home. No matter how hot she is and how much I think I cant find anybody else like her that will respect my rules, I keep the faith. Your vision of the good life should have a place for all of your pleasures and pursuits. I like fucking hot girls, but I also like getting enough sleep, eating well, going to fun concerts, being around positive people, succeeding at my business, talking about deep, intellectual things I am interested in, etc Understanding the good life also makes you feel better about your shortcomings. Women are part of the good life, but you dont need to fuck the hottest girl and you definitely dont need to get every girl you like. If you think that happiness requires you to be 60 or drive a Ferrari or bang X girls a year, you lose your confidence if you dont have those things. If your vision of the good life is simpler, however, you cant be shamed and guilted if you dont have those things. **Why are women attracted to confidence?** First of all, everyone is attracted to confidence. Nobody wants to be around an insecure, sad, moping sack of shit. And nobody likes to be around somebody that is easily controlled. Humans are wired to reach for something higher than us, not somebody beneath us that doesnt challenge us or help us grow. That said, women have a special desire for a confident man. Why? Because women have babies and are physically weaker than men, women evolved to seek a strong, powerful man who can make a credible commitment to protect her and her baby until the baby reaches a certain age. A protectors commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. In other words, if a protector can be controlled by others or crippled by despair, his commitment is not credible and the woman is vulnerable. It does not matter how confident you actually are, but whether you can display that confidence to a woman. Confidence is performative. A woman wants to see you confidently pursue a mission and not be perturbed and more importantly, not show despair. Women can subconsciously sense despair in a man. She wants to see you be a brick wall. Women also subconsciously know that the thing that is most likely to perturb a man is a woman, so she will purposely try to perturb you to see how you react. If you even flinch, she will question your emotional credibility. This is what we call a shit test. A big problem is that men meet women in social situations where they are drinking and having fun, so women do not see men confidently pursue their mission. For most men, when they go out, women are their mission. But fixating on women subconsciously causes you to be controlled by women, reducing your attractiveness. This is why DJs and bartenders are more attractive to women  they are actually doing something rather than just drooling over them. **Your place in the tribe** On a subconscious level, women want a guy who does not appear to be controlled by the tribe. This is part of the reason women like bad boys  a bad boy tingles the same receptors that an alpha male tingles because the bad boy does not conform to anybodys rules and does not feel like he is controlled by any other male. This is irrational, of course  most bad boys are losers and the opposite of an actual alpha male. But we are talking about emotions here, not rationality. The alpha male does what he wants, and he doesnt rely on anybody else for anything, either physical or emotional. He is the only one that cannot be controlled. Sure, the alpha male does have the most tangible things (food and resources) but the alpha male isnt thinking about that. The true alpha male is not the biggest, loudest, meanest, toughest guy: its the guy who literally does not give a single fuck and cannot be controlled. Its the guy who walks in a party with a ridiculous ugly neon green floppy hat. Its the guy who tells an embarrassing story about himself that most people would be too afraid to tell. Its the guy who does something thats a little off, not because hes weird or has problems, but because he just lives in his own reality. The alpha male is totally relaxed, calm, confident in what hes doing, and is never, ever, perturbed by anything anybody does, especially women. If you walk into a bar or nightclub, you see a bizarre scene. Otherwise confident, successful, manly men are selling their souls. They are begging beautiful women to buy them drinks, listening intently to their stupid stories and agreeing with their stupid opinions, begging for their attention, waiting for them as they talk to other men, etc These men instantly lose credibility to women because they are begging to be accepted and are easily controlled. In other words, these men are experiencing the same emotional anguish that the women experience, which turns women off. Women want to escape their emotional anguish, not be with a guy that is also experiencing it. I wrote an article about how women are not attracted to men that are overly emotionally invested in them. See here: URL A major reason emotionally invested people are unattractive is because they are dependent on another person for their good feelings, therefore making them controlled. And women are fundamentally not attracted to men who can be controlled. **Bitchy women** A lot of guys confidence melts around bitchy women. I, however, love bitches. A woman is bitchy for one of two reasons: 1) she has suffered some trauma in her life that has damaged her, or 2) she regularly turns men into weak puddles, so she turns up the bitchiness to make sure she can find a mate whose confidence is rock solid. For women that are #1, you should just run. You are not her therapist and cannot help them. But women that are #2 are a fun challenge. Whenever a woman is a bitch to me, I know I am on my road to fucking her and all I need to do is keep my cool and not be perturbed. Bitchiness is just a front to hide their intense insecurity and anxiety. Confident, happy, well-adjusted people act polite and friendly, even if they are being hit on by somebody they dont think is attractive. All hostility and negativity is rooted in fear, defensiveness, and your own perceived vulnerability. Women are crippled with insecurity and anxiety about how men, women and society in general feel about them and have an intense desire to be accepted. Next time you go to a club, put your horniness aside and just focus on the body language of these bitchy women. They are afraid. They are insecure. They are awkward. They are dorks. They are easily controlled, if they could just find somebody with the balls to try to control them. Even when they try to talk tough or cool, its a bluff. A hot woman acting like a bitch is similar to a 16 year old nerd with a pocket protector and acne talking shit to a prison convict. He knows he is faking it, and the moment the prison convict calls his bluff he will back down in fear and humiliation. Not all women are bitches. I know some confident women, but these women are confident because they have other things going for them. They are smart, they have accomplished things, they are fun to hang out with, etc But whenever a woman tries to act like shes the shit just because shes hot, she is faking it every single time. **How to act around women** Lets do some logic. Women are attracted to confidence. Confidence is faith that you will succeed. Therefore, women are attracted to men who have faith they will succeed in fucking them. In other words, women want a guy to act like he already knows she will fuck him. Of course, you dont actually know whether she will fuck you. But nevertheless, you must act as if you KNOW she will fuck you. You must bluff as if you know she will say yes. And even if you get rejected, you must move on to the next girl with the same confidence. Now the question becomes: if you truly knew from the bottom of your heart you could fuck a girl, how would you act? You wouldnt supplicate, or beg, or act needy, or even do anything really. If you KNEW you could fuck a girl, you would do nothing. Of course, you should talk to her and be nice so that you dont make her feel bad, and you would engage with her to the extent that she says or does anything interesting or funny. But the moment she does something negative, shitty, or boring, you immediately lose interest because you dont need to put up with her bullshit. Unlike a lot of other PUA blogs, I am not going to feed you a bunch of lines of what a confident guy would say. The fact is, confidence is an emotional state, and you either have it or you dont. And girls can sense it because it is very hard to fake your emotions, especially if you are hanging out with a girl for a long time. **Humility** Releasing yourself from the mental slavery of the alpha male sounds great, but it is actually very dangerous. Most people in our society can only function if they are being guided by a superior: society, your dad, the government, your boss, etc... They need the anxiety induced by the alpha male to stay focused and not go off and get drunk and play video games. But if you want to be a truly confident, self-actualized man, you need to be able to motivate yourself when there is no alpha male swinging an axe over your head. Not only must you be your own alpha male, but you must cultivate a positive humility, where you listen to men that are smarter and more powerful than you, not because of your irrational ape emotions, but because they are smarter than you and they are helping you improve. If you look at history, a lot of times when men get a ton of power they go crazy (see kings, dictators, rock stars, Mike Tyson, etc...) because they dont have the anxiety of the alpha male controlling them but they also dont have the humility to stay focused and keep their head on straight.

158,vulnerability,seduction,The Unexpected Cause of All your Insecurities (A Guide to Deep Social Confidence Part Two),16,6c6bwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/6c6bwp/the_unexpected_cause_of_all_your_insecurities_a/,2017-05-20 06:47:55,"**Its not your flaws that you are aware of that cause insecurity and self-esteem issues. Its the flaws youre not aware of, the self-defeating beliefs you dont even know you have.** &amp;nbsp; Nobel Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains this problem brilliantly, Were blind to our blindness. We have very little idea of how little we know. Were not designed to know how little we know. &amp;nbsp; The harsh truth is that your analysis of whats causing your social problems is inaccurate, limited, and completely biased. If you want to make a change, you must first learn the true cause of your social problems, understanding this is the foundation that any social self-improvement is built on. &amp;nbsp; Self-confidence and charisma (or the lack of them) are largely the results of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Psychologists have found that social expectations become social outcomes. This has been shown time and again by research on a powerful psychological force known as the Pygmalion Effect. &amp;nbsp; Imagine a babysitter is warned by a friend that the kid shes going to babysit is a real shithead, hes impatient, annoying, and arrogant. After hearing this, the babysitter becomes anxious about meeting this kid. When she finally meets him, just as expected, hes horrible. This kid wont listen to her, he has a short temper, and he treats her with total contempt. &amp;nbsp; Theres something the babysitter was totally blind to. The kid she babysat wasnt usually a shithead, he was usually a perfectly normal kid. He acted like a shithead because she expected him to act like a shithead. Psychologists believe this happens because when we expect people to act a certain way, we treat them differently (often without our awareness). The person thats a total asshole around you might be a saint around someone else. &amp;nbsp; This matches common sense, if youre a Trump supporter and you met Hillary Clinton, youd probably treat her very differently than a supporter of hers would, and she would probably treat you differently than she would treat a supporter of hers. &amp;nbsp; We dont just cause people to treat us differently based on our expectations of them. Our negative beliefs about ourselves cause other people to treat us differently too. If you dont respect yourself, your behavior will reflect this (and people will treat you with less respect. &amp;nbsp; Someone who is self-pitying gets pity, not respect. If you believe youre a weird who doesnt deserve to be liked, youre going to act uncomfortable around people. You will be shy and closed off, this behavior will repel people, and as you notice that people dont seem to like you, youre going to build even more evidence that youre a weirdo who doesnt deserve to be liked. &amp;nbsp; Then youre going to act even more shy and closed-off around others, and this pattern repeats itself ad naseum. If you were aware this was happening, it would be easy enough to deal with, but we dont notice this happening. We only live in our own mind which can easily become a vacuum chamber of negative, self-defeating beliefs. &amp;nbsp; We cant understand how a better mindset would change our life for a similar reason that a deaf person cant really understand how hearing would change their life. &amp;nbsp; We dont have the proper context to understand what our mindset is doing to us until we become aware that our mindset is damaging us and is negative in ways that it doesnt need to be. Lack of this awareness is why you dont think its your behavior thats repelling people, but that its the fact that youre a weirdo thats repelling people. &amp;nbsp; Without knowing it, we become our own worst enemy. We might believe people are assholes, but we dont realize theyre just reflecting our own beliefs back at us. We might believe were not worthy of affection, but we dont realize that we wall ourselves from vulnerability and make it impossible to receive affection. &amp;nbsp; We might believe we dont deserve a girlfriend, but we dont realize that we could easily get a girlfriend if we just took the right actions. In countless ways, we fuck ourselves, and because our brain is constantly looking for an explanation for our problems, we blame those problems on something we dont think we can control to free ourselves of responsibility. &amp;nbsp; We do this because its easy, like it or not, our brain is designed to take the easy route, and facing insecurities is never easy. The truth is that you are in control of (and therefore responsible) for all your social shortcomings, but its intrinsically difficult to notice the damage youre doing to yourself. &amp;nbsp; Changing yourself isnt hard because it takes so much willpower or hard work, change is hard because it requires openminded introspection and honest questioning of your own thoughts, behaviors, and values. &amp;nbsp; **Case Study: A Man Who Fucked Himself Over Without Knowing it** &amp;nbsp; I had a friend, Nick, who was an interesting case, he was good looking by societal standards, 62, blonde hair blue eyes, athletic build. He generally seemed socially confident, you would never guess that he had a crippling anxiety towards meeting women. &amp;nbsp; He had hooked up with some women by getting wasted and trolling the bars, but they were rarely the kind of women he wanted in his life. Still, he would take what he could get and date the first girl who would sleep with him, once he dated a girl he wasnt physically attracted to for an entire year. &amp;nbsp; After a few years of drunken debauchery, he met a girl who actually met his standards, she was athletic, ambitious, confident, caring, everyone loved her.He was super nervous when he met her, but with some nudging from his friends he managed to go on a few dates with her. After they started dating, he began acting incredibly neurotic. &amp;nbsp; Because of his nerves about this girl, he decided he needed to meet other women. He found a girl on tinder, slept with her, then on the same day (while the tinder girl was still at our house), he invited his crush to come by. &amp;nbsp; His dream girl came over, and the situation quickly deteriorated into sitcom-level awkwardness as Nick told his dream girl that he had slept with this other girl. Unsurprisingly, this turned his dream girl off, and they stopped dating. &amp;nbsp; A couple months later, Nick met his dream girl again, he was afraid to approach her, but another friend and I convinced him to do it. Surprisingly, she was happy to see him and they made plans to hang out again. Nick never followed through with these plans. &amp;nbsp; Nick hasnt slept with another girl in six months since this happened. He will declare that he needs to start meeting women again, and hell go out once or twice (for 30 minutes before he drives back home), and then hell say he needs to focus on his career right now. &amp;nbsp; Recently he decided this dream girl of his fucked him up. He said what happened made him unable to meet women anymore, that hes scarred, and this is why he wont go out. &amp;nbsp; **The Downward Spiral** &amp;nbsp; From the outside looking in, his behavior is clearly neurotic. But to him, it all made logical sense. Thats the real problem, its so obvious how other people unnecessarily fuck themselves over, but we all have a bias to be blind to our own similar behavior. &amp;nbsp; Its easy to notice when someone else is falling into a neurotic, self-destructive pattern, but its incredibly difficult to admit this to yourself.Nicks mindset has a foundational issue thats preventing him from growing. He is dealing with his relationship problems using what psychologists call a static mindset. &amp;nbsp; A static mindset is a belief that people dont change, that we are the victim to external circumstances. A static mindset is a ruthless self-fulfilling prophecy. &amp;nbsp; For example, you can have a static belief that you arent intelligent. Maybe you didnt excel in school early on and the feedback you got made you believe that school just wasnt for you, you just arent smart enough. This calcifies into a static mindset that you are not smart, that you, as a person, arent able to be a good student. This mindset becomes self-reinforcing. &amp;nbsp; When you are assigned homework, you tell yourself that youre not a good student, so you avoid the homework or approach it halfheartedly. When you read for class you dont pay attention, because, whats the point? Youre not going to get anything out of it anyway, schools just a waste of time for a dumb kid. &amp;nbsp; Then the grades come in, your parents are disappointed, and the negative feedback is stressful. The easiest way to interpret this feedback is to blame your failure on something outside of your control. Something essential to who you are, like your lack of intelligence. &amp;nbsp; By doing this, you relieve yourself from the pain of knowing that your own decisions are causing you to fail. By doing this, its not your fault. Instead, its like a disease, something you dont have to blame yourself for, something that youre a victim to. &amp;nbsp; This is a negative self-belief that can only lead to negative feelings about yourself. Sure, you alleviate yourself from responsibility for your problems, but you accomplished this through negative self-evaluation. This frees you from one source of stress, and traps you in another, far more damning stress- the feeling of helplessness. You paralyze yourself and make action impossible, because your mindset says action is pointless, that youre not good enough, no matter what you do. &amp;nbsp; **Victims to Ourselves** &amp;nbsp; Nick believes that he doesnt deserve a healthy relationship based on mutual respect. So, he makes it impossible for himself to get in this kind of relationship. He avoids meeting women unless he gets wasted, and when he does meet a woman he really likes, he self-sabotages the relationship so that its doomed to end before it ever really begins. &amp;nbsp; He tells himself a story about why this is happening, a story about who he is- a person that is fundamentally damaged, wounded, a victim. And through making himself a victim, he entitles himself to continue acting in self-destructive ways, sabotaging his relationships with ridiculous decisions like inviting a second girl on a date with the girl he really likes. &amp;nbsp; And those self-destructive behaviors reinforce his static, negative self-beliefs. He must be damaged or he wouldnt keep acting in such self-harming ways. If he werent a victim, then why does he keep making the same mistakes without ever escaping the cycle? &amp;nbsp; Most people do this, the differentiator between those who change and those who dont is how effective you are at becoming aware of the damage youre doing to yourself. &amp;nbsp; Every time you catch yourself falling into a self-destructive social pattern, you are opening yourself up to change. This is the only way to make real, substantial growth. Ask yourself how you might be doing this to yourself right now. It may be mild, it may be extreme, but self-destructive patterns are there, no ones mindset is perfectly enlightened. We all have negative beliefs about ourselves. &amp;nbsp; The path towards deep confidence is a path of building awareness of the ways in which your mindset is damaging yourself, and then finally being free to let go of them and disprove them. &amp;nbsp; Dont think of your mindset as something you need to fix, in a paradoxical way, this gives that mindset more charge, more power. What you resist, persists. Actively fighting against a mindset is emotionally acknowledging that mindset as valid. Conscious rebellion doesnt work, the path towards true change is counter-intuitive, it is surrender. &amp;nbsp; By accepting you do have negative self-beliefs, by surrendering to the fact that these mindsets are affecting you, they lose their emotional power over you. This is the path to freeing yourself from your self-imposed limitations. &amp;nbsp; (Part three will dive into the specific how-to of becoming aware of your own negative self-beliefs and freeing yourself from the problems they create) &amp;nbsp; If you want to see part three when it's released, you can do so by subscribing to the newsletter at: URL "

The problem is - it's not always possible, depending on what you are trying to hide. Most people, especially young, don't have anything serious to be ashamed of. Some may be a bit insecure about their looks, some are not too proud about their job, maybe they treated somebody impolitely in the past, etc. Now my situation - im a kissless virgin at 25. Despite being decent looking and successful in other areas of life, I was always awkward and scared of girls and intimacy. How do I become vulnerable about this? Let's be honest, it's something you might share with your closest friends, but when you meet new people the only option is to hide it, and for girls it's a major turn off. It really makes me depressed lately. Even if I finally lose my virginity later in life, I will never be comfortable with how much I failed on my youth. What do you think? tl;dr: How does the concept of vulnerability apply to someone who actually has something to hide?"

Robert Greene's or Mark Manson's?,39,5xqwn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5xqwn9/which_advice_is_better_about_being_open_about/,2017-03-06 14:02:46,"Robert Greene's The 48 Laws of Power: &gt; Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it comes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feeling of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other person to detour you into a strange country. Everything in seduction, however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or reveal them directly in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the scent. To surrender to your guidance they must be appropriately confused. You have to scramble your signalsappear interested in another man or woman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite. TL;DR - You conceal your intentions. Hint at interest in her, then hint at interest in another man or women. Patterns will confuse and excite. --- Mark Manson's Models: &gt; One can flirt by being clear with ones intentions as well. One can state ones sexual desires clearly or actually even move to make those sexual desires happen. Its counterintuitive, but this can generate a lot of uncertainty and sexual tension as well. &gt; For instance, lets say you meet a woman and just come right out and say, I think youre beautiful, Id like to take you on a date. &gt; A lot of men cringe at this idea. Needy men hate it because they think it will make them creepy. Narcissistic men hate it because they believe theyre giving their power away. &gt; But in reality, its one of the most powerful and practical things you can say. Not only is it vulnerable, as weve discussed at length, but it also builds far more sexual tension. &gt; But how? If she already knows you like her, how can it build tension? Theres no uncertainty. Oh, but there is. TL;DR - Be open about your desire. Vulnerability is attractive."

Background: I am a naturally funny person and I can see the jokes in almost anything. Women end up laughing in my company and many men see me as some sort of competitor. However, I have almost always had issues bonding with people my whole life. Has a lot to do with upbringing. In the past decade I have improved a lot and made a few close friends (3 or 4 of them). Still not close to having someone I can openly talk to about certain issues. This reflects in my game where I have issues establishing rapport and comfort with women. And In a social context, I have issues making mates with other Alphas since that helps my own status around other women. I am not sure how to change this and I am trying hard reading materials here to get more socially aware of situations. I am guessing its something to do with vulnerability but I am not sure how to tackle that. It takes me very long to enter or form a social group because of these reasons. Even if do form groups I sometimes get left out of events and dont get called every time. My questions is how do I establish becoming mates with other alphas in a social situation. Is it by making mates with the women they hang out with (some have female friends in common with me). This more of a internal game question and hence I would love to hear what you guys think of someone who is not socially awkward per say but lacks that ability to connect to people, form a group, stay alpha around other alphas and win the confidence of women.

In a world where you can get tips and perspectives from anyone or anywhere on the Internet, theres no shortage of advice. And a lot of it flat out justdoesntwork. Theres good intentions in the advice but when it comes to real-world practicality, men are still having to try hard to get the connection they want Which personally I believe should be easy and effortless, not confusing and difficult. When I was younger I really wanted to understand women and relationships. I was a computer programmer, web designer, avid video game player. But I felt clueless when it came to women. Like most guys connected to the Internet, I went searching for help. Unlike most guys, I invested over $20,000 into different bootcamps, seminars, products, and coaches into learning this stuff. Not to mention the thousands of hours I put into applying the advice I got. I first started off 7 years ago with an e-book on how to date girls in college. Its been a journey since then  Ive had one-night stands, polyamorous relationships, monogamous relationships, and everything in-between. Ive battle-tested all the different techniques, perspectives, and paradigms that I could possibly find when it comes to dating and relationships. And at the end of it all, heres what I realized What actually works is completely counter-intuitive and contrary to the advice I had been given. Even from the professionals, the gurus, and the best of the best. And so my intention with this post is to share with you the wisdom Ive learned through my own personal experiences, to the best of my ability, in the hopes that it will simplify your dating life completely so that you can move on towards growth in other areas of your life. I spent countless nights suffering in confusion about this stuff, when deep down I just wanted to have a stable sense of how attraction, connection, and relationships worked. I hope this post can save you the time I spent and offer some perspective that can lead to an amazing relationship in your life. Heres what youll learn in this post: * How to develop attractiveness towards women on a fundamental level, beyond the need for pickup lines, trying-hard, or approaching * How to get to a place where women approach you and pick you up, not the other way around * One widely-applicable exercise that you can do anywhere, any place, that will improve your connection to women over and over again. **About The Anti-Method** My approach with dating can be summed up as follows: The Anti-Method. Its basically the complete opposite of what guys are taught. Here are some real-world examples, of my own experience, of how the dating game using this way of operating has worked for me. **How I Met Jenny** I was eating dinner by myself at one of my favorite restaurants. It was a casual night where I spent time chatting it up with the people next to me and enjoying my time. I walked out of the restaurant, and while I was half-way down the sidewalk, a woman comes out of the restaurant and runs after me shouting. Hey, hey! I turn around. Havent we met before? she says. I didnt talk to her in the restaurant, nor had I met her before, nor did she look familiar. But she was cute, and I was intrigued that she came running after me, so I continued chatting with her. She went on to tell me that she didnt know what came over her and that she just felt compelled to leave the restaurant and come talk to me. I asked why and she said I dont know, there was just something about you. We went back inside for a drink, hit it off, and started dating seriously a few weeks later. Turns out she was an artist and was in a feature film that was released in theaters. Not only was she a badass with her work, but she had an incredible heart and dating her was healing on so many different levels. This wasnt the only time I experienced this. **Getting picked up at the bar** I went to a bar with a friend, and about an hour later, a woman bumped into me. She looked at me and said excuse me, but had a coy look on her face that told me that it really wasnt an accident. She scurried off, and 10 or so minutes later I walked to go to the bathroom. She came and found me, asked me if I was single, and told me I was cute and that she wanted my number. We went on a date a couple days later, with only one text-exchanged, which was Bitter bar at 8pm? (a local bar here in Boulder, Colorado). Super simple, no pickup lines, no trying, super simple. And this pattern wasnt just happening to me **The time I took a friend to a bar** I took a close friend to a bar to show him how he could apply my viewpoint on dating, and also to see if it was just me that women were responding to. I was wondering if it was just me or if this is something that could be taught. I rarely go to bars, and my friend doesnt go to bars either. Especially not just to see how women responded to him. This was a first-time experience for him. After a couple of hours, a cute hippie chick approached him and wanted to dance with him. They danced for a little, and as far as I could tell, didnt really exchange many words. They stopped dancing and he came to join me, saying that that was an interesting experience. (He later told me that she whispered in his ear I dont know why but I feel like I can trust you.) A few minutes later the girl came back up to him, asked him to hold out his arm, and then she wrote her number on his arm with a sharpie she had in her purse. She said she was having a party later and to text her for the address. We both went to the party later that evening and had a great time. **How I Met Alex** When I moved to Boulder, Colorado a few years ago I hardly knew anyone outside of a few friends that I had when I moved. So I took the opportunity to go to as many events as possible, and when I was invited to something, Id attend. One of my friends threw a barbecue every week during one of the Summers. There were always new people there and so I went regularly to get to know them and tap into the community around me. I had one conversation with one woman about some hobbies, for a couple minutes or so, and didnt really think of it that much. A week later I get a message from the woman that said that I came up a few times in conversation with other people and asked if we could get together. We got together to grab a tea and instantly felt chemistry that went on to form the longest relationships Ive ever had. **Ive been thinking about you** Im going to throw this story in here because it makes me laugh every time I think about it. I met this woman over 7 years ago when I was deathly afraid of women. She was super cute, and I at the time thought I wanted to marry herbut regardless, I was too nervous to ask her out and didnt have the confidence that the pick-up stuff I was reading told me I needed to have. So I let it go and beat myself up for it. A year after I met her, I ran into her again through a mutual friend. I was still crushing on her, but with (still) no confidence, and the fact that she had a boyfriend, I let it go and forgot about it. A few year after that and a text exchanges during that time period, I get a random message from her that said something along the likes of Hey, my little secret but I just masturbated to the thought of you and it was fantastic. We met up a few months later when we were in the same city and had a fun time in the backseat of my car. **Holiday shenanigans** Over the holidays, I went to a bar in a local town with a few friends. I dont know anyone in the town, but I wanted to spend some time with my friends so I went. At the bar, a couple of girls approached us and sparked up a conversation. We talked for 10 minutes or so, and because they were with some guy friends, they left to go to another bar. A few minutes later, both of the girls come back, and one of them tells me I really wanted to give you my number so I came back. Can I put my number in your phone? I gave her my phone and she put her name followed by Cute chick you met at the bar whos super cool. I couldnt help but laugh because that was the same technique I was taught in some pick-up book years ago, and now the woman was using it on me. **Notes on the experiences** The aim of sharing these experiences is to show you the range of experiences that can happen when you apply the principles that Im going to teach you in this post. You could end up meeting a woman you date seriously for a few years, have a one-night stand, or meet some pretty cool women that youre friends with for the rest of your life. Now, its important to note that while I spent 7 years studying the whole pickup stuff, it wasnt until I started applying the anti-method that all of these experiences happened. It was like a light-switch turned on, where seemingly random and amazing connections happened consistently, over and over again. And its not just me. Ive had friends and clients tell me similar stories where before theyd never had any real consistent success before with the other things that theyve tried. Its been proven to me that when a man has a full understanding of the anti-method, he doesnt have to spend years learning pickup, approach 1000 girls to get their confidence up, or learn to say the right thing or anything like that. By the end of this post, youll be able to apply this methodology as well to have an effortless dating life and begin to create the relationships that you want without trying hard at all. Ready to dive in? **How It Works** The common element in what caused all of the experiences I previously mentioned to happen is that I fully understood and applied the energetic dynamics of how attraction works. Its a myth that attraction happens externally with the things that you say and the things that you do. Attraction happens underneath the surface, at a subconscious level, when a mans energy and a womans energy are correctly polarized. Ill get into that in a minute. First, I want to make it clear that this isnt about quick fixes or temporary solutions to the dating game. Once fully understood and put into practice, these energetic dynamics will be embedded into your body and will improve your level of attractiveness in permanent way, without you having to think about it. At this point you may be askinghow does it work? Lets get to it. **Dating Energetics Explained: The Gravity Metaphor** To increase your level of attractiveness in a permanent way, the first thing to understand is how your energy works. The best way I can explain how this works is with an analogy. Think of yourself like the Sun. You are the center of your solar system. There are planets orbiting you, like Mars, Jupiter, etc. These planets represent the people in your life  friends, family, women, etc  all orbiting to various degrees of depth in relation to you. How people interact with you is much like how planets interact with the Sun. The Suns gravitational pull affects each planet differently and how they orbit the Sun. Its why certain planets are closer than others and why some arent in its orbit and reside in other solar systems. Their magnetic fields either line up, or dont. Theyre either polarized or not. This video by NASA does a good job of explaining how this works: [NASA Video: Understanding the Magnetic Sun](URL To make this happen, the Sun isnt really doing anything. Its just burning, doing its thing. Its not saying I need to attract these planets into my orbit or asking how do I bring them closer. Its simply being. The process of planets orbiting the Sun is naturally-occurring process of life. Relationships with women work the same way. The only big difference is that people have an ego. The ego is an attraction destroyer. It serves its purpose, and theres nothing wrong with it, however when it comes to attraction the ego gets in the way of the natural attraction process between men and women. Its de-polarizing. With the ego, the dating game feels like an uphill battle where you can never seem to go on a date with someone, or they always flake, or they want to be just friends. A romantic relationship is always out of reach, or at least the one that youre truly wanting is always one step away. With less and less of it, women in your life operate like planets to the Sun  they start to orbit you. Theyll orbit in your physical space, through social media, through friends-of-friends, through work, etc. They could be close or in a different solar system, but they are in fact there. How close they are in your orbit is dictated by the gravitational field that you have. Your energy. The stronger your energy is  the stronger your gravitational field is  the more naturally attractive you are. Meaning that as your gravitational field becomes stronger, you have to work less in order to connect with women in your life. Less effort. Less trying-hard. Less games. But how do you upgrade your energy? How do you upgrade your gravitational field? How To Upgrade Your Energy and Improve Your Gravitational Field **Principle #1  Releasing Expectations and Agendas** The first thing that any man needs to do to upgrade his gravitational field and improve his natural polarity with women is to learn to relate to women without expectations and agendas. What are expectations and agendas? An expectation is any place in which you are attempting to force your external reality to get a specific result. With an expectation/agenda, theres a concrete notion of I want things to happen this way and only this way or This is what I want so I have to go get it. This is the ego talking. For instance, most men are trying to figure out what to say to ask a girl on a date How to get her to be his girlfriend How to attract THAT girl And to fulfill that expectation, most guys go and do something about it  like approach multiple women at the bar. Again, expectations can show up as: this is the result I want + what do I need to go do externally in order to get it. When actions are rooted from that type of mindset of expecting a certain result, which often happens subconsciously, it destroys the natural attraction process and reduces the mans energy field dramatically . Has a woman ever flaked on you and you got pissed or down on yourself? Has a woman ever told you one thing and then did another and it upset you? Has a woman you thought was attractive flirt with some other guy and you got jealous or even depressed? If so, these are prime examples of your expectations getting broken. Heres the thing about women. In the dating game, they will continue to break your expectations over and over again until you can learn to let go of them. If you go to bar trying to pickup women, two things will either happen: 1) you wont pick up a woman because she can feel like youre trying to pick her up, or 2) you get REALLY good at saying the right thing to disarm her natural defenses, and manipulate her into sleeping with youbut not only does this feel shitty for you (and her) at the end of the night, but its a LOT of work! But as you let go of your expectations of trying to pick-up women or get them to respond in a certain way to you through external means, you become MORE attractiveANDyou become MORE attracted to women. Your ability to FEEL becomes heightened, you become more sensitive to your environment, and the amount of connection that you can have with women becomes exponentially higher. This is because as you let go of expectations, you give yourself an opportunity to need nothing from women and live in a state of unconditional love. This is very attractive to women, and feels very good for you. **Principle #2  Handling Insecurities and Processing Emotions** When a man lets go of his expectations of trying to do anything specific with women (like pick them up, try to sleep with them, or figure out how to ask them on a date), it puts him into a state of raw vulnerability. As his expectations leave, his ego leaves. His heart starts to open and he will start to feel emotions that have been buried up for years. This process can be scary and very confusing. Expectations in the dating game, from a core level, are created when there is a feeling of fear underneath. An insecurity. This could show up as feeling like you arent worthy of love, feeling like youre doing something wrong, feeling like you arent enough. They are also created from past relationships when things ended badly, or if there are misunderstandings about yourself or women in general. Its beyond the scope of the article to go into detail into why those expectations are created, however what you need to know for now is that as you release expectations, or as they get broken, the insecurities that created those expectations will surface. Its important to stay with your emotions and feel them in the moment as they arise. Like I said, this can be extremely confusing. How to navigate your emotions is highly situational and circumstantialand its not something I can cover in one article. **Principle #3  Trust** Finally, when a man is releasing his expectations and staying current with his emotions, the final part to upgrading his energy and gravitational field is to TRUST. Because it is vulnerable to not have any expectations with women, it can seem like initially that youre getting further and further away from women. Let this process unfold, and stay trusting that once things settle and the insecurities underneath the expectations are handled, women will be attracted to you more than ever. Its important to know that as a man continues to let go of his expectations and address his insecurities, all of the typical dating problems fall out the window. You dont have to think about whens the right time to text her. You dont have to think about whats the right thing to say. You dont have to try to be confident. You just have to beyou. Your gravitational field will upgrade moment after moment, and at a certain point, a woman will come into your orbit like I demonstrated in the stories at the beginning of this article. The beautiful thing about this methodology is that when a woman comes into your orbit in this way, the bond between you is based on your GRAVITY. Its based on reality without any external effort from you. When that happens, you can viscerally feel and know when theres chemistry between you and a woman. You can know that when you feel that chemistry its not because youre trying to force it, but because the woman is actually attracted to you for who you are, and not what youre saying or youre doing. Thats why in my example above I could just text the girl one line to meet up, and she met me there. No pickup lines or anything fancy. I could feel the energy between us and it was undeniable. That feeling is based on the energy of who you two ARE, and that is impossible to fake or lie about when you sense it. Watch the video below for a visual representation of how this works. [Anti-Method Visual Explanation](URL **Putting The Anti-Method Into Practice** The following exercise is something that you can go do immediately to start understanding how your energy affects your environment. Keep in mind that this isnt a one-off exercise. This is a continual practice that shows better results over time. The more you do this and the more you gain an awareness of the energetic dynamics, the more natural this process will become and it will eventually become a habit. **Step 1.** Go to a public place  a coffee shop, a strip mall, a friends party, a bar, etc. **Step 2.** Find a place in the middle, or a place that has the highest traffic. For instance, when I went to the bar with my friend, we stood right in the middle where the most people walk/hang out at. The reason for this is that in the spot with the most attention you can gain more awareness to the expectations in your field, that once broken, would expand your field of gravity. **Step 3.** Make a choice to yourself that although you could leave this spot, you want to stay put and do nothing. The reason for this is that when youre continually moving, its hard to see what your orbit is looking like and very difficult to sense what youre gravitational field is doing. **Step 4.** Wait. Do nothing. Notice the places in which youre drawn to do something externally  like talk to someone, get a drink, go to the bathroom, check your phone, and start to notice the place in yourself in which thats coming from. Its very easy to rationalize I need to get another drink but if you pay attention to your emotional state, youll start to be able to see that it could be a coping mechanism to prevent yourself from feeling awkward or anxious. The rationalizations are a clue that expectations are in your field  the very things that are stifling your attractiveness. Rather than avoiding them, stay in the same spot and see what emotions come up underneath. **Step 5.** This is where things may start to get uncomfortable, as the insecurities in your body will start to surface. Do you feel anxious being around people? Are you afraid that people are looking at you? Afraid that you might be creepy? Whats there? Start to examine your fears with a lens of objectivity, and let yourself feel anxious, nervous, fearful, sad, angry, whatever comes up. Sit in that emotion for a while. **Step 6.** Hold your ground and stay in your spot. People may try to push you around and get you to move off center or something may try and distract you. This means that its working, stay with it, and dont move off your center. **Step 7.** As youre feeling whatever emotions are coming up, continue to let yourself feel them until your body relaxes. This usually comes right after youre feeling the most awkward, anxious, sad, whateverwhich is why its important to stay in it. But at a certain point, youll feel an energetic pop or simply feel more relaxed, or at the very least more present, even if its just a tiny bit. **Step 8.** Now that youre present and current with your emotions, you can go with the flow and follow your natural desires. If you want to talk to someone, talk to them. If you want to go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom. If you want to grab a drink, grab a drink, whatever. Youll start to notice whos orbiting around you. If you think of yourself like the Sun, different people will start to sit around you, chat it up with you, interact with you. At this point simply be yourself, remain open, and go with the flow. **Step 9.** If a woman comes into your space and youre talking with her, just be yourself without any type of agenda or expectation on what your connection with her may look like. The mindset around this if youre wanting to attract a woman is the one of well see what happens. **Step 10.** If theres an opening, feel free to take it if youre digging her. Over time youll learn to sense the energy of the woman  if shes attracted to you, if shes trying to play games with you, if shes open to connecting with you. A woman might just bounce and leave your orbit, but if shes sticking around shell make it pretty obvious if she wants to keep hanging out. She may invite you somewhere, ask you what youre up to later, give you her phone number, etc. Just relax, take it easy, and take the opportunities if youd like to connect further with her (again without expectation). That being said, women have different energies that can be hard to read. If you stay in the realm of observing and paying attention, through your experiences you can begin to feel out what a woman is saying to you with her energy. **Step 11.** Thats it. Continually practice  this is a continual process as there are always more fears and expectations that are coming up. Its a practice that once ingrained in your habitual structure will provide massive amounts of love and connection in your life. **What To Do From Here** After applying this method over and over again, women will start to become attracted to you in various ways. Some will feel friendly, others will feel attracted to you, others will feel overbearing, others will feel uncomfortable. Youll start to notice a lot of different behaviors with women. But when it comes to connecting further, keep apply the same methodology. Remain stable, release your expectations, feel whats underneath, act when things pop, and notice what happens in your orbit. Dont worry about what to do say, or over-think your actions. When youre working on your energy with the Anti-Method, your being speaks for itself. If you want to ask a girl out, do it. If you want to text a girl, do it. Dont worry about the how. Your experiences from this point on will dictate how women respond, and as long as you stay with the process, youll start getting positive feedback from women. TLDR; If you learn how to properly shift your internal state by understanding the energetics of dating, dating will become easier and easier as you won't get flaked on, get rejected, etc. Read from 'How To Upgrade Your Energy' for the how-to, but the stuff above that is helpful to understand what's going on with masculine/feminine dynamics. TLDR2; Do nothing. Feel your emotions (anxiety, anger, awkwardness) until they ""pop"". Release expectations. Get approached. Have a good time. EDIT: First of all, thank you all for chiming in your perspectives in the comments. I'm glad to see that this is making sense to a lot of people, and helping men understand previous experiences that have went very well for them. I can also see how this can be confusing, or not much make sense at all, or seem ""woo woo"" or whatever. I've gotten a lot of comments and messages asking for help - asking for certain advice, how to apply this in certain situations, how it works in general, etc...and so I've decided to launch a private Facebook group for the men who want support with this further, and to join a tribe of guys who are on the same journey of them to go at it together. If you'd like to join, feel free to stop by, chime in, share your experiences, ask questions, and grow. Here's the link to join us: [The Anti-Method Private FB Group](URL Cheers, Max"
165,vulnerability,seduction,A Valid Criticism of Models: Attract Women Through Honesty by Mark Manson!,0,5pwz1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5pwz1n/a_valid_criticism_of_models_attract_women_through/,2017-01-25 03:14:14,"Hello I can across an article that criticize models by Mark Manson, the author of this article does address several points that Mark needs to address. Below is the article I copied and pasted here. If you like to check the original article, here is a link: URL His piece on neediness in dating does not look good. I mean, pretty much everything in it is wrong or incoherent. He starts off: &gt;There have been a number of discussions on the forums in recent weeks on the subject of neediness. In my book, I formulate a theory that defines non-neediness as the source of all attractive behavior in men. Unfortunately, I think some readers (judging by the threads on the board) are making one of two mistakes: 1) misunderstanding what non-neediness is and how to attain it and 2) trying to use it as yet another measuring stick for success (i.e., treating it as yet another magic pill for their problems  I will get into the ironies of this in a minute).&gt; Lets keep these criteria in mind when were reading the rest of this article  for this article to have not been worthless Manson needs to: clearly outline what non-neediness is and how to attain it, and explain why it shouldnt be used as a measuring stick for success. However the problems already start here  the first mistake is in fact two separate mistakes (misunderstanding what non-neediness is and misunderstanding how to attain non-neediness are two separate mistakes), and he incorrectly says that the using of non-neediness as a measuring stick for success either entails or is conceptually identical to the treating of non-neediness as a quick fix for problems  but neither of these are true, because it is logically possible for the criteria used to assess the results the method produces and the method itself to be both conceptually different and not logically linked in the way described (the criteria for success might be number of girls slept with, and the method might be show vulnerability  these arent conceptually identical and of course doing one does not entail the other  even if the criteria for success were amount of vulnerability shown). So Manson continues: &gt;In Models, I define neediness within romantic and social relationships as prioritizing another persons perception of you over your perception of yourself, and that this prioritization leads to all unattractive behavior in men, whether directly or indirectly. So, when talking to an attractive woman, a needy man will expend his effort trying to piece together what her perception of him is and cater his behavior to what he thinks she wants, whereas a non-needy man will focus on what his perception of her is.&gt; Jesus Christ. I mean, sorry, but how can Mark actually bring himself to publish this shit? The glaring contradiction is painful. In the first sentence, Mark says that neediness is prioritising another persons perception of you over your perception of yourself, and presumably non-neediness is the opposite,**prioritising your perception of yourself ** over another persons perception of you. In the second sentence, Mark says that a non-needy man will **prioritise his perception of another person** over another persons perception of him. So he is defining non-neediness differently here; he cant even stay consistent over the course of two sentences! It doesnt stop there: &gt;There are two ways in which men can become needy: by undervaluing themselves or by overvaluing the person with whom theyre interacting.&gt; When people write they really must think about the argumentative support the claims they make will need. Manson is claiming that undervaluing oneself or overvaluing the other person causes a prioritisation of the other persons perception of yourself over your own perception of yourself (lets take the first definition, why dont we; the second would still do). Issues abound. What is prioritisation in the sense he means it? He never explains. Could prioritising A over B mean that one is valuing A more than B? Could it mean thinking more about A than B? Both seem like plausible views to attribute to Mark here, but he never explains what kind of prioritising were talking about. Another problem  what kind of value are we talking about here? Intrinsic value? Extrinsic value? Final or nonfinal value?* We need to know this, but Mark is keeping quiet. How do we know hes not equivocating between different types of value? And even if not, the strength of his argument here is dependent on which type of value hes talking about; if were talking about nonfinal instrumental value, then it certainly doesnt follow that because I perceive my instrumental value to be lower than it actually is, I prioritise another persons perception of myself (whatever this means) over my own perception of myself. This is an glaringly obvious non-sequitur. We run into further difficulties if we define perception of oneself as view of ones own value (however characterised); how, exactly, could my view of my own instrumental (for instance) value as being lower than it actually is necessarily lead to a rejection of views of my own value in favour of anothers views of my own value? This isnt at all obvious. For someone whose stated aim with regards to this article is to clarify what non-neediness is, there doesnt seem to be a whole lot (actually, none at all) of clarification concerning the terms Manson uses to explain his concept of neediness. But wait theres more: &gt;An example of [becoming needy by undervaluing oneself] would be a man with low self-esteem who feels a severe lack of confidence interacting with women (or anybody, really), and therefore has developed bizarre beliefs about why people would or would not like him. As such, he believes he needs to impress them with money or accomplishments, make fun of others, or pretend like hes too cool for anyone else. As a result, these beliefs manifest themselves as needy behaviors and turn off many women.&gt; It seems odd that Manson is calling beliefs about the reasons why people do or do not like you bizarre. Beliefs about why people like you arent necessarily irrational  Mark has beliefs about why people like others but he would surely not call them bizarre. But maybe its not the holding of a belief per se but the specific beliefs that [you need] to impress [people] with money or accomplishments, make fun of others, or pretend like [you are] too cool for anyone else that are bizarre (which in this sense probably just means incorrect). I disagree  accomplishments surely do impress people in the relevant fields; if I am Usain Bolt and run 100m in 9.5 seconds, then surely that would impress many people, even those with only a weak interest in running. Perhaps one could rescue Marks argument somewhat by distinguishing between being impressed with the person qua achiever and valuing the person qua achiever, and claiming that the latter isnt entailed by the former. Im not sure how separate they are though  to say that they are separate would require the possibility of being positively affected by something and as a result not coming to value that thing in any way. But the worst thing in this paragraph of Marks is that there is yet another non sequitur  it doesnt follow that undervaluing oneself would lead to these behaviours, in whichever sense of the term value. I could perceive myself as having lower instrumental value as a dating catch than I actually am, but it doesnt follow that I think my own instrumental value as a dating catch, abstracted from things like my accomplishments or the amount of money I earn, is not high enough to convince a particular woman to have sex with me. &gt;So now that weve got kind of a better understanding of neediness and how it relates to mens behavior&gt; Just lol. &gt;We all look for validation from those around us. We all care about what other people think to a certain degree. And barring sociopaths, we always will. The goal here is NOT to ELIMINATE neediness from our lives  its impossible to do this without completely gutting ourselves of all emotions or empathy  the goal here is to re-prioritize our perception of ourselves vis-a-vis the perceptions of the women we interact with.&gt; At this point Mark is making life difficult for himself. Elsewhere Mark defines validation as: &gt;Validation is the information we receive about our identities or who we are as a person. We all adopt identities and beliefs about ourselves and then we seek validation to reinforce and prove those identities and beliefs to ourselves. We all do it. And theres nothing necessarily wrong with it.&gt;  and external validation (which is what hes talking about in this neediness post) as: &gt;External Validation  The approval and admiration of others.&gt; On the overall definition of validation given theres no reason to believe that validation received from external sources would be positive forms of information like approval and admiration  information we receive about our identities might take negative form; that people do not approve of our identity and we are not admired for it, so Mansons definition of external validation seems off. It certainly isnt the fact the information is received externally which makes the information take a positive form. So Mansons definitions of validation and external validation, taken together, dont make sense. To return to the neediness article, we are then treated with another gargantuan non-sequitur; eliminating neediness (in Mansons view misprioritisation) from our lives requires gutting ourselves of all emotions and empathy? I dont see how this follows. Perhaps we could save Manson here and grant him a few implicit premises  perhaps this is the work that the concept of validation is doing here; neediness means seeking validation (so nothing to do with prioritising, then?), and you cant have emotions or empathy without validation-seeking, so getting rid of neediness means not having emotions or empathy. But this sounds totally off the wall  how does having emotions or empathy require seeking approval and admiration from others? I simply dont see any link between the two. Anyway, Manson never bothers to delve into this link, so the premise (you cant have emotions or empathy without validation-seeking) is unsound until he can explain how there is a link here. I can barely bring myself to go on here, but: &gt;But heres the irony, and something that may blow your mind: The act of analyzing ones own neediness while talking to a woman is, in itself, a needy behavior. Stop it.&gt; Erm doesnt this follow the exact standard of non-neediness which Manson prescribes, that one should prioritise ones perception of oneself over others perceptions of yourself? Surely if you werent in this case, you wouldnt care whether you were being needy, because that would be up to the other person to decide. So the act of analysing ones own neediness while talking to a woman is actually non-needy behaviour by Mansons definition. It gets worse: &gt;Stop trying to quantify and maximize everything.&gt; What? What relevance does this have to anything else Manson wrote? &gt;Practicing the proper behaviors reduces your neediness. Its not a coincidence that I dedicated the majority of the book to it.&gt; ??? Practicing non-needy behaviours reduces mispriortisation. Didnt he just say that proper valuation causes reduced neediness, not the practicing of behaviours (by which Manson surely means being honest, escalating confidently etc.)? Maybe we have an instance of multiple causality, with two sufficient conditions for (non-)neediness. Unfortunately, Manson never mentioned this further cause earlier on in the article, so the implication is that he doesnt regard it as a further cause, and this is stupid. &gt;Non-neediness is an experience, a feeling, a perspective. Its not something you can maximize or measure.&gt; Surely it is measureable  otherwise how can you compare levels of neediness within the same agent? I could maximise it by (under the Mansonian definition) prioritising my own perception of myself as much as possible over the womans perception of me. I couldnt quantify neediness levels, perhaps, but I could measure it relative to other situations where I felt more or less needy. &gt;That simple change in mindset and self-perception silently seeps into all of your actions and words, affecting everything, without thought or effort.&gt; One must necessarily have thoughts to have a mindset. &gt;Its no coincidence that soon after having that experience, he landed a hot girlfriend.&gt; Heres to anecdotal evidence. &gt;Any action or behavior can be needy or non-needy. What determines the degree of neediness is the intention behind the behavior. I can go out and approach 20 hot women for the sheer joy of it and not be needy with any of them. Or I can sit in a nightclub at a VIP table with $500 bottles of vodka and have 20 women approach me that night and be exhibiting extremely needy behavior the entire night.&gt; These two examples are so different in ways which dont concern intentions that they just dont support the claim that any action or behaviour can be (non-)needy. Furthermore, any behaviour can be (non-)needy contradicts what Manson said earlier  he thinks there are determinate non-needy behaviours to practice, regardless of the intention behind those behaviours (otherwise they wouldnt necessarily be non-needy behaviours, and it would only be practicing the intention behind them that mattered). &gt;And if that doesnt make sense to you, then you really need to read the damn book.&gt; It doesnt make sense to me, and I doubt that there will be much, if anything, in the book which corrects these errors. *See G.E. Moores Principia Ethica (1903) for the Intrinsic/Extrinsic distinction, and Korsgaards Two Distinctions in Goodness (1983) for more on that distinction and the Final/Nonfinal distinction.

Recently I've made strides in my life. I hope to be an entrepreneur and engraining a tough, no excuses mind-set is something I've really been developing. I've lost interest in things such as video games and have grown a natural interest in acheiving greatness. As the saying goes, winning is addictive. The expense of this mind-set is I've lost my vulnerability, my ""soft-side"",my ability to relate, whatever you want to call it. It makes it hard to open up and relate to people when I've engrained in my mind that doing what others won't is what is necessary for greatness. I value being genuine/honest to others, but at the same time, it's tough to be blunt with people and tell them they are being whiny/making excuses without coming off as a dick. I've become the stereotypical ""business/ sales guy"" who is driven, always is working overtime to hit the get the job done, and thrives off achievement. I know this is a skill/side of me I need to master if I'm gonna have any success with women. Women, by in large(not all of them), are emotional people. Learning to connect with their emotions is something I really want to do but I just don't know where to start. How do I become more vulnerable and relatable with people? Tl;Dr: I suck at being vulnerable and really connecting with people on an emotional level and I know I need to do this be successful with women.

Had 2 long term relationships (five years and one year) despite being quite the social disaster (absolutely no social life, no friends, excluding a couple of people I see about twice a year) In this in between-period of being graduated and getting employed, recently being dumped by my second girlfriend, last week Ive decided to go full Don Giovanni-mode seduction. The first week was terrible. All I did was avoid my empty plans to explore some place (libraries, malls) to turn into my hunting ground. **Actual Field Report:** Today was my first approach, mind the apostrophes. I gathered my balls and visited the city library. In the cafeteria of which I found a terribly attractive girl. She mustve been about 20, petite, pale skin, blushy cheeks, midldly freckled, delicate yet perfectly curved, clear blue eyes, delightful semi-messy bun perfectly leaving just a couple of loose hair strands on her neck and the sides of her face, she looked delicious. She wore tight black jeans and a loose purple sweater, revealing a bright red band of her bra on her shoulder, introducing the slightest suggestion of naughtiness to her otherwise very well-behaved schoolgirl style. She was sitting there all by herself, dreaming, occasionally writing something in her small pocket agenda. It fascinated me that during the whole time, she never checked any device or phone or whatever, which is becoming rather rare in the city where I live, these days. I entered the cafeteria and sat down at the table in front of her, facing her. She started eyeballing me from the start. Inexperienced and scared as fuck, as I am, not knowing what to do, I took my notebook and started writing like a madman about the feelings I was experiencing, trying to pull some troubled mysterious-artist-writer persona. I ended up writing two pages of exclamations to myself approach her, do something, you lunatic, shes staring at you, she wants you, christ, shes beautiful, and so on, and so on. It worked! Her hamster was obviously going wild wondering what I was writing about. I caught her glancing at me several times during the twenty minutes I was drinking my cup of joe. Hell, I was writing so vigorously many people in the cafeteria were staring at me with fascination comparable to hers. I think she really wanted me to approach her. I think something in her even begged for it. But I didnt move, I just kept writing. I knew I had to do something, but I couldnt do it. Way past any 3-second or 3-minute rule, I just sat there until she got up to pay for her ice tea. I sprang into action, payed for my coffee and literally chased her on the library stairs, in my head: slow enough not to seem like a creepy stalker, in reality: too slow, making me seem like a creepy stalker. Now, for the grand finale, she sat down in some silent zone of the library to continue reading her book. I hesitate but decide to go and sit next to her. To cherrytop this cake of creepiness and failure, I went wrote her a small note saying &gt;Hi, I wanted to start a conversation with you in the librarycafetaria, but you got away (didnt you notice I came after you when you got up to pay?). I think you look awful cute and I found it intriguing that you dont watch some device every two minutes like so many other girls. Id like to get to know you! Send me a text, 1234 / 56 78 91 , my name is milleetre."" When I gave her the note she looked disappointed. I shattered her dreams of being approached by me, with balls attached, the fantasy me she had in her mind back in the cafetaria. I gave her a stupid note. Of course she wont text or call me. Mission failed. **Obvious lessons learned:** 1] Dont hesitate. Dont stare. 3 second rule. 2] Dont seem creepy or desperate by literal chasing people around. 3] Notes are a terrible idea. To girls, and cute girls in particular, they are no different from the creepy messages they get on digital platforms all the time. They are like male glances in the street, they are easy, they get spammed with them, they dont make you stand out and therefore have next to none seductive value. It doesnt take any balls or display of vulnerability to write a note or a message, just as it doesnt take any balls or vulnerability to stare at a girl in the streets. **If it doesnt take balls, if anyone can do it, she wont be impressed.** "

Remember, being an expert at seduction does not mean you're an expert at relationships. The reason I'm saying this is because I really screwed up big time with a girl I really liked because I didn't know how relationships worked. I made a post awhile back about this girl I asked out: URL Well, that actually led me to a relationship with her. She was super cool, laid back, and we had a great time. But then, I broke up with her after 3 months of dating for reasons I didn't exactly know why. I stayed single for 1 month and it was great. Then I started to miss her. Then I tried to get back together with her, but she had made plans with her ex. I could tell she didn't really want to be in that relationship, and eventually she broke up with him and started talking to me again. This was great because I wanted to get back with her. Eventually, she ended the relationship again. Why? Because I had no idea what a relationship was. What I realized was, I was quite selfish. She said that it didn't feel like a relationship. More like friends with benefits. She had problems and issues that she didn't feel comfortable sharing with me and she said that I just wanted sex. Now, I'm not saying that this is all true because I didn't just want sex. It was very nice and I could just be ranting off here, but really, that's what she felt like it was all about. Just because I thought I knew what I was doing doesn't always mean she's going to think the same way. What I'm trying to say here is, if any of you are having trouble keeping a girl around and don't know why you feel like it's not working, you might have no idea what a relationship consists of. Don't go down the same road as me if you really like a girl you've met. Understand that seduction only lasts for so long and once you begin a relationship, things start to change. She's going to pick up on things. Women are not stupid. They can sense your intentions and pick up on stuff you didn't realize what you were doing and if she never decides to tell you these things, you're going to be very confused in your future relationships with women. So to wrap this up, Seduction and Relationships are different. If you need advice or would like to know more, I recommend that all of you who want to bring women into your life research the study on relationships. This involves being a better listener, expressing vulnerability, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to read a book like [Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus](URL to give you a brief idea on how women act, how they hear and say things differently, and what they value in a man. If you haven't read [Models](URL by Mark Manson yet, it's definitely worth reading. ##Any questions, please ask."

Youll plan ahead, procrastinate and then re-plan and then procrastinate again, and then decide you need to read this book a couple more times -- all because youre scared to death of that vulnerability. Maybe youve already been through this. Maybe youve already spent months or years avoiding taking action because youre afraid of the consequences. Maybe youve put off that career change, that wardrobe upgrade, joining that dating site. Maybe youve missed opportunities with women who liked you because you were too afraid to make a move.

And the less vulnerable youve let yourself be throughout your life, the harder its going to be to start. But slowly, you will chisel away at yourself. Youll humble yourself, expose yourself, and then learn that its OK. Its OK to be rejected. Its OK to make mistakes. Its OK to say something stupid. Women will not dislike you for your rejections and mistakes or saying something stupid. Theyll like you for your ability to be OK with being rejected, to make mistakes, and to say something stupid. The man who always has the perfect line to say to her is a man she will not trust. Because he shows no vulnerability and his words are inauthentic and therefore needy. The man who has some good lines and some bad lines and is able to admit the latter and laugh at the former, this is a man she will trust and a man she will open herself up to, both emotionally and physically. Thats because a man who becomes comfortable with his vulnerability becomes the opposite of needy. If neediness is prioritizing others perceptions about you over your own, then vulnerability is the exact opposite. Being vulnerable forces you to accept and prioritize your own perception over those of others. Why? Because you have no choice. As you make yourself vulnerable, you will experience rejection. And as you experience rejection, you will be forced to upgrade your own sense of self worth. Theres no other option. Slowly, but surely youll chisel a Dont Give a Fuck attitude out of yourself that is genuine yet giving at the same time."""
179,vulnerability,seduction,Conquering the Shit Test,4,5742d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/5742d7/conquering_the_shit_test/,2016-10-13 00:32:48,"Just the name of it doesnt sound too good, does it? A shit test is where a woman challenges or questions a man on his behaviour; or tries to elicit what his core values are through (often kinda mean) questions, during seduction, courting and dating. I bet this sounds like a lot of trouble to you; like something you wouldnt want to have to deal with when youre just trying to take a girl out on a date, or when youve just got home from work. This is why so many times when men get hit with the shit test they react negatively to what they see as a woman using catty remarks to keep a scorecard on them. But what if I was to tell you that the shit test is really just a strong indicator of a womans feelings of vulnerability about herself and attraction towards you? The problem is most guys dont realise that when a woman is slinging all these challenges at them shes not trying to be a bitch by doing it, and that theyre not being a chump for putting up with it. Yes it can be a way of sorting out the men from the pussies and testing that youre a guy worthy of her: yes it can be a way of her saying, Im queen of this litter and I have the power to choose. But thats only half the story. The other (most important) half is that shit tests can show that a woman is attracted to you; and that she feels vulnerable about that attraction. A woman will use a shit test as a way of seeing if youre a man that will stand by her and accept her: warts and all. Whilst you see her as the prettiest, smartest, girl at the party throwing road blocks at you with remarks like: Im thirsty: I cant talk with a man until he buys me a drink. I wish I was hot/ young/ slim/ pretty like that waitress. Shes beautiful, dont you think? Youre far too charming. I think you must be quite the player. Do you want me to tell that joke again more slowly? Youre a little slow, arent you? A lot of the time these mean remarks are just hiding her insecurities about whether youll stick around when shes got no make-up on and has morning breath. Sometimes consciously, sometimes subconsciously, shes testing your attraction and commitment to her. She wants to know that youll still adore her, above all the other girls, when you hit the inevitable trials a relationship throws up later on. Most PUAs would tell you to change the subject if she shit tests you. Thats great if you want a fast route into her pants: but real, long lasting attraction is about being able to be take the strong, masculine position and reassure her, Its ok, calm down, youre amazing just as you are. Keep your tone of voice confident, and this isnt being weak: this is being strong and smart. You need to understand that shes not angry at you when she snaps at you for not remembering the shopping, or glares at you for catching the waitresss eye. These shit tests, that come later on in the dating stage, are an expression of her own insecurities. A guys just got to realise that moment is about her, not about you. Women sometimes dont even recognize their own needs until they creep up on us at a moment where were maybe not feeling that attractive ourselves. Our needs could be for love, passion or just remembering to send her a text to say goodnight. What seems like a minor offence to you, like sneaking a peak at a pretty blondes butt, can turn into a major crime when combined with a womans own insecurities that can be tough to control. Even after the initial moment of a shit test has passed, we can keep acting worse and worse even after the initial crisis has been solved. To a guys mind you may think Why is she still mad? I thought we dealt with that problem whilst the woman still feels emotional about the fact she let you see some her vulnerability, and that shes not perfect. This can create a pretty negative cycle of arguments which Im sure all of us can relate to. The best thing a guy can do in this case is to offer the woman some security through his masculine presence: dont try and rationalise everything that she does but have the strength to give stability where shes feeling unstable. Often the best way to do this is just to hold her. Even the shit test lines you get earlier on in courting and dating can often be handled the same way:  By not reacting negatively, but by being assured enough in yourself, that you can provide support to her.  By having that strength of masculine presence to resist the challenges she throws at you.  By seeing her catty remarks as a way of inciting sexual tension and desire in a man shes considering as a partner.  By being James Bond cool, collected, and confident enough to turn her negative emotions into positive examples of your masculinity. Here are some great examples of how you could turn around the shit tests she said to you earlier, into great ways to demonstrate how attractive you are as a man: I was about to get you a drink, but I didnt want you to think I wanted to get you drunk. I quite like you just like this, actually. The waitress is okay (then look at her like with desire), but youre the hottest girl here (watch her blush) Of course Im a player, just looking for the right woman to reform me. I guess Ill just have to prove you wrong about how smart I am though when we have our first date next week. Just remember, if you can maintain the strong, masculine position in her life whilst she momentarily loses control through a catty remark, or has a full blown melt down, it will not only stabilise your bond with her but will create more attraction. Recognise that shit tests often come from her vulnerabilities, and not your mistakes. Sail over these obstacles and shell find you even sexier. "

""Be a leader of men""- I hear this phrase often and it always comes down to providing value. What does this mean in the context of game? Provide value how? I might be doing this already but not aware of what is valuable to a girl and what isn't. 2. Neediness- on this subreddit I see this topic covered frequently but most of the advice is geared towards curing the symptom not the cause. I am not a constant texter and typically avoid needy behavior but I still feel like I need the validation and affection from women. This is despite having a great career, being in shape, having a good social life and staying occupied at least a decent amount of the time. I guess my question is how do you get over the need for validation from women when other areas in your life are handled? Thanks all! "

But how do you get to the point where you start being vulnerable? You can't just open with ""Hi I'm Bill and *insert vulnerability*"". First you need to have good opening technique (and not just a ""firm handshake""), get her interested so she will not cut you off with ""I am in a rush/BF/not interested etc"" and THEN you can maybe start with some real shit. Even then I find there needs to be some warmup conversation (not small talk) before getting real and that can take a few minutes in which you can strike out in a million of ways Mark does not bother mentioning.

182,vulnerability,seduction,My technique and the theory behind it (still in it's infancy but field tested),3,52g3df,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/52g3df/my_technique_and_the_theory_behind_it_still_in/,2016-09-13 05:14:41,"I'm not exactly sure how to word this yet and might rewrite this later. I'm basically winging this based on what's worked for me and why I think it worked. Ok, so there's a few things to consider about human behavior before I get into the technique. One, humans look for traits in others which they either lack, or have lost touch with. Note that we live in a society where stoicism and acting ""mature"" are stressed to an absurd degree. Essentially, most people have lost touch with their inner-child and cares more about being perceived as smart or sexy than they do about having fun, which I attribute to the inner child. Second, if you won't commit, people will do anything to try and get you too. I don't use this manipulatively (though people who exhibit anti-social (as in cluster B) behavior do). I do this because I got seriously hurt by someone and I'm scared of commitment, and also because I missed out on sex as a teenager/young-adult and I'm playing catch-up. Third, we are obsessed with traditional ""masculinity"" and ""femininity"", men define themselves by what they think women want and women define themselves by what they think men want. We all care too much. Fourth, women can instinctively tell when you give a shit about sleeping with them and this makes you boring to them. So, the technique is simple. In a world where people are longing to connect with their inner-child, are more obsessed with image than having fun and surrounded by members of the opposite sex who are basically all acting the same based on societal expectations, you simply have to subvert these expectations to appear attractive. I am a man, and this involves going against all advice given to men and what we perceive as masculinity. Acting young at heart, unconcerned with other peoples opinions, goofy, but doing it with confidence literally makes you magnetic to women. The dance floor and it's non-verbal communication are a perfect example. I can be surrounded by dudes with very practiced dance moves and carefully crafted masculine looks, yet when I hit that dance floor and dance around like a complete goof, women always try to dance with me. Part of the attraction, is the women picking up on my lack of concern for what the other men think, I've been laughed at and have just not cared, I just keep dancing and try to enjoy myself. I also really don't care if women sleep with me, which makes them very comfortable around me because they can tell, and also makes them want to make me want to sleep with them. I'm filling in what they themselves lack, and they want to be around me because finding that in another person feels the same as getting in touch with these traits themselves. They want to define themselves through me. Sidenote, most people are insecure and look to define themselves through external sources, but internal validation is the only way to break out of this. I also exhibit extreme confidence by breaking every social rule for men and having a blast doing it. I imagine this triggers confusing. Sort of ""who's right here?"" ""he's not doing what he's supposed to but he's the only dude having fun and not giving off a vibe of just wanting to get laid"". Also, all psychology aside, I am having FUN, real fun, and I'll have fun regardless of whether I get laid, and women really dig that. Pander to them, and they have the upper hand. Focus on having fun, and they become the ones trying to prove something to you. Something which makes them uncomfortable, but is also different and breaks the monotonous cycle of bar interactions. Okay, now for what to do at a bar. First, DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANY GIRLS WHEN YOU FIRST ENTER. I don't care how hot the girl is or if she checks you out. You are creating mystique and fostering an image of independence and also signalling that you have options and will not submit to them for sex. Then, you can go one of two ways. If you're dancing, go out there and have a blast, get lost in the music, even if you suck at dancing, girls will really dig it. Everyone on that dance floor is trying to be the best dancer, and is casting sideways glances or laughing at anyone who doesn't dance traditionally. This comes from insecurity and a lack of confidence, and by doing this the men are actually making you more desireable by signalling their insecurity, and you will be exuding confidence when you don't care. This takes time but can be accomplished in one night if you stick it out. You will feel judged and you'll wanna stop dancing but if you keep going, remind yourself that you're free to do what you want, you'll eventually drop into a rhythm and start dancing like a loon, then you're golden. Never commit to anyone at the bar. If they wanna dance, dance with them, spin them, talk with them a bit (note:say whatever you want and be exuberant in doing so, it's not an act, you'll actually feel exuberant and elated once you release yourself from social ""laws"" regarding interactions) and then move on. This works in two ways, one you don't hitch your wagon to one girl which gives you options, and two this causes them to want to compete for you. Note, if the dance floor is empty, be the first one out there, girls fuckin love it, once again, you DO NOT at all have to be a good dancer. Ok, if you're at a non-dancing bar or place. You wanna follow the same first step as above, ignore everyone for at least 30 minutes, the more you do this the better. Sit at the bar and study people or examine the decor, but do not focus on people. (You might have to go the bar alone for this technique to work. you get used to it.) Then you want to walk around the bar and start interesting conversations. Ask strange questions is the way to do this. ""What's your favorite childhood memory/color/president"", you can say whatever you want and they will dig it because they've dealt with the same boring conversations for years, and it's exciting. It can be hard to segway from this into real conversation, so always be ready to bail, otherwise she will start signalling disinterest, and regaining that interest will be a hell of a battle, and not at all worth it in my opinion. Move around the room talking to everyone and anyone. Be fun, spontaneous and outgoing. Note, that this will trigger resentment and competitiveness in men and they probably won't want to talk to you, and if they do, they might try to passive aggressively put you down. Almost every man their is trying to get laid and they take your actions, and the positive reactions you produce in women, as a mockery of their masculinity and superficial seduction techniques. You will be a pariah among the men, but a prize to the women, this is very stressful at first. Men will go after every girl you've been talking to (still can't figure this one out but whenever I leave a girl to talk to someone else, someone almost always starts talking to her withing five minutes, which brings me to another point, be ready to lose any woman and don't care, sometimes they'll be doing it to try and get your attention back and other times you might just lose them to someone else. DO not get your pride involved, it doesn't matter), I've also had men literally crowd around me and separate me from a girl at concerts, bump me while dancing. Women with boyfriends will also engage in this as an extension of their boyfriend. They want to be the sexiest things in their and they use their unavailability to instill jealousy in others. You will steal the show from them and they will do ANYTHING to get you to pay attention to them or to stop you from doing this attractive behavior. These are usually narcissists and codependents or, who are defining themselves through eachother, meaning they need others to want their mate so that they can maintain the grandiose image they have of their partners and thus reinforce their own self-worth, since they define themselves through this person. Ok, but back to the talk-strategy. Basically talk to a lot of girls, even unattractive ones and do it to make good conversation, lest you give off a vibe of someone just trying to get laid. This is a fine balance, and if you tip into being seen as someone who's trying to get laid, which you will notice in the way the women are reacting, then you should leave and go somewhere else. Remember the women that were the most fun to talk to and whom turned you on the most, be on the lookout for superficial charm (think sirens calling men to shipwreck in ancient greek lore) and women who seem to give smug looks to other women once they have your attention. If there's music on and no one's dancing, dance your way over in between women, they'll dig it hard. Note that women you've talked to, and some you haven't, will be trying to get your attention during this, they'll poke you, smile at you, or find someone else to talk to while glancing your way over and over again. If anyone rejects you harshly (some women go to the bar just to do this. An okcupid study showed that men will actually pay for a date with someone who rejected them harshly while they wouldn't do the same to someone who did it compassionately. Some women either instinctively, or consciously know this and use it to their advantage. This is your masculine pride again. Eventually you won't even feel it when they brush you off harshly), you ignore them, they will try to get your attention back but you'll be done with this person, you don't want their attention, you don't want to sleep with, they are trouble and you are done with them. The idea is that, in doing this, you'll find someone you really click with and you'll have a great conversation with them, and the fact that you're not pressuring them to sleep with you, will actually make them want to do so, but you'll also almost always have to make the first move once they signal sexual interest in you. If this doesn't work, you're in trouble honestly. You have three options. You will be the most interesting, attractive, confident man in the bar. But you can still blow it all by over-investing in someone or showing sexual interest. Women will also have conflicting feelings, torn between resenting you for making them feel jealous and just wanting your attention, flipping between seeing you as the fun person you are, and leveling you as an asshole to protect their feminine pride. They may want to reject you as payback, because people are insecure and they will take your behavior as a rejection, particularly very attractive girls. So, the three options are. Wait it out, wait for them to come to you, and thus you have the upper hand and thus you have added protection from them rejecting you out of spite. Two, try to return to the ones that you felt the best connection with, for me, once I get over the false allure of girls that adhere to the Lilith archetype (topic for another day), these end up being nice and weird girls. Not prone to revenge-rejection but still on guard and unsure of how to perceive your behavior which makes the situation tough. Option three, which is probably the best option as I've always had trouble recovering if I didn't hit it off with someone, is to bail or just stay but just focus on having fun or dancing or something. I'm sure there's a way to recover, but by this point, my weird actions have created a bizarre atmosphere in the bar and I dunno how to handle it yet. Random note: even if you hit it off with someone. Be prepared to walk way, give them space, and talk to other women. Do not make them feel chained to you in anyway or that you're expecting something. The autonomy you grant them will make them feel great. I'm sure I forgot stuff, and I'm not gonna go crazy indepth for brevity's sake, but this is the basic theory. ALso dress however you want. If you're really good looking, dress down, and let the handicap principle work it's effect (read the handicap principle by amotz zahavi and you'll start to understand why women dig altruism, artistic talent and other traits which are not geared towards, or are actually conflicting with, traditional darwinian survival traits). Even if you're not gorgeous, I suspect this would still work. I saw a girl at a bar with very poorly fitting t-shirt, jeans and sneakers and she was getting hardcore checked out, more than the dolled up girls, despite not being overly attractive. This also explains why you can say whatever you want, including showing weakness, vulnerability and sadness and it will actually endear them to you. The handicap principle in a nutshell is this ""I can afford to have this handicap, or act in a way conducive to traditional survival, because I am so good at surviving that I can still thrive despite these handicaps"". The traditional examples is a peacock and it's tail feathers. The tail feathers make no sense in relation to the peacocks survival, it's heavy and it slows them down, which makes them easier prey for predators and also exhausts them. Yet the peacock with the best tail, gets all the ladies. Note how this relates to humans and seduction based on primal darwinian logic. Women attracted to tough guys, money, etc... They want a pretty tail! Note that traditional darwinian logic is also an influence, but the deficit of fun-loving approaches in men has created an environment where this technique can thrive. It's supply and demand. Everyone wants something from everyone else. In bars, men want sex, women want men to want to have sex with them. Go in with a fun mindset, and you're giving something that's in serious demand. PS. I've tried being dominant and had some success but it was always a frustrating challenge. This might sound crazy, but try it, you'll be shocked. I've also tested this against bars full of all different types of men, dominant, submissive, somatic narcissists, cerebral narcissists, normal fold etc.. and it's pulled more attention than any of them. Double PS. It's possible this theory only works in the modern climate and in reaction to the archetype roles that people have slipped into. Triples PS. You should also have firm boundaries, be assertive and always speak your mind. Essentially, you want to release your inner child, while also making it known that you will not let anyone walk all over you, ever. If you're not used to this, work on it slowly, you'll be amazed at the strength you have within you, and how much this simplifies human interaction and allows you to make your way in the world. One more PS. This tactic involves honest signalling, which also implies to the handicap technique. You could sum it up as ""be yourself"". I'm always just acting however I want to and letting others act however they want to. It involves no manipulation or planning, other than not showing attention when you first enter the bar. Just have fun and watch the magic. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, you have to do some inner work, and make sure that you're not trying to sleep with girls to reconcile a previous rejection, or to assert your masculinity over other men, because this will lead to a debilitating sexual addiction. Do it because it's fun for both you and the women. You can feel the ego boost it gives you, but make sure that doesn't become your motivation. You want to generally care about these women and want them to have fun at all times, inside and outside of the bedroom. Do not use women or con them, it will turn you into a fraud. I lied, one more: I also have a really interesting, sad past. Don't hide this from women but also don't spill your guts to them. E.G. if they ask why I'm not drinking, I say ""I'm a recovering alcoholic"" but leave it at that, if they wanna know more, they'll ask, and they almost always wanna know more. That's basically it. I'll re-read and rewrite this later. Just wanted to share what's been working for me. And yes, I've tried acting traditionally masculine, and it worked, but not as emphatically as this tactic, and it was very frustrating and fake and I hated feeling like I had to restrict what I said and did to fit this image.

We're glad that we didn't meet earlier. She did lasik actually and she still feels a bit blurry, probably need another month for full recovery. So in this context we didn't rush it and it's a blessing in disguise. Everything went on well, we chatted for like 5 hours and we parted ways. I foot bill and she said she will do the next one . We talked about almost anything under the sun. She looks average but has a very nice character , she is an epic cook and well to do and I'm slightly above average though. Did some Kino ( shook hands and touched her back twice - she wore a dress ) . We do share our experience in meeting ppl online . She said she met another guy yesterday just before me and some that are damn weird ( i.e another guy : a needy musician who wrote a song for her because she shared her past r/s with her previous ex ) . The one that she met yesterday she said that he didn't have a job. Not sure if she's hinting there's nothing between them or not. I told her about my experience too and how I dislike flaky girls ( opened up my vulnerability and it's a fact - who doesn't ) After we met, she asked me for my FB ( the 2nd time ) which I did provide - finally . So I guess I kinda opened my life for her to CSI , vice-versa. I didn't provide the first time as I respect my privacy and I didn't know her well enough, most dates only has one occurrence. After the date , we still do casual text chats and her responses are faster. I'm not too sure about our face affinity as she's pretty average but she's definitely a nice courteous lady. I think I will spend more time to get know her even better. My thoughts now is just enjoy her company, spend time doing activities together and I put our commitment at the sideline which actually removes pressure from both sides which she agreed too. We didn't tell ourselves point blank but I agreed with her that we should start out as friends and anything extra is a bonus. I'm not in a rush as I'm still seeing other girls at the moment too. Guys, how do you think the outcome of my first date. "

She texts me a few times throughout, but I'm not a big texting fan so I keep my responses short, and keep it mostly to logistical stuff. We set up a time, and the next day she explains that she can't because_______. So i figure fuckit, i have to work later that day, which means we'll probably ride the same bus, so i'll go for the close that day. Didn't see her. I text back saying ok, so let's hang out after you're done doing ____. She agrees, says she'll be done around 1. That morning, I go to the gym, and start getting texts at 11 saying she's done blah blah. I finish my gym routine and we meet at 1:30 at the transit center. Good thing i'm always late, because she was like 40 minutes late. Normally i would fill the time chatting with people or other girls, there weren't really people waiting around, so i just flipped through my phone chatting up girls on dating apps haha. Under normal circumstances, it is best to logically plan out where you're gonna take a girl, other wise you're just wandering around and it's weird. This time, I wanted to just try going with the flow...more on that later. But i wanted to buy some shirts, eat, and i figured why not take her with me clothes shopping haha. She arrives. She walks towards me, and at about 5 ft away i look at my watch, turn around and walk away (all in good humor of course). We hug each other, give her a peck on the cheek, grab her hand and on to the subway we go. Subway ride I fluff about her night last night, her thing this morning. We talk about marijuana. I did what I like to call the turtle-key-bridge pattern. I got it from a foreign dating-game show, where the guy gets to ask the remaining girls a final question(if there are any left), and I thought this guy's question was excellent. I had never done any patterns or anything before but who doesn't like these little psychological games? She loved it, so i made a note to try and do The Cube later on. During the ride I also learned more about her past, and shared some stories about my self demonstrating my vulnerability, as I realized I haven't done so. Doing so really seemed to take away any initial awkwardness or tension that might have been around before. She's highly receptive to my hands on her, we kiss a few times, compliment each other, etc. We get to our stop. She gets some milk-tea, asks me if i want one, but i suggest we'll share one. She was kind of waiting for me to order and but it, but she buys. We get food, i bought it cause she just bought us a drink. During food I ask about her past in much more depth. Learn about her relationship with her parents, siblings, why she moved across the ocean here, etc. Lots of joking and teasing her laugh too. Nothing special really, just two people enjoying a meal together. We walk to the city's main plaza, take some selfies together, walk around. Stopping to makeout every now and then. After a bit of this I realize why it's nice to have a plan. Shopping for clothes just didn't seem suitable anymore... We were walking around, aimlessly mind you, although she thinks i'm taking her somewhere, asking me where i'm taking her. LOL, at this point in my mind i'm just like ""ok shit, have plan next time"" I act like I'm lost for a second, break out my phone and look at maps. There's this really nice hotel building in the area that is supposed to have a great view of the city and I've been wanting to check it out, luckily it was close by, so we proceed there. During the walk I notice the energy becoming slightly off, conversation lulls, so I try to remember the Cube from when I read the game 8+ years ago. What a great little game!! lots of fun, and breaking down the meaning to her was lots of fun. We get to the hotel, and I tell her if they ask we're in from ###. She's kind of weirded out but I grab her waist and lead her in. Get to the top floor, take her around to a few of the secluded scenic spots. I love being in high places, it's always so romantic, especially when it's just two people. Use this opportunity to me a little more sexual, feeling her up while we kiss, etc. I jokingly ask to guess her boob size, and start using my hands to do so. Perfect guess lol. Unfortunately the rooftop was closed, but the whole time she thought that how i knew were all these little spots in the hotel are was very cool. (To be honest, it was my first time there haha.) We go down the a few floors and encounter an exit that leads to a very nice area, it says no exit, but I say I can't read english and we go out. We walk around more, chat about various countries i've been too, languages, etc. At this point we've been walking around for a few hours, so i start heading back to the transit station. Before we get there, I ask if she'd like to taste some special treats a co-workers has brought back from Asia. I think if i waited till we got to the station, it would be weird, like, ""where are we going?"" Walking back she is cold, I take my jacket off and put it on her. We get back to my place. I recite a few foreign-language poems for her for fun. Make out on my bed, clothes come off easy. A little bit of lmr when I went for the panties. I go back to making out with her and slowly work my way back down. No problem. Afterwards, I debrief about why she liked me. She gives me an amazing massage. I in turn also give her one. Go down on her again, then she goes down on me again. Turns out she has never had an orgasm in her life, which means she can go on and on. Unfortunately my little guy was a bit exhausted haha, next time I'll wait a bit longer before busting. I cook a quick meal for us. Take her back home, which turns out is not that far at all. She's a good girl, I think I'll keep her around, but judging from what I learned about her past, I feel like she has a hard time letting people close. Never touched the asian treats lol.

185,vulnerability,seduction,Simplifying Confidence and Vulnerability,5,4wx2ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4wx2ua/simplifying_confidence_and_vulnerability/,2016-08-10 02:33:00,"**Confidence**: everyone wants it, but nobody is sure of what it is. We have so many questions, so many doubts. The more we search for a definition or meaning, the more confused we become and feel. I'll use two of my favorite books on game as an example. For instance, we read *Models* and Mark Manson tells us that confidence is all about being vulnerable, but then we read *The Manual* and W. Anton tells us to avoid vulnerability in order to express confidence. How can that be? How can they both be right? If a man wants to achieve true core confidence, how can he manage his emotions and his behavior regarding **vulnerability** and **confidence**? Let's clear things up, shall we? Mark Manson and W. Anton agree on what confidence means, and on who a confident man is but their concepts of vulnerability are different. What ""vulnerability"" means to Mark Manson is what ""confidence"" means to W. Anton. What ""vulnerability"" means to W. Anton is what ""neediness"" means to Mark Manson. **Vulnerability (for W. Anton)/Neediness (for Mark Manson)** - A vulnerable needy man is a man who has no boundaries; a man who is willing to sacrifice himself, change who is, his character and personality for women; a man who is submissive, negative and has no purpose in life; a man who tries to impress; a passive man who is not masculine and plays the victim role, tells is sad story of rejection and asks for pity in return. A man who expects life to have mercy on him without the minimum of his effort. **Confidence (for W. Anton)/Vulnerability (for Mark Manson)** - A confident vulnerable man tolerates his uncertainty. He puts himself in a place where he can be rejected, because he has audacity, he is courageous and he knows he will be just fine. He is optimistic, he takes responsibility for his fate and life. He is bold and he makes a move. He pulls the trigger. He respects women, loves them, but he is never intimidated by them, knowing they are human beings just like him. He lets go and he surrenders to the moment. He leads. Why? Because he is a masculine man, he tolerates not being certain all the time and deals with the vicissitudes of life. "
186,vulnerability,seduction,How to react in this situation ?,1,4xcu4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4xcu4v/how_to_react_in_this_situation/,2016-08-12 20:19:25,"First of all I would like to say thank you to the community and their advices which help me a lot in my progression Here's the story : The other night I went clubbing in Barcelona (for the holidays). The music was good, my friends and I were having a really good time. At one moment I accidentally walk into a cute colombian girl. I decided to dance with her. We dance all night passionately and with lots of fun. After this dance session we decided to go to the after party which were at her appartment. During this little party we speak a lot. Then we decided to go in her room to sleep but each other were to excited after the discussion so we had a really deep talk about how we feel with lots of things. I lead the conversation and it turns to be a ""vulnerability"" situation where we were really open each other. She was a really interesting person. We sleep together (but no sex, we were too drunk), I stayed at her home all the morning because she wants to, and we continued to share our emotion about lots of things. I really appreciate the discussion. We share our thoughts and insecurities which leaded to an incredibly good vibes. There was a lots of kino and many IOIs from her so I decided to ask her to grab a coffee with me the next day before she left the country. She accept and then I ask her Facebook account (I'm not from Spain so using the phone is complicated). After I left her home I add her in the end of the afternoon, send a message and since then I got no response. So I got many questions : -She was really interested and show it permanently, do you have any idea why she flakes? -That was the first time I feel vibes like this, it was incredible. During our discussions we were really open to Each other, as if we had known from a long time. How can I create the same vibes next time? -I shared only a little party and a night with her, but I had a really good feeling with her and now I miss her (and it hurts a little to be honest). I don't understand why I feel like this and I don't know how to avoid this type of feelings. Thank you in advance and sorry for my bad english! "
187,vulnerability,seduction,My Definite Guide to Inner Game,623,4tlf4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4tlf4p/my_definite_guide_to_inner_game/,2016-07-20 00:34:05,"*Edit: Something should be noted about this guide. This guide is everchanging until the day I can't edit this post anymore. This so I can be open to suggestions, add things I forgot, or add things that I learn along the way. This is aimed to be my ultimate guide, and I hope it helps you as well.* #**When going about the day** ***Walk with a purpose.*** Feel like you have a purpose in everything that you're doing. Walking, talking, running, fucking. Put your whole body and mind behind it. Women will see when he has his shit together, even when just walking. It's the aura you eminate - it's real. ***Enjoy being out of the comfort zone.*** Just as with stress, reacting to these situations as if they were enjoyable/helpful actually make yourself a lot readier for growth. The next time you're facing a situation that's unknown and would push you into uncomfortability, just think to yourself ""Man I'd love to do something new now - where I have no shitting clue on what to do, I'm sure I'll gain experience and learn more about myself."" ***Live in the present.*** You can only control the Now, worrying about the past (that is done) and the future (that may never be) is futile. If you approach a girl and she turns you down, then that moment is already gone because the Now takes it over. She could give you her number and you could start to date and create new Now experiences together. You will never know if you fear approaching her because of an irrational future that may or may not happen. Even if it does happen, within seconds a new Now replaces it and in days it is forgotten. Living in the present is basically about understanding that life is here and now. Not tomorrow. Not yesterday. Not in 10 seconds. Not in 0.000001 seconds. Right now. Always. The 2 main sources I can recommend for mindfulness is meditation &amp; the book ""The Power of Now."" In my opinion, if you have mastered mindfulness, you have mastered Inner Game. URL /u/archaicfrost has a nice write-up on this topic ***Be grateful (about everything).*** &gt;""If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough."" It's been scientifically proven that regularly being grateful increases your happiness by a lot. Funny enough, other people will also be happier if you thank them for something that they did. Appreciation is beautiful, both for yourself and for the other person. Do it often and to everyone. This is a currency much alike love that you get back more of the more you spend it. Be grateful about that tree outside your bathroom window, that you look at when you take a shit. Be grateful about your brother still helping to deal with your shit. Be grateful about peaches. Be grateful about your past self working on your body. Be grateful for that girl in class who smiled at you when you looked at her. Be grateful for that fuzzy feeling you get when you compliment other people and see them smile afterwards. In the same vein whenever something bad happens, it's easy to focus so much on the negative side that you consume yourself in misery and self-pity. For example you opened up a set, created a good vibe, did some kino but you didn't have the balls to ask her out on a date. You can be angry about yourself for not asking her out on date for the rest of the day, or you can just be grateful that you approached in the first place. Be grateful about the fact that you even managed to kino and you both had a good time. Learn from your mistake, but do not give it more attention than it needs. ***Always look on the positive side of things (Or: Frame the situation in a way that it's beneficial for your growth).*** Here's a great video on what this entails: URL (Don't prejudice just because it's from nigahiga. It's more about the meaning behind it.). TL;DW ""I found out my girlfriend's been cheating on me"" --&gt; ""Great, now I don't have to worry about whether she was the one or not."" or ""Wow she rejected me so rudely"" --&gt; ""Good, one less bitch I'll have to deal with. I'm glad I polarized quickly to weed out the ones incompatible with me. Also, I'm glad I'm now able to not get offended as easily as I used to be."" You get what I mean. Focusing on the negative things is detrimental to your growth, since this means you get stuck in past mistakes, a fake world that you can't relive anymore. Stop hoping for a better past, move on. ***Be high energy!*** Pump yourself up with that good music, smile at the birds chirping, scream ""you're the man!"" into the mirror, laugh for no fucking reason, just get your energy up! You're much more likely to enjoy your day this way, and positive vibes are contagious! ***Take control. Be a leader.*** You do not need permission from anyone. If you wish to do something, you do it. Don't be a pussy. After that, trust yourself - you're a LOT smarter than you think. Women will wet their panties for a dude who knows what's up, knows what he wants and is not afraid to show it. Often you'll be given choices, and often you fear the consequences and responsibilities on your shoulders, however big it may be. In those cases you just choose something, stop tip-toeing around the issue and tell her in the face where you're taking her on a date. It doesn't so much matter where you actually take her, it matters that you took the lead. --------------- #**About yourself** ***Be Confident.*** Just check out /r/seduction's top posts. &gt; Confidence is not ""She will like me."" Confidence is ""I'll be fine whether she likes me or not."" URL ***You are not perfect. Embrace this fact.*** Be comfortable in your own skin. Women don't seek the ""perfect"" person, they look for someone they can relate to and connect with. Seeking perfection is NOT the way, it's a weakness. Women seek a CONFIDENT dude, who's okay with himself, not in a slacker kind of way, but in a ""damn I'm awesome, and if there are things I can't change about myself that I don't like, then let that be that"" kind of way. Aim to be better than yourself, not others. In the end, there will always be someone else who's better than you at something. But your goal in life is not to be better than the rest, it's to be the best version of yourself. Cheesy as it sounds, you are unique and the world needs your uniqueness. URL read /u/jimmiereese3327's inspiring story for more on those 2 points. ***Forgive yourself.*** This is a big one. Ever messed up a set so bad you beat yourself over it so much, your mood is ruined for you and your buddies for the rest of the night? Now, we've all been there, but we all have to understand that this is really unnecessary. Give yourself permission to forgive yourself. Only if you forgive yourself, you can lift up all the pressure you had from messing up. This also leads to forgiving other people much easier. ***Don't care about what other people think of you.*** This is so fucking important. It is both the simplest, yet the hardest to execute advice. But once you figured it out, you will be Superman 2.0. Ever felt like standing up and screaming around in a cafe to commit to a joke, but were afraid to embarrass your friend? Wanna dance in public to your jam, but don't want to look like a weirdo in public? Have that warm feeling in your stomach about that really funny punchline that could be offensive, so as not to appear like an ignorant person, you don't want to say it out loud? Well fuck that guys. **If you want to be a free person, express yourself 100%, live life on your own accord, there is no way around it. Simply don't give a fuck. It's simple.** You're having excuses right now. I don't know what your excuse is. Maybe you're having a moment of enlightenment, and that's good. To those who don't, I'll say this again: **Simply. Do. Not. Give. A. Shit.** About what other people think of you. &gt;*""Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.""* Consciously catch yourself when you're having that speck of a doubt. Choose to push through despite it and do whatever the fuck it is that you wanted to do, no matter what other people could think about you. Either the reaction is different from what you expected (probably much better than you thought), or they simply don't fit your style and you don't really have to care about that. I could say more about this topic, but I'll choose not to. You will notice that once you reach 100% authenticity, you will magically draw people to you. You'll just be so real. Like you're their best friend and they want to open themselves up to you because you're just yourself, and so you make other people feel like they can just be themselves around you as well. URL /u/stephen-silver had a great story about this. ***Let go of your persona.*** This goes in the same vein as ""do not care about what other people think about you"", but it goes a level deeper. Often times, when you're out with friends OR you just met a new group of friends, you will tend to act one way rather than the other, even though you don't want to. For example, you're out with a friend who never knew you did pickup, yet there's that really hot girl you want to talk to in a caf. Chances are, you'll think to yourself ""Oh man, he doesn't even know yet. If I surprise him here out of nowhere and I fail it's going to be embarrassing as fuck!"" OR maybe you just 'feel like you shouldn't do it in front of him, because X.' At those times it becomes apparent that you have created a certain ""persona"" of yourself, an ""identity."" And to an extent, you want to keep up that persona in front of your friends. Maybe you even have slightly altered personas between different people in your circle of friends. Well I'll tell you what, people don't have identities. You are you. Be you. Nothing else. YOU have no persona, because YOU ARE, and that's it. Never forget to *express YOURSELF 100%*, (almost) no matter the cost. It's more important to keep integrity and be true to yourself than follow up on a self-persona that only exists in your mind. Yes, maybe people will be surprised if you suddenly show a different side of yourself, maybe something you're embarrassed about - but the more embarrassed/defensive you get about it, the more it means something to you because that just shows how much you don't want to get attacked for something that you love. If you don't let go, you will get exhausted, both mentally and physically. Let go! ***Don't take yourself too serious.*** Lighten up, bro. Don't take offense to every little thing, makes you hard to be around. If you don't take yourself serious, making jokes and making others and yourself laugh gets a lot easier. Plus you don't get offended as easy and people will see you're a chill dude. Makes you a lot more likeable and makes life a whole lot easier. If you're stuck up and angry at everything that's being thrown at you, shit gets tiring, real quick. URL Here are *a lot of great points* regarding not giving a fuck &amp; stoicism by /u/randianhero ***Don't compare yourself to other people.*** This is a really basic tip, and you've probably heard it a lot - doesn't mean it's unimportant. If you're too busy comparing your [insert external/materialistic measure of success here] to someone else, you'll always be lacking SOMETHING. Happiness and inner peace comes from within. Most importantly, however, taking yourself too serious and comparing yourself to others makes you a dick who can't appreciate good things. You wouldn't be able to be happy about your friends' or other peoples' success. You would see other people being successful as a projection of you being unsuccessful. Oh and also, don't compare yourself to feel better about yourself. That's a short-lived, twisted, unhealthy &amp; needy way of feeling good about yourself. Grow up. Don't be that guy. Relaaaaax bro. Have fun. Spread love. ***Learn to be funny***. I learned the easiest way to become funny is not to by becoming the wittiest dude on the planet a l Conan O'Brien. Simply commit to your jokes, don't take yourself too serious and most importantly, make yourself laugh. Learn which type of humor presses your buttons. If you manage to do those things, the girl will laugh whether she actually finds your antics funny or not, the whole energy behind it will make her laugh without her knowing why. ***Smile.*** ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #**During a Conversation (With a Girl)** ***Smile from the inside. Genuinely smile on the outside.*** Like you love life and mean it! ***Be vulnerable. 100% brutal honesty.*** You probably heard this about a thousand times. Whenever you have an opinion on or have a feeling about something, don't be afraid to say it out loud. You will feel vulnerable because what you would say is your 100% real self, and if the other person disrespects that, it'll feel like they directly attacked you - that's why you shy away from it. Don't. Remember about that thing I said with being authentic and perfection? Girls love it when you're vulnerable. It shows that you are not afraid to say what's on your mind. That's sexy as fuck. Read ""Models"" by Mark Manson for more about vulnerability. URL read /u/mi5ery's write up on vulnerability (who also recommends Mark Manson's ""Models."") ***LISTEN. Genuinely listen to what the other person has to say.*** The easiest way to make another person interested in you is to be interested in that person yourself. Ever have the feeling of not knowing what to say? You can initiate a conversation by asking an open-ended question, but ask too many and the conversation turns into a weird interview. To avoid this, listen to what the other person has to say. Don't go ""Oh that's cool"" and ask the next question or think about what you're going to say next. The other person will notice - either from your words, or your eyes, or your choice of topic. A girl leaves a lot of ""hooks"" onto which you can latch yourself on. These include ""Observations"" - what she wears, her hair, her way of X (talking, walking, dressing) or her ""Sentences"" themselves. For example ""I returned from LA last week, when I came home I saw my dog with a bow tie, what the hell! My mom think's she's so funny *smiles*."" There are a LOT of hooks that you can latch onto: Her returning from LA (""Where were you before returning from LA?"" or ""Last time I was there, I met a buddy who...""). Her dog (""Why did you choose that dog and not another one?"" or ""I've always wanted a Corgi, I saw some videos where..""). Her mom (""Does she often prank you? You seem to get along with your mom really well, I know that my mom would ...""). URL here's a cool write-up from /u/aswjacob if you want more tips on ""Never Running Out Of Things To Say."" URL Also interesting and helpful is /u/everyseventeenyears's ""Rhythm of Speech"" ***Be outcome independent.*** When talking to a girl, just have fun in the interaction itself. Remember all the things with being vulnerable, living in the present, not giving a fuck. Those are all means so you can just have fun. Tell inappropriate jokes that you find funny, do stuff that makes you laugh and enjoy yourself. This endless source of fun is contagious and draws others to you - girls also just want to have fun! Without judgement from anyone else, without worrying about weird looks from others, without being afraid of offending anyone. If they see you as an inspiration, it'll be much easier from them to have just as much as fun if they hang around you. This way, you'll support each other in an upward spiral of shits 'n giggles. And if it's time to go slower and sexual, do it in the same playful way. If it doesn't work, there's enough fish in the sea - as clich as this sounds. Find someone that matches your energy. Go into an interaction only wanting to express yourself, and if the girl loves that, then they love you. If they don't, don't beat yourself up over it. Life goes on and you don't have to exhaust yourself with unnecessary, negative thoughts. ***Be okay with your sexuality. Show desire.*** The biggest weakness in guys is having no faith in their sexuality. They feel like they just can't get sexual with a women, no matter how well the conversation goes. They say ""I don't know how, what do I have to say?"" And they'll get tips like ""Slow down your voice, talk slower, physically escalate, look at them like you wanna fuck them on the sink right now."" But when they try they fail, get creeped out looks and are left with a big fat question mark. The main point is your Inner Game. If you talk slower, deeper, with stronger eye contact and with more physical touch, but you don't believe in what you're doing, then you're not congruent. Not congruent means your inner belief system and your outer actions don't match each other. This results in inauthenticity, creepiness and rejections. The trick is to be okay with being a man. It's in your DNA to want and fuck a women. Then be okay with this fact. You want a girl, and there's nothing wrong with it. In fact, this just makes you more of a man - more attractive. In fact, women are much much naughtier than you might think. You see all those erotica novels? How they consume sex scenes like it's chocolate? While we men are like ""Oh shit she's got hot pants on, look at those legs."" Women talk about ""He really knew how to work his dick omg I wanna fuck him right now."" All. The fucking. Time. They live on their horny side, it's just that society has slut shamed them to death so they hide it. But oh, you know nothing. Be sexual with them - they LOVE it. So be okay with it. ***Don't put her on a pedestal.*** I think this is self-explanatory. Don't see the world and other people in scales of value. See them as other human beings that have just as many weaknesses and insecurities that you have who take shits, probably vomited a few times for being too drunk, laugh like a hyena, dance alone in their bathroom, have the worst voice when singing in the shower, say dumb shit like 1 + 1 = 3 once in a while. Don't filter or change yourself in an attempt to woo the woman, it's not gonna happen, it's not worth it and she'll see right through it. Stop unnecessarily pressuring yourself. ***Rejection is fine.*** Sometimes you do everything right, perfect kino, perfect vibe, but they still don't want anything to do with you. This can have multiple reasons, most of which you can't influence (like location). Or maybe they just straight up reject you. This is good, invited even. If it wasn't going to work out anyway, then be grateful there weren't any more games played and the interaction is over sooner rather than later. This will give you more time to try out new things and new women. In the first place, the image of rejection being bad and the fear of failure is something that's wrongly taught to us. We all have to fail or we won't grow. Be happy about being rejected, not because you got rejected, but because you had the courage to try and have gained new experiences to use for next time. "

One girl asked what i had planned for memorial day, and told me she was free. I demanded for her number to set up the date. Which to she said ""I'm not fond of meeting people that i met on the internet a couple of hours ago. So lets talk a little more and then i'll decide if i want to meet up or not"". At this point, i just felt going the root of take it or leave it was the best. But she was very invested in the conversation. She usually typed way longer than I did. So we're talking and getting to know each other through text, which is fucking lame and boring because thats what dates are for. Usually in this scenario, would you guys have taken the same path? I feel like I'm giving her the power. Which I am most likely. I asked to play question game to expose vulnerability so that i can get her to comply to the date. Edit: She wanted to skype before hanging out and feels that it is awkward if she randomly met up with a guy she found on the internet. SHe also insisted waiting till next week for her friend to come"
190,vulnerability,seduction,Expressing sexually submissive tendencies/fantasies; vulnerability or weakness/turn off?,5,4lyyfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4lyyfl/expressing_sexually_submissive/,2016-06-01 12:15:37,"I've seen a few posts that concern this subject in other subs and in various forums, but I think its something that would be worthwhile discussing here amongst us. I've been on the sub for a while now and have been making a lot of genuine change - seen some real improvement in dating and in general life. But this whole thing started with the fundamental realisation that a lot of my behaviours and general personality are based on huge insecurities (or at least, were). After realising this and noticing that I communicate how little I think of myself, I started to make changes, hence being here. Last night though, I was talking to a girl about sex and what gets us off. This got me thinking about the way I lean toward certain 'fetishes' or 'kinks' and where they come from. This is is a throwaway because I'm fairly active on the sub and this is rather personal, but I've always leaned on the side of submissiveness. Something gets me off about a girl being in control when it comes to sex. This doesn't mean I can't just have plain old sex - that's just fine. Hell, I can do the whole dominant thing pretty well too, and I enjoy it. But for some reason, I really enjoy giving her the power when it comes to sex. I think it's fairly well known that a lot of women - even those who won't outright say it - love to be 'dominated'. Go over to redpill and they'll tell you every woman in the world fantasises about such things. In my own experience, this is true - I'd go as far as to say that the vast majority fall under this. I've finally managed to get my head around what Manson means when he says: Neediness = bad, Vulnerability = good. He's saying that by putting your true self on the line, expressing your intent and what you want, you're being the opposite of needy - because you're basically saying 'this is me, take it or leave it'; i.e. you're opening yourself to the possibility of rejection (making yourself vulnerable) in comparison to needing the approval of others so badly that you shroud your personality. Now, I think some of these submissive fantasies/ideas are based on my insecurities and negative experiences. This is something, in truth, I'm -deeply- ashamed of - but I get off on the idea of being humiliated, denied etc. and even delve into the category known simply as 'cuckold'. I'll spare the gory details, but looking back on my life as a teenager, I was rejected and forced to watch girls that I liked have sexual experiences with other guys that I then perceived as 'better' than me. I was also cheated on at one point by a fairly long term girlfriend. I'm not passing the blame, and I'm not saying I'd ever actually want to live out such 'fetishes'. But, I do think that they might be routed in experiences I had in critical years for sexual development, and that the seemingly-world-ending pain I experienced at the time became 'fetishized' so that I could take arousal from it instead of being hurt. This is all getting perhaps a little bit too psychological and off course. My question is, do I express this as who I am? Do I say 'yeah, a lot of people think this is weird, but its what I like and what I want' or do I try and change it? The lighter stuff doesn't bother me so much - even if most women are massively in preference of being dominated in sex, I can do that, and liking a woman to be somewhat dominant isn't an issue. Its the other stuff I question. I don't like the fact that I'm aroused by the thought of being cheated on or humiliated or whatever - should I try and change my mindset so that I'm ok with that part of myself and can express it is as who I am, or should I try and identify and paint over the underlying causes of these thoughts? Where does one draw the line? I guess I've ended up asking two or three questions, but general discussion or direct answers are welcome. Hopefully someone out there can relate to this, though I appreciate its perhaps a bit out of the usual remit of seddit."
191,vulnerability,seduction,"The 4 truths about ""being yourself.""",19,4gezv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4gezv8/the_4_truths_about_being_yourself/,2016-04-26 05:34:11,"Heres a scenario: You meet a woman and she asks, How long was your last relationship? You tell her 2 years even though it was a 2 week fling off Tinder. As soon as the words come out of your mouth you think, Whyd I lie? I could link the research to why being authentic and acting with integrity is important, but lets be real no one makes behavior changes strictly off facts. If that was true tobacco companies would have gone out of business a long time ago. This isn't an article on why you should tell the truth. You arent in kindergarten and life isnt black and white. This is an article on what it takes to be authentic. Being authentic is something we all crave, but in moments of weakness we stop being ourselves to be what we think others want us to be. Weve all heard the phrase, Just be yourself. My mom said to this one night years ago when I was balls deep in my drug and alcohol phase and depressed because I couldnt get a girlfriend. Just be yourself couldnt have resonated less with me at the time. Lets clarify what just be yourself, means. It means be authentic. Brene Brown has the best definition of authenticity in her book Gifts of Imperfection. Authenticity is the daily practice of letting go of who we think were supposed to be and embracing who we are. Maybe its a stretch to say were being inauthentic if we choose to laugh at our bosses shitty joke at work. Or tell our friends we loved their pasta even though it tasted like cardboard. Or on a first date she asks if we want kids and we reply, Ive considered it, even though the thought of changing a diaper makes us puke in our mouths a little bit. You could argue, Im just being polite. Thats how the game of life works. But what about the instant replay you run in your heads on the car ride home when we think, Im sick of trying to be someone else. Why do I do it? I just want to be me. Thats the moment Im talking about. Theres a price to being authentic. If it was easy, wed all run around telling everyone their jokes sucked and their pasta tasted like a Fedex box. The hard part of being authentic isnt how you handle others, its how you handle with yourself. Authenticity requires you to know your inner states, emotions, and thoughts, both good and bad. This is one of those things that sounds easy, but is really hard and uncomfortable in practice. Ive written about the dark path of deception I went down years ago to get what I wanted from women. A path of deception, lying, and manipulation. Part of it was because I was drinking the PUA kool-aide. Part of it was because no one taught me how to be authentic. Plus, it was easier to deal with the pain of someone being upset at me behind the mask of drugs and alcohol. I convinced myself I wasnt responsible for the emotional harm I caused someone if I was high. I know thats sounds fucked up, because it is. But thats the world I was living in at the time. It took self-loathing to the point of my first thought in the morning being, I hate myself, and someone almost dying because of my careless behavior for me to realize that being inauthentic was causing more harm than good. I was so caught up with instant gratification from women and sex that I didnt realize the destruction I was causing to myself and others. After the smoke cleared (literally and metaphorically) I made the decision to work towards being authentic with women. I still have moments of weakness and say what I think a woman wants to hear. Then I remind myself its a daily practice and I can always do better next time. There are some truths that come with being authentic. Being authentic isnt not easy, but its incredibly rewarding when you make the choice to be yourself in a situation when your normally wouldnt have. There are 4 truths that come with being authentic. **AUTHENTICITY TRUTH #1: YOU WILL QUESTION YOURSELF** Kind of like a hangover. When you embrace who you really are, you will question why you did it shortly after. This is because being vulnerable is uncomfortable. You are exposed for all the world to see. Your ego wants to step in and protect you. Sit in the vulnerability. I know that sounds like a woo-woo spiritual term but there isnt really any other way to put it. I guess I could say suck it up. Or deal with it. Im trying to put it nicely though. Once you learn that discomfort is apart of the process of being authentic it becomes less terrifying and easier to accept. Just like when your ears are going to pop when the plane is flying into the sky. After youve flown a few times you remember to start popping your ears before you get in the air. Whenever I go through a situation where I choose to be authentic I practice difficult conversations with friends before I have them so I can find the core essence of what Im trying to say. The blunt truth. The last scenario I choose to be authentic was when I broke up with my girlfriend. I wanted to tell her that it was because I was moving and didnt want a girlfriend. The truth was I wasnt ready to be in a relationship and I wanted to date other women. The conversation was really uncomfortable and we both cried. After we broke up she sent me a text that said, Can we still be friends? You are such a great guy and I want to have you in my life. We still talk today. **AUTHENTICITY TRUTH #2: YOU WILL GET INTO THE TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS YOUVE ALWAYS WANTED** When you start embracing who you are people start leaving your life. This is a good thing. Its good because it makes room for the kind of people you always wanted to be with. When I first moved to Colorado, I stopped thinking about things like pick up lines, or when to touch a womans arm when I met her. I started basing my interactions off of two things: Telling the truth, and asking for what I wanted, knowing I might not get it. This changed everything. One night I was out at a bar and there was a cute girl outside who lived in my apartment. I had been wanting to meet her for a while, but I hadnt had the chance to introduce myself. When I saw her I knew I wanted to say hello. Instead of thinking of what line to say, I went up to her and said, Hey my name is Mark and we live in the same building. Ive noticed you walking around before and I wanted to introduce myself. How are you? We ended up dating for a few months before she moved away. She was amazing and was completely different than any other woman I had dated at the time. **AUTHENTICITY TRUTH #3: YOU WILL BECOME POLARIZING** Just writing this makes me squirm in my chair. As a recovering nice guy, I cant stand the thought of people not liking me. The reality is it happens. Even when I act with authenticity and integrity people still get hurt. Ive had to learn to separate myself from these moments and not take it personally. Theres a great quote from the book, that describes how to handle setting boundaries and other people upset at you perfectly: Indeed a compassionately wise person cares about his own happiness as much as the happiness of others - no more and no less. This isn't to say that sacrifices aren't sometimes appropriate, but rather that we have to be wise in deciding which sacrifices to make. Sometimes we may care about another person's happiness but find them too dangerous to remain near as with an alcoholic determined not only to take her life into ruin but to take her spouse and children down with her. In such cases, the most compassionate thing to do may be to detach with love, removing ourselves from her environment without ceasing to care about her in our heart. Nor does being compassionate require us to adopt a passive demeanor and express only gentle kindness at all times. Though compassion can certainly be gentle, it must also sometimes be harsh, forceful, and even angry. **AUTHENTICITY TRUTH #4: IT GETS EASIER** The more you practice acting in alignment with who you think you are the more you can process emotions without judgement. I used to have a lot of shame around the fact I read dating advice to improve my relationships with women. I remember hiding my personal development books and tapes in my closet. I thought that if people really knew that I struggled with dating, I would be laughed at. Now I write a dating blog talking about my most embarrassing experiences. Part of it is because Ive processed them and there and they are in the past. Another part is that Ive developed a new comfort zone of authenticity. Ive told enough people in my life about the shame and embarrassment that Ive felt in the past and learned that people dont react the way I thought they would. If anything, they tell me about an area they struggled with too. This builds confidence. "

We know that attraction is generated by: -Breaking Rapport -Keeping them guessing -Confidence -Strong Body Language -Teasing and Banter -The ""Push"" aspect of Push Pull. However, this directly conflicts with being charming and getting thr girl comfortable. Which is achieved by: -Building/Seeking Rapport -Compliments -Not teasing and Banter as much -Showing vulnerability -The ""Pull"" aspect of Push-pull My problem has been that if I act too charming and genuine, the girl is never attracted to me and friend zones me. On thr flip side, when I'm trying to bust their balls and keep attraction, they don't feel as comfortable or trust me and think I'm an asshole. Exactly how do you intertwine these two paradoxical concepts?"

However, I believe this kind of game leads to blowouts and the woman thinking you're too open too fast. Example, I fell in love with a woman I was dating; and confidently, I told her that I was in love with her. I was not reaction seeking, and I did not care if she didn't share the same feelings for me; however, she told me I was too emotionally attached. There have been several occasions where this concept has lead to problems. There's another school of thought that says ""don't show your cards at once."" Which I agree more with; thoughts?"
195,vulnerability,seduction,Question: Conversing with statements instead of questions feels so unnatural to me.,2,4ce396,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4ce396/question_conversing_with_statements_instead_of/,2016-03-29 16:14:51,"There is a common piece of advice out there that conversations flow well if you make a comment relating to the other person's last statement then follow up with a question. As such, the conversation is guided by what questions you ask. After reading a couple books, including Mark Manson's book ""Models"", I learned that conversations become more personal when you share more about yourself by speaking with statements which express your beliefs/opinions/feelings far better than questions do. I found that this particular section made me a bit uncomfortable when I read it, so I tried changing the way I converse by using more statements and fewer questions in my conversations with others. I haven't practiced this a lot yet, maybe 10 conversations, but I immediately felt my conversations became more strained for the following three reasons: 1. As a kid, my communications skills were not very good. Early in my quest for self-improvement, I decided to make it my goal to learn as much from the other person as possible in every conversation. This made conversation much more fun and interesting for me, which improved my social skills a LOT. For the first time, I found myself seeking out conversation rather than avoiding it. Asking questions has been a rewarding habit in the past and I realize that it is going to be tough habit to break. I fear that my mind is resisting this change because of the worry that conversations will become mundane again. What do you guys find fun or rewarding in this type of conversation? I don't think I quite get it. 2. I am an introvert and I find that this type of communication tires me out quickly. Coming up with an opinion or anecdote to share for every comment that she makes is much more mentally taxing than simply asking a question generally related to what she is talking about. I realize that effort is required to change my habits and to truly relate with other people, but fuck if I'm not completely brain dead and unwilling to talk any more after about 10 minutes of this. Are there any introverts out there who might have solved this problem? 3. Before I learned that speaking with statements was how ""natural"" conversations are supposed to flow, I found that I was quickly turned off by girls who never asked any questions. It made me feel as though they were way more interested in expressing themselves than actually getting to know me. I know that many people have felt this way in conversation with someone. I am concerned that if I make the conversation too much about ME and MY feelings, then she will become disinterested quickly if she isn't naturally assertive. There seems to be a very fine line between expressing vulnerability in conversation and dominating the conversation. How exactly do I manage this properly whhile leading the conversation? I do believe that speaking with statements can work well at developing emotional connections, but I am worried about the above three points. Does anyone have any advice that might might help me address these concerns? All opinions are appreciated."
196,vulnerability,seduction,"[FR] Successful first date, need advice on second date!",1,4cnitv,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4cnitv/fr_successful_first_date_need_advice_on_second/,2016-03-31 10:56:50,"Apologies for the wall of text! I tried to format it to make it easier to skim or skip around. Im new here, and want to be useful. The posting guidelines recommend specific things worth sharing, so in an attempt to make this organized and easy to read, Im going to separate this out into different categories. **MINDSET:** - Its been an awkward amount of time since Ive dated for a small variety of reasons, so Im attempting to kickstart my love life a bit here. Pivotal for me has been reading Models (Mark Manson) and No More Mr. Nice Guy (I dunno. Google it). A universal refrain in those is that intimacy &lt;- vulnerability &lt;- honesty, which is a bit scary, but also super relieving. So, the mindset I was attempting to cultivate here was one where Im not trying to impress, but to be honest, and just get to know her. - I got a bit caught up in the details of the date, and felt a decent amount of anxiety ahead of time. What if I plan something wrong? What if she doesnt like what were doing? What if its not exiting enough? I texted a buddy, and he said, Youre the badass sonabitch who is the good time. She should be lucky to have your attention for more than 2 seconds. So do what you have planned and just try and enjoy hanging out. Stop being a scared little bitch. Fucking pussywillow. Haha.. That helped. But thats the mindset I was able to maintain throughout the night. No pressure. Were just getting to know each other. Im a fun guy, and if shes the right girl, she doesnt need a perfect date anyhow. **LOGISTICS:** This is where I think I struggle the most. I asked for advice in a previous post, and got some helpful feedback. I think the flow of the night was really cool. Heres what and when and why I did what I did: - I called her around 2:30 and asked when shes free. She gave me a few days, and I asked what she was doing that (same) night, telling her I just wanted to do something low-key. Maybe thats a no-no, but whatever. - I texted her to meet me at 8:07 at a specific part of the mall parking lot. I was a fre minutes late, unintentionally. When we got there, I told her we had two missions to accomplish but that I couldnt tell her what they were.Id previously told her that everybody looks better in glasses. She told me she didnt. So, we went shopping for glasses for a while. We browsed for a while, then after that, I had her wait outside the candy store while I grabbed some thin mints. - By now its 9, and I take her to Barnes &amp; Noble to buy hot chocolate. I put some thin mints in, and the game is how little can I add before she can guess what Ive added. (This sounds weird and creepy as I type it, but it was fun.) - Its close to 10 when we leave and go to Walmart and grab some oats. We drive to a duck pond. Its 11ish by the time we get there. We walk around, try to figure out how to get the damn ducks to eat our food, and make out until 12ish. - We make out and talk until 1 or so. What I liked was being able to change venues at my leisure in a natural way. It appeared both spontaneous and low-key. **KINO:** Im not sure how necessary this is, but as far as I can recall, these are the moments and times I escalated, and specifically how I did it. This is lengthy, but Im trying to be explicit for whoever this might help. - We hugged when we met. - When we were trying out the glasses, I was putting them on and taking them off of her. - I touched her arm and guided her with my hand on her lower back at times while we walked through the mall. - When we were walking out, I held her upper arm to guide her towards my car, then slipped my hand down her arm until we were holding hands. - When we got in my car, she was trying to adjust her seat. I leaned across her and spent a while trying to figure it out. I said, this is my way of trying to touch you, and it was funny. - I touched her jeans as we drove, and commented on how they didnt feel like jeans. I kept rubbing them throughout the drive, and when I offered her a blanket, I said she could use it as long as I could keep touching her legs. Again, funny. - It was cold as we were feeding the ducks. I had her put on my sweater, and we hugged tightly as we walked around. - I actually didnt want to kiss her on the first date, but she kept smiling, staring at my eyes, looking at my lips, and licking her lips. The main deterrent was that I had slightly dry lips, and didnt want her to see me lick my lips. When I caught a chance to lick them subtly, I went in and kissed her. - We made out for a while outside, then for a while in my car. My hands naturally started roaming under her clothes. Once she moved my hand, and I backed off for a while. An hour later, she moved my hand again, and said she wasnt ready, that it was too soon. I just kept kissing her and backed off. It was fine. **CONVERSATION:** I dont have any specific phrases I think were magic, and Im coming to think there is no such thing. Im naturally light-hearted and have an easy time talking and joking around. I few things that I think were helpful with the conversation: - My mindset was healthy. - I tried to allow the conversation to become about emotion rather than simply facts. I also allowed for silence when it felt appropriate. At one point, she was talking about her family, and she said something like, You probably dont want to hear this. I just softly said, I do. Later, she said that this is the thing that makes her saddest, and then paused as though she wasnt sure whether to go on. I just looked at her and said nothing. She kept talking, and said shes never told anyone this before. This was very intimate. **LESSONS:** - I have the tendency to want to perform, to be an entertainer. Throughout the date, I spoke freely whatever I wanted to. I was very vulnerable, and the date was very intimate. - This honesty I believe worked because my mindset was healthy. By healthy, I mean that I was more curious about finding out about her than I was about making sure she liked me so I could feel validated. For those who are single, dateless and stressing about it. Take a moment to considerThat instead of feeling the need to impress them, you could wonder if they impress you? (URL Something like that. - Logistics! Again, I sense that I suck at this. It took a hell of a lot of my time to figure out that feeding ducks really is okay. But getting it right, so that there were a number of different venues that felt natural, was pretty helpful I think. This is a skillset I need to develop. **HELP!** That date was on Monday. We are going out again on Friday. I feel confident in my ability to go about integrating her into my life if this goes well, but I am a little lost on this date. I want it to be fun and loose, but I dont want it to be too similar to the last date. Here are my ideas so far: ComedySportz. - I like that it shakes things up and that it would be super fun. I dont know how interactive it is, and I dont know if the limited ability to talk would be a big deal. I also dont like that its 2 hours. Id rather spend an hour on something and move on whenever Im ready. Art museum. - I like that I can talk and touch. I feel like weve spent a good amount of time just talking though, and Im wary of just walking around talking about things all the time. Ice skating. - On paper this looks cool, but Ive only ice skated once, and Im not sure how fun that would be if Im not competent. I also like the idea of doing something quirky shes unlikely to have done much before, and Im not sure this works for that. Also tough to see how it naturally segues into something else besides hot chocolate, which weve already done. Dancing. - On paper this looks really cool too. But I dont really want to do it. Mini golf / bowling. - Too trite. I feel like I have to do something a little bigger since its a Friday night. Im not sure that lowkey and predictable is the way to go here. If I were forced to make a decision right now, Id do something like this: 7:15 - meet up, find a reason to stop by my place, and give her the grand tour. Have her try a juice that I made or something. 7:45 - 10:00 - go to Comedy Sportz (an improv show). 10:00 - 10:30 - walk down the street and buy some horchata, since she has told me I need to try that. (Still have to find a horchata place there, but I can figure that out. 10:30 - If its clear and warm out, lay on a hill and see if we can identify constellations? Im not sure. I get stuck at this point. I want something isolating but I dont want to just hang out in my car, and I dont feel comfortable in my apartment (roommates in the front room, and nothing to do in my room). Any ideas here? Alternatively, I could do something like this: 730-830 - go to the museum of art and look around. 830-930 - get drinks at a juice bar or something. Stop by walmart and buy coloring books and crayons. Draw portraits of each other or something. 930-10 - head to the street the comedy club is on and walk around. 10-12 - go to the comedy club. 12-1 - take her to a look out point over the city where we have to finish our portraits. I dont know. As Ive said, Im trying to figure out this stuff without looking too try-hard. Part of the pressure I feel here is that I know she gets asked out a ton, and I want to set myself apart. Shit, this got long. **TL;DR: - I had a great first date on Monday. The keys were having a mindset where I valued honesty over performance instead of seeking her validation, and having a strong but easy-going plan in place. Now, Im trying to figure out what to do for a second date. This is something I struggle with, for whatever reason.** Any ideas, guys? "

First post and FR here. Little background around myself: Never really had any experience with girls platonically or romantically and I wanted to change that. I feel like my inner game is strong (workout, volunteer, getting into photography...), but my social skills have always sucked. I stumbled upon this subreddit about 4 months ago, and I was amazed by all the stories and advice. I wanted to try to implement it into my life, but here we are four months later (after struggling with some bad AA) and I just made my first approach. Here's how it went (about an hour ago, just for reference): &amp;nbsp; So every other Thursday, I go to a meeting for my college's Habitat for Humanity club. I got there about ten minutes early so I could get a seat in the back (being in the very front for club meetings weirds me out). I pulled out a lab report I was working on the whole week to make it seem like I was busy (I understand for someone that's trying to break AA that this is a very counter-intuitive thing to do, but I digress). About five minutes later, this girl who I had always thought was really pretty walked in. &amp;nbsp; CUE THE SYMPTOMS OF AA. Mini heart attack, sinking feeling in stomach, knot in the throat...basically that feeling of social paralysis hit me hard. ""Fuck, dude. Not now. I'm not ready. Where's that flying ice cream truck when you need it?"" **To top it all off, this room was rather empty (about 10 people in like a 50 desk room), and she picks a seat one spot away from me. And she's by herself.** &amp;nbsp; FUUUUUUUUUUCK. At this point, I realized that if I didn't speak up now, I would have some INTENSE regret later, a feeling that I'm all too familiar with. I remembered the oh-so important 3 second rule, but to be honest, I sat there for an entire minute as a five act internal monologue played out in my head. Eventually, I just thought ""well, I'm in-it-to-win-it now"", took a swig of water, thought of Aurora by Foo Fighters to calm myself down, and went in for the kill. I turned to my left: * Me: ""Excuse me, can you do me a big favor?"" * Girl: [grins] ""What's that?"" * Me: ""So my brother has a birthday coming up soon, and..."" (completely true, it's on April 13th and he never told me what he wanted) * Girl: ""...you don't know what to get him?"" (laughs) * Me: (laughs) ""Yeah, you ever have someone tell you that they want nothing? What do you do in that situation."" &amp;nbsp; From here, she asks me about my brother's interests to give my ideas, and then I ask her if she had any similar experiences with gift-giving. No problems with eye contact, and I made sure to have a nice smile/grin on my face the whole time (this aspect of socializing has never really been a problem for me). I consciously tried to ask open-ended questions about her so I wouldn't monopolize the conversation. Plus, I was genuinely interested in hearing from her. &amp;nbsp; This conversation lasts about 3-4 minutes, and then the meeting begins. It lasts for about 10 minutes, but I honestly could not tell you what happened during that time. I was so preoccupied by what I had just done. 4 months of built up AA, and I finally did it. Holy shit. Once the meeting ends, I try to resume the conversation with her: * Me: ""Hey, what's your name? "" * Girl: ""I'm X."" * Me: ""Hi, X, my name is Ryan."" * [shake hands] * Me: ""So X, what do you study here?"" * Girl: ""Biochemistry."" * Me: ""What made you want to do that?"" (continuing the open-ended questions) &amp;nbsp; A few more exchanges about our studies, and then she gets stopped by one of her friends in the room. I hit the panic button, so I said ""It was nice meeting you, see you around!"" before I left the meeting. Now here's why I feel a little shitty: * a) I wanted to verbally express my interest in her (ex: ""I think you're cute/pretty/beautiful, and I wanted to introduce myself..""), but I never found a moment to get it in. I guess my opener didn't really put my in a good position for that. **If I get the chance to talk to her again, should I try to express my interest then?** * b) The way I exited the conversation was little awkward. I stood there in silence for about 2-3 seconds (not TOO long, but long enough for me to notice) before ejecting. I wanted to keep talking so I could learn some more things about her, but I panicked when her friend came in the mix. &amp;nbsp; **What do guys think I could do better next time (with her or another girl)? What can I do to not become complacent with just one approach?** I can provide more information if needed. Thanks for reading (I REALIZED THIS A REALLY GENERIC, BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL TO ME). &amp;nbsp; **TL;DR Finally did my first cold approach, but I don't have that euphoric feeling, mainly because I wasn't able to talk for very long or express my interest (vulnerability).** "

I know it is covered in the book, but I just can't quite get being vulnerable while not being needy at all. For example, suppose I'm texting with a girl I kinda liked, and the conversation started to get boring or nowhere. I know, the right decision is to stop the conversation right then (I got the date set up). Here's where I'm confused; I wanted to talk about the new rock-ass Civil Wars trailer and wanted to know if she liked it too, but at the same time, I just want the conversation to not stop, which is I know, needy. Also, when I talk about the new cool trailer, I'm both expressing myself and my hobbies AND expecting her either to be excited or straight out bored, which is from what I've learned reaction seeking (needy).

201,vulnerability,seduction,Why a man's courageousness is more attractive than his confidence...,59,4a4oww,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4a4oww/why_a_mans_courageousness_is_more_attractive_than/,2016-03-13 04:44:01,"Confidence is universally recognised as one of the most attractive traits a man can possess. Youll be very hard pressed to find any dating adverts by women looking for men lacking confidence. However, I would argue, based on my experience, that there is one quality that women value more than confidence. That quality is COURAGE. Confidence can be defined as A feeling of assurance, especially of self-assurance, or, The state or quality of being certain. Meanwhile, courage can be defined as The ability to do something that you know is right or good, even though it is dangerous, frightening, or very difficult. So, it would seem that the difference between confidence and courage is in certainty; confidence contains certainty whilst courage does not. Courage often involves stepping into the unknown, into seemingly dangerous or frightening situations. Why then, if courage is lacking in certainty, would it be a more attractive trait than confidence? Because courage represents the willingness to take a risk whilst confidence does not. Confidence, as valuable as it is, still operates within the realm of safety. It operates within the realm of the known. This is part of it's beauty because it allows for a definite outcome, but it is also it's limitation because it cannot operate outside the realm of the known. In order to step into the unknown it takes courage! A man who operates only in the realms of safety and the known doesnt have the willingness to take a risk. He only takes the calculated risks that he knows will succeed, which, ultimately, are no risks at all. A man who is prepared to step beyond the realms of the known for what he believes to be right and good will take any risk, and consequently his capabilities are limitless. This is the man who has courage! A courageous man has the capability to approach any woman, in any situation, should he feel compelled. He knows not what the result will be. A courageous man has the willingness to express exactly how he feels without any veil of insincerity. He knows not what the result will be. A courageous man has the openness to be fragile or vulnerable or weak, even when it is expected that he should be solid and protected and strong. He knows not whether this will mean he is perceived favourably or unfavourably. Courage opens up the doors to infinitely more possibility than confidence. And ultimately, women do not want to be limited by a man who only operates within the finite arena of confidence. Dont believe me?!? Go out and ask some female friends if theyd aspire to be with a man who is afraid to express his emotions, who is afraid to be vulnerable, or who is afraid to be real and true to the intimacy of telling it exactly how it is. They might settle for a guy like this but it certainly isnt what they aspire to. In my own life I can say that I spent a long time in the absence of courage, a long time trying to live up to the confident man I thought I was expected to be. I never allowed myself to step beyond the known. I never strayed from the well-worn path of being self-assured. This placed a definitive limit on how deep my relationships could go, on how much trust and intimacy I could inspire in a woman. When I finally found myself breaking free of the limitedness of confidence and embracing the expansive uncertainty of courageousness, suddenly, my relationships had a depth that seemed almost infinite. The courage to express myself with unreserved vulnerability inspired the trust that was required for a woman to reveal the fullness of her beauty to me. Women are dying to meet real men. Men who are willing to step into the unknown. Men of COURAGE! What does this mean practically? It means dont be afraid to express yourself if it feels right. It means dont be afraid to be in touch with your emotions if it feels good. It means dont be afraid to reveal your vulnerability in order to protect your ego. Ultimately, it means dont be afraid. Or, more accurately, whether or not you are afraid, take the actions that feel right and good in abandonment of protecting your ego. Dont expect that you have to be confident at all times. When confidence is absent courageousness takes over. Be courageous!"
202,vulnerability,seduction,"Had an awesome night out last weekend after battling a dark time of my life and it was partly because of this subreddit, so THANK YOU!",30,4adhio,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4adhio/had_an_awesome_night_out_last_weekend_after/,2016-03-15 02:17:56,"Hi! First time posting here, but being a long-time lurker on this sub. First off, i'd like to say that english is not my first language, so excuse me if i say some dumb shit haha. A little bit of context: I'm 25 years old and an introverted individual. Im a male nurse and also a talented guitarist and experienced gigging musician. My band is well known locally and we achieved sort of a underground cult status, not only because the music, but also because our powerfull and energetic live shows. Despite struggling with chronic low self esteem, I was always lucky with women. I kinda fit that bohemian-looking art-guy niche. I have long straight hair, muscle-favorable genetics and sort of a childish face. I pay a lot of attention to develop my own style when dressing, and also like to spend a lot of time grooming. In the psychological sphere, I consider myself pretty intellectual, but also kinda spiritual. I love to read about everything from physics to more metaphysical stuff, life philosophy. I developed a great sense on critical scientific reading and I love to stay in tune with new medical research, as well spending a ton of time asking myself what I think about a lot of everyday issues and human condition. The last 3 months i was fighting one of the darkest periods of my life due an abussive relationship i've had. I suffered physical and a vast spectrum of forms of psychological abuse. After finishing the relationship, i was even accused by my ex-gf of being an abuser as she was trying to hurt me even more and annihilate me socially. Thankfully, police was clever enough to dismiss her allegations (they were aware of me being beaten previously, and by analyzing her behaviour when she tried to fuck me up). They were pretty supportive, and to this day I feel so grateful to meet at that time such great professionals. The next 3 months were kinda harsh, but now i find it wasnt really a sad time. At first, i was scared of having any kind of relationship with the people around me, and become reclussive, pretty almost stigmatized for that experience. By falling in a extreme form of loneliness and hitting the buttom of all my inner darkness, i found light by struggling with pain. I decided to take charge of my life and feel proud of the scars, not because suffering hurt in my life, but for being able to wear them on my skin and surviving every dark experience which ultimately will only make me a stronger and better individual than before, willing to enjoy my life more than never. I started to do exercise and go to the library every day to keep my hungry mind satisfied. I'm a male nurse and had no job currently, so i'm right now studying to succeed on the next nurse resident tests, but also devouring philosophy and psychology stuff on my free time. I also found about this subreddit and learned everything i could about seduction, putting it into practice on the study breaks on the library. I must say i become interested in seduction not only because girls, but aiming to become more attractive on every kind of human interaction. Last Friday i had an awesome night out with friends. It was the first time i had a night off since everything happened, partly because my ex-gf trying to approach me in my favorite places (i had even spotted her on her car driving around my home trying to spy me), but i decided it was about fucking time to do all the things i was willing to do. So i spent the night with some good friends of mine and we have an awesome time. We got drunk, talked about a bunch of fun shit and did some crazy stuff. I also met a bunch of people and put my best effort on being socially desirable to everyone of them. By the end of the night, many of them rushed into me because i was so fun and witty. And yes, since this subreddit is about seduction, I spotted a few girls looking at me and talked to a few of them, after maintaining a strong eye contect. I did it because curiosity, not thinking about getting laid or searching for external validation. One of the girls i gamed that night caught my curiosity like no other. I know her for a long time, since she studied in the same nursery school as i did and i was always attracted to her since she is extremely beautiful and good at painting (i feel genuinelly attracted to art-oriented people). I never gamed her before because my low self esteem, but my vision on life and taking risks changed drastically since then. So I approached her and we both talked for more than an hour, in a intimate environment which we both persuaded. We laughed about a lot of stuff, hated on our school and went to more intimate matters, such as family, sex and things like that, while touching her and doing the triangle gaze stuff. She came closer to me as the conversation went on and maintained intense visual contact. I've felt like being gamed by her, and that was nice! Eventually, one of her friends come for us and she asked me where I was heading. She later appeared on the club I told her I was going to go. A few guys approached her, and when she was being approached, even if I was in the other corner of the club, talking with other girls or with my friends, she was looking at me, wanting to meet my eyes on her. I smiled every time I spotted her doing this and she smiled back, and rewarded her later by approaching her again and moking about the guys trying to flirt with her eye and how bored she seemed until I came back to her. What I feel proud for is for doing this shit not because being afraid of dying alone or because I wanted to fuck her, but because I was having a great time with her and I was enjoying myself a lot, honestly. I was safe in my skin. Everytime I touched her was because I wanted to do it, and everytime I triangle-gazed her and unconsciously smile back to her was because she had gorgeous lips and I was happy to know theyll be mine to kiss whenever I want if I decided to take a step up because she was genuinely interested in me. I didnt go to home with her. A friend was insanely drunk and in danger of doing things hed anyway regret and I take care of him. Friends are my priority. I must confess that, at the end I was also frankly afraid of kissing her or having sex with her because ive got some intimacy struggles since the abusive relationship, and I wasnt in the mood for it. Sex is now a difficult thing for me, and I accept it. I need more confidence to hit those lands, and need to work more on it. Anyway, i messaged her a day after, and she responded me back and said she had an great time with me, that she thought Id forgot to message her back and that she waited for me outside the pub before going to home. She stopped texting me after the last statement, I feel that she had also vulnerability problems and she was afraid of saying that. She mentioned the previous night she was trying to evade her ex-bf and that she had a hard time on that relationship. I didnt ask her more that she was willing to tell me about that, she looked slightly sad previously we started to talk and whenever I wasnt near to her. I can understand her being confused or afraid of feeling attracted to anyone else. But even if she was busy with other stuff or lost her interest on me (which I doubt) and couldnt give a fuck. Id lie if I say Im not interested in knowing her more and spent a night with her being sleepwalkers underneath her favorite blankets, but Im not losing my shit if that doesnt happen. What makes me so happy is being able to enjoy myself like I did. Planet earth is full of awesome girls anyway! I wrote this post to thank you everyone on this subreddit, because even the more common threads (like, how do I do to be likeable to this girl, etc) are a great place to develop a mentality of your own about the inner game. Of course, the external game is important, but without a good inner game you cant pretend to be liked by others if you dont think you deserve it. My favorite videogame franchise is Final Fantasy, but life couldnt be more different from Final Fantasy. Youre not gonna to meet some day a princess, which triggers a series of event which ultimately unveil the truth behind ones existence and purpose on this world, like some kind of underlying faith. Life is absurdly random and this is a great thing, because it lets you follow whatever new road you encounter. Youre gonna screw some things eventually, and maybe meet poisonous people who want you to cut your wings and paint on you a new ones, just to tell you that they did great things for you, and because of that you have debt to pay off, because no ones gonna love you better than them. I dont think anyones taking a wrong way, or commiting mistakes, as long as theyre on their way to make a life worth living for. Youre just living, and if you are realistic enough with yourself, youre building experiences which will follow you whatever road you take, and youll be proud of them someday. And maybe someday someones gonna feel proud of being with those kind of scars, because scars are sexy as hell. I do think that every individual existence trying to be a better self have a lot of valuable things, because the disposition of being happy with yourself, but still wanting to be a better human being (with a more developed moral of their own) is signal of higher morality, which subsequently have a beautiful background to flourish. The moral of the story? Amor Fati. I also wanted to write this to make sure to everyone which is having a hard time on ther lives, as I was, that you can overcome anything. Pain is an universal experience. You shouldnt be overshadowed by pain, because scars ultimately make the life worth living for, no mather how strange shit youve been through. Thank you all!

If so, you've come at the right place because that's what I'll try to answer in this post. *What is vulnerability?* Vulnerability is the fact of showing yourself as you are. In our daily lifes, many of us put on *masks* and *filters* that makes us behave differently than we would normally, mostly because we're afraid of being disliked for what we are. We want everybody to like us, so we try to please everyone and thus change the way we act depending on who we're interacting with. Thus it's obviously easier to be disliked for something you aren't than for something you are (because it hurts), the downside is that nobody will like you for what you truely are neither. Simply : vulnerability is the expression of your authenticity. *Thanks OP, but what it has to do with success with women?* Vulnerability displays a very attractive mix of both **confidence** and **sincerity**. Why? Because that's the both qualities that are necessary to, but also developped by, the act of being vulnerable. It takes guts to take the risk of being judged for who you are! That's courageous, and courage and confidence always come together. Furthermore, you can't be vulnerable unless you're sincere, since you cannot be attacked for what you are not. Why is it so attractive? Because everbody crave for confidence and sincerity. We often aren't as confident as we appear to be, so when somebody really self-confident like us, it means he's also confident in his attraction towards us. That's stable and reassuring. And if he's confident about it, he must have good reasons : that's flattering as well. Besides, we tend to trust more confidence than... actual truth! Think about when you were certain of something, but someone was asserting the opposite so confidently and with so much energy that it made you doubt, and you ended up almost agreeing with him. Just to realize few days later that it was all bullshit, and you were right. **Let's take an exemple** on what is being vulnerable and how it impacts relationships. John likes Sarah. She's an attractive girl and John see her everyday in class. She's hot. She got boobs. John likes boobs. Ok, know what? John has two choice. He can either try to go under the radar, and try to sit next to her as much as possible, follow her at every pauses, hear her complain about how the exam was too easy (let's not have received ideas) and how she her last boyfriend broke her hearth. Soon, John has become Sarah's gay bestfriend. But sooner or later, John decide it's enough : after all he has done for Sarah, she still didn't saw how kind and attentionate he is, and how much of a good boyfriend he would make! He opens his hearth and tell her he's in love with her. Sarah don't understand : why this nice guy suddenly fell in love with her? She thought he was gay. Moreover, she fell betrayed : that's why he was so kind and understanding? He just wanted to sleep with her! What a dick. Sarah ignores John for the rest of his life. John is so lonely and ashamed that he applies for the Human Mission to Mars, the NASA feels sorry for poor John and sent him indeed to Mars, where he dies, alone. Now realize that for John it's not a decent a life plan : he cannot center his life around one woman, and if he gets rejected, burn it all to the ground. John has another choice. He can assumes that he's not perfect, but well enough to get an attractive girl like Sarah. He realizes that besides becoming his best self, there is very little he can do to make Sarah more attracted. In fact, she probably has already made up her mind. John decides he will go to Sarah at the end of the class, when she's not surrounded by friends so she have no social pressure, and tell her he finds her attractive and that he'd love to know more about her. Sarah is impressed. This guy just walked up and tell her he liked her, while she could reject him at anytime! She finds the fact that he didn't try to hide his feelings nor his intentions very attractive, she's thankfull for his honesty and she decides to give him a try. They set up a date for a few days later when it's convenient for both of them, exchange numbers and part ways, both feeling like their day has just been brighten. Now Sarah could have rejected John, for multiple reasons : she wasn't into him, she has a boyfriend, she just broke up or fight with somebody, she was having a bad day... all those reasons having nothing to do with John. And by acting showing his vulnerability, besides demonstrating very attractive qualities, John also was straightforward and polarizing, which made, Sarah rejecting him or not, both of them gaining huge amounts of time by immediatly settings things straight and clear. Yes, you still need to challenge her. Yes, you still need to develop an attractive personnality. Not it won't work everytime. But what I wanna show in this post, is that you gain a lot of time as well way more solid results by showing who you are and not trying to hide anything. You'll end up attracting what suits you, and way more effortlessly than if you were overthinking in terms of *techniques* or *game*. Hope it helps! TL;DR : Vulnerability is the expression of your authentic self. It's very attractive because it demonstrates confidence and honesty, besides being polarizating. EDIT: Read Mark Manson's *Models* for more on vulnerability!"
207,vulnerability,seduction,[FR] My first approach after finally realizing that I have to take action.,8,44ooxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/44ooxb/fr_my_first_approach_after_finally_realizing_that/,2016-02-08 12:32:11,"Hello Seddit. Not sure how to make this a green post (your queue mods). I've been a long-time lurker here, for at least 2 years now. I was your typical bitch-boy that read all kinds of theory, and absolutely loved watching RSD videos (Still do), but never bothered to ever take any action. I'm 22 and I lost my virginity at 21, having slept with ~10 girls in the same year, without doing any real game. I'm VERY incontrol of my emotions. So much so, that I can produce feelings of love in my chest completely on my own without any stimulation. This gives me a lot of power when it comes to interactions, even though I haven't had tons of practice with it yet. I don't want this to be a long post, but here we go. I'm working out at my gym and I'm in the cardio room. There I spot an asian girl that just...I couldn't stop staring. I have a big-time fetish for asian girls regardless, especially fobby ones. I'm about 7 days deep into my NoFap streak (everyone has their opinions about it, I find that NoFap keeps a flame burning inside of me), and I'm blatantly staring at this girl and she catches me. However, I didn't stop looking, nor did I feel awkward. I kept looking over at her any chance I could. I think she picked up on this, because she switched from 1 treadmill to another, just so she could get a view of me. For those of you who care, I'm not the most attractive guy in the world either. 5'7, skinny, packing on some muscle but I do know I have a nice face. I believe that my blatantly obvious desire for her, sparked something in her. Men desire women, but a woman's desire, is to BE desired. Internalize this guys! It makes it so much easier to be direct with your intent and congruence. I was feeling bold and knew I was going to approach this girl. My balls were literally making me. She even switched yoga mats with someone else when I left the room for water, just to be beside me when I got back. Unfortunately, as she was on her way out of the gym I noticed she was with a friend, and my brain immediately began making rationalizations of why I shouldn't approach. I didn't. I felt like the biggest, most pathetic, waste of shit I ever have in my entire life. Complete fucking bitch-boy. The next 48 hours I literally thought about it over and over. I'm not talking about one-itis or scarcity mentality. The reason I was so upset with myself, was because I wanted something so badly, her, and I let someone I don't even know, prevent me from going after what I wanted. How can I let someone have so much power over me? I made a promise to myself, that I will never let myself feel that level of pathetic-ness ever again. I'm sure some of you know the feeling. 3 days after I first saw her, there she is, again in the gym. She left about 5 minutes after I got there, but I put down my weight and I followed her out of the gym. I tapped her on the shoulder, while I was out of breath and told her exactly what I thought. Listen, I don't have too much game, nor have I practiced, but I find myself most confident with being direct. I told her I noticed her the other day. I told her she was beautiful, which she smiled in reply to. I asked her name and held her hand briefly, while looking her in the eye and telling her that I couldn't stop looking at her the other day, and that I wanted to approach her but I didn't because she was with her friend. I was completely blunt and honest, and quite vulnerable. I got her number and hung out the next day. First we hit a bar to play some pool, but no drinks, since I quit drinking a while back. We got back to my house and we played 36 questions, which is an AMAZING way to create vulnerability in each other. We were sitting on my bed against the headboard, beside each other. I remember one moment we shared a laugh and we looked at each other, I got struck with the feeling in my stomach while looking into her eyes, that I wanted her. I'm VERY in-tune with my feelings and I believe in the law of state-transference. I went for a slow but lingering kiss on the cheek. Just one. The kiss on the cheek is deadly guys, especially if you're able to make her feel that deep lust you have for her while you do it. After that it was like nothing happened and we kept talking. Eventually my lust for her was too high and I just start kissing both her cheeks repeatedly over and over. (Mind you, this girl is from mainland China where they are very traditional and this thing is rare. In their minds, they are only allowed to kiss their ""boyfriend"") I was so overcome with lust for this girl, physically and mentally, we had chemistry. Our noses were touching and I ran my fingers along her lips, while saying ""Your lips are as chapped as mine..."" and then I went in for it. Oh my god, some first kisses are amazing. The chemicals, the rush, the passion, Jesus. Needless to say she had NO IDEA how to kiss, and I told her I can tell. I was her first kiss. I told her I don't mind and that I'll teach her, so I did. Needless to say, turns out she lives across the street from me. We're seeing each other again this Saturday. Aside from all this guys, I'm going to be VERY honest with you. When I approached her, I honestly did not care if she was going to reject me. I didn't care if she said no or if she would fuck me right then and there. What I was MOST happy and proud of, was that I did the approach. Nothing could bring me down. I will never let anything so pathetic happen again. If I forget this, life will smack me even harder once more so I can truly internalize the importance of taking fucking action. Good luck brothers. "
208,vulnerability,seduction,Tinder and you: a brief guide to success,166,46wwne,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/46wwne/tinder_and_you_a_brief_guide_to_success/,2016-02-22 06:48:18,"Tinder and other similar apps provide incredibly easy ways to meet women, particularly for those of us who are on the ""shy"" side about cold approaches. Since Tinder was introduced, I've met over a hundred women and have conversed with at least five times that many. Many of you will have had considerably more success than me, which is fantastic. There are a few key elements that I noticed breed success in this particular application. Let's start with the basics: (1) Select good photographs, particularly the primary one. The primary photo should represent the best values and features you possess. It should be the ""best version of you"" in a nutshell. After much experimenting, I found that myself in a suit but in a somewhat casual setting. For example, a photographer caught me relaxing alone after a wedding, wherein I was one of the groomsmen -- was looking nice, but not posed or forced, a gentle warm smile on my face and a cheerful background. Every element spoke of positivity, value, cleanliness, masculinity, confidence, and yet a slight vulnerability. Women key in on these elements instinctively. The remaining photographs should not detract from the narrative too much. Do: Photos with dogs or cats, photos with male friends, photos that show you doing some activity that you're passionate about, maybe a photo with grandma (but only if you're looking for a LTR with your matches). Do NOT: shirtless, flexing, bathroom mirror, dirty room, posing with tranquilized animals, posing with any attractive females, group photos only, and don't have only selfies (it looks like you have no friends). (2) Reading the signs: Initiate communication every single time. Pay attention to her bio and her photographs, generally she's trying to tell you something about herself. Never comment on her body, no matter how much she sticks her tits out. Do comment on choices and if you can discern it, comment on her values and ideas. ""Seems like you have a love affair with hoop earrings."" ""That's a nice sweater, did you make it yourself?"" These are slightly neggy but also playful. You want to weed out the super serious ones typically. If her bio is a laundry list of requirements, might as well move on. Important note: ""No Hookups"" almost always means she'll hook up. Also, the second important point: You have to be assertive, like more than you feel comfortable with. Within about 5 or 6 messages back and forth, I typically do the following: ""I have to run out and meet some of my colleagues, but here's my number, let's chat and make some plans to meet up."" You want the girls who are eager enough and brave enough to text you. It's an escalation of trust, and you should treat it as such (see next section). (3) Establishing rapport: This is always the critical element that most guys miss. They start off with ""hey sexy"" or ""sup babe?"" or ""wut r u up 2?"" That shit'll get you unmatched faster than anything. You start off polite, direct, and fun. You want a girl who is fun, right? So a little bit of gentle natured teasing or some slightly sexual jokes -- I find double entendre works really well with girls who are a bit on the dirty side, since it allows them to communicate this to you by responding in a sexual way or by feigning innocence. The best way to establish rapport with anyone is to ask targeted questions, identify what they value, then later mirror those values through statements. For example: ""What's the most romantic place you've ever visited?"" They always say ""Paris, the weather, the architecture, the food..."" You'll reflect this by saying ""I went to Rome last year, it was absolutely amazing. I spent hours wandering in the old ruins, admiring the ancient architecture. Even though I was traveling alone, it was heartwarming to see so many couples enjoying their time together. And the food... well, Italians have perfected the art of wine pairing. Are you a wine or beer person?"" This patterning of eliciting values and mirroring her values through your statements quickly establishes comfort and rapport. You shouldn't be too obvious. (4) After you've built rapport, you want to generate attraction. Nothing gets a girls ovaries cranking more than a guy who is passionate and dedicated to something. A craft, a hobby, your career, your travels, your dog, etc... express in colorful and expressive language why these things are important to you and how much you love spending time doing these things. You'll find that she'll start to pattern after your exhortations of your passion. (5) Sealing the deal: You'll want to accomplish all of this as rapidly as you can, always angling for an opportunity to get her number and make plans to meet. Seduction is so much easier once you're together, you can rely on the standard methods to proceed from there. Even if you don't K-close the first night, make an effort to hug or hold her hand if you can. Finally, when it's time to part ways, make plans for the next time. Have a very specific idea in mind, preferably something you think she'd like based on what you have learned about her. I hope that this simple guide gives you some ideas about how to improve your chances. In summary: Have good quality photos; be assertive, fun, and friendly; elicit and mirror her values; try to meetup as soon as possible; use standard in person methods to build attraction; and always have a next date plan.

209,vulnerability,seduction,"What is ""vulnerability""?",29,47agxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/47agxr/what_is_vulnerability/,2016-02-24 14:11:55,"What is vulnerability? I see a lot of people on this subreddit are confused about what Mark Mansons theory of vulnerability means. I have read Models, and I have my own thoughts. Vulnerability, as I understand it, is an acknowledgement of your weaknesses, and how you overcame them. The key part of my definition is how you overcame them. Nobody is attracted to weakness by itself, and if you tell somebody you are just weak, you have to balance it out with something strong about yourself, or they will lose attraction to you. That sounds harsh and ugly, but thats just now the world works. Of course, in a healthy relationship you need to be able to be honest with your partner and share your fears and weaknesses. But that should and can only happen once you have gotten to know each other and made a commitment to each other. When you first meet somebody, you should not bore them with tales of your weaknesses or expect them to act as your therapist, especially if there is no light at the end of the tunnel. If you met a woman and on the first night she said to you I have terrible depression and I think of killing myself every day there is nothing attractive about that at all. But if she said I used to have terrible depression and I was suicidal, but then I started doing pottery and I now feel much better you will admire her because she overcame an obstacle and became a better person for it. Imagine you got invited to a party on Jay-Zs boat. You would go, right? Sounds fun. Now, lets say you went and Jay-Z just sounded like the typical douchebag rapper. I got mad cars, I got mad hoes, I got lots of money, etc... You might be a little impressed but you wouldnt really care about or like Jay-Z. You would be bored and you wouldnt really feel an emotional connection with Jay-Z. You would just be happy that you were on a boat in the sunshine having fun. Now imagine that Jay-Z was vulnerable with you. Imagine he said something like you know, every time I go on stage, I get incredibly nervous and I fear that I am going to fuck it all up. But I go on anyway. And once Im up there, my nervousness goes away. If he said this you would like Jay-Z a lot more. Why? Well, first of all, what he is saying is interesting. You get to see the thought process of a famous rapper and the psychology of a successful person, something not a lot of people get to see. Secondly, you become more impressed with Jay-Z. If Jay-Z gets nervous, he seems like more of a badass for fighting through it rather than if performing just came naturally to him. People love to minimize the success of others by thinking well it just comes naturally to him or he was given to it by his parents. But if he did it himself, he seems like more of a badass. Third, you would be inspired. If Jay-Z gets nervous and fights through it, why cant I? You would literally become a stronger, better person for it. Fourth, you would feel closer to Jay-Z because he shared something intimate with you that youre not supposed to share. You would also feel closer to him because you probably have also felt nervous at some point in your life and knowing that Jay-Z feels the same way makes you sympathetic and closer. Fifth, you would feel closer to Jay-Z because he was being honest with you. You know he had nothing to gain by telling you about his nervousness. Now imagine if youre talking to some loser on the boat and he says Ive always wanted to be a rapper but Ive always been too nervous to try, so I didnt. That guy is technically being vulnerable but so what? Hes not attractive. In fact, he just made himself look like a bitch. Unlike Jay-Z, his nervousness 1) isnt interesting because a lot of people are crippled by their nervousness; hes nothing special. 2) He doesnt seem like a badass. 3) Youre not inspired. 4) You dont feel closer to him because, even though you probably also feel nervous, you dont want to form an emotional connection with a guy whose nervousness cripples him because you dont want to also be crippled. You want to overcome your own nervousness so seeing somebody else fail repels you, not attracts you. Finally, you wouldnt be impressed by the guys honesty because you would just think hes making excuses for not being successful. Let me be clear. I am not saying dont ever tell a woman you have a weakness. What I mean is that whatever weakness you reveal has to be counterbalanced with your strengths. If you are afraid of heights say it loud and proud, but make it clear that it doesnt cripple you or hold you back from enjoying life. Its ok to get nervous sometimes, its not ok for nervousness to cripple you. Its also fine to admit that youre not perfect. Admitting your weaknesses makes you attractive to girls precisely because it shows that you are not scared of them and you dont let them hold you back. Whats sadder? A guy who can only speak language but doesnt give a fuck or a guy who can speak 3 languages but is sad that he cant speak 10? "

I realise it isn't a generic FR and is a situation that Seddit teaches us to try not to get into, but the seduction principles are sound. FYI I'm 17 and minimal experience with girls. Very shy quiet girl who has next to no experience with guys. Met her at the start of this year. I was into her from the get go, but hadn't found seduction yet so was a pussy and did shit all until months later, which was met with a bit of resistance even though she was into me cause overthinking. So this was a real breakthrough for me. Onto the FR! Quick background: I had decided to not contact this girl because she couldn't make up her mind and it was pissing me off. I was escalating only for her to not give me any sort of signal in return, even though she liked me escalating. Her dilemma was she just wanted to be friends because we're both going to uni a little while and she didn't want to get into anything. Fast forwards a few weeks after. I cut myself off from her and I'm at one of my friends 18th, when another friend there though it would be a good idea to invite this girl over cause me and her had a thing and she lives close by. She dated the guys who's birthday it is a few years ago and they're friends now so he said she could come. She turns up and I really don't want to talk to her cause I was sick of her indecisive shit, so I go about my own thing. But everyone is bugging me to go up to her and talk, trying to tell me to, ""just do it"", which was annoying (Confidence is a non issue for me, but I just actually didn't want to talk to her). At some point in the night I just thought, fuck it I can't keep ignoring her cause otherwise people will make a big deal out of it. She was sitting down, I went over to her and sat on her lap :P. ****** Reasoning: I thought it would be funny haha, self amusement. It's bold, I decided if I was gonna do this. I wasn't gonna half ass it. Result: She says she has to go to the toilet basically immediately after I sit down hahaha (She told me after it wasn't an excuse and she really did, but it did feel a bit stink). ****** From then on, other people at the party tried to push us together, like everybody leaving but them, never have I ever's directed at us. Through all this, I was starting to catch feelings for this girl again. After all our partying just before we were going to bed at 4 in the morning, I said to her, ""I want to talk to you. Tonight, or tomorrow morning before you leave?"" She said tomorrow, but knowing her she would try to wriggle out of it. I wanted to talk to her about not seeing her at all anymore if she just wants to be friends because I couldn't just be her friend when I was still attracted to her. **I had to set these boundaries for my own sanity because I was sick of letting her sit on the fence**. I previously thought this was going too far, but now I see that I really didn't need that in my life. I was more than happy to live without her I my life if she didn't want to fool around. Tomorrow rolls around and I try to isolate her early but she has the excuse of she's too tired. I tell her, come on, let's go talk now a little later. She replies with, I don't even know what you want to talk about (A lie, she told me after that she had an idea, which was spot on what I did want to talk about haha) I only got to talk to her literally as she was leaving and only because I went up to her car, opened her door and said, ""It's important to me that I talk to you"". I talked to her about her unresponsiveness later, she said that's what she does haha. Run away from things :P. But if I hadn't gone up to her as she was leaving and said that, she would have left, I would have still not set out my boundaries and none of the fun that we both had would have ever happened. **Take chances guys. Have the balls to do the things you want to**. ********* I have to say, it was fucking hard to tell her I didn't want to see her again, (We have great chemistry and get a long really well) but it was good. I was proud to set that boundary and express myself. I guess that vulnerability for ya, it's tough but pays dividends. ********* And oh boy did it pay off in this case. After I said that we started talking more. I told her about how I couldn't deal with being attracted to her and ignore that, basically just being telling her exactly what I was thinking. I wanted to talk to her more since this would be the last time talking to her and I wanted to find out some things for myself so I can further improve, so I said for her to come out to my house and we can talk some more. She came after lunch to my house, I had the intention of just talking to her only, but I was still attracted to her. I kept playing with her hands and ears, touching her arm. Honestly, I never thought about it I just did it. I got to the point of asking her one more time if she wanted to be just friends, and so we wouldn't see each other. I think I leaned in towards her over her shoulder just after I asked because I remembers her saying, ""You always make it complicated"", meaning that I escalate haha. I found that amusing :P. From there it was easy. I framed it as, did she want to have some fun with me, or did she want to just be friends. While she was making her mind up, I asked her if she wanted to end the year with a bang ;), which was a completely unintentional pun XD. I got her lying back into me with her head on my chest, and I kind of ran my hands down her lightly, brushing her boobs. I think I went back up to grab them after that :P. It was surprising to me how relaxed she was about letting me play with her tits. So I think the lesson here is, **play to win, take risks and reap the rewards**. After satisfying my child like need to squeeze and play with her boobs, I felt like she had finally opened up to me almost fully. When I got her to stand up I grabbed her ass and she made a joke about her Latino er, 'features' ;) (A running joke between us). I kissed her all over her neck and face, traced lines on her back, played with her hair. I used to think that making out was the only thing I could do, I was so narrow minded. That day I learnt that I can do what I want. I shouldn't be restricted by my own narrow minded ness. This sort of stuff happened for the next few hours, at one point moving to her car where I learnt that boobs make a real nice pillow :P. For the first time this girl had actually showed affection towards me, all the other times she had really been on the fence. But now I had a genuine connection with her that we could share. For all you guys on the sub, that's what I hope you find. A great connection with someone you really enjoy time with, hot girls are great, but I think this sort of feeling is unique. This post really dragged on more than I thought it would. I guess the TL:DR; would be: take action, set firm boundaries, play to win and enjoy your interactions. In January I was a nervous kid who knew nothing about girls. I'm proud to have come this far and I want to keep pushing forwards and I wish all of my bros on this sub the best of luck with their own endeavours in seduction :) "

I'm new here. Also, not from Texas. I'm from California. I'm not good at introductions. Anyways, this is my first post on Reddit. Ask me if you have any questions (or take me under your wing if you are good at this stuff). I'm also planning on starting a log in 100sets once I get the chance. I'm in my mid-twenties, have had two relationships (always started by the girls showing heavy interest in me first) one for six months, one for eleven months. Also had two short exclusive ""flings."" I have been rejected pretty much every time I asked a girl out that I actually wanted to pursue (seriously, like 6/6) if not before the first date, I didn't get a second date. I was also incredibly unhealthy/overweight until I was about 19. That led to an intense drop in self-confidence, and I still view myself as the fat middle school/high school version of myself. This sub has helped me realize the importance of inner confidence and how it affects every aspect of life, ESPECIALLY the beginning stages of meeting women. I still think there is an important place for vulnerability to allow for intimacy in a relationship, and I'm incredibly marriage-minded (I haven't been trying to push things physically with the girls I have been approaching). Formerly, I pushed the intimacy/authenticity envelope too soon towards women and I think I freaked them out. My main goal right now: become less fearful in approaching women, and have a meaningful conversation with them. My secondary goal: to not be afraid of getting to know multiple women at the same time. I'm very prone to oneitis and as soon as I have a strong interest in one girl I tend to ignore the rest of the female population. *I want to get better at confidently adding value to people's lives, not objectify/take.* I have been learning to approach women for about two weeks now - only with the goal of having a meaningful conversation in the moment. Basically, if I see a cute girl but I'm running to work, etc. (no time to sit and chat), I won't approach. I should probably start trying to get numbers to meet up with them later, just haven't started doing that yet. All of my approaches are daygame. Mostly in coffee shops. **The actual story:** I'm at a Starbucks tonight, reading this sub, exploring overseas opportunities for next fall, etc. An attractive girl wearing a bright orange prison inmate jumpsuit walks in and heads straight to the bathroom. My brain stopped. I couldn't focus. The bathroom is right behind me and I was semi-worried that she was going to come out and shank me or use me as a hostage. I waited 'til she came out and as she was walking by me I asked if she was actually a prisoner and why would they let her walk around in public without a guard, etc. She went with it (which legitimately scared me for about half a second), we bantered back and forth about it, and then she told me she was an actress starring in a film about Harley Quinn. I asked her more about it, we introduced ourselves, and I asked what she did before acting. This led to more meaningful conversation for a few minutes. At one point in time she said ""I feel like I've known you my whole life."" To which I honestly replied ""No one has ever told me that before."" She had a huge smile on her face and said ""Well, we should go out sometime,"" gave me her Facebook info, then had to leave. I got a semi-sketchy vibe, so I probably won't pursue. I'm still sitting in the Starbucks typing this up - I had been waiting for a good story to share before I finally posted."

Im back in the game for less than a year right now and Im practicing as often as I can. I must admit that I have learned a lot thanks to you. Like a lot of people here I had few but amazing successes and of course a lot of failures that I don't regret. I practice seduction in social activities (specially dance) this means theres no alcohol involved. Ive noticed that the difference between a nice flirt that leads to nothing and a flirt that lead to at least a date is connection. When you connect with a girl, she invests in you. She shares with you her personal feelings. She feels understood and close to you. She feels secure and genuinely wants to see you again. For me the key of the success is definitely connection. Sometimes connection just happens naturally. But sometimes it just doesnt come. Heres my question: Do you have tips to trigger connection? What Ive experienced that works well is: - Sharing first a personal experience that shows your vulnerability - Listen to what she says and ask personnel questions, - Make her laugh I know this is pretty standard so if you could help me Thanks Ps: English is not my first language"

I am at a stage where I don't frequent this subreddit anymore, as I have reached a stage of my game that I'm happy with. But I want to discuss some basic philosophy of seddit with you. I always like to think about how seddit isn't just about picking up girls, but it's social and personal skills that you will use for the rest of your life when meeting others. I always try to relate the things we practice in seddit and apply them to normal, real life settings. Lately, I have been thinking about the workplace and whether showing vulnerability is a good idea. About me- I hate constant small talk, I like getting to know people and developing deep mutual relationships. I love the idea of strong vulnerability; I think divulging a bit of personality, not taking yourself too seriously and looking to build good connections and rapport is the most important and healthy approach to relationships. However, I have been boggled time and time again when it comes to my workplace. We have to be professional at work, that's true- but I am really struggling with getting past the small talk into more meaningful conversations with my colleagues. Whenever I show even the slightest bit of personality or vulnerability, my colleagues tend to act quiet, awkward or uncomfortable. I am currently on placements in a medical setting, and a few of my close friends on the placement have noticed the same problem with a lot of the colleagues- they tend to be superficial, reserved and very reluctant to engage in any conversation that divulges anything personal about them. I have known a few of these colleagues for as long as a year or two, and they are still the same. It's getting to a point where I am tired of trying to connect with them, and I am worried because it is making me dislike my colleagues and view them as boring, awkward and herd-like. Has anyone had similar experiences ? I guess I want to pose these questions to seddit: 1. There will always be people who don't reciprocate your outlook and your vulnerability, how should you deal with them? 2. Is it a bad idea to show vulnerability in the workplace? 3. Can you convince people to open up more to you even if they don't seem to be reciprocating initially? Here is a short scenario of what we're dealing with- I went on a few dates with one of the colleagues who was relatively popular in our year group. Initially, she stated time and time again that she ""was scared of being vulnerable"" even though she liked me. So I just played it cool and told her to ask me out when she is ready. After about a month she caves and asks me out. We go on a date, and I try to tell her a bit about my geeky side- How I like playing video games, reading popular science or interesting physics books- She responded by asking me ""That's so strange, have you ever met anyone who likes that kind of thing?"" (She goes on reddit a lot, so I was a bit confused, because I thought this kind of thing would have crowded her home page). Anyway, I asked her about her passions and interests in life, to which she replied she had none.. she just studied and went out for drinks some times. Anyway, we mutually stopped seeing each other promptly after that. I wasn't willing to date someone who doesn't have a genuine passion in life. And she didn't want to date me incase we broke up and it would ruin the ""group dynamic"" in the placement. I need help seddit, what would you do in a situation like this? "

Bren Brown has a TED Talk called The Power of Vulnerability. I think my date last night perfectly illustrated that, as well as a few other concept in pick-up. It started with a meeting at Mcdonald's to study. I'm taking a math class to chip away at my pre-med requirements, and she's beautiful but doesn't have many friends yet as she just moved back to town. Studying math is a solitary activity, so it was really just to spend time talking with her, just the two of us. As the conversation rolled on we got on the topic of Planned Parenthood. Now please, I'm not here to raise political issues, but it did play a roll in how the night unfolded. In her analytical point by point defense of PP she said ""you guys (men) have it so much easier. You don't have to deal with those decisions, you make more money and don't have to worry about those issues as much, etc, etc..."" This really hit a nerve with me, a raw exposed nerve that I didn't realize was there. And when she touched it I was 1) hurt to near-tears, 2) felt pity for her all-head/no-heart remarks, and 3) I no longer gave a fuck what she though about me. A little back story: I was engaged to be married this summer but called it off when it became clear that we wanted different things, and neither of us would change. One of our biggest issues was kids. If, and how many. For as long as I've been dating girls I've wanted to be a dad. I had dreams of children I had never even met. And then this summer those dreams faded away, and I had no control in the situation. I don't know if that desire has died in me, or if I'm just going through a phase right now. Either way, I guess it's irrelevent. So back to the story, there was something about how casually she discussed abortion that seemed to rub salt in my still open wound of not having kids. I looked her right in the eye, holding back tears, and said ""just because men don't have to face those exact same issues, doesn't mean some of us would give up all of those privileges for the joy of having children."" Now I'm a pretty big guy, and love MMA, so I don't think she was expecting such an emotional response, however it was my emotions that contrasted her analytical opinion on the matter that softened her demeanor. After a few minutes of comically awkward small talk I put my hand out on the table, palm up. She took it and I told her she was kind to try and change the topic. I apologized for looking like a ""bug pussy"" and she apologized up and down. She asked me if there was anything she could do, I told her that I could use a back rub as my shoulders were sore. I'd even return the favor. She smiled and said yes. So we went back to my place, rubbed each other's shoulders, pealed off some more clothes and had the best sex I've had in years. It's funny, as soon as I welled up at McDonalds I was sure the whole thing was a bust. I actually gave up any ideas of ever hooking up with this girl. I just wanted to speak my mind and GTFO. I think it was actually that psychic shift that led us to bed. That's my story :) TL;DR If you are COMPLETELY secure in who you are as a human being, know who you are &amp; what you're all about, and TRULY don't care what a person thinks of you (not in an asshole kinda way, but in an unshakable way), you can take a date to McDonalds, cry, and still get an F-close."
223,vulnerability,seduction,Vulnerability,8,3iyhty,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3iyhty/vulnerability/,2015-08-31 00:27:43,"Mark Manson says the only way to really attract women is to be vulnerable. I agree with this completely. The only way to build deep connections with humans is to open yourself up and be vulnerable. You can go out and try to woo women with magic lines or tricks, and that might work for a night or two, but that's a lonely experience for one to lead. The thing is, I feel like when I'm vulnerable with women, it scares them and a part of me feels it makes them see me as weak. I went through difficult times in my teens and early 20s. Most of it was not my fault and due to a poor medical diagnosis and treatment. I have a lot of shame around it, but I'm working through it and at the end of the day, I believe my experience has made me a stronger, more aware and well rounded individual than most. Sometimes it comes up when dating a girl, and I invariably hide it from them. I have made the decision to no longer hide my true self and if the situation comes up, to share it with them so they understand who I am and where I came from. But I still can't reconcile that women see it as a weakness. I opened up to a girl recently who id been dating for a month and a half. Something came up and the only way I could explain it was to share some of my past. I thought it would bring us closer but she was totally different the next time we hung out. Everything was great between us, and now she's saying ""I want to keep things casual and light right now"" due to the fact that she's dealing with a lot of raw emotion from a breakup earlier this year. I'm confused why this wasn't an issue until I opened things up to her. She said it made things approach ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" territory, and I said ""uh, I'm pretty sure this was just being a human being territory"". I'm at the best place I've been in my life, but I'm trying to figure out if I should keep aspects of myself to myself. It goes against my values, but I also know there's a time and place for things. I guess I should just say she's weak and judge mental and I shouldn't waste my time with her, but I'm still struggling. Any thoughts? "

I was studying and thought this would be a great way to share some peer reviewed evidence from my notes and textbook. We're currently talking about the ""Interpersonal process model of intimacy."" In a nutshell, it's exactly what Mark Manson and many others have been telling us, and what you should never forget. Self-disclosure. (i.e, Vulnerability) It goes on to say that the ""closeness"" felt in relationships between two people (men or women) is created by 2 things: **1) self disclosure and 2) the responsiveness of the listener.** Don't ever think that going up to the girl you're interested in and telling her every weird fantasy and embarrassing story you have is going to get you laid. You'd be completely forgetting about point number two. If her responses suck, it ain't workin'. Revealing yourself appropriately is key. What is appropriate? Well it depends on the context. How long have you known this person? Where are you currently? What's your relationship history with this person? You should consider all of these variables and more to be socially appropriate and generate positive feedback. In any relationship situation - whether you just met her or you've been dating 9 years - this is absolutely critical. It's something you can't avoid if you want to get intimate, and it's something you have to do correctly. And that's what practice is for. "

One of the most important skills in pick up and life in general is being confident in yourself and your identity.

I started to apply these principals while studying abroad last semester  and I experienced the best success Ive ever had with relationships. However, Ive returned to a rut. Im now a senior at a relatively prestigious university in the US  but I dont want the major that I currently have (I chose it before reading Models) and am not passionate at all about my schooling. I was incredibly anti-social my first three semesters here, and while Ive been taking steps to build a social life this semester, its clear that my interests are not in the classroom. Its hurting my confidence and self-esteem to go through this day-to-day grind for something that I dont want, and makes building a social and dating life an uphill battle. Its hard for anyone who hasnt struggled with these self-esteem issues to understand why I want to drop out during my senior year and pursue my own interests. Moreso, I would be the first person in my family to graduate from college and a degree from this university would make them tremendously proud. But spending all of this time in the classroom for a degree that I dont want and dont plan to use makes me feel like Im not being true to myself  and Im starting to think the best move for my personal development would be to say fuck it and follow my heart. I could fail miserably, but theres always the option to return to school and I feel it would be a tremendous life lesson. However, the advice from the few people Ive asked (family and one outside friend) makes me feel like it would be a horrible mistake and the best move is to tough it out and finish my degree. What do you guys think? **TLDR: Considering dropping out of a prestigious university to pursue my interests  afraid this is a life-ruining mistake.** In case you're curious: I would like to pursue a career as a writer. Ive always been a strong one, and have written for a popular sports blog for the past two years. Currently, I'm an Econ major. My general ambition is to try to build a freelance portfolio the next year while working part time to pay for rent and put towards my debt ($15k). After that, I would like to spend a year or two traveling SE Asia and South America while working as a writer/ blogger. "
226,vulnerability,seduction,Models - Is there such thing as being too honest and too natural?,2,3gcen0,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3gcen0/models_is_there_such_thing_as_being_too_honest/,2015-08-09 22:28:08,"Hi guys, intermediate sedditor here. Read models a while ago and it helped me ditch a lot of the canned openers and just be myself. I saw some changes - women were a lot more receptive to me when I was honest, I am getting less numbers now, but women are higher quality. This is exactly what I want because my end game is finding an amazing partner! So here's my question to you, can our game be too natural? Can we be too honest? Show too much vulnerability? I think this is an important issue to consider, how much is too much? Back story : got a tinder message from an attractive lady. She is 25 but has a mature mindset - thinking about finding the one and sharing life together, settling down. I initially started off with some text ""game"", just teasing her having a bit of fun. We exchange photos, and we both find each other very attractive. Great. Fast forward to about a week, I'm away right now, but we are set to meet up next week. Our texts have evolved into literally essays. Long long messages... Being honest about ourselves, talking about who we are. Here's the deal, I said openly to her that I felt like we have a great connection, I feel like I can be myself and not play games with you. She was very responsive, said she really likes me saying that and it's how she wants me to be. Is there a problem with this approach? Especially in a text, when the general concensus is that it should only be used for short fun playful messages. Am I showing too much vulnerability and perhaps a loss of mystery? How will it affect our attraction? "

So I tried to focus on milestones, hard times and how I dealt with the best and worst. [Part 1](URL [Part 2](URL &amp;nbsp; **#First approach is always the hardest** This is still my daily challenge, after working 8-9 hours in a desk, going out there and approaching my first set is the hardest part of the day or week. I don't really know how I do it, most of the time after finding a couple of excuses, I tell my self *really? you are finding bullshit excuses?* *Just do it!* I have done this X many times, I can do it one more time once I start walking towards to my target, my heart pounds and no matter what I say I feel the thrill and adrenaline bump which makes me feel good afterwards. Later I usually tell myself See it wasn't that bad . Usually after 2-3 approaches I am in a talkative state and it is on after that point. Usually on my 4th or 5th set of the day I get really good responses, like n-closes etc &amp;nbsp; **#First milestone** My first 35 approaches were literally open then eject. I don't remember getting any numbers when I first started, it was mostly 2-3 mins of chit-chat with group of girls. Then around 35th set I met this cool blonde chick whom I isolated immediately. She was in a large group and wanted to chat with me in the patio. After like 20-30 mins of chat, her friends came by and she told them she wants to stay here little bit more, they can go ahead she will find them later. Then we went back inside to the dance floor and first kiss close of the journey, then grinding. But she was in town for only that weekend and my friend from NYC was staying in my small apartment so I couldnt bring her back home, but that was a big boost for my confidence seeing that it is possible. &amp;nbsp; **#No fap for 57 days** After seeing good results on my first 30 day no-fap challenge, I decided to start over and not to masturbate until I get laid, no matter how long it takes. After around 25-30 days of no fap, I really forgot about masturbation, I had enough energy to do anything. &amp;nbsp; **#First Lay - missed threesome opportunity** I was doing the same thing over and over again, open then eject, this lay was pure luck of just keep opening, around my 80th approach I have seen two women in a club, early 30s, dancing in the dance floor and a dude trying to grind one of them, I took the other one, isolated her she was trying touch my cock and she told me to pin her down and fuck her brains out, I immediately got a boner. First I thought she was trolling me, then she started kissing my neck and putting my hand to her thigh, then I told her lets go to my place now. After being on nofap for 57 days, I fucked her brains out for hours, Although first I did cum like in 3 seconds I was still hard. I did cum like 4 times to her face/mouth that night, she was down for anything because I was leading and fucking her good, ass to mouth, massage oil, deep throat, anything next day she was having trouble to walk because of anal. Two days later she called me and told me her other friend that I saw in the club also wants to play, She must have told her how good I fucked her. I was sooooo excited to have a three-some with them, when they came over to my place things changed. Other one was too experienced to comparing to the one I fucked. She was teasing me playfully and making sexual jokes. We started drinking wine, she was a recent divorcee and she was incredibly fit 35 years old with fake tits who was trying ride cock carousal again. Fake tits was still down but my girl started get cranky because I couldnt lead immediately and she told me it is better if I call a friend over to fuck the Fake tits and we can have 1 on 1 with her, she never done threesome with her friend and this is not the best time to try. Fake tits started go thru of the photos of my friends, and decided to fuck one of them. My lucky bastard friend came over and fucked the fake tits in other room, while I was fucking my girl in my room &amp;nbsp; **#Friends who bring you down are not worth it** A friend of mine who is not into seduction was kinda bringing me down and laughing/smiling whenever I got rejected. This type of friends are selfish and insecure, if your friends mocking you while they dont approach anyone, that means they are insecure egoist bastards. If one can not understand the concept of being rejected, If he cant understand rejection is okay because it is nothing personal he shouldnt be around while you are approaching, he will drag you down. Also my friends were not cooperating about the venue choices, we were going to a venue of the groups choice and stay there for hours, which was not good because after a while rotations slows down, similar faces, when getting rejected other people can see it etc.. &amp;nbsp; **#Series of successes** I was still going out my friends but leaving them in one venue and bouncing other bars solo. I think in that period of time I was starting get continues success, because I was opening more sets a night, I was bouncing a lot, one problem with staying in one place is that if you get rejected other women see that and when you approach to them they shut you down, especially in small venues, but when the venue is big and crowded, or when you are bouncing a lot you are eliminating that risk. So from sets 80 to 120 I was really successful, because of my clever venue and timing choices. &amp;nbsp; **#Demographics** Again choosing the right venues or spots increased my success ratio, moving from traditional american bars to high end places increased my success, there are a lot of foreign girls(mostly european) in those type of places thats one reason, second I was improving and learning from my mistakes, third competition is not too high, because most man are either dont wanna be seeing try hard or basically pussies who cant approach. &amp;nbsp; **#Mediocre Game, hit or miss** Until my 250th set it was hit or miss. I was getting laid every other 20 approach or so. In the bars and clubs I was either getting incredibly good results or I was ejecting immediately. Then on youtube I have encountered sasha daygame and daygame.com and james marshall etc This guys were being direct on the street, stopping walking sets and getting numbers, Seeing Yad ,who is pretty ugly dude - no offense Yad- n-closing models on the street without any routines what not, blew my mind, and I decided to daygame on weekends. &amp;nbsp; **#Daygame figuring stuff out** Daygame definitely helped to improve myself, becoming, direct bold and caring less, my results in terms of n-close ratio was also high. My confident boosted, it affected my night game too, I started using less routines and canned stuff. &amp;nbsp; **#Hardest Times** After started doing daygame around(250ish set) next 100 sets or so I was too outcome focused, I was getting tons of phone numbers but I was not getting laid from those numbers. Also going out every weekend to the same spots coming back home alone, I started get depressed again, this time purely because I was focused on outcome. I was also dating with girls I have met thru this journey. One day after a german girl I was kinda dating dumped me, I didnt wanna go out, then just before midnight I told myself, come on dude , you never know , just go out and enjoy. That night I met an amazing woman whom I had 5-6 months relationship and due to some other factors we had to break up but It was an amazing experience in my life. I guess to be able to say Fuck it and without caring about the outcome, going out there and enjoy the process is the best way to get thru hardtimes. &amp;nbsp; **#Worst set** there is a lot of it, literally tens of it maybe even more than 100, while doing day game there is a lot of women who dont stop to talk with me, or just say no and walk away etc this still happens a lot to me. I just dont care about it anymore. The worst one that I can recall was that one day set I did Yad Stop she laughed at me loud and sarcastically and walked away, that was really weird In bar or clubs, there were a lot of times that sets I have approached didnt understand what I was talking about due to combination of my accent and loud music, or they are basically in a bad mood, or place is a sausage fest and every other dude is approaching them it is hard to stand out, list goes on and on I just dont take rejection personally. The worst one I can recall was that a girl acted like I didnt exists because I tried to talked to her from the side next to bar, It was a loud club, I repeated myself like 3 times, she didnt acknowledge it, I went up to talk to someone else immediately, because her behavior did hurt me like a motherfucker. &amp;nbsp; **#Best sets** Best night set: One day I went out solo to a bar that is close to my place, getting drinks at the bar, I kinda listened convo of the couple next to me, it sounded like they were on a first date , and the guy was literally interviewing her. Then guy goes to restroom like 2 mins later, I was still waiting for my drink, I turned and made a joke about either he was a blind date or a tinder date, turns out it was a tinder and she was not enjoying the night, I made a joke that she should ditch him and have a blast with me tonight. I jokingly said Id promise to find all the people who are having a tinder date tonight in the bar and telling them we finally find you guys, now we can have a foursome. We can watch their reactions. It was a weak joke but it made her laugh, then her date came back. I left the bar, opened a couple of other sets some of them hooked what not, after like 20 mins later just before I leave, I see that girl from earlier tinder date was wandering alone, when she saw me she waved her hand and came to talk to me, after a short chit-chat we bounced to another bar together where she encounter her close friends. I had to talk to her friends like 5 mins then I suggested her to bounce, she came with me, I played a scavenger hunt with her in the bar. Then invited her to back to my place. Turns out she was a squirter who loves deep throat. That was my first squirter and I had one of the best sex in my life, every time after I cum her face she was whispering that how bad she wants to swallow more of my cum and giving me a massage to relax then giving me another blowjob and licking my balls etc she was really easy to please as well, almost every-time I penetrated her little bit hard she was shaking like crazy, moaning loud and having an orgasm, seeing her like that making me hornier This set was the best because it rewarded me in too many ways: going out solo, talking people next to you around the bar, being friendly, convincing a girl who was on a date to bouncing another place, being friendly to obstacles(her friends), same night lay, amazing sex &amp;nbsp; Best day set: Walking around east village in NYC, I saw this tall blonde incredibly hot girl, she was little bit over 6 foot, wearing a black stripped white dress showing her long legs and deep cleavage on top, my friend thought she must be a model and he literally pushed me to the set, she was walking really fast and had a poker face. I stopped her, told her I think she looks nice, I had to come and say hi, she was surprised then turned out she was incredibly friendly. My friend was right, she was a model. She was visiting the city, so I was. She didnt know anyone but other models. She kept talking about modeling, but I had this unimpressed, questioning face, even though my heart was beating so fast and I was excited inside, I tried to keep cool and teased her about nothing going on her life besides modeling, she was letting modeling define her, I jokingly said I though there were more to her than modeling, she immediately started qualifying herself, she is not one of coke-head party girl type models, she use modeling to travel the world and run her food and travel blog on the side, how she is a record nerd and love good music, educating herself to become a food guru etc after like 7-8 mins of conversation I was not sure about instant date I honestly dindt wanna get rejected because she might said she was busy but I told her I am taking her out tonight, hand my phone to her to enter her number. These are her words You, sir, have huge balls. I really like confident guys, Id love to have a drink with you. Walking away from her with her number in my phone I was on top of the world. That feeling was enough to believe me to continue what I am doing. Well same night I was leaving NYC so I couldnt meet up with her and she was from Sydney so never seen her again. &amp;nbsp; **#Comparing my first sets to my most recent sets** Over time time there was incredible developments in terms of my inner game, my confidence is boosted, I dont take rejections personally. My body language changed a lot, strong eye contact, I am way more aware of what I am doing and how she is receiving what I said to her, so I guess it could be called self-awareness. I am much more confident to take the lead in any situation. They get the vibe of that I am really good at sex too. So lets say when I first begun this journey when a woman was interested in me, chances to take it further with her was 10%-20% , now it is 70%-75%. &amp;nbsp; When I first started doing this, I would sweat a lot, I would not keep the eye contact, eye would nervously smile a lot, sometimes even I would get a blush. I would wait her to like me and show me stronger IOIs, I would be less confident to make the next move etc &amp;nbsp; Now I make strong eye contact, I smile only when I first approach and if there is something funny, seriously it took me 500 approaches to realize I am smiling too much during the interactions. &amp;nbsp; In terms of what I say to my target changed a lot too, I used to use only canned stuff and it would throw me off a lot, because other people might used canned stuff on them, they would give an unpredictable answers etc.. Now I just follow a pattern, like Approach,tease,connect and close. Like more or less standard blueprint of seduction. Difference is I make a lot of assumptions and teases. &amp;nbsp; I am becoming a better man everyday and getting closer to my goal of being that guy *-a strong, high status, attractive exterior (lifestyle and looks), fearless, and able to open up and share your vulnerable side with her (and theoretically, only her). Basically strong, bad boy who doesnt really care and have abundance of options share his vulnerability with her and she thinks she accomplished something really important. During the process she gets small rewards (admitting she is the only one made him feel like that for a long time, introducing her to your parents) , it makes her to work harder for the goal-* &amp;nbsp; I hope this answer a lot of questions, I know most of the guys relates to me, because their journey is similar to mine so you guys dont hesitate to ask me anything, not sure if this was the type of post you guys were expecting.

I think it has become so big, I can barely show them when I am around people (even friends). But then I am watching TV or a movie, at a moment which might be moving for some people I am actually dropping tears and listening to music so beautiful and sad I am feeling my eyes get wet. I dont know if I just have not learned how to show my emotions so I have to show them when nobody is watching. It is not normal, that I am sure of. I have become better in a lot of aspects, become a better person and improved my life tremendously with the help of this community. But hiding my emotions, hiding my vulnerability is hurting my attraction alot I think. I have become this cold robot, following rules and guides, but have lost my humanity (or my masculinity) along the way. From what I have gathered so far it is okay to show how you feel, truely, without false intentions in mind. Make yourself vulnerable and the women will listen, stay and what ever comes of it. I just dont know how. Sitting here watching whatever and feeling my eyes go wet... wishing somone would share this moment with me. Showing that I am capable of feeling something. Maybe it is just the desire to actually share my feelings with something, be it a girl or a good friend. Have not had that kind of talk in a while. Just hoping some of you can actually relate to that kind of situation and might be able to help me get out of it..."

Looking at the comment section I saw a lot of comments which I agreed with but they were mostly people calling the guy a douche, other comments were just people throwing out random labels at each other such as ""You douche"" or ""How can you hate on op you white knight"" also op himself said a few things that made me dislike him a little such as ""I'm rubber your glue, you close pussies and I open them"" something in that sense. And then I finally found what I was looking for and why these posts bothered me so much and it's regarding Mark Mansons theory about vulnerability. Here is the full link to the article in his blog URL These op's were talking A LOT about shit tests, and how the woman keeps trying to play with them and manipulate them, so for each thing the woman said they had some awesome comeback. some comments from the women were really manipulative and shitty which the OP responded with a manipulative comeback, in others the woman just probably asked a question and the OP was sure its a manipulative comment and gave a nice comeback, the thing is - this comes out as very try hard and needy. You constantly think someone is shit testing you. so if you talk to a manipulative woman instead of calling them out for the shit tests and leave, you keep on playing this manipulative game and end up dating a huge drama queen(which is what you are also) or you give a non manipulative woman a cool comeback and she is turned off because you behaved like a dick for no apparent reason or you just came off looking really try hard.

231,vulnerability,seduction,My POV on online foreplay towards offline oral sensation.,0,3eb95f,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3eb95f/my_pov_on_online_foreplay_towards_offline_oral/,2015-07-23 21:38:59,"I hate meeting someone online / texting. It's too limited to get into subjects, you miss 90% of possible interaction/feedback and 98 other reasons.. Modern times being though, text is a frequent starting point so focus on intention and 'time to market'; get her (or him) out and about, for you. Intention; meeting in real life so embrace all richness of who you are, to find out if we click, feel comfortable, have flow. You make this desire for a date clear in first text. You don't say you don't like texting, but you prefer offline cuz that's where your focus is. You can't pay full attention, you prefer full life vs digital, so think 'slow-texting' a few long messages a day. You don't want to be her constant available direct chat buddy whenever she needs a dopamine fix. Your texts are truthful, playful and open enough so she notices you show self-awareness/vulnerability/goals (don't be a king; flaws connect). Its about who you both are, where you've been, and how/where you want to go. Respond to the small details she drops about her; if you are not curious about her as a individual on life journey/experiences, she won't open up to you and the 'we' wont feel comfortable. Speak up/deal with all awkwardness throughout the texting; yes we both know its odd to meet like this. Curiosity vs time to market So you're open but not fully available and cant express yourself fully in text. So about each shared interest or topic you find; curiosity remains and will cause a increased need to meet. All you want is for her to get out and about, on the market, at a certain time/place so you can meet her. Arousal may be tickled, be comfortable with your sexuality. It's not all information exchange and we certainly shouldn't get near the long term outlook track, you havent met her. We all love love and with each partner these grounds can be a new first time, cuz yes, for the 'we' it is the first time. No need to hide that curiosity and those desires either. You want to start playful though and don't get ahead of yourselves, again; you haven't met. -- Oral sensation So you're texting and have to work a lil to get her available for you to meet her. Throw in a surprise/extra value to refocus the attention and tension. Premium quality filled chocolates; the stuff that you have to search a bit for to get your hands on, this is your oral sensation surprise. The only way to find out what the surprise is, is to become available to be met. You tell her you will bring her a very tasty surprise and escalate/play from there. She may respond well to the 'very tasty surprise' but at least be curious/ask about something other than personal information exchange. In reply you note it's a true oral sensation. Play and mingle between answering her curiosity with describing the flavours you selected and double meanings over a span of xx till she is ok for meetin. In general: you tell her you're getting it on day x, and it you don't know how long the product survives (she thinks expiration date, I think about eat it myself). Things like; ""it may be cherry or pure passion"", ""It's cheesy, maybe creamy"", ""It's vegatable x,y,z"", ""Your tongue will go all over"",""if it gets hot it'll get very messy""; i think you should be able to make enough conversation about this, just do not reveal; this will place some focus on the surprise, give you some control, and take tension off if there is any. The point is to give her space, be holding yourself back a bit, but be assertive about intention. How you reveal the surprise on the meeting is up to you. My rant is done. TLDR: In texting meets for date; Buy chocolates with personal selected stuffings. Dont reveal the ""Very tasty surprise"" untill meeting (which gotta be fast cuz maybe tasty has expiration date). Textplay with 'its passion or cherry' 'oral pleasure' 'maybe cheesy' 'very much tongue activity, you'll love it'. Tickly curiousity, arrousal, get her to be available to be met. Edit: During the date you'll or she will ofcourse ask; how does it taste?"
232,vulnerability,seduction,"Male bisexuality, game, openness, vulnerability?",5,3f2ibo,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3f2ibo/male_bisexuality_game_openness_vulnerability/,2015-07-30 05:47:32,"I'm bisexual but generally more attracted to girls than guys (maybe 80/20). In addition I have had sex with girls but not guys (yet). For most of my life I just passed as straight, since that was fairly convenient. However in the last year I've started to notice that my lack of openness about being attracted to guys has caused some anxiety, so I told most of my friends. (I have several fairly serious ""secret"" things in my life that not many people know about, and I'm in the process of trying to rid myself of the repressed emotions this causes.) This summer, I'm in a new city with a new crowd of people, so I've experimented with being more open in general with my sexuality. I've had mixed results so far. Many girls seem very receptive to the idea, and I'm convinced one even wouldn't have slept with me if I hadn't told her. Whether this effect is something about the novelty factor or just the demonstration of vulnerability, I don't know. However, with guys I've had a fair share of awkward experiences. My friends seem to show some sense of uneasiness whenever I for example comment on the attractiveness of a guy I see. In addition both my male and female friends sometimes appear to treat me as more of a 'beta' than they did before. I'm trying to cultivate this 'alpha bisexual' image (like I WILL FUCK ANYONE MUAHAHA) but I'm not sure how to do it or if it's possible. Part of the problem is that unlike with gay or straight males, there is really no role model in society or my social experiences to rely on. Also my confidence about the whole matter isn't quite up to snuff yet. Does anyone else have experience with this issue? Is it possible to have mad game for both guys and girls and be open about it?"
233,vulnerability,seduction,A possibly alternative style to game:,13,3a2vja,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3a2vja/a_possibly_alternative_style_to_game/,2015-06-17 06:14:48,"My goal for this post is twofold: 1) I want to offer a my unique style with women that is a little different that what I see in a lot of the posts on this subreddit, and 2) I want to gain insight on why it works for me or what the theory behind it is. If you guys have any insight I would really appreciate it. A little background: I was always a natural with women. I think it has to do with being raised primarily by my mother and having an emotionally and physically abusive father. I learned to trust women more and naturally connect with them. This upbringing made me connect more with women than men. I don't do well in group settings and until college I had a terrible time connecting with men (it literally felt homosexual to connect with a male friend), but one on one with women I did very well. This is partly because I'm an above average looking guy (when I'm in shape, not currently right now because I've let myself go). I've had many very beautiful women tell me I am handsome, charming, funny, intelligent, call me a player (which I later on tell you the perfect response) and every other compliment you would want a woman to give to you. My style: Distant yet vulnerable - I don't agree with everything a woman says just because she is pretty. I even at times piss a woman off. I think this is a huge advantage. If you want to differentiate yourself you need to disagree. Not to be a dick, but be unapologetically firm in your beliefs. Sometimes this will just piss a woman off. It happens, but usually those are the girls that are too stuck up to even consider another person's ideas. I'm kinda a closed off person naturally. I have some trust issues. So I hold back. This goes along with not always agreeing with a woman. I don't differentiate between her less attractive friend and her when I interact socially. I'm always holding back. Sometimes its best to create that tension. Make her wonder why you aren't devoting all the attention to her. What I do though is put myself physically next to her. I don't establish interest by socially interacting with her more so than others. I start out more slowly. I just stand next to her, act natural and hold off for a bit. I like to play a little longer game. I've had some success with being really direct and I definitely open up the group, but I usually open one of her friends, be really social and demonstrate value. I like to tease her a bit and get her imagination going. This comes to the part about vulnerability. When I do strike up a conversation with her I usually spend a little time on the basics, where she works, ect. But I quickly enter into a deeper conversation. I might ask her what are her goals in the next five years. Here's an important point though. I'm not just interviewing her. I will usually add in that it really fascinates me to hear what people's goals are. I honestly let her know that I'm interested in other people. It's completely genuine because I would ask a guy the same question. The point is to go deep early on and to elaborate why you are going deep. This allows you to break social norms, i.e. going deep fast, while at the same time expressing who you are. I find that 9 times our of 10 its really hard to express your deep down values, but amazingly most people are all the same. She will usually have the same feelings and will love you for it. Just connect. Every guy on here is a deep enough person to go out and research how to better their love life. You're on average probably more educated, maybe have battled with social anxiety, depression, fear. All these things make you a deeper person and girls connect with deeper guys. On one extreme you can talk about something superficial like the weather, on the other extreme you can talk about the problems you had growing up with a bad father. It of course takes social awareness to talk about these problems. But if you can do it without seeking validation and you gauge whether she is deep enough to understand these problems it will work out for you. The point isn't to spill all you problems to a girl its to connect on a deeper level. It can be something simple such as common interests in music. Overexagerated Confidence in a humerous manner: Once you've connected, it's time to get to the fun part. This is where I shine. I have always been a playful confident guy. I was definitely arrogant in highschool which for little immature teenagers works, but in college I did some hard thinking and changed. Initially I lost confidence. I realized I wasn't perfect, I wasn't the most handsome guy, I wasn't the smartest person on the planet, ect. But the thing I eventually learned was that with a playful attitude you can get away with saying almost anything and you still get the benefits of being perfect. Here's where I think guys can get the most: first, its important that you keep in mind that you must have a legitimate connection going to do this. You can't just walk up to a girl on the street and jokingly say your the most handsome guy in the world and that you have to beat women off of you with a stick. Its just plain old weird. However, just the other day I deeply connected with a bartender and asked her what was the biggest problem in her life she gave me a serious answer that was actually really sad. She then asked me what mine was, so to break the tension: I sighed, got a really sad puppy dog look on my face and said ""women are always objectifying me and using me as a sexual object"". She laughed so hard it was amazing. This does two things. It highlights your humor and it puts the idea in her mind that women are after you. Now trust me. If you just straight out said you were a player she would roll her eye's and think your a loser. Humor makes even absurd statements seem real to a girl. Another example: The same bartender said what's that smell? I quickly go ""I don't know, if it smells like a handsome guy its probably me, otherwise its someone else"". She laughed like crazy. Now I know it sounds cheesy, its just a matter of personality. I naturally have a cocky funny vibe and she knows I'm just playing. I'm not the best looking guy. I'm about 30 lb's overweight currently. But that makes it even funnier. I'm in a much better position giving all that than if I would have just sat there and said I don't know what that smell is. It's crazy but the things that are your biggest weaknesses when exaggerated in a positive light become your biggest strength. Girl's love to laugh and honestly all you have to do is playfully exaggerate your qualities in a positive light. Its easy humor. I'm no comedian. I just grew up with a certain personality that was funny and resonates with women. But you can you the exact same sort of humor. One time I had like an hour long conversation with a girl about my dick. I gave him a sexy name. Now she of course asked me how big he was. Truth be told: not the biggest little guy in the world. So I didn't lie. I said: ""he's not the biggest guy on the block, but ladies sure do love him and he gives excellent mouth messages"". Instant lay, and boy did he message her mouth! It's crazy: I don't know why more guys don't do this. I'm not super alpha, not tall, but I can joke like a motherfucker about being a crazy badass and riding my harley on the weekends with my biker gang and all the tattoos that I have that she can't conveniently see unless of course clothes were off. What I'm trying to get at is I don't see this played up on reddit so much. It's a great way to highlight your humor, you can totally overcome weaknesses, it's easy. Now you must always remember to mix it with an initial distance and independence, a deep connection and a playful attitude. I hope this helps some of you. It's gotten me laid many times, I get called a player, charming, have had girls tell me I have a really intelligent face (weird comment but happened multiple times) As promised I'll tell you how to respond to the player shit test and ""We are not having sex"". As far as the player thing goes, this usually happens when we are walking back to her place. She say something along the lines of ""what are you some type of player?"". I stop her in her tracks, grab her face between my palms, look her straight in the eye and with a serious tone say ""I just really like women and thought you're really beautiful"", then kiss her really passionately, put a big grin on your face, and grab her hand and take her home for pleasure time. As far as the we are not having sex resistance: easy, just say you honestly don't care about sex and you just want to make out with her then kiss her. Now I know I may get some flack for this, but it really works. Its outcome independence. It makes a woman want to fuck you even more. It has worked literally 100% of the time for me. Trust me if she is taking you back to her place you have already won the battle don't be an idiot and be a totally AFC that argues when she doesn't want sex. I think it works for me because I honestly don't care. It's genuine. I'm not as horny as I was when I was 14. I like sex, but its a bonus. I just like meeting new girls and making out with them. Sex is good, but to be honest it's not the end of the world if I don't get laid. Girls love this. All in all, I know this was a long post that I hope a lot of you got something from. Comment if you have any experience with this style or know why it's working. I've been on seddit for years off and on but I don't see this kinda stuff on here. But it works for me and its easy to implement so I think you guys should give it a try. tl;dr: you can get away with the biggest flaws if you connect deeply and exaggerate yourself in a positive, playful way"

I feel like I put too much pressure on myself. I read this thread and everyone says things like always get a kiss on the first date or you fail, always try to fuck, etc. The puts a lot of pressure on me. Another thing, I feel like if I ask the girl on a date she's gonna think I want a serious relationship or that I'm committing to her. The entire thing stresses me out and makes me anxious. Is this an issue of vulnerability? Or an issue of giving way too many fucks? How do I get over this irrational fear of asking a girl out on a date?"

237,vulnerability,seduction,"No matter how bad you think it is, if you invest in yourself, you will progress.",616,3bicwv,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3bicwv/no_matter_how_bad_you_think_it_is_if_you_invest/,2015-06-29 23:48:03,"Hey guys, gonna talk about myself so that you understand where this is coming from, before I get to the seduction part. I'm 23, a total noob in seduction, I've discovered this subreddit about 2 weeks ago and have jumped straight into it since. I'm a college dropout, former gaming addict, one year ago I was 123 lbs for 5'11"", looked like a ghost, had a lot of acne and had ZERO confidence. I dropped out of college out of depression and because I was just losing money and not actually going to classes, but playing videogames ALL day, barely eating, having suicidal thoughts etc. So basically my life was horribly empty, and I didn't have anything going for myself. I also have a weak facial structure, so I was on the bottom of the bottom of the male attractiveness. I felt like I had nothing going on for me, except one thing I was sure of. I'm an extremely smart person, and I'm socially smart as well. I get people, I can empathize, I'm funny and I can connect with almost anybody. But all that was totally nullified by the fact that my self confidence was at 0, and I refused to meet people or even go out of my room, having terrible anxiety attacks just to go out and buy groceries..... Long story short, out of despair one day I broke my thousand dollars computer and the screen etc, and I told my dad I needed his help and went back to living with him. That's the best decision I've ever taken, and he supported me like I never thought someone could. I started going to the gym once I got a bit on my feet, while being tremendously anxious but determined to make a change. It was fake it till you make it mentality, I was terrified of going out there but I did, and eventually the fear vanished. I put on 30 pounds since then, and I look like a fit human being, not like a ghost anymore. Feeling good about my body helped me tremendously but I still had major anxiety and no social life, but I was able to function as a person again, leave the house without being terrified of the outside. Getting rid of my acne was the second best thing that I did. For those of you who never had bad acne, it's an absolute nightmare, especially if everything else in your life is not working out as well. I'm convinced that if I treated my acne years ago, my life would have been drastically different. Anyway, I just picked up the regimen on acne.org, I applied it religiously, which was hard for me because I've never had any good habits before so I had to force myself to never miss an application and my acne vanished. My skin is almost perfect now and is definitely something I don't think about anymore. You'll notice all I'm talking about here are changes in my appearance but it's because I really don't think I would have been able to change my mentality before drastically improving my appearance, because I'm self conscious like everyone and I wouldn't have been able to be confident without being somewhat satisfied with my looks first. Once my looks started to improve, everything else did. Part of who I really was, an extrovert and social person that likes to go out and communicate resurfaced. And it was hard at first, but I reconnected with a lot of friends, putting myself out there, calling them, showing them interest. This was the second most important part, living again, socializing. I have the luck of having made great friends in the past before all crumbled, and I was able to reach them again and lean on them to get back on my feet socially. I would be extremely nervous at first, hiding it and acting like everything was alright, and as weeks went by I was finally able to go out again without anxiety. I was forcing myself to be as honest as I could as a cure, having to tell people you meet at parties that you're a drop out and currently doing nothing with your life but trying to get it together is a hard thing to do, but the more you do it, the more you realize that you don't care and they don't either, if you're a good person it's all that matters. All in all, I became a social human being again, but I was still extremely unsatisfied, because I had had 0 interaction with a girl in 5 long years. I wasn't a virgin, but I only had sex twice prior to that so I only knew that I was able to insert my penis in a vagina, but no more. I had no experience talking with girls, flirting, dating or anything, and at 23 years old, it was something I was extremely self conscious about. I also craved attention from girls, craved a kiss, a touch, a word, an interaction, and most of all, a girlfriend. So I was extremely, extremely needy. And despite being needy, I would not dare make a move or show interest in any girl, because I wasn't confident enough for it, and didn't want to be vulnerable to anyone. Same with my friends, I was going out with them, but never actually really letting go, but as I said I'm really socially smart so I would blend in really well. All that was leaving me almost as depressed as when I started to change, despite all the insane progress I had made. For me my life was still boring and disappointing, and not worth living. So I made a deep introspection. Who am I. What do I want. Why do I hinder myself so much, why am I so mean to myself, why am I different. For me, normal people were heroes, aliens. I couldn't understand why life seemed so easy for them and so hard for me. And then I realized I had to let go. That my life was my story, that I was the only one living it, and nothing else mattered. That everything is fucking futile and all the problems I thought I had were purely illusions. Of course, this didn't happen overnight and it is still an ongoing process, but it's a belief I created and that I strongly hang onto. I started expressing myself more freely, my emotions, my desires, I laughed openly, stared at who I wanted to stare, went where I wanted to go, and talked to who I wanted to talk to. And it only confirmed that belief. Nothing bad happened to me, I put myself out there, showed vulnerability, and it was all good. This was a HUGE change in my mentality. I started having hope. I can change, I will change, I will become who I am and who I want to be. I reconnected with myself. Started playing the piano again, playing soccer again, calling some more friends I hadn't spoke to in years, and taking care of myself. And then I got interested in seduction, because I was still really craving an interaction with a girl. I discovered this sub, and I picked up models by Mark Manson. This book is amazing, for someone like me who understands social dynamics pretty well and is socially aware, it was like opening a treasure. It is all laid out, and it is true. In a 2 weeks span, just by being honest in my intentions, and confident in my actions because I simply don't give a fuck anymore about futile things, I have had 3 makeouts and 2 lays. I'm still seeing one of the girls as a FWB and I have a date tomorrow with one of the girls I made out with, who is a 9/10. I would NEVER have thought I could ever get on a date with a girl like that. In fact, about 4 months ago I met her at a party, when I was still really self conscious and just faking it, and I had dreams about her for weeks after we spoke once. The most important thing is I realized how not being needy is important when interacting with girls. It really allows you to be more honest and confident, because you're not dependent on the outcome, and you're able to show your real intentions without apology. In the beginning we texted each other, and I was fucking anxious when she took more than 20 minutes to respond to a text, or about if I said the right thing or used many emoticons etc. Then in the meantime I got involved with more girls, and I started to care less and less about her, and about any of the other girls, to the point that I don't even think about them at all when I'm not interacting with them, while about 2 weeks prior I had knots in my gut the whole day thinking about her. Confidence and honesty : I hooked up with a girl on tinder, we tried to meet each other but it didn't happen. Then she asks what I'm doing tonight etc, and we had been texting on and off for a week and I was getting tired of playing games and futile texting. So I texted her ""Hey I'll be honest, I just wanna fuck. I can come over to your place later tonight and we can have sex. If not, I think it's best we just leave it there."" I really didn't give a fuck about the outcome while sending this text, and guess what, she liked it. If I cared about her response, I would never have sent this text. That confidence got me laid the same night, at my dad's place. I also texted her that I don't want to deal with the situation with my dad at breakfast and that she'd have to leave. After we had sex, she told me she knew she would like me because I was so straightforward and it she loved it. I would never have thought about all that before reading models or this sub or becoming outcome independent. Basically having options, activities to do, friends to see, other girls to talk to, having a life basically, that is not dependent on any girl, allows you to be confident in your intentions and show them without apology. That was a huge discovery for me, and I'm loving it. I'm happier than I've ever been, and I'm really motivated to get my life back on the track. PS: Sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to get all of this off my chest. Edit: I also want to add that I haven't used any of the pick-up techniques to interact with girls, I don't like them and I don't believe in them because they don't align with who I am. I don't want to use a line, or prepare topics of conversations, or any tricks, I just say hi and stay natural, or say something I thought was interesting or noticed about her or what she's doing. I believe it is much much better if you're good at expressing yourself and making conversation, which was always my strong point."

Not avoiding the feelings, because of fear of her, and thus becoming nervous and anxious and weird. Lust makes you feel more dominant and confident. * Being Real - Authenticity. Putting your honest self out there. Not playing a character named ""alpha, cool man"". But rather being the most alpha and cool version of yourself. * Not being a pushover - Having standards that derive from your high level of self respect. You wouldn't put up with genuine disrespect and bullshit from even your perfect 10. * Not putting her on a pedestal - While respecting women, realizing that you're inherently ""worthy"" to fuck them. Believing it's not just you seeking her approval. * Ability to Have and show emotions - You can express being infatuated, you can be sad, and everything in-between. As long as it's not weird or a guaranteed turn off, you have no problem showing a vulnerability. * A sexual vibe - Having a sexual self esteem, and knowing that girls are not disney princesses. Knowing that their minds are dirty and they have needs. * Dominance - While being truly empathetic to her emotions and wants, staying firm in what you want and where you want to go. When the train that is the seduction switches onto the wrong track, you don't mentally shrug your shoulders and accept the direction you don't want...You mentally hit the table and think 'no, not what were doing, let's get back on tack.' * Not taking things too seriously - The ability to sense the humor in things, and in yourself. To not try too hard. To be more prone to shrug your shoulders smile, laugh...than you are to get mad, depressed, and freak out. ... These are sort of a rough order of importance. Especially with confidence being first. The ones below it won't be mastered just because you have confidence, but they will definitely be kickstarted. Comment if you've ever struggled with one of these, and now you don't. Tell everyone about it, because that struggle is probably pretty common here. Comment your story, an epiphany you had, some experience or whatever changed your view on yourself or the world that helped develop that trait in you. Also comment if you have any questions or any traits to add. Not gonna say this is a ""fully explained and complete list of inner game traits."".. because it's not. So feel free to ask and add. "

One of the most important pieces of advice I can give: Dont waste time in someone who isnt actually interested in you. Just because she is hot, we get this idea that we must have her. Stop that. Man up, say who you are, be honest about who you are, and let some of the women walk right away from the start. Women are looking for men who are authentic. If that includes something that is awkward or uncomfortable to talk about, its all the more intriguing. Not caring about being judged and showing true vulnerability is a massive aphrodisiac."

Advice needed!",1,3744p0,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3744p0/for_those_who_have_read_models_advice_needed/,2015-05-25 04:26:56,"There's a girl I genuinely want to hook-up with. We've hung out twice and I haven't made a move, aside from slight touching (which she didn't really respond to - somewhat neutral to it). I haven't made a move for two reasons: the first part is that she hasn't really given me the green light to make a move (it can be pretty obvious when a girl wants you to kiss her) - which leads into the second part: fear because she doesn't seem too interested so rejection is a high probability. I'm fairly certain that she's attracted to me, but the second time we hung out I discovered that she may have a boyfriend. It's probably why she's so hesitant to give me signs of interest. She has never mentioned the boyfriend but we were on her computer and her iMessage kept popping up with messages from a guy saying ""I love you so much"", ""baby...."", ""can you call me"" etc. So I'm about 90% certain that she has a boyfriend. Anyway, she's no dummy and can totally tell that I've been hitting on her and that I've been trying to be funny. She can tell I don't just want to be friends, but since I've been so indirect about it, I'm pretty certain it's turning her off, which is fine. This leads me to what I want to improve on. Vulnerability. Rather than just going for the kiss (which I know defines vulnerability), I kind of want to clear the air about the boyfriend. I want to lay it out on the table and tell her ""I'm interested in you, but I'm pretty certain you have a boyfriend. But the fact you have a boyfriend does not change the fact that I'm interested in you."" This is as true as it gets and how she responds to it wouldn't really bother me. She might never speak with me again and I'd be okay with it because this is for me and I'm trying to improve. I know it is highly unpopular to hit on a girl with a boyfriend, however, I think it would be much more unfair for the both of us to continue hanging out under false pretenses. It would be very unfair for her to hang out with a guy who she views as a friend, but secretly, he wants to have sex with her. It would be unfair to me because I'd be continuing a dishonest relationship and feeding off of desperate hope. And it would also be unfair to the boyfriend, for obvious reasons. I know that I should just leave a girl with a boyfriend alone, but deep down, I feel like I have to go for what I want. Man up and put her on the spot. I feel that if I don't do this, and just move on to the next one, I wouldn't be growing at all. What do you guys think? "
242,vulnerability,seduction,Trouble being attracted,1,37wiqn,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/37wiqn/trouble_being_attracted/,2015-05-31 10:00:28,"Perhaps I'm shallower than a puddle after a light drizzle or have absurd standards only imaginary girls could fulfill. Or maybe I'm using any excuse I can find to save myself from risk of failure/rejection/etc. Personally, I think it's none of the above, but I can hardly be called objective about myself so who knows what delusions I have. I genuinely have trouble finding people I'm attracted to. I can spend a few hours weaving through a dense crowd, looking for people to approach and come up empty. It's less ""she has a freckle omg she's hideous"" and more ""I feel no different about her than anyone else around her"". Maddeningly, its not just about looks either. I can be clocking in on hour 4 of my date her laughing, looking the spiting image of Bambi with both of us having a great time. But try as I might, I'm just not in to her. Now this is a scenario with easy solutions such as ""Stop bitchin and keep looking till you find a girl you like"", ""He probably weighs 350 not including the fedora, needs lower standards"", and ""Maybe needs to give dick-sucking a try"". Wise words, and cum is apparently good for the skin. The crux of the issue however, is that I'm here because I'm hoping to improve myself, and doing so is impossible without practice. And since this game lacks a single-player portion, I'm ending up attempting to hone seduction skills on girls I'm ultimately ambivalent towards. It's not as if I'm hoping to turn myself into a Don Juan who woos women with a single glance or devise the ultimate PUA routine; on the contrary, I'm 100% on board with Manson and vulnerability, honesty, inner game. But certain things can only be gained from experience, and I know I have a lot of fucking up to do. So in the spirit of self-improvement I've been training... well, more like flailing. On the plus side, outcome independence! Yay! Completely superseded but my seeming inability to stop caring what the family of 4 200ft away think of my pants while I casually walk down the street, but at least I'm equally invested in all opinions right? Crashing and burning on the whole ""women want a man to want them"" thing, but I really like joking and teasing, so that masks the issue long enough to attempt kino/escalation. Sometimes long enough to sleep with them. This leads to plenty of awkward situations, like my last BJ which felt a bit like a rehash of the mobster beating Tyler in Fight Club. Great technique, put her heart into it, but after a while I stopped her with a ""you gave it your best, champ""-smile. I consoled her, letting her know she did a great job and that it wasn't unusual, some guys don't cum at the drop of a hat, etc. but I could see it really crushed her self-confidence and it pained me to know that I was the cause of new-found insecurities. Ever the trooper, she came back the next time with a vengeance and redoubled resolve. The relationship did not survive the second attempt. Now I'm also completely on board with the ""leave them better than you found them"", ""take only pictures, leave only bubbles"" and other scuba diving/tourism creeds, so I really do try to make sure they have a good time; making others happy makes me happy. So as the S.S. Meh continues on its course leaving apathy and crushed spirits in its wake, I'd love some advice. Or commiseration while the ship runs aground."

244,vulnerability,seduction,[Guide] How to succeed at this without losing your integrity,35,31wzlv,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/31wzlv/guide_how_to_succeed_at_this_without_losing_your/,2015-04-09 06:31:23,"A lot of advice here needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Overcompensation is often taught here. I want to point out that training everyone here to develop narcissistic personality disorder is probably not the healthiest way to foster a self-development community. I am here to say, with bullshitting as little as possible, that there is a better way than becoming a complete tool-bag. I will give real examples of how you can strike a better balance so that this community can lose the image of being a try-hard douche. **Develop a sense of self importance, not an exaggerated sense of self-importance** There is a difference between being confident, a risk taker, and someone who thinks they are one. You are only confident and assertive, and risk taking in those moments for which you are taking action. If you let your ego become too large, thinking you are perpetually better than others you isolate yourself and start to take yourself too seriously. Find a balance between seeing yourself as a worthy and someone who can laugh at themselves. -Learn to fail with a smile on your face, without having to get the last word or make a snide comment. Allow yourself to lose face when you fail in the same way you welcome respect from others when you succeed. -Practice self-deprecating humor to keep your ego in check. This improves your game faster because you see your flaws and the weak parts of yourself that need improvement. **Stop exaggerating your achievements and talents** A lot of people here like to think they used some skill or technique. Most of your success stems from just approaching, saying hello, making eye contact, and not being an anxiety ridden, nervous wreck like you probably are in the 99% of the time. I know I am. You are not some PUA Jedi master with some special set of skills that the average male doesn't possess. **Being preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate** A wise (fictional) man once said, ""Self improvement is masturbation"". Indeed it is. Every time you find yourself reading about how to improve yourself, remember that someone out there is actually taking action and most of the time they are failing. And that's O.K. because eventually they will succeed. -If you are reading this and you do not have one story from the past week--right now--about getting blown out you are more preoccupied with your fantasies and fears than actually succeeding. Your fears are bigger than you are. Overcoming fear is all that self improvement was meant to be. **Stop requiring constant admiration** Posting here to motivate other people is respectable. Posting to brag about your success is pathetic. Unless you are seeking help about what your sticking points are and need to provide details of your encounters, please get over yourself. For those of you who have had success and are able to keep your mouth shut, I commend you all. This subreddit is on it's way to looking like more than a breeding ground for man-childs. **Having a sense of entitlement** Stop focusing on what you **don't have** and start focusing on the value that you can give regardless of the situation. Things like a positive attitude, a sense of humor, and excitement are things you can bring to any group. Imagine you were fighting in World War II, storming the beach-heads of Normandy on D-Day. Would you want to be that guy screaming and crying or the guy who can find fun and entertainment even in his last moments, raising morale and being perfectly in the moment. -Practice meditation -Understand that even that which you have, you do not necessarily deserve. This is a common misconception. There is no karmic balance, no rule to life that says hard work will always pay off or that laziness will not be rewarded. There are plenty of lazy people born into rich families. Focus on getting what you want but be humble enough to understand accept your situation without being needy. **Stop expecting special favors and unquestioning compliance with your expectations** **AND** **Do not take advantage of others to get what you want** The above two should speak for themselves. **Learn to recognize the needs and feelings of others** Do not supress empathy in yourself if you possess it. Some of us are not as in touch with our feelings. Being non-reactive? Good. Being assertive? Good. Asserting your own dominance on other people, steamrolling less confident people for your own amusement are just pathetic qualities to have. -It is good to practice being assertive and aggressive -Lose controlling, qualities. Practice vulnerability. **See to the door thoughts of envy** If you are envious of others or believe others are envious of you then your reality is built around external validation. Everyone here is seeking some validation. Otherwise you would not be on this subreddit. No bullshit. Accept you are chasing validation but be realistic enough to realize that you are a different person with different obstacles. Unlike sports, games, and other outlets, the game is non-competitive. Which ties to my final point. **Accept how shallow and stupid it is to base your self worth on something that is based 90% on your looks** Reality check. If you are having success with beautiful women very quickly you are good looking, not some special snowflake. Not God's gift to humanity. Pat yourself on the back when you succeed, be humble, stay positive and enjoy the ride. Many of these traits I have discussed will look strangely familiar to some of you. I encourage you to filter everything you read. "

I've always been extremely reserved around others, and would rarely smile when out in public. I found this guy's thread pretty interesting so I decided to give it a shot and just fuckin smile everywhere I went. I probably looked like a weird little shit when I first started doing it. I'd literally just walk around in public with an almost constant grin on my face. Over the top no doubt, but it helped me get in the habit/mood. Previous to this, I was a stone wall. Whenever engaged with someone socially I'd have a blank stare usually plastered on my face. I grew up with this false notion that girls saw emotion/vulnerability as a weakness and therefore suppressed it for quite a while. Anyways, forcing myself to smile was instrumental in getting myself to open up more. I'm an average looking dude, not very attractive at all. I've never had a women compliment me on my looks, and up until a few months ago I was a virgin. It's no surprise to me now that it took me 21 years to get laid. Imagining how I must of looked before I began doing this.... I'm sure I gave off a strong ""serial killer"" vibe. In the last 4 months I've been laid 6 times. Smiling more is solely responsible for this. It has improved my mood out in public, given me more confidence, and just made me much more approachable. So if your one of those guys who was like me and pretty reserved about smiling, go out there and do it. This shit works. Original thread i mentioned- URL"

Hells yeah, I'm in. The night before I had felt the awful effects of units once again. Still, my game had never been better than yesterday. I get on the bus and turn up my music, getting somewhat in-state. I had to switch busses and on the second I see a pretty girl. I sat there contemplating on game and vulnerability, that I should approach her. It was too late by then but we happened to both exit the bus on the same stop. I approached her but it was pretty beta, very little game involved, but I still felt good about it. At least I approached. I arrived shortly after, we played some drinking games and discussed which girls we should invite, girls one year younger or girls two years younger. Whatever, I smoked some weed though I often get too drunk or faded. I automatically enter another state and the atmosphere changed. It was great and I felt even better. We were 7 guys and like 6-8 girls came over. I was really assertive and dominant, I became like tactical and also impulsive so things were looking good. I initiate some more drinking games but these girls didn't bring much alcohol. Anyway, I sat next to an attractive girl and my game was on point. I built up sexual tension, kino, eye-contact, absolutely everything I've learnt from Seddit. She was receptive and attracted to me. I didn't show too much interest and I did not engage in a conversation about her with her, though I could have several times. I didn't do so because I was so dominant and engaged in the whole group. My interest was shared equally between the group and the girl. She sat between me and the alpha, and he had not gamed well so far, unlike me. He starts to engage in a conversation with her and uses kino. We were playing I've never ... The subject of virginity came up and i drank, though the other girls that must have been virgins did not. I took ownership of it but the group wasn't engaged enough so it felt strange. Then the game revealed that the alpha and the girl had tried anal before. Cool. The alpha had his arms around the girl and they were flirting. I cannot recall exactly how this came to be. Anyway, the alpha and the girl asks somewhat manipulative if I could bring them their booze. I said no, get your own and while you're at it, bring me a beer please. Eventually the girl stood up and got them their drink. The other girls were leaving and the alpha had disappeared with the girl. We smoked some more and saw them through a window. My friend performed some weak missionary, my other friend saw his dick eventually and, to our surprises, he couldn't get it up. We kept smoking in a jacuzzi and had a really great time with great friends. ----------------------------------------------------------- This morning I thought about last night and how I almost lost my virginity. Fuck, it was a pain in the ass but I still had a great time. My lesson was that I should engage sooner and be more aggressive. I thought this would be a suitable opportunity for my first FR, and I would LOVE your feedback! Sorry for the huge post by the way. All of this wasn't necessary but I wanted to share. Thanks!"
248,vulnerability,seduction,[FR] My experience with vulnerability on my FIRST date ever.,3,2zbft3,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2zbft3/fr_my_experience_with_vulnerability_on_my_first/,2015-03-17 15:27:59,"I hate to label this as a Field Report. I really do. Since this was more of a life experience, it feels somewhat demeaning to call it such a term, but that's just me. For some background, I am a 17 year old male in High School. I have been following /r/seduction for around 8 months now. I've studied the PUA tactics, I've read the books (Models, No More Mr. Nice Guy, The Game), you name it- I've done it. I have constantly been working to improve my own happiness as well as my interactions with women. I suppose that there's nothing wrong with getting an early start. What I had discovered throughout my journey was that I really didn't want to have sex with every HB out there, I wanted to make a genuine connection with a girl that was compatible with me. And so, I set out to do that (through the guidance of Models, of course). However, this was no easy task- at least not for me. All throughout my life, I had been taught that in order to make a girl like you, you'd have to not show interest in her at all. Because the trick is that they LOVE guys that play games and pretend that they don't exist right? Right?? Right? Guys? But allowing yourself to become vulnerable with a girl is not some PUA tactic that you can just apply and then all of the bitches will promptly jump on your cock. This was something that I would have to allow internally. This was an emotional process; Not some canned lines that I had learned on the Internet. **I've kept you long enough. Now for the story:** The golden California sun beat down on face as I neared the In-N-Out we would soon meet at. My clammy hands gripped the steering wheel to turn into the parking lot. The realization hit me that I was about to go on a date. This felt so alien. But why? I had hung out with other friends before. Why was this any different? Oh, fuck that's Eve's car, I thought to myself. She's inside waiting for me. I pulled into a spot, checked my hair in the rear-view mirror, and exited the vehicle. I pulled the tall glass door with a $5.95 Burger Combo! sticker slapped on and entered the In-N-Out building. I immediately noticed her ordering her food in the line. I have to say something witty to her. Think! I approached her with the first thing that came to my mind. So..uh..In-N-Out huh? I squealed out. ...Yeah..In-N-Out. She managed. I felt the cashier's cock-eyed glare pierce my skin. After deciding not to order anything (the nerves killed my hunger), we made our way toward a small booth. Oh wait, I read somewhere that I should sit next to her instead of across from her. But won't that be weird? I don't know anymore. I decided in the spur of the moment to sit across from her. Perhaps I should ask her a question as we wait on out food to arrive. So, Eve, I'm curious. What do you do for fun? I asked. Now fellas, I'm gonna be honest here, I can't remember every single detail of what was said. I apologize. But what I can tell you is that that question seemed to break the ice. After I had learned her interests, I could share my own interests and soon began a fun conversation. This led to me directing the conversation into something more heated to generate attraction. I began bringing up subjects like first kisses, and I shared the embarrassing story of my own, she shared hers. It turns out that she had only been with one other guy (that she had also lost her virginity to). We laughed and had fun talking to each other. This is when I began to notice something. I was being VULNERABLE with a girl. This was absolutely nothing like any other interaction that I had had before with other girls. I began sharing things that I otherwise would feel embarrassed about. Same for her. I suppose the takeaway here is that you must be vulnerable first in order for her to reciprocate. After about an hour in there, we went outside and into her car and talked. And I mean actually talked. Not about the fucking weather or sports or some bullshit. I'm not sure what had sparked it, but we had gotten into a conversation about our struggles. Our past relationships. Our insecurities. Really deep subjects that would otherwise not talk about unless there was a sense of trust present. Then we listened to music and danced in the parking lot in her small little car. It was fantastic. Then, I went for a kiss. And...she rejected it. Saying that been with one other guy before and didn't want to rush anything. WE then said our goodbyes and I got back into my car to drive home. Once I got home, I saw a couple of messages: &gt; Believe me I wanted to, but I just don't do anything on the first date. &gt; I can respect that, I guess. I replied. &gt; But believe me, I wanted to. This is the part that confuses me. She wanted to, but she didn't? Okay. Anyway, I've tried for a date two for a couple of weeks now but she consistently tells me that she's busy working. She's done this twice already and it's been a bit disappointing, as I really like this girl. I've spoken to her in school and flirted and she still seems interested, but I honestly have no idea where to go from here. I'm sure most of you will say that I should just next her but I don't want to. Perhaps it's oneitis. I don't know. Anyway. There's my FR. "

Conversation went quite smoothly, talked a lot about uni/what to do when we get jobs/exams and so on. Thing is my ears turned red like Rudolph's nose; goddamnit. Train commute took about 25mins, we talked the whole way until I had to get off. After asking her for my name I instead asked her for her number. She mentioned once during the conversation that she had a boyfriend but I asked for her number regardless. She didn't give it though, but said she enjoyed the talk and motivated me to 'don't take it too seriously, look forward'. Is there something like too much vulnerability? I feel like when I open completely it could be unattractive because I am being completely honest to her and myself. Why did she ask for my name when she has no intention to give me her number? Writing this down helped me realize that only through constant rejection and learning can I get better. I hope this sounds not too egoistic but looking forward I think I will only approach very beautiful women (the greater the approach anxiety, the better) since I would like to find one as a girlfriend. Tl;DR Embraced the struggle, approached HB10, rejection is good since it gets you thinking."

Whether this is asking her on a date, going for a kiss, trying to bring her to your room, etc. Taking these chances is worth the risk, but I really suck at doing it. I actually don't think I'm afraid of getting rejected, because that literally isn't even bad. Rather, I guess I have a fear of vulnerability based on some bad past experiences from my life growing up (I'm 19). For example, I tried to get a bunch of people to go out drinking for my 19th birthday, and even though like 25 people (including hot girls) came out, I was so worried leading up to it that like nobody would show up. Or another time I tried to study at university with this hot girl and she basically bailed last minute cause she wanted to study by herself. Or just other general socially embarrassing or shameful moments. Again, I don't even really care if I got rejected by a hot girl. What is more scary to me is her telling her friends ""omg *billmcflame* tried to make out with me at the nightclub, it was so weird."" How do I overcome this fear and start taking more *likely worthwhile* risks and start to escalate and polarize??"

And how to effectively use vulnerability?,5,2wiu5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2wiu5m/immaturity_vs_spontaneity_and_fun_and_how_to/,2015-02-20 17:22:35,"This is probably a more generic question regarding basic social interactions than it is a question regarding seduction, nonetheless, I wanted this subreddit's input. This question has PUA implications so here goes. My (17M) question is regarding the difference between acting ""immature"" and being spontaneous, enthusiastic, and fun. I am not referring to immaturity regarding emotional control, but immaturity in the sense that my actions are perceived as ""inappropriate"". Here is an example. Today, I went sledding with a mixed group of guys and girls. Upon arriving, we gathered at the bottom of the hill. I yelled, ""Race ya to the top!"" and proceeded to sprint to the top of the snow covered hill, knowing full well nobody had joined in. I viewed this action as spontaneous and fun: a simple expression of my enthusiasm for sledding. I would have found legitimate pleasure in racing someone up that hill, but did not truly care whether or not anyone joined in (outcome independent). Many of my male friends in that group proceeded to poke fun at my ""childish"" antics and insinuated I had severe mental deficiencies. Initially, I brushed it off. Why bother ruining a great time by even acknowledging the negativity? But their reactions stuck with me all day. My friends have been responding in this manner quite often lately, that, or I have become more aware of their negativity. It seems the more outgoing I become, the more my friends ""poke fun at me"". The thing is, they take it too far and I get legitimately offended. These are my friends; I should be able to completely let my guard down and have some fun without the fear of being ridiculed. Its as if I make myself vulnerable and they take advantage of it.While this particular occurrence was not a very heinous account of my friends being assholes, it is a recent example that I can easily reflect on. I honestly try to not give a shit too much about petty things like this, but I feel like in doing so I'm avoiding a bigger issue. Here are my questions: Was this ""race"" immature? If so, should I work on this? I view this action as an indication of a genuine part of my personality, and am very hesitant to change it. How should I react when my friends are being assholes? Call them out on it right then and there? The difficult part would be to retain control of my emotions whilst acknowledging their assholiness. In the past, they proceed to make fun of how ""butthurt"" I get. In reality, I feel I am making them aware they have taken their joke too far. Should I wait for another situation without females and call them out on it? Should I ignore it completely? I have been doing this but I feel that appeasing their behavior will just allow it to get worse. I guess, in behaving ""immature"" and fun, I make myself vulnerable. Vulnerability is a powerful tool, and if used properly, can really bring people closer together. I am having extreme difficulty determining how to not let my asshole friends walk all over me when I am vulnerable, whilst not being oversensitive to harmless jeering. Help would be appreciated. "
255,vulnerability,seduction,How to be a bad motherfucker,192,2x7e2h,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2x7e2h/how_to_be_a_bad_motherfucker/,2015-02-26 16:49:49,"A lot of you guys are in the PUA scene for the same reason. You are insecure and have feelings of inadequacy. And those feelings are exacerbated when you get rejected by girls. A large part of a mans self-esteem comes from the women that are attracted to him, so when a girl rejects you, you feel like less of a man (or a lower-ranked man). You feel a moment of happiness when a really hot/awesome girl likes you but then you feel crushed even worse when she moves on and you get oneitis. You feel jealous and resentful of guys that are taller than you, richer than you, better dressed than you, better looking than you, etc Here is the solution to all that: keep fighting. Thats it. Just keep fighting. And really, thats all you CAN do. By keep fighting I mean, continue to work hard to improve yourself every day. No matter what defeats you suffer, be sad for a while, and then pick yourself back up and get back at it. You have to have faith that your fighting will pay off and one day you will see the end of the rainbow, even if its not in sight now. The fact is that most people arent improving themselves so even if you do something small every day to improve yourself after weeks, months and years you will be light years ahead of all those guys that you are jealous of. And at the end of the day, thats all you really can do, so you might as well accept that as your reality. A lot of your fighting will be in vain. You will focus on the wrong thing and grind on that wrong thing for a long time, wasting your time and going nowhere, not realizing that the thing you SHOULD be doing is right under your nose. Thats fine. Thats part of the fight. Every mistake you make is an opportunity to learn and all the time you waste is a lesson that will make sure you wont waste it again. Success isnt a mountain that you have to climb. Sometimes its right in front of you and all you have to do is take 3 steps. And a lot of people are afraid to take that afirst step, much less 3. Getting girls isnt magic; its a thing that people have figured out. You just have to take those steps. I do stand-up comedy for fun and its interesting to see the type of people that eventually become successful and get on TV. Stand up is one of those things that people think is mostly in-born talent: you are either funny or youre not. But in reality the people that make it in stand up are the hardest workers. You see a lot of people who are naturally funny try stand up and do ok but then quit or give up after a while. On the other hand, you also see a lot of people who are not funny at all work their asses off and make it. I have a friend who is fast becoming a household name and getting huge in comedy. A few years ago I can honestly tell you that he wasnt funny at all. Like, at all. Even when we were hanging out as friends he wasnt funny: his jokes all sucked. 99% of my friends were funnier than him. But the difference is that that guy kept working at it; he got on stage 15-20 times a week when the funny guys were going up 3-4 times a week. He worked his fucking ass off and now when you see him do a stand up set you laugh your ass off and you would have no idea that he isnt a naturally funny guy. One of the lies in our society that people believe is that success comes from talent. Some people are born with it, some people arent. Its just not true. For 99% of things, hard work takes you much further than talent. When you see people like Jay-Z and Eminem, you realize that they arent necessarily the people anybody would think would make it. In fact, they are the opposite: Jay-Z is an ugly, goofy guy who was overshadowed by so many other rappers in New York. And Eminem is white. But those guys worked harder than anybody else and became the best. In fact, its because they had to face so much adversity that they succeeded: because they got used to fighting. They just kept fighting. Of course, some things are in-born. If you play basketball, you have a huge advantage if you are tall. Period. You cant change that. And in getting girls, some guys are just born with advantages you will never have: better genes, more money, etc And the worst part is, there are some girls that absolutely will not fuck with you because you dont have one of those advantages: you are too short, too ugly, too poor, etc But here is the thing: those girls werent going to fuck you anyway so there is no use in worrying about it. All you can do is keep fighting and work on the things you CAN get better at, and you will eventually surpass those guys that are born with those advantages. I know lots of guys that are born hot, rich, tall, etc and they eventually fuck it up because they are douchebags and have no game. I would even go so far as to say that being that hot is often a handicap to them because they never had to develop any skills. None of the super-hot guys I know can keep a super-hot girl because they never developed all the weaponry they need because mediocre girls would just flock to them with no effort. I have a guy friend who is literally a 9/10. He looks like a model, he is rich, he owns a nightclub, drives a Mercedes, etc On paper, he is the shit, but I use him for a bait. Im not bad looking but whenever we go out the girls are instantly attracted to him first and if its a group of girls I usually start out with the #2 or #3 in the girl cuz the #1 gravitates to him. But  he has kind of a flat personality and can act douchey, so as the night draws on I become the center of attention and the girls gravitate towards me. Oftentimes the #1 flips from him to me. Why? Ive been fighting for this and he hasnt. Im in the field every day and hes not. I have experience and he doesnt. Nowadays, when I get rejected by a girl I take it like a man. I dont get angry, or call her a bitch, or pout, or go to a strip club, or make some bullshit excuse as to why she couldnt understand I was awesome. It may not be true, but I just assume that when a girl rejects me its either because 1) I wasnt good enough for her or because 2) I didnt act right. But instead of letting rejections drag me down, I know that no matter what happens, I will keep fighting. I will get back in the gym, I will keep trying to eat healthier, I will advance in my career, I will read more, I will try to become a better person, so that in 6 months I am no longer the guy she rejected. I am a totally different person. I see a lot of advice in the PUA world as to how to overcome oneitis, but Ive learned that the only foolproof method is to improve yourself so much that you are no longer the person that got rejected. Oneitis isnt about you loving the girl, but rather about your ego being sore at getting rejected. Your ego cant take no for an answer, so you have to change yourself so that your ego can say to itself well she rejected the old me; the new me is better. EDIT/ADDITION: And here is the amazing thing: girls are more attracted to the guy who is fighting rather than the guy who is already successful. If you're already successful, the girl knows what you have: a nice car, a nice house, etc... But if you are fighting and on the come up she has no idea what you may achieve. You might become the fucking President or a billionaire. That is way more exciting for her. And on top of that, she would get to be part of the ride, rather than to just arrive at the party late. Watch the last scene of 8 Mile where Eminem wins the final battle rap. Instead of talking about how awesome he is, he talks about all the ways he was humiliated. But you root for him and realize he is a bad motherfucker because despite all that shit he went through he is still fighting and that's the most impressive thing of all. You KNOW he will become successful. That is also what vulnerability is: vulnerability isn't being a sad sack of shit and whining and crying all day. Vulnerability is being able to admit your weaknesses because you know you will overcome them because you are always fighting. URL (the last battle starts at like 6:50)"

A lack of interest in you in the future means you didn't leave a strong enough impact. How do you leave an impact? You turn the sexual tension up, turn her on enough to where she thinks about, or will sleep with you after. This is how my dates are when I'm at my best. ... When you go on a first date, you should have it in your mind that you're planning to sleep with her afterwards. Unless, you're both really focusing on finding something more settled down and long term. If you're on that page, ease up a little bit. If you're only casually dating, which for this post I assume you are, then your mentality is **""I'm going to take her home."".** Remember you are the leader. When you both want to get closer, you need to be the one that makes it happen. She might not be giving you blatant green lights to escalate. But as long as there's a lack of a red light, escalate. She usually won't give you much to work with because, she wants to be lead. She wants the seduction to happen, but you need to do it. Any time she's still there and comfortable, **she wants you to escalate.** ...So Good locations: * close to your place * allow for semi isolation, a vibe where there are other people, but you can really focus on just each other * comfortable enough to where you could see yourself browsing the web there instead of your home Once at this lovely location, think ""what would I do if she was my girlfriend?"" so if you don't know how to greet her, greet her like you would a girlfriend, a confident hug and a kiss. Sit like you would with a girlfriend, pretty close, plenty of contact. Talk like you would a girlfriend, just to have fun, **not trying to impress her** anymore, you already have her. She's already yours in your mind. You might be hesitant about this more straight approach but trust me, it will be accepted. But only if you're comfortable. Her level of comfort will match yours. So keep your body language relaxed, slow down, breath deeply. If you're comfortable and relaxed with the intimate vibe, she will be too. As far as what to say. Just **keep things fun**. Try to beforehand get yourself in a mood where your seeing the humor in things. And if you can steer the conversation in a light heartedly sexual direction. As for specific topics I usually wind up at: * Working Out - ""I saw you looking at my shoulders"", "" Do you really need to, you look nice, nice legs"" * Girls&amp;Guys - Crazy or interesting stuff that's happened to you two. Don't make shit up. * Music, or movies, or books. - ""Do you like _____ ?..."" Try not to be gamey at all, no routines. And **be yourself**. Trust that your real self is attractive enough. Don't put on a front. If you have a vulnerability about you, then you'll open up a bit more. Don't try to be so ""alpha"" that you're fronting and she never see's who you really are. You need to be a bit vulnerable, and show who your really are. The reason is, you need her to be vulnerable and open up who she is too, in order to form a connection. At the end, unless she volunteers herself to, just pay for it. Don't get caught up in what it means to to her, don't assume it's a beta thing to pay for a non girlfriend. As long as she's not taking advantage of you ( where she clearly wants another drink more than your dick), then don't be cheap. Take your wallet out. When you're successful so far and you're going home, ( just assuming because I believe in you.), you'll be met with resistance. Be ready for this. Treat these moments like speed bumps. Slow down, but keep moving forward. I mean stuff like, anti slut defense, questioning if she really likes you. The advanced shit test stuff. Approach these moments: * with humor * mix or follow the humor with **serious &amp; honest** words of comfort ""I like you"", ""Nothing is gonna happen you don't want to happen."" * Escalate right after and get her mind back on how wet she is. After I like you just pause and make out. Remember no means no. But once she's ready for you to take it, be dominant and escalate and take it.

257,vulnerability,seduction,A Book in Review: Models by Mark Manson,209,2r725u,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2r725u/a_book_in_review_models_by_mark_manson/,2015-01-03 22:00:43,"So, this book ""Models"" by Mark Manson has been very popular on this subreddit lately. When I first heard about it the name led me to believe that it would be a book full of sleezy PUA techniques of no real value at all. Since enough people were giving it praise I decided to take a look at the book myself and see what all the fuss is about. Luckily, I am glad to say that my first impressions about the book were wrong. In my opinion, even though technically you cannot ""solve"" seduction I think that in most part Manson has figured out the heart and core around seduction. This book tackles seduction from almost every angle possible from inner game to clothing style. It covers all of the typical problems that men face when trying to go after girls. In my time with Seduction I became disillusioned. I felt like all of the techniques were clogging up my mind and disallowed me to be who I was. I wasn't able to be myself because I would be too busy thinking about what to do next. It just made me nervous and I *hated* it to say the least. (And really I am saying the least for sake of time.) I thought that if I acted like myself then I would not get anywhere because nobody would like who I was on the inside. Manson's take on seduction shows exactly why I felt much freer and ultimately more successful once I threw away everything I had learned and just acted like myself. In a nutshell, Manson's approach to seduction is very much based on inner game. No frills on top of it. The idea is to be three things: *Honest and Truthful *Vulnerable and open to being rejected *Never be more invested in her than she is in you The idea is to be honest in who you are and with your intentions. For instance, if you try to pick a girl up you should try and be yourself instead of pulling PUA techniques because at the end of the day that person is not you and by trying to be someone else you are ultimately being dishonest. This ties in a lot with vulnerability as well. The idea is to put yourself out there and to present yourself. Yes you might get rejected but without doing this the rate of failure will be that much higher as I am sure most of you are aware. The idea about investment is a very new idea which I liked very much. The model of seduction on this subreddit and in the PUA community in general is of a sort of ""act disinterested because if you act interested then she won't like you."" This ""aloof"" sort of strategy doesn't work very well because girls ultimately never generate an opinion about you because there's nothing to have an opinion on. It allows one to stop being nonexistent and it allows one to go after chicks successfully without having to worry about things. It closes a huge paradox which has been floating around for a very long time. ""If showing interest shows that I am of low value then how do I approach at all?"" The point is that you can approach but you should do so in a way that shows that she can reject you outright and you won't care because you're not invested. Over time as her investment grows you can show more yourself. It's an amazing way to think about it. There are some misconceptions on what it means to be Vulnerable. Remember, it's not about telling all of the sad stories you have about your life. Being vulnerable means putting yourself out there to be rejected. It means being able to say ""I like you"" because its not the act of liking a girl that makes her disinterested, it's being distraught if she says no that is the turn off. If you can be brave enough to put yourself out there like that then you make yourself vulnerable. This turns girls on. This is the way it's done. This is something a lot of people have trouble with in this community I find. I think it was the sole reason why I had so much trouble when I first started. I would always try to ""take it slow"" when in reality girls that I was going for were waiting impatiently for me to make a move. What I like as well is that the book treats women like people. I feel that a lot of books are so focused on trying to find a formula to get with women that they get lost in the calculations and forget that women are people to. In the worst case scenario I have found that some of the thinking leads to very sexist thinking. I've seen this in myself and others. See /r/theredpill as an example of people who have gotten lost in sexist thinking. The sad part is that it borrows a lot of language and techniques from this subreddit. That can't be a good sign. This is something that I don't enjoy seeing as I think this subreddit is better than that. It's something that potentially threatens subreddits like this one. Seeing an approach to seduction which allows a woman to be human during the whole process is a huge breath of fresh air for me and it's one of the reasons why I think this book has the right approach. Of course, there's more to this book than I can pack into this post. The main take away that I receive from this book may not be the same for what any of you might take away. This is why I feel like you should read the book for yourselves. **I would even make a motion to put it into the sidebar as ""essential reading material"".** *I think that this subreddit should be ""remodeled"" around what this book says because it's so spot on. I know these are radical ideas but I think that as it stands, this subreddit has problems because it preaches a lot of techniques which **don't work**. Such as the idea of shit tests and whatever, the book explains why shit tests are not worth thinking about. There's of course more to it than that, but I feel that if more people read this book by coming across it in the sidebar that would be a small step to improving this subreddit and allowing all of us to be more successful with women.* Overall I feel like ""Models"" is a very sleek and refined approach to seduction that cuts away all of the bullshit which has piled up over the years. It allows one to be oneself while recognising that self improvement and inner game is the core of successful seduction. The techniques provided are easy to use and mindsets over rejection and all the other things are adjusted in the most perfect way possible. I cannot praise this book enough because it's exactly what led to my success with women after I forgot about all the techniques. It's not that I used the things that I learned form this book, it's that this process is what I learned and this book verifies it. Please take my advice and give it a shot. As someone who thought he had nothing left to learn and just wanted to read the book to check if it was any good I found myself learning even more from it. Thanks for reading and I hope everyone has a great day. :) Please leave a comment, I am interested to hear what everyone has to think. P.S. Notice how I gave some controversial opinions in this post? That's an example of me being vulnerable. Im opening myself and my thoughts to you guys. If I don't do this then no useful change/growth is generated and I want this subreddit to grow to its full potential! Come at me! Think for yourself and tell me what you think!

258,vulnerability,seduction,Vulnerability and Reverse Oneitis,4,2rlbuh,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2rlbuh/vulnerability_and_reverse_oneitis/,2015-01-07 14:50:38,"throw-away account This sub has been my best friend for the past few weeks and I really enjoy what you guys are doing here, so thanks. background;; The past couple of nights I have been listening to Models on Audible and upon completion was feeling empowered and motivated to work on myself. I loved all the points Mark made in the text and honestly can't wait to listen to it again - and find other readings that expand / compliment what he says about seduction. Vulnerability;; My main reason I have to make this post is to get this off of my chest. I refuse to be this vulnerable in front of people I know (about this issue), as it makes me look like a total tool and someone who isn't capable of making logical decisions. I've really been beating myself up the past few nights because of a mistake I made Sunday. I was out drinking with a buddy, who will play a part in ""reverse oneitis"" later, and drank a little too much - then decided to drive home. Thank god nobody was on the roads or with me at the time. But I was on a phone with my buddy, didn't see a red light, or that the light I was coming to consisted of a T-intersection. It was snowing too, so as I did notice I slammed on my breaks and wasn't able to stop... I stared in horror as I was about to run this light, unable to turn right or left.. and slammed into a green box (that was public property). It tore up my car, or rather my parents car, pretty badly.. and I still haven't had the nerve to tell them about it. I plan on letting them know tomorrow that it did happen, just not how it happened. I'll stick with another story, and pretend it happened when I call them. This relates to vulnerability because it's really tearing my ego apart - not the accident, but the fact that I could let something like this happen in the first place. Mark, author of Models, likes the attitude of thinking of things happening as ""a gift,"" usually when referring to being rejected or being polarizing in a certain way that generates a hurtful response from an approach - this is a gift because you learned something new about yourself that you may not have been able to find out on your own. I think of this as a gift, as I learned my lesson about drinking and driving - and that maybe when I drink too much I don't have good judgement. It's also a gift because nobody was hurt, nobody witnessed, and i'm left with a result that I can lie about. I know the truth, and can't let something like that happen ever again - nothing is worth going through that again. Reverse Oneitis;; I moved to a new city for college, where I had been working a lot and going to school for a full year without even attempting to date or pick up. The girl who I had been crushing on, admittedly only to myself, approached me and asked for my number. The next few nights she came over, we hung out, and I didn't have the balls to have sex with her. In my head I didn't want to rush her into anything, whatever. Somewhere along the way I caught feelings, would text her too often, and say whatever it was that I could to make her notice me.. We didn't hang out for a long time - but I assumed it was because she truly was busy and didn't have the time to come over or go get a drink with me.. No, I was just too needy and took her words for value, when really she probably never wanted to talk to me again after all that.. Well the time comes, I say oh well, and to this day it has been two months since we've seen each other outside of work. I start my seduction / self-help journey here, and learn her apparent unattraction to me has made my uninterested in her. I've gone out quite a bit since, met a few girls, had real genuine exchange of words with beautiful women (women who I never thought would give me the time of day), made out with a girl (really grossly at a bar), gotten phone numbers, and been rejected. Everything has been going well. Ms. Oneitis must have sensed my attitude change and now wants to hang out... But she doesn't ask very smoothly and made me uncomfortable when I read her text. She wants to go hang out with me, and another guy she had hooked up with in the past (same guy I went out with last Sunday) to have drinks. To me, this is an instant red flag.. I tell her I don't want to anymore, sorry... but maybe ""X"" does. She texts me the whole next day with things like ""Are you mad at me?"" "":(?"" ect.. I tell her no, but if she wants to hang out we can't ""be just friends.. that won't work for me"".. anyway she has texted me a lot in the last couple of days.. asking why I don't want to hang out.. and a lot of my response has been nothing.. I don't want to hurt the girl or make her feel bad, but I also don't even want to talk to her anymore.. but she continues to text me like she's going to change my mind.. She would always text me back when I was being needy as hell with her, but she would never want to hang out again.. now she wants to and I'm just not interested and can't get her to leave me alone."
259,vulnerability,seduction,Ways to eliminate neediness from eminating?,2,2slnv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2slnv7/ways_to_eliminate_neediness_from_eminating/,2015-01-16 16:32:12,I don't want to exude neediness when dealing with women. Is the only solution to this displaying vulnerability? I don't feel the need to text or hang out with them 24/7 but I've just been constantly drilled that neediness is bad so what are EXAMPLES of it showing and how do I eliminate them completely? If I'm just a confident individual am I gonna not show these qualities?
260,vulnerability,seduction,"Read ""Models"" from Mark Manson and what happened afterwards",10,2tkjp0,http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2tkjp0/read_models_from_mark_manson_and_what_happened/,2015-01-25 12:16:55,"I've finished Mark Manson's ""Models"" one month ago. He is basically saying: Vulnerability is the solution of everything and just be yourself. I was curious about it, extremely motivated and on the rack to check it out live in the field. So I went out almost every day and had a great time, meet many new friends and did what I like. But today, I just stopped my Saturday night early on and went home alone (again .. as always), because I somehow must have got that concept completely wrong. I'm 34 now, reading seddit and pick up advice for more than 2 years. I had only 3 (long term) relationships in my life and had a lot of sex with my 3 ex-girlfriends. Now I ""just"" want to get laid with new women, but that seems harder than anything I did before (incl. finding a great job, doing sports, living at a fantastic place, making a lot of money, pursuing many great hobbies with passion etc.) I don't want to bother you with too much detail. I put everything I read in ""Models"" into practice but after all, they just say ""no"" or say nothing and go home with another guy the same night. It seems like they are highly aroused by my moves and then byebye, you know :) Good night guys. I'm very tired right now and will go to sleep. I would really appreciate some helpful comments and advice from you tomorrow morning. Feel free to ask questions. I will answer them honestly."
