0,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,i22fxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/i22fxw/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-08-02 09:51:09,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place.

5,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,i2le08,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/i2le08/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-08-03 08:42:14,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning.

I'd really love to sink into little space today. I'd be down for some role-play, chatting, low key hanging out, then maybe getting into little play. For me, little space is about vulnerability, trust, and pleasure. Watching cartoons, coloring, and masturbating are fun parts of that. I like being cared for allowed to be vulnerable, and rewarded for that trust. If you're not familiar with little space or little play, I'm not really looking to teach someone right now, just to be cared for. I am very kinky, as previous posts show, and some of that can be fun to include, but I'd really like to be cared for right now. Message me and let's chat."

Bf isnt home and Im really enjoying kind of cheating on here. Im 18 petite, Latina. Pierced bellybutton, kind of an inbetweenie. I have always wanted a man to be obsessed with my bellybutton. Since I was like 14. I want someone to explore it, tickle it, spit in it, do all kinds of things to it. I have absolutely no boundaries when it comes to my bellybutton. Also kind of like my feet messed with. Its just weird isnt it? The bellybutton on a girl signifies fertility and vulnerability. Come tear mine up."

You read your latest instruction and force yourself out of bed, your heart beating fast, and apologize profusely for going to sleep without saying goodnight. Then you slap your chest until it's red and sore hoping you've punished yourself enough to satisfy me. You start your day on edge and focused on serving. Drag yourself out of bed, you have to go to work. You don't wear panties, since you were told not to. You get a message during your shift and have to go to the bathroom to play with yourself. You're little more than a toy to be played with. You're often on the verge of tears, and this day is just too much. You sob and scream internally. The next message tells you to lick the toilet bowl. You protest, hoping to have mercy, but instead you're told not to be a boring, prudish cunt and to do as you're told or go back to your boring, meaningless life. You realize that your feelings don't matter to anyone. They haven't mattered in a long time. You still hope that your mind will be enough to win someone over. You constantly wonder if all the questions you're being asked about your personal life are an effort to collect more blackmail, a cruel joke, or genuine interest.

You're little more than a toy to be played with. You're often on the verge of tears, and this day is just too much. You sob and scream internally. The next message tells you to lick the toilet bowl. You protest, hoping to have mercy, but instead you're told not to be a boring, prudish cunt and to do as you're told or go back to your boring, meaningless life. You realize that your feelings don't matter to anyone. They haven't mattered in a long time. You still hope that your mind will be enough to win someone over. You constantly wonder if all the questions you're being asked about your personal life are an effort to collect more blackmail, a cruel joke, or genuine interest. If you want your life to have this chapter, I'm right here and hungry for someone to mark. I'm interested in psychological manipulation, coercion, dubcon, emotional and physical abuse, existential dread. If we talk it's for a long-term exploration of these themes. I'm not looking for roleplay at all and I prefer a quick-fire interrogation style chat to slow and long-winded responses. I reward curiosity, intelligence, emotional depth, vulnerability and people who know how to grab my attention. Send me a PM with the following. Your first name, age, relationship status and occupation. Tell me why my post drew you in and what you desire deep down."

16,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,hk7f28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/hk7f28/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-07-03 08:52:54,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

The loneliness is sharp and palpable, but the hope that things will work out is waning with every day that passes. Searching for BDSM partners on Reddit is honestly one of the most painful things Ive been through in my adult life. I've been using reddit to engage in D/s dynamics for the past 11 months and it has left me feeling gutted and even more alone than before I started. I've been used, left, ghosted, rejected, and as a result, my self worth is shattered. I can't explain how many times I've said, ""Okay. I understand."" only to mean ""Okay, I understand that I'm not enough to make you stay. I understand that I'm not your priority and I never was."" How many ""Doms"" on here are actually just abusers? How many people promise that they're looking for connection, only to request explicit pictures and dole out tasks within 48 hours? They all want to possess me completely, to own every aspect of my mind, to exploit my vulnerability for their limited attention span, while giving nothing in return. And there's no pattern; it's been men, women, younger, older, nearby, and across the ocean. Someone told me once that this is just the game - that sifting through people on Reddit is common and most interactions are disappointments. But it's worse than that, I think. I wonder if weve created a space where anonymity serves to shield countless transgressions. I've known I was submissive since I was 15. I acknowledge and celebrate that part of myself, but I crave companionship. I crave a Dominant to guide my mind, command my body, cherish my heart, and treasure my submission. But I'm only interested in doing this safely and genuinely. I am constantly told that I'm ""not submissive"" when I stand up for safety, fairness, and honesty. To vouch for myself, to say ""no,"" is seen as disobedient. It hurts. I feel lost in this wide world and maintaining softness and sensitivity feels impossible.

27,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,hra36p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/hra36p/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-07-15 07:10:45,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself.

28,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,hrp3ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/hrp3ck/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-07-16 00:59:03,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself.

I'm about 1.75 m, dark brown eyes, beard and short black hair. I work 5 to 6 days a week as a restaurant manager. Cooking is something I adore to do, as is gaming and pets. I don't smoke, I rarely drink, I don't do drugs. I am from a small country in Europe but I am planing to move somewhere by 2021. I am open minded about pretty much everything, I love talking about politics and religion. I am strong believer of equality for everyone and a supporter of LGBTQ. About my kinky side,I like to take control, I love to set up as many rules as possible and to give guidance. I've my limits as you have yours and they are to be respected, but that's something to be discussed later on. I am waiting for someone to help guide and a possible relationship if we work out well. I am patient and passionate but I can be pushy and direct when the occasion dictates. I like being transparent with people and I expect the same in return. I am here for the vulnerability and connection I've had little/sub before but everyone one is different so I rather if we take it slow. I suspect you are not from my little town, so please be open to pics / voice recordings / videos. Friends are welcomed too! Just please be +18"

She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about.

The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat.

43,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,hzormu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/hzormu/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-07-29 08:40:34,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after.

This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."
48,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,i1tvn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/i1tvn9/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-08-02 01:20:54,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy.

She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out.

A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

67,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,gxz9oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/gxz9oo/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-06-07 07:19:37,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending.

But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal.

Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after.

Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me.

72,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,0,ha3wl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/ha3wl1/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-06-16 23:22:43,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go.

Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features.

The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are.

I'm not used to being alone. Life can get difficult. Let's just open up to each other about fears and dreams and let ourselves be vulnerable together. Then we bond over that shared vulnerability in intimacy. Would love to find someone to talk with long term. As a plus, I also write poetry, so if you'd like someone to write about you or to inspire some works, hit me up. Conversation or images both work as inspiration."

Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the last paragraph of this post. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night.

What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

I've been used, left, ghosted, rejected, and as a result, my self worth is shattered. I can't explain how many times I've said, ""Okay.

How many people promise that they're looking for connection, only to request explicit pictures and dole out tasks within 48 hours? They all want to possess me completely, to own every aspect of my mind, to exploit my vulnerability for their limited attention span, while giving nothing in return.

Someone told me once that this is just the game - that sifting through people on Reddit is common and most interactions are disappointments. But it's worse than that, I think. I wonder if weve created a space where anonymity serves to shield countless transgressions. I've known I was submissive since I was 15. I acknowledge and celebrate that part of myself, but I crave companionship. I crave a Dominant to guide my mind, command my body, cherish my heart, and treasure my submission. But I'm only interested in doing this safely and genuinely. I am constantly told that I'm ""not submissive"" when I stand up for safety, fairness, and honesty.

Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me.

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat.

This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat.

She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

129,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,gt1dmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/gt1dmj/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-05-30 07:09:44,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

134,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,gtzagv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/gtzagv/34_m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-05-31 23:47:12,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female.

To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her.

Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go.

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong.

But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter.

She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go.

Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

158,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34 [M4F] US east coast/online - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,fvnewg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/fvnewg/34_m4f_us_east_coastonline_i_want_to_chat_with/,2020-04-06 09:04:57,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning.

As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning.

Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go.

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong.

Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. * So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. * Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there.

She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."
182,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,34[M4F] - I want to chat with you about the girl I once corrupted into an eager slut.,1,frmnkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/frmnkl/34m4f_i_want_to_chat_with_you_about_the_girl_i/,2020-03-30 18:56:18,"This happened about ten years ago. She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning.

And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out.

Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was revelling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features.

The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after.

Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy.

She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out.

My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr.

Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her.

Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence. A couple weeks after Id noticed her there, we were introduced, and there was clearly an immediate connection. To be clear, Im not a head-turning guy. Im not bad looking, I take care of myself and I think I dress well, but I dont work out and I wasnt born with greek statue features. What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night.

What I think initially drew her attention was that Id been around longer than probably 95 percent of people in the group, knew everyone and had a lot of esoteric knowledge that I was well-spoken about. When we had our first conversation, we mostly talked about some of our shared interests, but it wasnt until she started asking me personal questions that I started getting the feeling there was actually a mutual attraction there. Against my better judgment, we exchanged contact info. This was back in the days when people still used chat clients like IRC and AIM. We started having conversations over the latter. She was still dating the guy Id initially seen her with, which made me uncomfortable about how frequently we had begun to chat. Eventually one of those chats got late enough into the night, and circled around sex and dating as topics long enough, that some admissions of interest came out. But we didnt go farther than that since she was still spoken for, and shortly after that I started distancing myself. Heres where the turning point came. Im not going to go into the details of this event here - if we get to chatting about this and have some chemistry, then I will - but something happened that was a) public knowledge throughout the weekly group, b) of a sexual nature, and c) very embarrassing for her. She stopped showing her face for a couple weeks. I felt bad for her about it. I would see her screen name pop up on my AIM contacts but she didnt message me. I wasnt sure if I should bring it up. Maybe she just didnt want to hear from any of us again. But eventually, one night, I sent her a message. We ended up talking on the phone that night. We talked through the situation, I didnt press her for explanations, and it turned out she was grateful and relieved that I had reached out. Eventually, sounding very vulnerable, she admitted that she had worried I had decided she was a slut and lost interest in talking to her. I told her I didnt think she was a slut and that she wasnt really in the wrong. And then, I dont know why -- it was late, I guess, and I was so lost in the conversation I didnt even think about it -- I admitted something. I told her I actually thought it was pretty hot. As soon as I said it, I winced. After all the turmoil and her emotional vulnerability, I felt like a pervert. I was ready for her to react with stunned silence and then tell me she had to go. To my astonishment, that wasnt what happened. She said, Oh? She actually sounded *intrigued.* I had to scramble to try to explain after that. I didnt want it to come off as creepy. But she remained comfortable with everything I said, and even laughed playfully. When we got off the phone that night, I shook my head, feeling an immediate need to relieve my arousal. As I was putting my phone away, I heard the sound of an AIM message coming from my computer. Wed ended the conversation on what seemed to be a pretty done-for-tonight note, so Id be surprised if shed messaged me something right after. When I shifted the mouse and the screen saver dissipated, I discovered it was indeed a message from her. Shed sent me a mirror selfie, from the shoulders down, in nothing but a pair of panties and a tight tanktop hiked up to show a generous helping of underboob. ================================================================= So thats the beginning. There are more details to explain to the right person. If youre interested, heres what I ask of you: Be female. Whats exciting to me about this is the prospect of discussing it with a woman who is as turned on by finding out about it as I am by the memories. This is not a role play so I am not interested in talking to someone who is pretending. As such, Ill insist that you are either verified on a reliable subreddit, or willing to send a verification picture. If you dont know what this means, it does not mean including your face or any personally identifying details, but it does mean youre sharing a picture of yourself. Im not a picture collector and wont expect it on a regular basis. This is simply to prove youre who you say you are. Sorry, but its necessary evil; rules of the internet are that if you wont do this you are a dude who wants a JO bud, and thats just not what Im after. As far as why this concept excites you, Im not so particular. Maybe you fantasize about something similar, being in her place. Maybe youre into girls and you know some sweet thing who you imagine being corrupted, and you want to reciprocate with your own thoughts. Could be something else entirely; surprise me. What I care about is that we have chemistry. Im hoping to find a long-term chat partner. The story is too long for me to tell you the rest of it in one chat. Id like to give it to you piece by piece, getting your thoughts on it as we go. Heres what to send: Your name, age, a brief description of yourself, and a little about why this conversation appeals to you. As far as how we chat, kik is fine, but so is discord, skype or wickr. So let me know which of those you prefer as well."

She was eighteen, I was in my mid 20s. She was a smart (but not always wise) girl with a high capacity to love, a bratty streak, and a mess of sexual emotions in desperate need of sorting out. A year after wed met, she was reveling in being an obedient slut and getting treated accordingly. I did not plan this. This relationship was something of a sexual awakening for me and thinking back on it I still find it incredibly hot. Ive decided it would be fun to share the story with someone; maybe itll be you. The partner Im looking for is fairly particular, so if you want to find out if you qualify before reading the intro, skip to the end. =================================================================== Some of the details about this are going to be vague since it's a true story. We met via a fairly geeky weekly gathering that I'd been going to since I was a teenager. Our reasons for being there were pretty different; she was enthusiastic about video games and anime, I had just been going so long that it was where all my friends were. She was absolutely my type: brunette, bangs, thin but curvy, wore skirts. I could tell right away that she was smart, but also somewhat naive. She was also very obviously with some other dude who seemed to be closer to her age, and even though we were within the ""seven year rule,"" she seemed too young for me to pursue. My last few dating experiences had left me craving being single for a while anyway. So I had no intention of hitting on her, and at first she didnt seem to notice my existence.

I have a thing for voices and being scared by guys (it's really not hard to do) the vulnerability it makes me feel and and the adrenaline turns me on so much. I have lots of apps to be able to call with. I'd love it if you wanted to do verbal rp. Rape or kidnap maybe stalking are all prompts I like. I am a nervous laugher/giggle and I did a scene where everytime I laughed he would scream so loud my earbuds almost broke. Almost pissed myself... I came so hard once let me. I know its probably kinda strange but I'd love to hear from ya'll! Hmu.

I am that kind and caring young man who has been with the same person since the age of sixteen. I waited until marriage for sex, and I realized quickly that the way sexual intimacy and passion flows through my mind and body in no way matches my spouse. I am not looking to change either of our home situations, but I am hoping we can fill the voids in each of our lives. I am very uplifting, caring, compassionate, and giving to a fault. Are you the woman who wants to be on the receiving end of all my hidden passions along with my genuine care for you? Chatting and comforting each other throughout the day and when possible during the evening and weekends sounds like a dream come true. I want to dote upon you, always. Lets move past just text messages and be more vulnerable through pictures, videos, voice chats, and videos chats when our connection starts to take off. That excitement of having someone want you as much as possible just for being who you are is very intoxicating. Concerning age range and physical appearance, I am not seeking a specific body type. Your positive outlook and energy, your creativity, and your caring personality are much higher on my list than being a super model. Honestly, a bright smile and amazing laugh are much more of a turn on than anything. With being a loving father and provider, I have found myself in the athletic frame with more to love in certain areas. I have been on a weight-loss journey this past year, and I am excited to see the progress I can keep making. If you enjoy a thicker (not 300lbs of flab) type of man who is tall, handsome, has a full head of hair, with a warm smile and soothing voice, then I might just be your man. I am a natural leader and pursuer of things. Would you enjoy my attention being placed on you? I hope you feel the inclination to reach out and see if we can make the start of this year so much more wonderful than either of us could have imagined. Maybe you already feel a connection to a tender soul like me? I would love to hear what is going through your mind right from the start . If the type of vulnerability and indepthness of what I have portrayed is not what you are looking for, I sincerely wish you all the best. I hope to make someone feel cared for, wanted, desired, and help them realize just how wonderfully amazing they are. You are wonderfully you, and I am excited to start getting to know and experience just how wonderful!"

288,vulnerability,dirtykikpals,21 [M4F] Anywhere - 7 foot tall extremely hardcore sadistic bearded dungeon-owning masterseeks lazy weak-minded humorless slave with great tits and emotional baggage for a highly sporadic online poly relationship of a purely selfish sexual nature until she disappears without warning after a few days,0,dbucq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/dbucq5/21_m4f_anywhere_7_foot_tall_extremely_hardcore/,2019-10-02 00:41:36," Hi. Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe he life has passed so quickly and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia (SO many questions about that) where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a master and his Slave. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a Slave. Not a Slave, but rather my Slave. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"

I included the picture, as it was the inspiration for the prompt. I love the idea of a dual sort if love between a mother and son. The maternal relationship, that is enhanced by the romantic and sexual feelings on top of it. I think it is rife with amazingly sexy possibilities and situations. Things like waking up to you cooking in nothing but an apron, giving you massages that go much further, casually walking around our house in the nude, etc. We can discuss specifics, and I would prefer to talk first instead of diving in. Here are some of my kinks: incest, large cocks, cum play, exhibitionism, anal, lingerie, tit fucking and plenty more. I'd like this to be a texting/sexting/slice of life Roleplay. You text as my mom and me as myself, without as much prose and more dialogue. I'd love to know what you might include, and hope to hear from some of you!"

Feeling Lonely and Losing Confidence,1,9o13q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/9o13q2/33_m4f_newly_divorced_and_looking_for_someone_to/,2018-10-14 18:51:12,This is a lot different than any other posts I make on here and I dont really even think Ill get responses but maybe just writing it will be semi-therapeutic for me. I went through a really rough divorce over the summer and have been struggling ever since. Ive lost parts of myself that are things Ive always liked and felt they defined me as a man. One of them being my confidence in myself which Ive always had since I was young. The rejection from someone you care deeply about that divorce makes you feel shatters that and I havent been able to get it back. Its caused me to not even attempt to rejoin the dating world even though I feel incredibly lonely on a nightly basis. Its a struggle that I cant see a way out of and Im embarrassed to talk about it with anyone I know. Id love to chat with someone who doesnt know me since the vulnerability of talking about this is already hard enough and harder with someone who doesnt know this side of me. Hoping that talking with a girl can help me get some of that back. More than happy to talk on kik and would love a message from you. Hope to hear from some of you and thanks for reading!

To chat throughout the workday, if timing allows, and tease and sexually torment each other with hopes of the stars aligning. Lust and want would take over our already overflowing desire. This daily fun and erotic adventure is what Im hoping to find. I am in a physically neglectful marriage, and Im hoping to find someone who enjoys my sexual energy and wants to reciprocate in kind. The rush of leaving caution to the wind concerning a sexual experience has never happened for me. I am in the Eastern Time Zone, and work from 8am-5pm with a great deal of freedom to be less than professional during the day. To have a woman actually want to be sexual with me, even when Im at work, in my car, or sneaking around at home would be so exciting and satisfying. Would you enjoy waking up with me every morning, at least, in the virtual sense? Would you like having a man who is always eager and wanting to chat with you whenever he gets a chance? With being neglected, not only am I not satisfied, but I havent had the opportunities to satisfy someone else. I am a natural giver who seeks someone who wants and enjoys all of me. Physically, I am 6 feet tall, dirty blonde hair, a kind face, broad shoulders and chest, with a little more to love around the middle which I am working on. I personal believe that every woman is beautiful in her own way. No matter the shape, size, age (other than needing to be over 18), or ethnicity, you are perfectly you . It's our differences and little quirks that make us so interesting. If you feel like we would be a good virtual match for each other, please message me via PM. Please be wanting to send and receive flirtatious and explicit texts, pics, videos, and possibly voice calls or live chats. I know these types of things are very difficult for others to do for many reasons. I am very discreet and expect the same. Its that vulnerability part of giving up control of your pleasure to someone else that so heavenly. I love the idea of me creating a sexual story or scenario and making your body come alive as you send me visuals of approval. Listening or watching each other play and reach climax is also a great fantasy of mine. There are so many ways Im sure we can find to be completely naughty as we sneak around for each other. I am a very understanding person and not a teenager anymore lol, so I will not start humping you once I see the orange envelope. My main platforms of communication are Hangouts and Skype, but I have kik as well if that is all you can do. Even though this post is extremely sexual, I do have the natural ability of listening to others and being of great support to them. That is what is so painful about my own situation. I am the rock for my wife in these regards; however, she does not reciprocate my support of her in the way I desperately need. All PMs are welcome . Im excited to get to know you and see if we hit it off. If I dont hear from you, have a wonderful rest of your week and an uplifting weekend!"

How do you catch the eye of someone you would hope to virtually meet in just a simple phrase? Hopefully, the right woman will take a chance and be intrigued enough to open and read my own little reach out for fun, excitement, passion, and mutual satisfaction. I am a husband and father in the Midwest, USA. I have been with my loving wife for over 15 years (including dating), and I have been in a state of sexual and intimate neglect from the beginning. Its amazing to me how much the message of wait until marriage is coined and preached without any thought of how to teach and discuss what a healthy, sexual relationship within a marriage looks like. Once a month for 15 minutes is not a recipe for either party to feel wanted, needed, and satisfied. Very rarely does a weekend like this one come about in my life. I will be home, not working or other obligations, and my wife will be away until midday Sunday. I am hoping to find someone who is in a similar situation as me or at the very least enjoys the pent-up passion and energy of a sexually frustrated husband. Whether you are married, separated, or single, I am not looking to change either of our situations. Keeping things in the virtual world, specifically, I am looking to have a weekend affair where we completely throw caution to the wind and explore what makes each other come alive. This would include activities such as simple texting, sending teasing and explicit photos/videos to each other, live voice chat, and live video chat. I have been told I have the gift for story telling and creating wonderful scenarios for our imaginations to escape to. I have also been told my voice is very desirable. I know what I am looking for is difficult to find. Not that someone out there doesnt like the idea of what I have outlined, but the amount of vulnerability and risk is a real concern. It is a concern for me as well. Discretion in all areas is a must. I am hoping to get to know you through chatting off and on through the rest of the day and into tomorrow morning. I am a very genuine and caring man. More of the gentle giant type if you will. I find joy in bringing others happiness and pleasure. The bringing happiness has been available to me all my life; however, the moments of bringing pleasure has been few and far between. Physically, I am 6 feet tall, dirty blonde hair, kind eyes, a caring smile, broad shoulders and chest with a little more to love around the middle, strong arms, and thick thighs and calves. As for the physical type I am searching for, I have no requests or requirements. No matter your age (of course being 18 or over), your shape, size, or ethnicity, your energy and positive outlook is what will attract me the most. I truly believe every person is beautiful in their own special way (cue Marry Poppins lol), and it is the quirks or specific differences which make you so wonderfully you. Please be more than willing to dive into what I have outlined in this post after our getting to know each other period. I am a very passionate and giving person who is hoping to find my perfect virtual partner. All PMs are welcome and will be greatly appreciated by this man in the Eastern Time Zone. I am not a teenager anymore, so I will not jump you as soon as I see that wonderful orange envelope appear lol ... and isnt that orange envelope wonderful? "

I'm tired of feeling like I have to display myself as someone who has it all together. I sure as hell don't, and finding a partner and a submissive/slave wouldn't be about trying to uphold a false image of myself, but rather having someone to be there with, whether I feel confident, weak, scared, or joyful. I have a decent job and my own place. I'm clean, healthy, kind, intelligent, highly empathetic, and mostly sane. Outside work, I plan on being focused on you, but aside from that, I'm a reader, pc gamer and D&amp;D player. You're going to be my project. I want to train you to be purely submissive, entirely dedicated to serving me. I want to truly enforce a mindset in you, ""My Owner above myself."" I will slowly take control over every area of your life I can. Your life will eventually be scheduled and carefully controlled. There will be daily expectations for you to fulfill. Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. And when you break, by my hand or life's, you'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, and in that you have a place of strength and acceptance. You'll be that same place for me. Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul. Because it is only when I have someone to care for that I can bare mine."

We'll get to know each other and talk about what's going on in our lives and really develop an emotional connection that feels appropriate to the mother/son relationship were trying to emulate.

Even if that infatuation only lasts for a few weeks or a month, wouldnt it be amazing to be completely wanted, completely desired? Of course, those feelings are intensified when two people truly care and enjoy each other. When they share intimate details about themselves, when they pour out their worries and fears, when they make themselves vulnerable to that other person. Other than the obvious hardships of searching for companionship in the virtual world, trusting a stranger and becoming entirely vulnerable is almost impossible. Without this vulnerability however, how are the most magical exciting and intimate feelings possible? I am a married man who has been neglected and very rarely feel wanted, needed, or desired in my marriage. As most on here, I am not looking to leave my SO. I know, soon, I am going to have to confront her and experience extremely painful and heartbreaking discussions to truly change my situation. Before I open myself up and let out all the pain and rejection I have felt over the past 15 years or so, I want to feel as though I have escaped from my reality. I wish to experience what it feels like to completely be infatuated with a person and to lust for them constantly. The most exciting part of this for me is of course actually finding someone who wants and adores my advances and lustful desires towards them as well. I am searching for that person who wants to escape reality with me. Someone who enjoys me completely and how naughty I can be when teased. I am a calm, well-mannered, and compassionate man by nature, with almost an insatiable need to please once allowed or wanted to. For me, every woman is special in her own way. I desire a real woman who has lived life. I am not the shallow type who believes a woman should try and attain a supermodel figure. The pleasure is so much more delightful when the mind is provoked and teased. My hope is to find that special woman who enjoys my way of writing, my desire to send and exchanged teasing pics and videos and possibly live chat, and a woman who enjoys my unique imagination. I know moving away from just text is not for everyone. I am hoping to virtually meet that person who enjoys how showy I want to be and reciprocates my virtual treats. Physically, I am six feet tall, dirty blonde hair, kind eyes and smile, strong broad shoulders and chest with a little more to love around the middle. I believe every woman, no matter what shape, size, or age, is incredibly attractive and beautiful with how her personality and energy makes me come alive. Below, I am going to lay out one of my fantasies if I should ever find a person to experience it with. I know this post is already very long compared to others. If you arent curious about me after what you have already read, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your summer . Before I dive into one of my fantasies, please know that I see woman differently than most men. It might be my upbringing and only having sisters, but I sincerely believe you are truly, wonderfully you. (Fantasy) Night Time Moment of Desire ... Im not sure if my situation is similar to others, but once I am home for the day, I very rarely have any time to myself. There is no personal time to relax and mentally get away from the stresses and hardships of the day. On a more depressing not, that means that there is no time at home for me to take care of myself since my wife does not think of being intimate with me more than once or twice a month if I am fortunate. This fantasy stems from that lack of alone time. Escape with me to an evening where 10pm is approaching, and you and I have been sending teasing messages back and forth whenever we are able to sneak one in with my wife always being only a few feet from me. You have sent me tantalizing texts as I sit in a chair just next to the couch my wife is on. You have so much fun knowing I am becoming increasingly aroused and not able to do a thing about it. I send you a quick picture of the obscene bulge in my boxers which you have caused. You relish at how hard you get me; how much I throb for you. This game of tease and torment lasts about an hour, and then communication breaks for about fifteen minutes. You know when I am at home, messaging is hit and miss due to my situation, so you start to think about what fun we might have tomorrow while I am at work. Then, you see your phone light up with a notification. Its a message, from me. Are you alone? ..... Those three words are all you see. You reply Yes in a split second. Shes in the bathroom, about to shower. Do you want to play with your lover while Im in my bed? Your heart starts to race, the excitement building at what is about to happen. The hour-long tease you put me through has put you in a complete state of need and arousal as well. With a feeling of pure lust and desire you reply to me, Call me...NOW! Immediately you see your phone showing a video call coming from me. You answer with your body feeling the excitement rippling through and my face appears on the screen. I tell you we have just a few minutes while my wife is in the shower, and I want to play with my virtual lover. You nod your head and have the sexiest, wanting smile on your face. The next ten minutes are filled with us teasing and pushing and playing with each other, desperately wanting to make the other cum. If you were living out this fantasy with me, who do you think would be pushed over the edge first? Fair warning, I am insatiable when it comes to making a woman cum. Im guessing it stems from rarely being able to fulfill that need at home. I hope you enjoyed this little peek into my imagination. All PMs are welcome. I am in the Eastern Time Zone. If you enjoyed what you read, feel free to check out some of my past posts from the last few weeks. Thank you for reading this extremely long and detailed post.

Here are some of my kinks: incest, large cocks, cum play, exhibitionism, anal, lingerie, tit fucking and plenty more. I'd love to know what you might include, and hope to hear from some of you!"

Seeing other people's bodies, as they see yours, in its purest form is amazing. It can be sexy, and sensual, just like any other form of dress. But it can also be warm, cozy, and just natural."

As for the situation, it'd be adorable if we were coming back from a night out or something and just fancy being intimate in the musty summer heat of the early morning- only after a little chat though, as will be explained below. **Tip 1: Just telling me what you look like does virtually nothing for me.** This throws some guys, because a lot of you are super visual when it comes to arousal, and that's fine- it's actually hella cute sometimes- but when you only describe your shell, you're not telling me what's more important: what's in it. I want to know things along the emotionally driven lines of; if your dogs love you; if you're excellent in the kitchen; if you're the cool uncle/brother; your favourite cuddling position; where you are in the world; the things that make your mother smile when thinking about you (genuinely the best way I could think of summing that vein of thing up, I have failed you all); which languages you speak, and just all sorts of things that make you the wonderful you you are. If you leap in with the way you look and some dirt, I'm not going to be ready or willing. **Tip 2: Make me laugh please.** If you have sharp wit and/or a sense of humour, but you sacrifice it in order to appear all super masculine and moody, then you've made a terrible choice. If you want me to be blushing, all wrapped up in my blanket and smiling like an idiot over thoughts of you, then you must take the chuckle train to giggle town, and that's nonnegotiable. Being moody and stoic may appeal to the super problematic *I'm gonna fix him and help him be happy* part of my brain, but that part never has the good ideas and quite frankly drinks too much. **Tip 3: Kisses and vulnerability.** Make my limbs feel weak as I wrap them around you, make my breath shallow and frantic, arc over me, blot out the sun, and kiss me. Slowly. If you can create this vibe of gently but firmly imposing yourself on me, I will probably fall in love with you. Don't be afraid to be sensual, to stroke; to whisper; to invade my neck; to be kinda goofy and a little silly, but definitely in control, ultimately looking to make me melt in your arms. Nuzzle my nose, kiss me but barely make contact, make me moan long and soft to the point that I'm lightheaded. Fold my legs back, no need to shove them or push them, let me open them for you, but at the delicate command of your powerful-guy-hands. **Tip 4: Please be nice to me, thank you.** You might be used to treating women however you like, but it's not going to fly with me. I'm not your 'dumb slut' unless we've agreed on me being called that beforehand, so bringing that or similar out of nowhere is not appreciated. I like sex as much as you, and that's not something I'm going to be shamed for just because I'm a girl and you have a purity complex. **Remember,** I actually want to make you cum, I really do, and paying attention to these things is going to make me go all out in order to achieve that. Because if you interest me with yourself, make me laugh, pay attention to gently making me feel vulnerable during intimate moments, and respect me, then there's genuinely no words to describe how intensely you'll turn me on, and the lengths I'll go to to make sure you're drained. Drained, boy, because if you tick these boxes you will shatter the fabric of my life and turn me into a zombie obsessed with your sexual release. So, I look forward to hearing from you :) also you can combine this with ageplay!"

Imagine, the flirtatious chat building and building to more naughty and risque messages where you can feel the excitement build from deep within your being. Imagine feeling completely safe and protected as you let yourself go and submit to what you have always wanted and desired. That feeling of vulnerability which makes everything else seem so much more wonderful and vivid. I have longed to feel this connection with someone for over a decade now. I am not looking to change your situation or mine, and I am looking to keep everything in the virtual world. There is a part of me that needs to make a woman feel happiness and pleasure in a sexual and intimate way. Will you allow me to let my hidden passion come alive? For a few weeks or so, would you want my mind to always be on you? Close your eyes and picture what it would be like to send such intimate messages back and forth. Close your eyes and try to see what it would be like to live chat with someone or turn on your camera to see someone on the other end who has so much want and need for you. I have dreamed of finding a person to have such an affair with, and I hope this summer I can make this dream come true. I am a very passionate and caring man. For instance, I have been described as a big ole' teddy bear. My body type is more on the thick and strong side, so please be turned on by a man like that. I am interested in a woman who wants to be with me and loves the attention I give her. A woman who opens up and has a blast with me. This means a real woman, wonderful curves and all, who likes the sweet messages this big bear of a man wants to give. All pms welcome. In my opinion, age is just a number. All I ask is that you are over 18, like myself ;)"

Reddit is your veritable playground, and the only question for you is which jungle gym to climb on top of. So why in the world would you send me a message? Here's what I'm offering. I will try my best to be whatever you want me to be. Consider me tabula rasa. You want a Daddy Dom? Easy. You want a degrading asshole? I'll try my best to cut to the core. You want the lovable boyfriend type? I got you. How about some alien creature running sexual experiments via text? Sure. Why not. Want me to pretend like I'm Winnie The Pooh? Gimmie that honey pot girl. Maybe you just want me to be me. That's fine too. Or, we can just talk and feel each other out. Please keep in mind, I'm not interested in story crafting or world building.This will purely be two people talking. Now what am I asking for in return? Well, it's hard to define, exactly. I want a woman. Let's start with that. I want her to be confident, intelligent, a little sassy, a little innocent, sexy, maybe a little evil and manipulative. I want her to be popular. I want her to be wanted by others (and I want her to make that clear to me), but I want her to want me. I want there to be connection and chemistry. Flirting and intrigue. Sharing and vulnerability. I want to be addicted to you like a fat kid to cake. I want to crave your attention, and I want you to drip feed it to me and string me along. I want you to find yourself inexplicably thinking about me in a way that you can safely say you never have before. I want perfection. I want you to demand perfection from me. And at the end of it all, I want it to culminate in something filthy and fun and mutually beneficial to both us in light of the time taken out of both of our undoubtedly busy lives. If you've read this far then maybe you're intrigued. Maybe this post has you a little leery. Maybe you think I sound a little bit crazy. Well, here's where you take a chance. A leap of faith. Message me. See what happens. Worst case scenario you ghost me. Best case it becomes something fulfilling and fun and meaningful and addicting and dangerous and naughty and thrilling and maybe a little immoral. I can't wait to see what kind of responses I get to this post. I can't wait for the excitement of discovering someone new. I can't wait for the uncertainty of how to react to each other. I can't wait to hear from you."

Thanks in advance. I'm an adult female person looking for another person, preferably dominant in nature, to engage in a long-term interaction involving you doing your best to subliminally condition and brainwash me. Maybe this is silly. Maybe it's made up and impossible? I know just enough about hypnotism and subliminal advertising to be unsure how I feel about its effectiveness. Regardless, I'm not interested in a roleplay. The reason this idea is exciting is the vulnerability of it. The fact that you might actually be able to mess with my head in ways I won't realize or be able to stop. I'll be at work for most of the day so I'll be limited in terms of how much I can talk and what I can look at, but as we go forward I'll commit to looking at, reading, watching, or listening to anything you want me to (within reason). If you send me something I can safely look at at work, then I will do so. I'm a submissive person naturally and I have an active imagination, but I'm also smart and think I can be stubborn sometimes. I'm not certain how that would all effect this kind of interaction, but it seems worth noting.

Maybe this is silly. Maybe it's made up and impossible? I know just enough about hypnotism and subliminal advertising to be unsure how I feel about its effectiveness. Regardless, I'm not interested in a roleplay. The reason this idea is exciting is the vulnerability of it. The fact that you might actually be able to mess with my head in ways I won't realize or be able to stop. As we go forward I'll commit to looking at, reading, watching, or listening to anything you want me to (within reason). Stuff that's sneaky or subtle rather than overt is a bit more exciting to me, since the manipulation aspect is especially hot, but I'm open to whatever you think will work best. I'm a submissive person naturally and I have an active imagination, but I'm also smart and think I can be stubborn sometimes. I'm not certain how that would all effect this kind of interaction, but it seems worth noting. If you're interested in chatting, please send me a PM with your kik name and let me know what experience you have with this sort of mental conditioning stuff, or why you would be a good fit for this interaction.

She had insisted, even just pulling off my last article of clothing while she remained fully dressed. I felt a little uncomfortable at first, but God could she persuade. Each time I tried to collect myself enough to dissent, I soon found myself lost in a blinding white passion. I've never kissed someone like that before. Hell, I've never been kissed like that.. Jesus. She was always so intent, it was almost kind of strange. Yanking off my boxers whenever she could, always teasing about how I should just not bother with any clothes.. Despite typically being shy, I found myself excited by this change of pace; by the vulnerability and voyeurism. Her affection seemed to embolden me, despite the one sidedness of our attire. We often talked about moving in together. One night at her place, laying with her, I jokingly mentioned how I would probably wear a lot less clothes if I lived with her full time. Her response was, ""Oh, you'd be naked all the time. I think I'd throw away all your clothes."" I didn't realize at the time how serious she was, but I would learn soon enough... ------------------------ Hey DPP. This prompt is inspired by a previous experience of mine - lately, I've found myself interested in CFNM, exhibitionist stuff or even ENM (embarrassed naked male). Things like losing my clothes for an extended period (maybe permanently!), or maybe even ending up nude in front of multiple people, or in public. If you want to RP, we can follow this prompt wherever it goes, or even try out something completely different. If this sounds mildly interesting to you, I'd be up to roleplay, but I'm also just as willing to have a casual conversation. Do you have any questions or thoughts, or do I just seem like a crazy person? Do you have experience with this kind of thing? Let me know what you think. Regardless, thanks for the read, and I hope you have a good night!"

You no longer have to worry, you now have the chance to be as vulnerable as possible. I want you to tell me your stories, tell me your secrets, tell me the one time you hooked up with a stranger, or cheated on your partner. Tell me the time you masturbated in public, or sent pictures. Tell me something you regret and just want to get off your chest. Be your real self with me, and I will be my real self with you. Complete vulnerability, and I will of course share my stories. Hope you enjoy this opportunity. And if you need someone to command you, to be the dom to your sub and put you in your place. Someone who has so much control that even over text you know that your body is for my needs, than feel free to message as well."

Not because I think the sort of people to enjoy this are broken or self hating. Not because I want a cheap high from using off color language. but because it's so personal, and because it invites such a deep level of intimacy, trust, and vulnerability. Not just on your part, but on both of ours. This is why I used that word ""involved"" - this is not an invitation for a hollow role play. This is an interrogation of how we understand ourselves relative to our partner, and experience power and sexuality. Ideally, this sort of thing will leave us both a little shaken. If you've read this entire post (I get a lot of replies from people who obviously have not) and like what you see then please send an introduction. I expect decorum, and introspection. If you can't stand out as an individual, then you will be promptly ignored. Likewise if you insist on jumping right into using two-dimensional, hypersexual language from the get go. Don't be boring. I'm sure as hell not. Looking forward to your lovely reply :) now now, that's all too intense, I get it. That's why we're not going to make this a one time thing - we're going to get to know each other, and it's going to be sweet and romantic, desperate and shameful, and always sensual.
