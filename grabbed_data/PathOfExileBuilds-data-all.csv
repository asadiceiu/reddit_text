0,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,Slayer Masterful Form Slam Build with 100% Fist of War uptime,1,i25ssr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/i25ssr/slayer_masterful_form_slam_build_with_100_fist_of/,2020-08-02 13:55:39,"PoB Link: URL **Intro** I've always wanted to build something around Slayer's Masterful Form node. I've had several ideas but they were all either very expensive (requiring badge of the brotherhood), or not very good. The 3.11 update removed all of the in-tree sources of 'reduced physical damage taken', but they have buffed Enduring Cry to have that effect that scales with endurance charges. Masterful Form lets us access high maximum endurance charge counts by investing into frenzy charges. They have also buffed the minimum charge nodes (Disciple of the Unyielding and Disciple of the Slaughter) to give 8% damage per endurance or frenzy charge respectively. This means with 7 frenzies and endurances, you get 112% increased damage! We get those nodes by using medium thread of hope near duelist. Pathing there manually is too expensive. The main idea for the build is to maintain 100% Fist of War. We are 'cheating' here, attacking every 1.8s is too slow. We can bypass that limitation by using two skills instead. This is the same trick that people used to use for Unleash support. The timeout is tied to the active skill and not Fist of War itself. In my build, I essentially have two 5 links instead of one 6 link. In the build above, you can see that in my 6-linked weapon, I have the following gems socketed. 1. Vaal Earthquake 2. Earthquake 3. Fist of War 4. Impale 5. Brutality 6. Less Duration With 0.9s attack time, you can alternate between the Earthquakes and every one of them will be ancestrally boosted. You can even swap the second earthquake for Earth Shatter if you want something different. Clear speed should essentially be the same. We are also utilizing impale for a huge damage boost. People say that impale is not as effective on slow attacking builds, but that is not true. It essentially doubles your damage. It also leads to some amusing moments. What often happens is your slam will leave the boss at low health, and your herald of purity minions will proc your impales to finish the boss off. The build linked above takes quite a lot of investment and is what I've ended up with after a lot of trial and error. I've used that build and killed Sirus 8 and Simulacrum 20 with ease. I'll list budget alternatives to those gears later, but first I'll explain the few sources of pain for the build. **Issue 1: Frenzy Charge Generation** There aren't many ways to generate frenzy charges as a Slayer. Here are ways to maintain frenzy charges. 1. Blood Rage - this is excellent... but only during mapping 2. Farrul's Fur - another excellent choice, not too expensive, but this means you are not going to get explody chest 3. Terminus Est/Oro's Sacrifice - this is good, but they have high attack speed and swords don't get much option for physical slams. If you are not going for the 100% FoW uptime, Terminus Est is a great option and you can use perforate. With Oro's you should go for tectonic slam, but you'll have to change the build a bit. 4. Mob Mentality cluster jewel notable - annoying, but good enough to maintain frenzy charges while bossing (bosses have count for 20 warcry power, so you will always get one random charge) For a long time I was just using Farrul's Fur, and yes that is pretty much the best unique chest you can get. However I am addicted to explody chest, and I've since changed to a self crafted body armour. Now I am using a combination of Blood Rage and Mob Mentality. Blood Rage is more than sufficient to maintain while mapping, and Mob Mentality is good enough for bossing. For bosses with phases like Sirus, you want a Redblade Banner shield on your weapon swap. During phase transitions, just weapon swap and spam warcries to maintain your charges. I hate that I have to do that, it is so annoying. If I ever get my hands on an explody weapon, I'll most likely revert to Farrul's. **Issue 2 - Maximum Frenzy Charges** Since this is still a *slam* build, you have to invest a lot of points in the marauder side of the tree. This makes it hard to get to the 3rd frenzy charge node near assassin. You will likely have to anoint it on your amulet. This is a shame because you will miss out on +1 curse or +1% maximum elemental resistance, but for DPS anointing the maximum frenzy charge is probably your best option. Still, after getting all in-tree frenzy charges, you will only have 6 maximum frenzy charges. Masterful Form will only give you 3 additional endurance charges. Is it even worth 2 ascendancy points? To make sure we get the most out of those ascendancy points, we will have to invest elsewhere. There are several options that you can go for. 1. Warlord gloves - not too difficult to roll 2. Gloves corruption implicit - combine this with warlord gloves and you got a BiS gloves, but it is almost impossible to get this. 3. Darkray Vectors - this is pretty good, but boots slot is usually used to top up resistances. Also in this league, you probably want something cool like Elusive boots, but otherwise it is a good option. 4. Shaper swords/axe - self crafting weapons is a pain in the ass, if you can get good prefixes go for it. 5. Precursor's Emblem - don't hope for this, plus it is not that good compared to curse on hit rings 6. Synthesized Rings - again, don't hope for this, but I think this will be BiS. Currently I am rolling 7 maximum frenzy charges. The only out of tree source of frenzy charge I have is the one from warlord's gloves. It rolled with culling strike, how can I not use those? It allowed me to unspec from bane of legends and get overwhelm to get some base critical strike chance. I wish masterful form came with an extra frenzy charge out of the bat, though. **Issue 3 - Attack Speed** With level 21 Fist of War, ideally you want to attack at most once every 0.88 seconds. Realistically though, your attack time can be as fast as 0.8 seconds. This is because you will not be attacking continuously, you will have to include your warcries in your rotation. This is my ideal rotation: 1. Rallying Cry 2. Seismic Cry 3. Earthquake 4. Earthquake 5. Intimidating Cry 6. Earthquake 7. Earthquake 8. Enduring Cry 9. Earthquake Most weapons are too fast for this, even with Pulverize you can easily breach 0.8s attack time. You have attack speed from frenzy charges after all. The best unique weapon for this build is indeed, Marohi Erqi. You get both slow attack speed (from local reduced attack speed), and a free Pulverize support. With all the charges, onslaught and blood rage, I have roughly 0.85 attack time. **Minimum Requirements** As stated, my build is not 'budget'. To do this style of build, you want to at least have these gears. 1. 6-L Marohi Erqi 2. Farrul's Fur 3. Warcry Cluster jewel with Haunting Shout and Lead by Example (for 'free' intimidate and onslaught) 4. Amulet with 'Frenetic' anointed (2 silver and 1 azure oil) 5. Gloves with +1 frenzy charge (for a long time I have Haemophillia with the corruption implicit) This is the bare minimum and you can clear sirus 8, the rest of your equipment should just be life, resistances and quality of life (avoid ailments, etc). When you accumulate currency, these should be your first upgrades. 1. Warlord Amulet with reduced pride mana reservation along with level 3 enlighten - This is how you fit pride into the build, otherwise don't use pride, flesh and stone is more important. 2. Vulnerability on hit ring - just get a warlord ring with full prefixes and an empty suffix and augment phys, guaranteed to give you vulnerability. 3. Mace cluster jewel with 'Overlord' for fortify on hit - this frees fortify support and you can replace it with brutality. Luxury upgrades like explody and +1 curse chest can come later. With additional curse, you can get a assassin's mark on hit ring. **Budget Alternatives** **Marohi Erqi is too Expensive** Go full elemental! I originally started this with a 6 link Debeon's Dirge, and it got me pretty far. The tree will look pretty much identical, without impale of course! I also tried brain rattler for a while, that is also a good option, but not as budget as debeon's. Panquetzalitzi seems like a good option too. If you go elemental, you can also use **Surgebinders**, corrupted with +1 frenzy. This shouldn't be too expensive. It was my what I used initially. I believe Kongor's Undying rage is a good alternative, but I've never tried it. It should be good for both physical and elemental (with ele overload). **Farrul's Fur is too Expensive** You can just use any other chest, but you will need a warcry cluster jewel with Mob Mentality. They aren't too expensive. They are not too hard to craft either. If you ever get a 'reforge with speed modifier' harvest craft, you are guaranteed either lead by example or mob mentality. Speed crafts are hard to come by though, and I'll just suggest you alteration spam for it. I hope you enjoy the build and give it a try!"

I'm pretty tanky but can get blown up fast as hell. I die a lot, actually. I dont do any damage, things like Chimera takes minutes, i82 Veritania took minutes...it just feels really awkward and my pdps is like 550 (not bad, not great right?) My SSF crafted gear is a (very very very very slow) work in progress, where I feel like I barely got capped res until I hit t13. None of my gear besides my chest and my weapon would ever sell on trade league. I've died 150+ times since maps. I can do t14-16 maps ""comfortably"" where the clear is okay but ""ONE TAPPING"" bosses is just unimaginable to me. Certain mods are unplayable, like extra phys as elemental dmg, and vulnerability - the latter is disgusting to play with as melee and I never felt it was so bad as a ranged class. Is my skill tree too horrible for how badly geared I am? I hit all the right things on paper, things I'd always look for in a build. 150-175% life? Check. Some means of regen? Check, I have enduring cry and 7 endurance charges. Some means of defenses? 90% phys reduction , capped res, 42/60% chance to block attack/spell 50% damage...The only thing that I think really fucks with me is the crit. Maybe my gear is not good enough for crit and resolute technique would be better. I have 0 regret orbs to fuck around with, and I feel like I am incredibly point starved with needing intelligence (warstaff) and dexterity (cull strike, blood rage) so my skill tree is awkward. I never took alira. So to summarize my questions I guess 1) Do I need to overhaul my skill tree to go from crit to resolute technique, and with that go from undeniable to unstoppable? 2) Should I stray away from glancing blows (since you cant even reach max block anyways with glancing blows) and just go maces? Any direction would be nice. I recognize Jugg has the potential to be damn near immortal, and I'm just not seeing it. I saw Steelmage goes crit earthshatter and tried to model my build somewhere between his and Aziires on the poe forum...and I feel like Steelmages gear is unreasonable for me to ever obtain. Somehow manages to get BiS for SSFHC and I can barely get res capped hahah URL I'm going to assume my build is 1000000% my problem as to how I allocated points. Any advice would be awesome."

The Math with an lvl 20 GC (afaik) would be 5 times 70% Percent, minus the support gem that you cant link, because you have to link GC. Right? So we have 5-linked Earthshatter, dealing 50k average dmg 6-linked it gets to 80k average dmg or 250k DPS with my current 1.4 Attacks/Second 6-linked with GC we have ((50k*0,7*5)(average dmg*30%less dmg*5 mirrage warriors) 175k per GC use. With my current setup my GC has a CD of close to 1.5secs. Am I assuming right, that this would be like 0,66 Attacks/Second? So we get to 116k Dps? Like mentioned above, 6-linked with 1.4 Attacks/Second and the best Damage Support gem i would have like 250k DPS and GC would be a significantly dps decrease. Now we come to the spicy part: Earthsatter has a 2nd dmg part, where all the spikes we created explode. And even if in the text of Eartshatter is the line that we can only have like 15 spikes, i am not pretty sure about it. Often it feels like i explode 25 spikes, cause im having 5 mirrage warriors attacking with Earthshatter. Anyway, the dmg from the spikes can overlap and when we would have 25 spikes with overlapping dmg per use from GC, it would be pretty awesome. Right now im using GC as my main ability. I leapslam(supported with impale, fortify and shockwave) in a pack, use GC and at this moment i GC from pack to pack. For bosses i have an arcanist brand with desecrate, vulnerability and Purifying Flame. Atm I am thinking about to use a six linked real attack/slam and have a 4 link GC for extra dmg. But right now Im loving the concept of beeing a General and scream at my warriors to kill smth. POB: URL Really would love some ideas, suggestions or anything else. Thanks in advance!"

I'm still using Maim with Infernal Cry but I'm not really sure what else to use. I tried using Cast on Melee Kill with Phase Run but it seems to trigger very rarely since the Combust from Infernal Cry needs to do the killing blow. I've also tried using Rage Support but you don't attack fast enough to make great use of it. I'm thinking of trying Culling Strike and Onslaught, might even try Blind support."

A friend of mine gifted me a Kondo's since I really like using 2h Swords and now I want to somewhat make use of it. Here's my tree attempt: [URL The idea was using either Sweep, Lacerate or Smite, grabbing all the important survival points in the tree and some good 2h stuff.

Enlighten + Blasphemy on Warlord's Mark and Vulnerability. This setup would probably be also in Favour of Lacerate, so Blood and Sand is a must as well. This pretty much leaves me with little Mana to cast my spells and with enough Leech nodes it should be manageable. &amp;#x200B; If going Elementalist, I would go for Sweep or Smite and Discord Artisan with my spare points. Pick Mastermind of Discord and Paragon of Calamity. &amp;#x200B; Besides that, I really liked using Enduring Cry on my first character and it felt really awesome as defensive skill, so I would use that as well. Leap Slam + Faster Attacks for movement and Cast when Damage taken (1) + Motel Shell as backup defence. &amp;#x200B; Since this is my first time creating a build, I greatly appreciate any help to make this ""dream"" of a build work.

My name is Nawul and I need help with my Self-Curse Doryanis Prototype Occultist build. Im at level 85 atm, the build seems pretty good but I need suggestions on better path/items/skills. The build revolves around Curse Effectiveness and self-cursing with Conductivity, the ascendancy choice is pretty obvious, its Occultist because of curse effectiveness, extra curse, better clear and helps me capping Chaos Resist (+60% via Withering Presence). Heres the POB: [URL I already have all the items besides the Shield. I can reach -277% Lightning Resistance with 2x Thread of Hope, 1x Immortal Flesh &amp; Conductivity, with a few adjustments and new clusters I can reach -350%+ but I dont know if worth it losing a few damage/EHP nodes for it. The build ends on Lv.96, I know its high but for me its pretty chill to get there. I have 1.079m Arc DPS with no Awakened gems and theres a few items missing in POB (Helmet, Boots, Both Rings, Flasks). Tested with Shock Nova the damage seems better overall, 2M on Nova and 1M on the rings, 3M with good positioning. The DPS is pretty nice when I equip the Cowards Legacy belt (+50% Curse Effect on You) + Pain Attunement, but EVERYTHING will hit you like a truck (boosted Vulnerability 100% uptime on you), and because of the +50% Curse Effect on You when Im cursed with Ele. Weakness my resists drop near to zero, its terrible. I have a pretty cool Determination Watchers Eye for the unaffected by Vulnerability but I cant find space on mana reservation for it, even if I found other curses (from mobs or map itself) would make me REALLY squishy. I would like new suggestions from build pathing, items, ascendancy, everything! Feel free to criticize and suggest anything you want, im having a blast leveling the build and I really want to make it work and ill probably play in standard with it after the end of Harvest. Im in love with Doryanis Prototype and I really want to exploit the item.

10,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,What do I do with my 2 6 links in my penance brand inquisitor?,5,hx3s6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/hx3s6f/what_do_i_do_with_my_2_6_links_in_my_penance/,2020-07-25 01:28:01,"URL Hi all, This is my current build. It started as mathil's league start. I fell in love with Harvest crafting after I found out about a few of the deterministic recipes (crit chest, elusive boots) and started trying to do things on all my gear, to the point that I'm pretty proud of where I'm at. My helm is self-crafted and gives me a 7 link on its own, which is where I have my penance brand. So, I'm looking for what to do with my two 6 link slots. Currently, Disintegrator is 5-linked but I have 1500 fusings to 6 link if there's a compelling reason to. #Evolution of the Build 1. Mathil's league start was great. I got through the game and to maps relatively quickly, and his build served me well and got me through the atlas. 2. I crafted a +3 lightning 7 link (pcoc) staff on my own, and switched by build to have less points on the assassin side to grab staff global crit stuff instead, as well as picking up the glancing blows keystone using a thread of hope. I spent a long time here crafting a way to get defensive layers, doubling down on taste of hate by adding in %physical damage taken as cold to my chest and helm, while also getting +max cold resist on gloves. 3. All that defense meant nothing to Sirus, and I started looking for more damage scaling, since it seems all the penance brand league starts used arcanist brand+wave of conviction pre-nerf. I found someone using disintegrator with elemental conversions and plugged it into PoB, which showed a huge damage increase. 2. So I swapped out my 7 link staff for disintegrator, used some +random influence crafts to get a shaper stygian, got two COTB, crafted lightning conversion on gloves and swapped out the phys to lightning gem for a cold to fire. 4. This version has been incredibly strong, and crafting my 7link helm has left me in a confusing bind on what to do in the other two 6-links I currently have. My chest is currently using blade vortex as additional damage. When I run t14-15 maps, it does enough damage with both heralds that I can sprint through maps not casting spells. However, t16 mobs are generally too tough and I still need to cast brands, since slowing down to let multiple ticks of BV hit defeats the purpose, since 1 cast of a brand can clear a room. The brands one-shot everything which means the BV is just pretty graphics and maybe a last ditch defensive layer that hits them before they hit me if something sneaks by. It's basically the same story in delve, where at around depth 240 it's not enough damage to kill things but it's nice to keep mobs from 2 shotting me. My brands do about 4.3mil on a 20 pulse and 11mil on explosion, whereas BV does around 1.6mil and VBV does around 1.1mil. While it's nice to 100-0 conquerors in 8 seconds, it hasn't helped me kill Sirus on my own. This is my first league with the new Atlas and it's hard to get practice on Sirus. I feel that I should just stick to my penance brands and run something more defensive in my chest/6 link. #Eventual Goals I think the next step I want to work towards is a big one. I want to replace disintegrator. It's a pain as I'm still only at 6 siphoning charges (missing 2xrings and boots) and I can't *quite* survive 6 siphoning charges when the fight ends. 2x surging vitality (fettle is too difficult to roll) keeps me topped up, and of course leech makes it a non-issue, but vulnerability becomes an unmanageable map mod. I can keep my curse flask going and weapon swap when something slows me down (looting, a wrong turn in a bad layout) but it'd be nice to get rid of that extra step altgoether. But it's *so much damage loss*, even with perfect items. Swapping to a 90ex staff &gt;Rarity: Rare Gale Pillar Eclipse Staff 100% increased Global Critical Strike Chance (implicit) -------- +2 to Level of all Spell Skill Gems +2 to Level of all Lightning Spell Skill Gems +1 to Maximum Power Charges Gain 10% of Elemental Damage as Extra Chaos Damage 17% increased Damage per Power Charge 10% chance to deal Double Damage (crafted) -------- Shaper Item Crusader Item -------- Note: ~b/o 90 exalted Actually lowers my damage by like 12%. The plan was to swap to a pair of quadruple extra conversion scepters (phys as extra lightning, cold, and random element, alongside non-chaos as chaos or elemental as chaos), alongside swapping to shaper/hunter boots and shaped COTBx2. At that point, I'd be dealing 50% chaos from my eternity shroud and get the full penetration, which I don't have from my ascendancy which only affects elemental resists. That whole setup input into POB shows me going from 11mill to 7.2mill on explosions. It's kind of put me at a a loss on where to go here. I had thought I would craft ""trigger a socketed spell when you cast a spell"" craft on one of the 1handers and use it to consistently cast my steelskin, but now I don't know what to do. #TLDR 1. ~~What do I do with my 2 6 links right now? BV as a secondary skill isn't super helpful for where I'm currently delving or for t16 maps.~~ I will be swapping BV to a support skill with coh, pcoc, and maybe blind. Still taking suggestions if there's something else to do here. 2. **It feels like a lot to invest 5 links into enduring cry/steelskin, especially since it doesn't seem like steelskin is doing anything. I'm not really tanky enough to survive multiple hits and my reaction time isn't even that good. If spamming a potion and flame dashing away doesn't save me, it doesn't feel like steelskin will help. What defensive tool should I use here?** 3. **Any swaps I can make to add tankiness or defensive layers? I'm still relatively new to planning builds.** Still interested in advice here related to changes to the passive tree too. 4. **Any advice on disintegrator?

I mostly play some copied build from poe ninja reach t10-15 maps and stop around there. I wanted to make my own project with some shitty axe/shield perforate bleed something berserker (i like how he goes brrrr) but I am really struggling defensively. URL Here is what I have so far. I decided to get some basic axe/bleed/shield/life and go from there. I want to make it tanky but I do not know how. I am missing on game mechanic knowledge so I am asking for help. I think about gettin aspect of carnage as the last berserker asc but I am afraid I will get one shot when I get into a map at this point. Basically I got fortify node and use fortify with my main skill but I am not sure if it does it. Maybe move fortify to leap slam and put ruthless in 6l? Any uniques I should look for? I also got 2 cast when damage taken setups. I swapped steelskin with vulnerability since I was not really feeling it. With immortal call/molten shell/active berserk I feel very weak. I die when I enter the temple of Atzoatl. Even at 2 packs is hard and rely on health potion and brrr leech to stay alive. I am aware that when I level a bit more and get a little better gear should be OKish but I am looking for general guidance how to go for a bit more defensive setup/tree/items/etc. Any suggestions how to fix this character? My main goal is nothing fancy. If I manage to simply spam t14-16 should be enough for now. Will look further to kill some boss after I learn how to play.

Scaling+ minion physical damage to attacks from the Abyss Jewels, combined with the grip of the council and hatred in an essence worm ring, this will a flat % increase as cold, which should mean Brutality isn't necessary Hopefully running Feeding Frenzy and Chieftain Spectres to give them frenzys, aswell as a Carrion Golem (which will also be boosted by +8 from Cold Irons and Ascendancy) should give plenty of added physical damage. In theory I plan to run a 4link with Cyclone - Desecrate - Cast While Channeling - Bone Offering, ideally on boots with Socketed Gems supported by Fortify With Coming Calamity I should be able to run Vitality for additional life regen for survivability, aswell as picking up the Divine Flesh node situated on the Mind over Matter Keystone, will provide additional elemental defenses in place of Chaos Resistance, this will mean additional chaos res required but add extra layers of survivability against multiple layers of damage. The affix of Circle or Guilt providing additional physical damage reduction and added defenses via the Pantheons of Gruthkul and Solaris will provide extra survivability without added investment. I've yet to figure out how I wish to apply Vulnerability but otherwise I think most of the things I wish to achieve are there. Any thoughts or suggestions? Thanks in advance, Exiles"

This league, I had the idea of maxing out impale damage using the new cluster jewel node ""Rotten Claws"" + Dread Banner &amp; Generosity combo, and lastly 40% dread banner effect which gave my zombies and carrions with 99% chance to impale. I've done serious research to calculate the true damage of carrion golems' combo attack. Inside the PoB, I've updated a previous workaround to accommodate the new nerfs. Calculations came from another subreddit thread. To cut things short, I've added the buffs from Ruins Hellion and Animated Guardian; also added the full 50% more damage of carrions with 10 non-golems; also included the 800%/6 more attack speed of carrion golems when doing the 6-part combo attacks. \---------------------------------------------- TLDR; [URL BUILD OVERVIEW PROS 1. TANKY, so many layers of defense 2. HIGH DPS, both bossing and mapping 3. VERY DECENT CLEAR SPEED 4. INSANE SINGLE TARGET 5. Viable as a starter 6. Does all contents with ease, including simulacrum CONS 1. Expensive min-maxing 2. You will need lvl 21 gems 3. Only around 500hp regen 4. Getting a good rolled Xibaqua jewel is really hard 5. You CAN still DIE to hardcore (like 10x) random overlapping delirium explosions if you stand on a single spot and not run around. 6. Can't do 100% delirious map, 80% is our limit. 7. Some zombies will die if the map is really really juiced. 8. Minions will be gone each time you logout so you need to resummon them again (except spectres). Kinda fuc. MECHANICS 1. We use 4 spectres, 3 for buffing our golems, and 1 for defensive utility. We use 2 carnage chieftains (frenzy charge generation), 1 host chieftain (power charge generation), and ancient wraith (+1 curse limit, enfeeble on hit) OR ruins hellion (powerful rallying cry) which I really don't like because he dies like 75% of the time when playing on juiced delirium maps. 2. We use animated guardian to buff our minions and our self even more. Kingmaker, Gruthkul's Pelt, Victario's Flight, Helm with NEARBY ENEMIES TAKE INC PHYS DMG mod, and gloves with CURSE VULN on hit. 3. We use 8 zombies in total which deal around 130k DPS each and also apply impale stacks. They're just there to buff golems, and to deal decent damage. 4. We use the new cluster jewel with Rotten Claws (20% chance to impale for minions) and other juicy nodes like Renewal and Feasting Fiends to buff our minions even more. 5. We are stacking only 2 Primordial Harmonies (enough to let the golems slam around every 2 seconds), 1 Might (make your golems angry af), 1 Anima (+1 max golem), and the rest will be Eminence to max out our golems' attack speed. 6. We are using Xibaqua jewel which gives Divine Flesh. I paired this with Ahn's Heritage and now my defense is bonkers. ![img](2jt8e7zodov41 ""Juicy resistances"") OFFENSE: 1. We got 4 undying Carrion Golems who wreak havoc with around 3M Shaper DPS. 2. 8 Zombies in our arsenal, dealing around 1M DPS in total. 3. We just phase run through the map and let the golems kill everything. Then DEATHMARK those thicc single targets and see them get smashed by our army. DEFENSE: 1. 46% base phys redux 90% with flasks up 2. 79% max fire res, 78% max cold and lightning----in addition, 50% of any elemental damage taken gets reduced by our 87% max chaos res (Divine Flesh) paired with Soul of Shakari (5% REDUCED chaos damage taken) now that's gg. 3. up to 49% attack block (max roll Rumi's Concoction) 4. 70% chance to evade, given that the enemies are blinded (Minions have chance to blind on hit abyssal jewel) 5. Enfeeble from Ancient Wraith that stacks with the Vulnerability curse on hit of Animated Guardian. 6. 30% reduced extra damage taken from critical strikes Ahn's Heritage corruption. 7. Thicc 4202 normal molten shell. therefore, GG vaal molten shell. &amp;#x200B; THAT'S IT FOR THIS SHOWCASE! THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

I don't know if I should use Skitterbots or a Curse + Blasphemy Support. I have looked a bit into it and people say that Skitterbots is a good ""aura"" to run since the skitterbots inflict shock and chill (in a 30 units radius) which is a guaranteed 15% dmg increase and 10% movement debuff (that can scale pretty good). The skitterbots are also gain movement speed and increased effect of their elemental ailments as they level. Overall, they're a good ""aura"" and have a lot of possible synergies to take into account. Now curses with blasphemy support are trickier. A good thing about them is that their radius is somewhat larger than the skitterbots' however the skitterbots have 30 units of radius across all levels while curse + blasphemy surpasses that value when they reach about lvl 20. Blasphemy curses are centered around the caster unlike skitterbots which can be a good/bad thing. A player may prefer staying behind their summoned creatures and have the skitterbots chase enemies or they may prefer going in the frontlines where their desired curse has greater effect. Curses are versatile with things like: Vulnerability, Elemental Weakness, Projectile Weakness, Enfeeble, Temporal Chains so there's plenty to choose from, but curses are only half as effective on bosses and then there are those hexproof enemies. Though I guess we use curses like these for clearing (especially Projectile Weakness for spectre users) and less for bossing while skitterbots can be pretty niche for bosses. I may have overlooked the ""curse on hit"" affix. It seems nice for what it is since ""hits"" can be from both ""attacks"" and spells"". Though I'm slightly unfamiliarised with this effect, I see the potential in it (Cyclone + CwC + GMP + Ball Lightning could spread curses like wildfire) but I don't know the exact mechanics. Like does it still drain mana when you curse enemies with hits? On a related note, there is this potential combo that I've been drawn to. If you are unaware, there is this unique ring called ""Profaned Proxy"" and it's basically an unset ring that replaces the elemental aura of a skitterbot with the curse you socket in it. The stats seem pretty nice since it adds some cold and lightning res and +3 levels to the socketed curse gem. This could be used to have one skitterbot with Temporal Chains and one with the chill aura if the player desires enhanced slow effects or one with Elemental/Projectile Weakness and the other with the shock aura. Though this might be not worth it in the end since we'd sacrifice much needed res and quality of life stat increases. I'll let you guys decide about this one. Lastly, if we look at the the gems closely we notice that both Skitterbots and Blasphemy Curse reserve 35% mana (not the case if using ""curse on hit"" , ""Profane Proxy"" or other sources) though for Skitterbots we only need 1 socket while the latter requires 2 to function as an aura. So the Skitterbots win when it comes to the number of sockets. But I've come here for advice and to gain a deeper understanding of what's more effective so I'm asking you guys to tell me which of these ""auras"" should I run taking into account I'm running a minion-based character. Thanks in advance! :) TL:DR Should I run Skitterbots or a Curse + Blasphemy setup for my summoner and why."

As such, I have opted to get the extra golem from tree in order to get Stone and Carrion Golem. \- I put on an elder helmet a Meat Shield-AG-Blood Magic-Raise Spectre and use 3 supporting spectres ( Carnage Chieftain for frenzy charges, Host Chieftain for power charges, Necromancer for Vulnerability). The AG is wearing Mask of the Stitched Demon, Kingmaker,Redeemer Chest with Nearby Enemies are Blinded and crafted % of Maximum life as Maximum ES and Southbound gloves. In order to keep all of them alive I have invested some points on defensive minion nodes since the damage for HoP is already through the roof. \-For the last part and where I need help from you guys is that from what I 've seen so far from other people the clearing of HoP builds is quite subpar so I wanted to have a map clearing 4-link that would aid as much as possible in the build's greatest weakness. For this, I came up with 3 possible options all of which would be linked on Shaper Boots that are supported by Life Leech to create an extra layer of sustainability and defense. Also I opted to go for Cyclone and Cwc to overcome that I'm not investing any points in casting speed etc and at the same time keep my mobility high. Possibl Links go as such : Cyclone - CwC - Brutality - BV/Bladefall/EK a) BV seems to have the highest Dps (keeping 10 blades up should be very easy) with it reaching almost 300k shaper DPS but with an AoE radius of only 20 b) Bladefall has about 110k shaper dps but i think it should have a better screen coverage (??) c) EK has about 160k shaper dps and the plus of needing a lower dex requirement giving me some extra points to invest in other things. On the other hand, I believe it would have the worst area coverage of the three and so I'm not very inclined to use it. So which option would you guys choose with having in mind that fast clearing is the main (if not sole) purpose of this 4-link setup? Or if you have another idea on how to do it more efficiently I am all ears! PoB Link : [URL"

So I was thinking about doing a facebreaker build on standard league, since I don't really care about new leagues in general. Whenever I check facebreaker builds on [poe.ninja](URL usually the best performing builds use corrupted, well rolled facebreakers. (But as far as I know they only show builds from current leagues). Since I have some currency to spend I wanted to ask which facebreakers would perform better. Well rolled facebreakers (750-800% more dmg) with a good corrupt implicit like ""Curse Vulnerability on Hit"" or ""+X to gems"" or uncorrupted Legacy Facebreakers with like 920%+ to unarmed attacks. I am not a numbers guy. Are the legacy ones way better than good rolled corrupted ones - or is it the other way arround?"

So I want to incorporate them into my build. I'm using level 5 Blasphemy + Level 20 Vulnerability/Temporal Chains, but I'm running into mana reservation issues. I typically run Blood+Sand/Flesh+Stone/Dread Banner/Pride and Vulnerability; this seems the good standard link. Unfortunately, I can't seem to sustain double curses without dropping Pride which is a pretty big DPS loss. It is nice to run both Vulnerability and Temporal Chains for rougher T15/T16 mods, but in practice this doesn't really seem to be all that effect (damage is better!). I was planning on getting a level 3/4 Enlighten and seeing if that would make a difference. I managed to drop an Enlighten (lvl 2) and that seems to give me room to sustain all 3 auras without the defensive/offensive duality of Blood &amp; Sand/Flesh &amp; Stone. That's good, but disappointing. I'm hoping that level 3/4 enlighten will remedy this, but I don't know if it's worth the effort. Wielding Blasphemy w/ level 20 vulnerability seems to have really given me the boost I needed. I'm using an Impresence that I annointed with Ambidexterity. That combined with Blasphemy/20 Vulnerability seems to do the trick! I really love the Maddening Presence aura (mini-Temporal Chains) that I get after killing a rare/unique enemy. It's pretty cool! I was looking into my weapons (Soul Taker) + 320 pDPS Siege Axe and getting a stronger Siege Axe is tens and tens of exalted orbs. I do know that I could probably get tankier; before I was using the 2x Curse boots I was sitting at about 5.9k HP. I'm currently sitting at just over 5k, but my jewel slots (and I don't have all of them) or particularly great jewels. I'm currently sitting on 4 exalted orbs and about 350-400 chaos wondering whether it's worth further investment into Lacerate or whether I should start looking into taking my Divine Ire Hierophant (level 70) or focus on my new Toxic Rain Pathfinder. The Lacerate Gladiator has been an *amazing* League Starter and is handling 80-90% of T15/T16 maps with relative ease. My attacks per second with Blood Rage are at about 7.2 so it feels really smooth, but some of the nastier meta-morphs have been a struggle. I get the feeling that what I really need is to be to much tankier and to get better jewels, but I don't know where to start. It's been my first time taking a starter build to the state where it's quite this geared -- Impresence, Windshreak, 6L Belly, Soul Taker (etc).

Reflected damage can be mitigated by: * Armor - Gluttony removes all armour * Block - I will not use any block. * Dodge - I will not use any dodge. * Evasion - If I can get ""Hits can't be evaded"" it will make sure the reflected damage gets through my hopefully high evasion. One way I have found to do that using Hiltless is to use The Effigon + Flesh and Stone in sand stance. All nearby enemies are blinded and I get ""Hits can't be evaded"" on them. Does this work on me too? Or do **I** have to be blinded for the reflected damage to always hit me? Is there another way to get ""Hits can't be evaded"" using Hiltless? The only other option I can see on the [wiki page](URL is Resolute Technique which stops me from going crit or EO. If this works, I will take 150 damage on average from Gluttony for each Flicker Strike activation and 100 damage from each hit on an enemy from Hiltless. Using Multistrike, that's 450 damage for each activation against a single target. That seems to low to proc CWDT spells at any effective rate. Can I increase it somehow, except by having more attack speed? Self-cursing with Vulnerability? Any ideas? This build is weird in that it wants attack speed and accuracy (if not using Hits can't be evaded) and then it wants a bunch of spell damage related stuff. How do I build it properly? I don't even know what ascendancy would be the best. Does anyone here have any experience with a similar build? I'm aware this will most likely end up being a much worse version of my current CWDT build linked at the start of the post, but I'm interested in giving it a shot to see what it feels like.

The build is cheap, straightforward, and fun. Work your way up to 900+ Strength without having to worry about Accuracy. Get tanky without having to sacrifice damage. Clear all content before needing to spend the oodles. **Current State of Progress:** Character has beaten Uber Elder, but is still likely to wipe at least once per success. Most T16 maps are easily cleared, but dangerous mods like -MaxRes, Vulnerability, and No Regen are likely to kill you. Uber Lab can be speedran, and should be until you get good enchantments. Seems great at Delving, but I don't Delved much. Do note my currently equipped chest is amazing and worth like 10ex, but it's little difference from a more mediocre 6-link. [Brutus' Lead Sprinkler](URL Per 10 Strength, 4-7 fire damage is added to attacks. With 1000 Strength, that's 400-700 added fire damage with a rough DPS estimate of **910.08** ON A 1-HANDED WEAPON. That's greater base damage than most expensive 2-Handers. Pastebin: URL We all know Cyclone is great AOE but lacks at single-target. Dual Strike is fucking awesome at single-target damage and we have two incredible weapons. 6-link the Dual Strike and 4-link the Cyclone in your helmet with a ""Supported by Increased Area of Effect"" mod. Support both with Fortify and Rage. Hop around, mow the lawn, and then get down to *beat the shit out of* whoever's left standing. Berserk and Immortal Call on a lv20 Cast when Damage Taken to turn emergencies into an explosion of brutality. This might be more of a playstyle bonus than pure stats, because the proc is very visual and encourages you ""hold Q"" until the motherfucker is ***dead***. You cast Blood Rage, Rallying Cry, and Molten Shell on rotation with Flasks and link. Vaal Molten Shell charges quickly and is... just wonderful. Vaal Molten Shell **does not** share a cooldown with Guard spells. [Xoph's Blood](URL is not necessary and makes the whole build much more expensive, because you need to get a lot more value out of your rings and solve for mana without leeching. Still, I'm sure this build's ""Final Form"" should use Xoph's Blood.

The rest makes you tanky and speedy. **Passives Tree:** Life, Strength, Attack Speed, Crit %, Crit Mult, Fire damage, Jewels. Take the whole big mace wheel up by Zealot's Oath. UNIQUES AND REQUIRED GEAR **[Astramentis](URL 6+ Affixes worth of very necessary Attributes, relatively cheap, and an absolute treasure to level with.

Life and resists from the rest. **Rings:** Life, Resists, Attributes, and take some Attack Speed if you can. Craft Ele Damage with Attacks. **Boots:** At least 30% movement speed, then Life and Resists. **Belt:** I recommend an Abyssal with, ofc, Life and Resists. Craft Ele Damage with Attacks. **Mana:** You get all the mana sustain you need from a single line of ""% of Physical Damage leeched as life"" from a Jewel or Ring. **Life Leech:** Between [Blood Rage](URL and [Lust for Carnage](URL you hit your leech cap. From Jewels you want two sources of +% Crit Multiplier and some Attack Speed. ""While Dual Wielding"", ""with One Handed Weapons"", and ""with Maces"" are always better profit. Ideally, you also want % Life, but that gets very expensive. I enjoy going straight damage with my Jewels. On the Abyssal Jewel, you want Life, Attack Speed, Fire Damage to Attacks, and/or Crit. ***SKILLS*** **[Dual Strike](URL Fortify, Rage, Elemental Damage with Attacks, Combustion, Faster Attacks No, Faster Attacks isn't top damage, but you *need* that animation sped up to react to mechanics. *Since Dual Strike is so cheap, you can easily afford a lv21/23% gem* **[Cyclone](URL Fortify, Rage, Infused Channeling, ~Increased Area of Effect~ Gotta keep Rage and Fortify up. Infused is great damage, defensive bonus, and boosts Dual Strike. **[Cast when Damage Taken](URL Berserk and Immortal Call, all max level.

Because of EE I run generosity+hatred. I've read some guides recommending temporal chains, and I like the effect a lot, but have no clue about damage with this nor how to get a clue about damage with this. Currently I'm running blasphemy+warlords mark because of the phys damage of the minions. Is there a better aura to use for phys damage or survivability? I used to run enfeeble but PoB showed me less minion damage with enfeeble so I switched it. Currently I use gloves with ""cast level 10 vulnerability on hit"" - does that mean on any hit from me or would I have to slot an attack skill there to trigger the effect? 2. does taking elemental equilibrium in case that I have to stay back make sense for me? As I gathered from r/pathofexile my minions don't trigger EE so the +25% resist shouldn't apply if I don't hit anything, right?Right now I am using consecrated path as attack to trigger EE, I consideres switching to cyclone as to not add flame damage, but don't know if that would make anything better. 3. Cwdt I am unsure if having two cwdt setups is useful or a waste of slots. Currently running level 8 cwdt+desecrate+flesh offering+phase run (for get-aways) and level 17 cwdt+immortal call. Since I have barely any armor (1412) or evasion (1031) I am unsure if I should run this or steelskin and unsure if the number of damage taken is too high (2621 damage at 4918 life and 2554 energy shield).

If you want to scale elemental or chaos damage, other classes are simply better. &amp;#x200B; Additionally, we use Cyclopean coil for Freeze and Shock ailment immunities (by having dex&gt;int&gt;str), Chill Immunity boots, and aim for Stun resistance on shield, helmet and chest. **This, in combination with Tailwind, gives us a great feeling of control and speed.** A Corrupted Blood immunity **Ring of Blades** makes us effectively immune to bleeds as well, while the Shakari god-power gives poison immunity for maps where that's needed. &amp;#x200B; Acrobatics and Phase acro is used for overall mitigation, while Basalt and our flexible flask spots are used for actual damage reduction. A Warlord's Mark on hit ring is used for sustain. Spell Echo makes it easy to sustain even against packs that would otherwise be in 1-shot range. &amp;#x200B; I have used Zealotry and War banner for reservation. Before you get a Warlord's mark on hit ring, you can pick up reduced mana reservation on the skilltree and use blasphemy warlords mark. EB+MoM is an option for higher budget versions. A +1 curse (vulnerability), +1gemlvl, +spellcrit chest would be ideal, but by far the most expensive item in the build. A weapon with Tora's unveiled flat phys/20-30% chance to bleed mod would also be great. &amp;#x200B; Links with EK is mostly up to what you like. Brutality is your biggest damage boost, Spell Echo goes super well with Warlords on Hit, Critical strikes is nice for consistency, Onslaught goes well with shield charge. I personally don't like Slower Proj (less AoE) and Controlled Destruction (less consistency). Tailwind, Rupture and Powerful Precision is your most important ascendancy notables. I use Fast and Deadly for the last, but Far Shot is also an option, for bigger area coverage of the projectile nova. &amp;#x200B; Here is my current character: [URL &amp;#x200B; And here is the template and planning, with a few options: [URL"

My ascendancy order would be Arena Challenger (movement speed faster act leveling ) &gt; Blood in the Eyes &gt; Gratuitous Violence &gt; Outmatch and Outlast * **Dual Wield** Mostly because of Outmatch and Outlast node in the gladiator ( I believe you can use a two hander and only get the frenzy charge generation) that give us a nice balance between speed and and defense. * **Blood Magic** I choose to use blood magic because now has a very good node behind it, Mortal Conviction that let us use a non banner aura for free (Malevolence) * **Crimson Dance** The reason is that I want to try it out, it has good synergy with the blood stance and is really close in the passive tree, also since we are blood magic we are not going to have herald of purity so it seems to be a way too boost our single target. * **Resolute Technique** This is a league starter build also a bleed build so to shoot to birds with one stone, I use it to avoid getting accuracy in the tree or the gear also for a smoother leveling experience. * **Swords** Because of the node Bladedancer it give us +2 to melee range increasing further the AoE thus the clear speed of the build what I'm looking in them are good physical damage, attack speed and increased duration and damage for bleeds. * **Leveling** Level with cleave + onslaught + chance to bleed to level 12, then lacerate all the way. (grabbing the highest pdps one handed axe or sword you can find) * **Skills** Main links: Lacerate + Brutality + Multistrike + Melee physical damage + Ruthless + Fortify Totem: Vaal Ancestral Warchief + Bloodlust + Brutality + Melee Physical damage Defense: Cast When Damage Take + Increased Duration + Molten Shell Aura: Malevolence (to boost the bleed damage) Mobility: Try out all the new mobility skills if none works as I like probably whirling blades with faster attacks. Curse: a defensive curse or vulnerability * **Gear** A tabula and all rares for easy and cheap gearing. Flasks: life, basalt, granite, stibnite and quicksilver. &amp;#x200B; * **PoB** The [build](URL and [screenshot](URL of the tree &amp;#x200B; **Conclusion** This is not a a fully fledged guide it is meant to create a discussion, any criticism or improvements are more than welcome since Im not familiar with bleed or lacerate so it is possible that the build is complete trash, please comment and thank you for reading."

So far I'm still in early mapping so I was hoping to get some insight in what things I could perhaps improve on the skill tree? URL URL There's the build in path of building so far. After it is a picture of the gear I am running. I'm running Soul Taker as my 1h weapon right now, really love this weapon for freeing up the mana pool completely, I am using the extra mana for Blasphemy - Vulnerability (with increased AoE), Herald of Purity and War banner. Shield is Lioneye's remorse for big tanky stats. main gem link: * Lacerate * Melee Physical Damage * Faster Attacks (considering change to brutality) * Deadly Ailments * Swift Affliction The strengths of the build is it's overall tankiness and I'm ideally going to focus on having it be very strong for single target encounters like uberlab, shaper and uberatziri etc. With ancestral guardian and vaal dual strike the single target potential is quite good, but I am yet to see if Soul Taker starts slowing down on the damage as the content gets higher level. I am also considering getting a rapier or something with a lot of phys dmg and bleed modifiers for endgame, and at that point probably going Blood Magic for the hp nodes, with the amulet making vulnerability reserve no mana. Main weakness is the lack of coverage by lacerate. Once you get the bleed explosions going the clear is quite good but the initial connections are a bit short. Please share your thoughts if you've been playing around with bleed in the past, and if you see fixes for the skill tree so far."

Was thinking of pairing TS with bleed and Haemophilia for that nice pop. Crimson Dance seemed pretty iffy but if I could stack bleeds quick enough it should be worth it. Hopefully with TS chaining and extra projectiles there will be plenty of hits to stack bleeds. Gathering Winds Rupture Far Shot Ricochet Fossil crafted bleed bow or the Crimson Storm Haemophilia Dying Sun Flat Phys rings and amulet Rare boots Rare armor with maim Starkonja's Head Not sure about quiver. For links I was thinking TS, Chance to Bleed, Brutality, Vicious Projectiles, GMP, Deadly Ailments in the chest. Other option would be to get Vicious Projectiles on a bleed bow and replace something with Maim. I'll try to PoB it out but it's hard to tell how effective things are when it comes to bleeds. Other links will be Herald of Purity, War Banner, and an aura. Curse will be Vulnerability from an on hit corruption. Last thing I'm trying to decide on is Resolute Technique or crit.

So i'm using Don's hatred+hypothermia, as well as his CWTD+IC+coldsnap, Mathil's assassin's mark with blasphemy. The main thing that i think i thought of that didn't come from them or other guides was when i was checking highest DPS support gems and saw ""bloodlust"". Never heard of it before, so i look up how it works. So all i gotta do is use my ancestral warchief to proc the bleed, then i get tons of dmg. Not very helpful for map clearing i think though. I'm using the spare 3-link on my weapon for CWTD+enfeeble+temporal chains, cuz i couldnt think of anything better and doesn't seem bad for melee characters. What i spent a lot of time thinking about is how much chance to bleed is optimal, because on the one hand if the enemy is bleeding i do 1.67x more dmg so more chance means more reliably get that bonus while clearing. While less chance means i could get useful stats for bosses, because it's easy to proc on bosses even with low chance. So maybe use vulnerability curse while clearing and Assassin's mark while bossing, or just always use assassins?"

My Wife is finally giving PoE a try and has been enjoying it so far, though she is making the typical beginner mistake of going for too many damage nodes in the Passive tree (it is her first character, I dont want to force her into specific builds, I want her to see the difference between her first few characters and her first build guide.) So I had a thought, she does at least two-times my Damage (unarmed Consecrated Path Scion while she is playing with Vortex/Frost Bomb/Freezing Pulse Ele.) She has the big frost damage section at the top of the Passive trees and a few others, she is now starting to grab life nodes, though I suspect at ~85 she will have ~100% increased life as opposed to 150+. This tells me she will still deal loads of damage, but will die a lot. To try and negate this I was thinking of going with a support build (which I have never done) so that I can increase her survivability. Best way to do that? I was thinking of going Occultist. This way I can run an extra curse, reduce frost resistances of nearby enemies and freeze enemies she has chilled periodically. I would also grab the extra curse in the Passive tree. For my own damage I would run Dancing Duo. Summary: Enfeeble Curse Aura (Reduce Damage) Temporal Chains Curse Aura (Reduce Movement) Vulnerability Curse Aura (Dancing Duo Damage boost) No enemy Regen (Occultist Ascendency) -20% Cold Resist (Occultist Ascendency) Periodic Freezing (Occultist Ascendency) 10% Reduced chilled enemy damage (Occultist Ascendency) Ultimately mobs would move 30% slower, dealing 40% less damage, 30% reduced accuracy, Crit Chance and Crit Damage. All while I provide ramping damage in the form of Dancing Duo (that she would trigger the initial Ramage, until I get a couple of writhing jars.) Thoughts? In theory I imagine it would work. "

I think I will use grace and AA, or drop grace for blasphemy setup.

It took everything I could throw at it and it was even possible to AFK things like Breaches and Abysses due to automated Bone Offering (cast at 1/3rd of EHP lost). This is a non-crit (EO) build, but boss damage is really good even with little investment and clearing is above average as well. I cleared much of the content in the game before I died to Detonate Dead (can't be blocked or evaded) in a Vulnerability map that probably had monster life. There will be a proper build guide coming on the forums after I reroll it and make videos. **Important Build Synergies:** * Spirit Eater trick to get the 4.0 APS breakpoint without any attack speed investment. The more you cast, the more attack speed you get, with the only limit being the Poet's Pen cooldown (you can actually crash the game with self-cast VD and Unearth Totem!). This one I discovered on my own during the process of playing the character. * Soul of Arakaali trick to get 50% more Leech, Life on Block, and Life from Flasks. * CWDT Automation for Bone Offering (Immortality vs most packs.)

70,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,[Elementalist] Oro's Sacrifice Flicker Strike,4,7wim1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/7wim1j/elementalist_oros_sacrifice_flicker_strike/,2018-02-10 13:19:00,"I've created an Oro's Sacrifice build utilizing the frenzy charge generation on ignite to enable Flicker Strike, one of my favourite abilities. Cost: the build is somewhat expensive, probably around 5ex in total if you're going extremely optimal. Budget can probably cost 3ex, which is rather low I think. [Path of Building](URL [Profile](URL **My thoughts:** The build has respectable damage surpisingly, especially since Elementalist is such an oft-ignored specialization. This damage is achieved mostly through the ascendancy passives [Liege of the Primordial](URL and [Paragon of Calamity](URL offering 40%+40% and 40% increased damage respectively. We have [Lightning Golem](URL on a CWDT setup, increasing our attack speed by 9% and lightning damage by 40% through Liege of the Primordial. Similarly for [Flame Golem](URL it offers 20% increased damage from the golem itself, and another 40% from Liege of the Primordial. To make Elementalist work properly and not be a worthless choice of ascendancy, I needed to enable to Paragon of Calamity for the extra damage. This is achieved through the use of [Eye of Innocence](URL which hits us for 100 fire damage each time we ignite an enemy. The secondary effect of this amulet is the 70% increased damage while ignited, which is achieved and complimented by [Mokou's Embrace](URL which itself offers 20% increased attack speed while ignited, and further enables us to actually *be ignited* with it's 25% self-ignite explicit. This build focuses on the upper and lower right side of the tree, and not being fully dexterity-based or near enough to Resolute Technique, but nonetheless bearing many raw stats, my choice of gloves came to [Shaper's Touch](URL These gloves offer a fair amount of %ES, loads of accuracy, and loads of evasion rating. **About the mana/health reservation** If you've looked at the Path of Building link provided above, you likely noticed the number of auras that are run in this build. The build sits at 1% life unreserved, and 16% mana unreserved. *On life, we have:* [Blood Magic](URL - [Enlighten](URL - [Anger](URL - [Wrath](URL * mandatory: all socketed in a [The Vertex](URL or have a 21 Blood Magic and lv4 Enlighten in whatever helmet you wish. The Anger is for general fire damage. The Wrath neatly enables the extra damage from our lightning golem, and gives us a hefty chance to shock most enemies (especially with our attack speed), increasing our damage further. On mana, we have these auras: [Enlighten](URL - [Grace](URL [Determination](URL - [Discipline](URL The choice of Grace and Determination seems odd, but it is an interesting defensive option when paired with [Iron Reflexes](URL I stumbled upon this option when looking at a necro aurabot. This combination of auras and keystone gives us a pretty sizeable 20,000 armour, which is *very* nice for a build that is energy-shield focused. This also means that through the use of a Jade Flask and Granite Flask, coupled optionally with a Basalt flask, we've got 15% physical damage reduction, and about 40,000 armour. **(God damn that's a lot of armour)** **Surviving in maps** The one issue I have with this build is the low amount of total ES. This means that even with the [Vaal Pact](URL keystone, our ES leech on hit rate with [Ghost Reaver](URL only comes up to 1970 ES/s, about half our total ES. With the extreme amounts of armour and that you are constantly moving you are still extremely difficult to kill, but nonetheless 5k eHP is a rather small amount. Thusly, the build must counteract the few wasy it can be *easily* killed. Chaos damage: an [Atziri's Promise](URL (35% chaos res), [Shavronne's Wrappings](URL (so chaos damage does not bypass ES), and the Soul of Shakari upgraded with [Terror of the Infinite Drifts](URL (immunity to poison, less DoT taken). *Bleeding*: a Basalt flask and one of our flasks with the 'of Staunching' suffix. This is probably the most dangerous thing for you. Pay serious attention to the map affixes for Vulnerability and any mobs that cause bleeding. It can kill the shit out you if not careful. *Freeze/chill*: use the unique [Dream Fragments](URL ring, making us immune to that shit. *Stuns*: the Soul of Gruthkul, offering stun immunity if stunned recently. *Other shit*: you have [Vaal Discipline](URL in case you need some on-the-spot serious survivability. Use it wisely! *Map mods to avoid:* - % ele reflect is bad usually, but since we take 50% less through the ascendancy you can (carefully) run yellow maps with this affix. - less recovery: you'll get less leech/s. Avoid this on red maps. - a load of extra damage mods: even with a load of armor, % damage as (insert element) can destroy your tiny es pool. Be extremely cautious when running maps that have several extra damage mods. - the boss: Some bosses just can't be done. I would recommend skipping bosses unless you're entirely sure that you can kill them. **Movement** The build uses Leap Slam to get around. **Conclusion** The build offers respectable damage for a class that shouldn't use a two-handed weapon and an ascendancy that needs serious work. I made this build because I love the way the Witch holds a two-handed weapon, and I love Flicker Strike. I'll continue to revise this build with whatever currency I come by, and hopefully I can make it not so... low-es. Somehow. Criticise my shitty build now. "

Chest: using a Carcass Jack(5L, with Warchief setup), also have Daresso's Defiance with 5L. My phys damage reduction is way better in Daresso's but take a damage hit. Helm: started with Abyssus but the 50% physical taken got me owned, so I swapped to Starkonja's. I'm using Lightpoacher now just because I have one with 2 abyss sockets(2 reds with CWDT+Immortal Call) Boots: using rare ambush boots with 112 life, 17 cold, 35 light, 25 movement, and added 24 fire to round out resists(blasphemy, enfeeble, vulnerability).

Uniques: Cane of Unraveling - a new unique staff announced for 3.1 this is 1 of 3 unique items I'm married to as far as the build goes right now. guaranteed +2 chaos gems level is huge and the minor perks for power charges synergise with the ability for tricksters to generate charges with swift killer. In addition to this the staff's unique ability to generate charges with mana spent will allow me to actually keep up power charges against bosses as well as general trash clearing. This brings us to my next unique item choice Sidenote: this staff is not in PoB yet so I created a custom ezomyte staff with +2 chaos gems and spell damage + cast speed stats congruent with the chaos damage and cast speed bonuses the Cane of Unraveling will give me. The Aylardax: I toyed around with using this amulet last league but ultimately decided since I wouldn't have power charges against bosses it probably wasn't worth it. As the build now stands with easy power charge upkeep against bosses I feel that the additional 5% MoM effectiveness will be very nice, especially since the amulet is so cheap and as a staff build I will not have access to fortify. Alleopathy: The Final unique I'm positive on using became a staple of ED builds last league. These gloves are also very common and cheap, they give me access to a huge increase of DoT when combined with 2 spreading rot blight jewels, taking these is a no brainer. Cherrubim's Maleficence: Thought process here is a relatively cheap unique chest I could use. added chaos damage is nice and as long as I get one with a decent life roll I should be set for early league. I'm not positive about using this one and any other suggestions are welcome, however unless the patch notes dumpster life meta stuff like a BotB or taking a Shav's and changing the build to LL will cost way too much. Witchfire Brew -&gt; the reason we take double curse on the tree the changes to make it give despair instead of vulnerability don't change anything for ED, still a BiS flask for the build Kiara's Determination -&gt; way to deal with stun + also lets us break freezes, bleeding and ignite are covered by other flasks Gem Links: ED -&gt; Efficacy -&gt; Void Manipulation -&gt; Swift Affliction -&gt; Controlled destruction -&gt; empower (empower is very optional here, will not bother getting one until later in the league when I have money to 6L my staff) - ED setup is socketed in the staff for +2 to chaos gems. Contagion/Blight -&gt; arcane surge (lvl 9) -&gt;increased AoE -&gt; Faster Casting - socketed in the Alleopathy gloves so Blight gets the bonuses of AoE and Faster Casting, this is used to spread ED and to blight tougher enemies for the huge bonus damage hindering them gives our DoT from the spreading rot jewels, since blight is only to increase the dmg of ED I don't care about supporting its damage that much and take QoL gems in faster casting and AoE instead. Arcane surge is left at lvl 9 so it activates on every cast of contagion. CWDT -&gt; immortal call -&gt; increased duration - standard cwdt setup stops me from getting instagibed. Since I don't need a 2nd 6L my chest will instead have 2 3L utility setups in it, the CWDT setup is one of them Wither -&gt; spell totem -&gt; increased duration - wither totem for even more damage on bosses, pretty self explanatory, this si the second 3L I put in my chest piece Lightning warp -&gt; faster casting -&gt; less duration -&gt; efficacy - my movement ability since staff can't use shield charge, the support gems seek to reduce it's duration allowing me to warp around as fast as possible. Socketed in boots or helmet. Blasphemy -&gt; enfeeble - another damage reduction measure, socketed in either boots/helmet whatever you didn't use for the lightning warp setup Clarity: extra mana regen for MoM put in an unlinked socket in whichever item has the blasphemy setup Summon Flame Golem -&gt; standard golem for extra damage, not mandatory if you're too lazy to summon it, single unlinked socket in same item as clarity/blasphemy setup. High budget options: I've included a +3 chaos staff as another potential weapon in the PoB, it increases damage by a ton so its certainly the best high budget weapon for this build BotB - Unless it gets nerfed (which it might) belly is a lower damage but much higher survivability option for this build for the chest slot. Because our 6L is our staff coloring it and getting 2 3L's on it wouldn't be a huge problem if you can afford the high base cost or get a lucky drop early in the league Thanks for reading guys I'd love to hear any thoughts/suggestions you have on this build EDIT 1 - as was discussed in the comments below it is probably better not to spend money 6 linking the cane unless you really feel like you need the additional survivability having power charges on bosses gives you. Use the Cane as a 5L and focus on a +3 chaos staff for your 6L as a 6L cane is outperformed by a +1 chaos +1 gem level 6L rare staff EDIT 2: Patch notes basically didn't change anything for this build as far as I can tell, rip vaal pact but we didn't need it anyway "

For this I assume the finished version with Kaom's Heart, so no space for links here: **The first 4-link:** This would stay exactly the same. The CWDT-Immortal Call-Vortex-Increased duration setup is really nice when we can cast spells (unlike in his 3.0 Gruthkul's Pelt build) **The second 4-link:** I liked the concept of cycloning he did in 3.0 (I didn't test this out myself, but my friend who doesn't like the totem playstyle that much said this one was enjoyable), so I thought about incorporating it back into the build. In order to do that, I'd have to free up a slot for this cyclone setup: Cyclone-Life Gain on Hit-Culling Strike-Maim **The third 4-link:** *This is where my problems start.* Keeping Leap Slam-Faster Casting is a no-brainer here. This would leave me with the choice of either Enduring Cry-Increased Duration or dropping the support for Stone Golem. I suppose having the golem is much more beneficial, but is this change worth the loss of the support? Secondly, I lost Vulnerability in the tracks. Is it worth replacing the Enduring Cry with it? This would mean final 4 link (or 4-socket) would look like that: Leap Slam - Faster Attacks - Vulnerability - Summon Stone Golem. **My another random thought**, as I am quite a lazy guy, was to use some kind of Vulner setup: 1) A Vulnerability-Blasphemy combo (I don't know how the blood magic reservation would hurt my sustainability. I know about the reserve nodes behind Blood Magic, but The loss is ~1k at 5.7k HP) 2) Curse on Hit. This would have to replace 2 of the Cyclone links for that - I'm not even sure which ones, as both Culling strike and Maim look nice. I could keep Maim for general clear and swap in Culling strike for bosses, but then again, I am too lazy for that. -------------- What do you guys think about all the options here? Anything good or should I just stick with the guide? TL;DR: I want to put a non-damage Cyclone setup somewhere in the build and make Vulnerability automated as I don't want to cast it manually. There are some options, but I have no Idea on which to decide on and need help. P.S. It is my first reddit post and the formatting may be flawed, sorry for that in advance! EDIT: Formatting"

Since I was lucky enough to get a The Surrender for a decent price during legacy league I have been brainstorming a build to use it. Ultimately, I decided on a shield using/defense orientated champion that I truly feel is the strongest character I have made to date. He has incredible survivabilty thanks to high HP, high armour, high regen and high life leech. He is the first character I made that can farm uber lab. He's the first character I made that took down normal Atziri and successfully did The Pale Court. He has no problem doing T14 maps. I haven't tried Guardians or Shaper yet. But, the biggest downside to this build is low DPS. Mapping is slow and killing bosses is even slower. Yeah, he can stand there and take hits forever but killing bosses is really slow. That was the sacrifice I made since the goal was as much surviivabilty as I could manage. But, now I am looking for and would appreciate any feedback on how I could up the DPS of this character without hurting his surviviabilty. Flasks are currently : 1. Seething Divine Life Flask of Staunching 2. Ample Basalt Flask of Heat (+20 to charges) 3. Experimenter's Sulphur Flask of Iron Skin 4. Experimenter's Diamond Flask of Iron Skin 5. Lion's Roar Granite Flask Since I'm using Brutality, I'm not able to use Taste of Hate or Atziri's Promise otherwise I would use them. Currently he has 6.4K HP, 85% physical damage reduction, 53% chance to block attacks, 22% chance to avoid attacks, 519 life regen per second, 5% life leech from attacks (with +90 life leech modifier). I'm using Soul of Lunaris and Soul of Tukohama although depending on the boss fight I'll switch Lunaris to Solaris. My general strategy is shield charge in, hit frost blades to curse mobs with Vulnerability (or enfeeble depending on the map) then Reave them until they die. I'm pretty sure Reave was the wrong choice for main skill but when I crafted this build I felt that this character is going to stand still and have enemies surround him he needed a quick AoE melee skill. I thought Reave was the best choice but perhaps I was wrong? Thanks pathofexilebuilds subreddit."

Spreading Rot allows the build to add a 50% more multiplier on all enemies for ED, Contagion and DO to benefit from. Occulist with Blasphemy Vulnerability and Eber's Unification both further lower the chaos resist of all enemies. Trickster with Shield Charge gives +50% health and mana regained which helps sustain the DO self DoT and mana upkeep since I am runnign max level Clarity with MoM as defense. Since no other auras can really be used with chaos DoTs I decided to do MoM, especially since I use essentially no mana with this build. The 30% damage while not on full ES will also be up pretty much all the time, and when it isn't, it still grants benefits. The main concern is the damage. I know PoB isn't good at calculating damage, especially for multi spell builds. And only 3k DPS for Blight seems just straight up wrong. Another concern is mobility. Shield Charge does not seem to be very quick with Breath of the Council. I don't want to be slow and I want to use Shield Charge since I love that skill.

I'm honestly torn between all 3 choices, Zerker offers me insane instant life leech and more selfcast dps and doesn't have to keep up flesh offering all the time (can just cast it for bosses) but will take more dmg than the other builds and have a harder time capping resists. BF Necro has the pain of having to keep flesh offering up all the time, doesn't leech as much but has alot more overall dps from the summons and more defences. BV Necro also has the pain of having to keep flesh offering up and also vortex stacks up all the time but has very balanced dps from self cast and minions and also better defence overall."

Heres a couple of ideas that Im liking so far in no particular order: * **Shrapnel Shot, Chin Sol, Drillneck, Point Blank**: I probably put some shock chance in there, but Im having a lot of trouble getting a lot of shock around Duelist side of the tree. Curse on Hit/Frenzy to apply curses. * **Crit Flicker Strike**: I need to get into mob packs before my party can, so I think flicker strike could work here. There are multiple weapons that could work, with my eyes currently on Starforge and Hyaons Fury. I like Starforge for the potential synergy of the new physical support gems. * **Shield Charge + Whatever**: Trying to find some way to apply shock/curses with shield charge, and then using another skill as my main attack. With some attack speed, Im thinking either **Static Strike** or **Sunder**. * **Charged Dash cwc Shock Nova + Innervate**: I was brewing this build before these new skills, but I think Shock Novas base shock chance warrants this sort of combo for this build. Im excited for Charged Dash as it fills out a lot of the themes I want for this build, but I dont know if the damage numbers are good enough for a main damage skill. * **Unarmed Doryanis Fist + Shield Charge**: Seemed pretty cool, but the numbers look pretty poor from the datamines. The skill comes with 20 base shock, so that's the main reason why I was thinking about it. Charged Dash too if it works with unarmed. The biggest problem I think Im having right now is Im having a hard time scaling lightning damage, so I'm currently leaning towards damage conversion. Is this build concept sound? Im not looking for 2.6 Vaal Fireball levels of clear speed, but I am looking for damage that clear up to T10 at a brisk pace. What do you guys think? "

For starters here is the skill tree I have right now URL I know that level 100 is not particularly realistic for a build but I wanted to see what it would look like with all my points allocated, as this will be my starter I'll probably leave off the jewel slots unless I get anything particularly good until the prices come down as well as maybe the frenzy charge cluster and a power charge cluster to put it at around level 91. For those not up to date on the trickster node buff in 3.0, its not shown on PoE planner but the frenzy charge node now also gives +1 power charges, 15% chance to generate a power charge on kill, and 5% increased DoT damage per frenzy or power charge. My questions are: 1) How much life is standard for a MoM build? I have 166% right now which with MoM absorbing 30% damage puts me at ~215% increased HP. I can easily get up to around 180-200% max life with a few nodes close to my tree by specing out of a bit of damage. 2) Is 3 +1 power charge nodes excessive? The increased damage from the newly buffed trickster passive and the node which gives 4% increased spell damage per charge made taking as many as possible seem worth it. I'm also planning on using the Aylardex amulet which will give me 1% additional damage percent taken by mana per power charge I have making power charge offer me both damage and survivability. 3) My plan to generate power charges against bosses is to use the shield Jaws of Agony socketed with cluster trap support in my secondary weapon set and then swap back to my main damage setup after spamming a few trap casts, I know this seems convoluted but I also plan on using The Aylardex amulet because of both the benefits it brings in general as well as the huge increased power charge duration which should help against bosses as I won't have to swap and spam traps as often. Is there any less clunky way to generate charges against bosses since otherwise all my charge generation comes from kills or is this likely my best option? 4) Since I am MoM I obviously don't want to reserve much mana, is there any aura that makes picking up an essence worm worth it or any curse + blasphemy combo which is extremely effective on this build? I looked into temporal chains but it seems bad because it doesn't make DoT do more damage, just take more time to do the same damage. 5) This is just a random mechanics thing that I'm curious about, the Weave the Arcane node in the trickster tree gives 8% reduced damage taken after spending 200 mana, is this only from using my skills or does taking 200 damage to my mana from MoM also activate this? EDIT: did some more research and got some advice. Dropped to 146% increased life and dropped the +1 frenzy charge cluster to put my build to level 91. Will take more jewel sockets past 91. Decided not to reserve any mana and run the clear mind jewel, will use an orb of storms curse on hit vulnerability setup instead of blasphemy. EDIT 2: Seems the first person I talked to about life % may have been misinformed, took another 40% putting me at 186% and dropped the method to the madness cluster and 2 power charge duration nodes to put my build at level 89. Past 89 I'll decide to either hit more survivability, damage, or jewel slots depending on my needs. Will also use clarity as my only mana reservation, possibly picking up an essence worm ring to still use the clear mind gem depending on how the build feels. Thanks a ton for the help everyone this community is awesome! EDIT 3: have moved away from OoS and settled on blasphemy + enfeeble as well as clarity. I think the build is getting close to finalized my new tree is this: URL Its set at level 84 with 160% increased life. If at level 84 I feel too squishy I'll take more life around the scion node, otherwise I'll path down to method to the madness for damage or jewel slots if I get anything good.

I found Windz Mortem Morsu ST guide and decided it looked awesome and well made so I followed the build even though I only made it into the 40s leveling before Legacy ended. I was quite crestfallen to see the assassin and poison nerfed so heavily in the beta and had resigned myself to picking something else to start Harbinger despite having fallen in love with the character. But now with the new passive tree revealed with ailment scaling built into weapon scaling to make it more viable, I've tentatively decided to go with the concept I originally decided on but I would like help in figuring out how to make the build as viable as possible. And while it seems to be a right of passage for new players to make their first few characters crap, I'd like some guidance if possible to try and make this build succeed. The only planned equipment I was looking at was claws (either with shield or dual wield, so far avoided dual wield nodes on tree), cospris will for double curse/poison on hit, and maybe lycosidae for hits can't be evaded. I really have no idea what other items or uniques to shoot for or build around.

ST links are flexible, this was just what seemed to show the most DPS in PoB though I'm new to the program. Also, I'm not sure what to look at for a mana solution as there is very little on the tree and blasphemy + aura is 85% reserved, which leaves it a little tight looking. Also not sure where to get consistent power charges as the ascendancy 10% on non-crit might not be enough? Here is the tree I have so far, I tried to respec into as many physical + ailment damage nodes as I could. I know its max level but basically I pathed to crimson dance last as an afterthought, and down to iron reflexes before that, and without those points its at a more reasonable level. URL So how can I improve this idea so far or optimize the tree? Is there anything crucial in the skill gem setups I need to change? What sorts of items should I be aiming for and to build around? Is this going to end up relatively viable or is it just going to crash and burn? I don't need it to be the strongest or most optimal build but I would like to do maps and have the end game content be a possibility with enough work and gear investment.

We will also have good Evasion as well as 52% dodge, 30% Spell Dodge, and Vaal Pact (optional) Ultimately, we also will use Vulnerability either from cwdt or witchfire, but we propably want to wait until we have a +curse amulet because we want Enfeeble too. Now for the fun part, from Supports+Chin Sol+PB+Frenzy Charges+Vulnerability we have a total 'more multiplier' of ~16.6, and that is without the total inc dmg multiplier, the extra dmg from Chance to Bleed etc etc. So the damage should be absurd even without crit. Vaal Pact is an option and probably the right one, at least when attempting Guardians/Shaper with this, if it is at all possible. Some Opinions? "

My gear was bad so I couldn't progress past like T9 or so Maps. Since then I generally overhauled my gear, went from a Marohi Erqi to a Disfavour (only 5l but oh well deals enough dmg for now) and now I think my gear is in a state where you could say it's pretty solid. &amp;nbsp; With this I also took a look at my Tree and Ascendancy. I switched some points around but most importantly I went from Juggernaut to Berserker Ascendancy. Now don't get me wrong - the damage is amazing. &amp;nbsp; However Carnage has it's price. I am not sure how much the 10% increased damage taken is a factor or if I'm just imagining but since I switched I jsut keep dying and dying. I tried to balance Carnage with the 6% reduced damage taken from ""Rite of Ruin"" which seems unpopular since I'm skipping ""Cloaked in Savagery"" but even with that I can barely tank T13 T14 maps with decent mods. I randomly tried a Map with an Onslaught Leaguestone and I got absolutely destroyed. Even when swapping in Enfeeble for Vulnerability I still have a hard time dealing with maps (even without Onslaught!) &amp;nbsp; My Question is now what to do? In this state I can't see myself killing Shaper, Uber Atziri or even Guardians. I am sitting at 7k life currently with my resistances all being capped. Honestly I don't see too much room for improvement when it comes to gear as I have decent life values on every (rare) piece of gear already. My Tree offers 4% life here and there but with being lvl 87 I don't think I have much left to skill. 3/4 Jewels have life on them (last is needed to cap resists and would be veeery pricy to switch for one with life life, resists and damage). &amp;nbsp; Basically the only real meaningful switch (IMO) would be back to Juggernaut for better fortify, more life regen, more, better and easier to stack endurance charges and 4% less damage (I mean no Carnage means 10% less damage taken but as I had Rite of Ruin it's still overall 4% less damage taken right?). Would that enable me to do high level content or would my damage take too hard of a hit? I think Chieftain isn't an option overall as it seems to be totem focussed right, then again a big part of my single target DPS is Ancestral Warchief but hmm doesn't seem to offer toooo much defense either... &amp;nbsp; tl:dr I wanna progress in high level content but I keep getting smashed like a sheet of paper, halp ;_;"

I will be taking Ghost Reaver and Vaal Pact. Along the way, I'll also be taking some pure ES and Power Charge nodes.

I elected to keep a Bladefall and BV equipped for levelling them, with an attack setup of either ST or BF and an ancestral totem throughout leveling. Right before normal malachai you can equip CwC and run poison - bf - bf for epic ezpz malachai. The build after that is stupidly smooth to level because if you don't find a good wep, you simply do more spell damage than attack, and once you find a good wep you do stupid damage for a bit. Then when you get to end game you can swap to CoC instead, if you prefer. Uniques recommended (if you want to farm the div cards etc) is a death's hand and a Cospri's Will. I personally plan to 100% get deaths hand, and if I get a cospri's I will run two of the following based on situation: enfeeble, temp chains, warlords, punishment, vulnerability.

I wanted to use poison, but started wondering how I should go about doing things: - Crit vs Non Crit (Non-Crit is usually cheaper, but there is so much powercharge synergy, but not as much as Assassin) - ES vs Life/Armour (Es is apparently better ATM, but life is cheaper, but then again, the Occultist can help with ES) Here's what I think/expect to use: - I'd like to use Vaal Pact, as I've never made a character that used it. - Gem Swap for bosses - Dual Curse (Temp Chains, Enfeeble or Vulnerability) with Blasphemy for trash, change to Orb of Storm and Curse on Hit for Bosses - Wither Spell Totem for Bosses - Gem Swap for bosses - Blade Vortex, Poison Support, Void Manipulation, Increased Area/Conc Effect, Life Leech, Inc Duration, probably in that order in # of links (I've never gotten a true 6 link though) - I'd like to be able to comfortably do maps up to tier 11. I don't know what movement skill to use, I'm thinking double wand, with Inc Duration in the tree (for Blade Vortex and Poison), which kills Shield Charge, Whirling Blades, Leap Slam, Lightning Warp. I'm just thinking a high movement speed and Quicksilver flask. My budget is fairly low (I've bought everything for my Shield Charge, and am back down to 19 chaos). Can anyone help me pick a direction? Thanks! EDIT: Also, I'm kinda new to double dipping/ +chaos dmg is good, because it affect the hit and the poison, +phys is bad because it affects the hit, which affects the poison, but not the poison itself a second time, right?"

Is it worth it to then be running two curses at once? If they have Vulnerability, they won't have Warlord's Mark and my life leech will be greatly reduced. If they have Warlord's Mark, then they don't have Vulnerability and would take reduced damage compared to if I was running Herald of Ash alongside. What's the reasoning for the 2 curses here? Is Vulnerability really that good? I actually used some respec points to hit a bunch of ""reduced mana reserved"" nodes, and was able to run Warlord's Mark, Vulnerability, Discipline, *and* Herald of Ash. But to get that I also had to spec out of some accuracy/crit chance nodes, and change my amulet to one that gave me higher strength (speccing out of a +30 str node) and dropped about 1k dps. I ran a couple maps that way and it didn't seem like as big of a dps decrease as the tooltip led me to believe, but I mainly just did it to see if I could. Edit: my enlighten is still a lowly level 1. So I'm stuck using a -mana reserved node for now regardless."

Due to the inc chaos damage on the chest I gravitated towards an attack based poison build using either blade flurry or cyclone. Path of Building code: URL Skilltree: URL Bandits: Oak, passive, frenzy/passive # Summary The tree focuses on reaching a HC viable amount of life (180% min, can go around 210% if you drop damage), and then going for the 2 skill duration clusters and shadow start to scale our poison damage, and acro/phase acro. I really want to fit in Hematophagy for that juicy double dipping 20% increased damage while leeching and more leech defense but having trouble fitting it in and visualizing the benefit since path of building is not factoring it in to the dps calc. The defenses of the build are 180% increased life, acro/phase acro, slayer leech, 20k evasion with grace and the miniscule (12%) block chance from dual wielding. Whirling blade with FA+fortify for more defense as well. With the evasion on cherrubims and passives I felt dual wielding Dreamfeathers was the best choice for the weapons (46% inc attack damage) and then running grace for more damage. Elreon rings can be used for the mana cost as well as the small amount of mana leech near vitality void. Some accuracy on gear brings the chance to hit at a minimum of 90%. # Links 5L Blade Flurry Links: Blade Flurry, added chaos, poison, void manip, melee phys/inc aoe/conc Use a wither totem, flame golem, blood rage, and blasphemy vulnerability. The path of building dps with melee phys as the 5th link and frenzy charge is 360k, 450k with atziris flask, 550k with atziri+jade. # Conclusion In total I estimate the cost to be around 30c or so if you five link the cherrubims (20c?), with 2 dreamfeathers being 2c, the chest itself being around 2c, and an atziri's flask being 5c, but can get started for &lt;10c with just a four link if you drop melee phys, losing 50k dps. My concerns for the build is whether this is enough damage, whether the slayer leech combined with cherrubims is overkill and another class should be used. I'm trying to calculate the leech potential using the the wiki page (URL and this is what I have so far ``` total leech recovery rate = max life * 0.02 * instances of leech * (1 + increased leech per second) ``` Which say for a reasonable 5.5k life pool and 230% inc leech per second from slayer, cherrubims, and the tree equates to: ``` total leech recovery rate = 5500 * 0.02 * instances of leech * (1 + 2.3) = 363 life * instances of leech ``` The get the maximum instance of leech, that page says ``` max instances = (0.2 + increased max leech rate) / (0.02 * (1 + increased leech per second)) ``` Substituting in 0.35 in the increased max leech rate (0.1 from slayer, 0.05 from vitality void) we get ``` max instances = (0.2 + 0.15) / (0.02 * (1 +2.3)) = 5.3 ``` With our 7.12 attack rate we'd reach leech cap in less than a second. I'm not sure where the percent of attack damage leech as life comes into this, I'm hoping that the 3% from passives and tree is enough. Do you guys think that going slayer is worth it? Raider, assassin, and berserker were other options I have been looking into. I thinking to upgrade you can swap the chest for a cospri's will and dual weild varunastra and respec accordingly. Please tear me a new one before i waste time on levelling this build. Thanks for reading."
121,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,Mirror/Blink Arrow Necromancer - NO Cluster Trap. Help with math/PoE mechanics,4,5z5eni,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/5z5eni/mirrorblink_arrow_necromancer_no_cluster_trap/,2017-03-14 01:54:06,"Hey there, I just want to go over the build with some of the more experienced players here to optimize my passives and links. I am really bad with math and pretty clueless about PoE math, so I am really depending on your help here. This is about a pure Mirror Image summoner without Cluster Traps, if you don't really care about the 'why', just skip until the long underscore :) Background: My favourite character was a Mirror/Blink Occultist I played during Perandus league. I played it with Lioneye's Glare (hits can't be evaded), Heretic's Veil (Temp Chains, Proj Weak, Vulnerability), the Soul-Strike quiver, Doedre's Damning (too poor for curse ammy) and some magic find equipment including an Andvarius for roughly ~100% MF at all times. The build was everything I wanted. Curses, Chaos damage and illusions on an Occultist just felt right. I had &gt;10k ES and used both of the Occultist ES passives. Needless to say, it was pretty much impossible to kill me with all the blinking, ES regen and ES pool. Just blinking through the maps, shooting Mirror Images left and right, poisoned mobs dying all over the place, it was just a joy to play. But there were some downsides as well. The damage just wasn't quite there beyond ~T12 maps. Some people started making Cluster Trap Mirror Image builds, but I never really liked that direction. Sure, I wished I had more Mirror Images aswell. But I didn't want to give up that carefree style of play, just shooting arrows left and right. So I simply stayed and leveled around T12 until the League ended. Here are my final links in Perandus: Bow 5L/ Blink Arrow - GMP - Poison - Add Chaos - Min Dmg - (Pierce) Chest 5L - Mirror Arrow - GMP - Poison - Add Chaos - Min Dmg - (Pierce) Heretic's Veil 4L - Enlighten - Temp Chains - Vulnerability - Proj Weakness Gloves 3L/4S - Faster Casting - Wither - Spell Totem | Vaal Discipline Boots 3L/4S - CwDT - Immortal Call - Enduring Cry | Chaos Golem Divination Distillate, Quicksilver and some defensive Flasks __________________________________________________ For the Necromancer, I won't make concessions for MF and will try to push my damage further. My preliminary build looks like this: URL It is a pretty simple and uncomplicated skilltree, concentrating on a large amount of ES, Minion DMG and AS nodes, lots of jewel sockets and aura conservation and effectiveness. You could chop away a good chunk of ES and put points into Minion Health and +1 Zombie nodes for strong blockers, but I think having a stable ES pool should be better overall. One of the things that was always out of reach for me (and after this league will be once more), was Shavronne's Wrappings. This league though, it dropped in my third T1 map that I ran. Absolutely ecstatic, I proceeded to waste all of my jewelers to give it anything from 1-5 sockets -_- (still wasting them). But I'll get there eventually. The thing is: This is going to be low life. Low life means lots of auras, and lots of auras make Commander of Darkness that much more appealing. Heretic's Veil not as much, but I'll probably run Proj Weakness on Blasphemy somewhere, it is a really massive curse here. But the sockets will be tightly packed, so I'm pretty sure we will need Unset Rings. Here is my planned setup (for now) Bow 5L - Blink Arrow - Minion Damage - GMP - ??? - ??? Chest - same, but with Mirror Arrow Boots - CwDT setup Unset Ring 1 - Lightning/Stone Golem (undecided) Unset Ring 2 - ??? Gloves - Auras ??? Helm - Auras ??? Lots of question marks, as you can see. We have reached the part where math is becoming my problem. I have absolutely 0 clue on how to find the most optimal combination of damage auras and which support gems I should use in Blink/Mirror to complement them. I could write down several links that 'sound right', but I couldn't tell you which one is better than which. All the Necromancers and PoE math wizards that have endured this wall of text until here: Good job and thanks a lot! I really need your input and knowledge about PoE mechanics to settle my aura and support setup, playing Blink/Mirror means I need all the damage I can get. I don't want to hit the stonewall T12 again. I will only consider adding Cluster Traps once I run into that wall again. Until then, I'm not going to touch it. I would be really grateful to anyone taking the time to crunch some numbers or elaborate on their game experience to help me decide on my sockets. Thank you!"

It's designed to have one in each hand; one swing chills, the other ignites. The main modifier is that chilled enemies (by your attacks) take 100% more burning damage. That's a more multiplier like Vulnerability, etc. But it also recently got a change to the chill mechanic. It now *always* chills for 1 second. Zombie or boss, 1 second. Furthermore **you can do 0 cold damage, and it still chills.** So with this we can convert everything to fire with Avatar and Cold to Fire and still get the chill and double burn damage. I decided on Cleave to merge their high dps and get good single target too, with the option of switching in a conc effect for tough bosses. There's also the new Cleave jewel for permanent fortify and extra area. The main snag is that we're dealing with burns not poison. Either you go crit for big burns or emberwake to stack them. I think due to the axe having very power crit and us attacking quickly, RT emberwake may work the best, with a Taming super-late game. If anything it can be very cheap for the damage. A 440+ edps Dyadus is about 2 alchs. Thoughts? I'd like to see your ideas for a tree and ascendancy. Cheers."

Dual Curse with +1 amulet. Enfeeble / Vulnerability for survival/ dps. * Dex + EV% on jewelery. * Tree, still trying to figure this out...

Early game: Start as a Scion, level up with dual wielding swords (cleave -&gt; lacerate -&gt; warchief after cruel lab) 2.

Few other things too...,3,5osifb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/5osifb/anyone_familiar_with_path_of_building_cant_get/,2017-01-19 09:10:33,"After many people convinced me to give path of building a try, I'm stuck on a few spots. 1. Point blank does nothing. Even when close range is checked. It also reads as black when you click 'show power nodes.' 2. Wither totem only shows 1 stack. When you change it to 20 stacks, it does nothing. 3. Not sure if vulnerability is coded right. You have to up the level of them gem a few times for it to actually name any damage change, then it only bumps up a few thousand. I'm on a build with about 700k dps lvl 95, and from level 10 vuln curse to lvl 21, the difference is like, 3,000 dps. That seems really low for a 5% increased dps. I know it's not 'more dps' though. 4. Enh Empower Temp Chains modifying the gem level and quality does nothing. I can disable them and re-enable and it does nothing to the effective DPS. Which really sucks because I'm trying to see how well TC works with a certain tree over vuln."

146,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,"Life-based Cospri's Will Occultist Bladefaller, any good? Help before new league starts please",2,5fjwzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/5fjwzi/lifebased_cospris_will_occultist_bladefaller_any/,2016-11-30 04:25:40,"Hi guys, was wondering what others think of this build and if there are any improvements I could make. The core mechanics of the build that I'm trying to scale are: * curses - I want to use 4 curses with +1 from ascendancy, +1 from the tree and +1 from Cospri's Will. I've gone Cospri's to curse Hexproof enemies for consistency and will be using blasphemy, hence the curse radius passives. I also have +20% curse effect. Endgame I want to use Heretic's Veil with 3 or 4 curses in it but I'll use 3 and Blasphemy until then (can you run 2 separate blasphemy circuits, i.e. 3 curses with blasphemy in one item, 1 curse with another blasphemy in a different item?). I currently plan to use Warlord's Mark for leech (got Vaal Pact) and endurance charges (will improve Immortal Call Duration), Temporal Chains and Enfeeble for safety with Vulnerability for damage - could swap out Temporal Chains for Assassin's Mark when farming or against easy bosses. If you can use 2 separate blasphemy circuits then I'll use 3 curses in my Heretic's Veil, the 4th link will be empower or enlighten and the 4th curse can go in another item with another blasphemy gem. If not I could use the other 3 curses with Empower / Enlighten and Witchfire Brew for Vulnerability and dot scaling. * Chaos damage - Cospri's gives me free poison damage on hit, which I scale in a number of ways (Temporal Chains, Vulnerability, Void Beacon ascendancy). The Profane Bloom (enemies have a chance of exploding for 20% max life as chaos damage) and Malediction (4% of non-chaos damage as chaos damage per curse on enemies after recent kills) ascendancies and Shaper's Touch passive (5% of physical damage as extra chaos damage) makes it so I'll have several sources of chaos damage, most scaling with my physical damage. My brother is going to run an aurabot with Hatred and Herald of Ash so I have more non-chaos damage to convert to chaos damage through the Malediction Ascendancy and get elemental damage scaling out of my physical damage as well. I'll ideally be using Atziri's Promise to get additional extra chaos damage from my physical and elemental damage and a wither totem to scale all this. * Jewels - I've gone for quite a few jewels on my passive tree, until I can afford them those points could go into spell damage and physical / chaos damage, but endgame the jewels should be better so that's what I've shown on the tree. Other equipment: I don't have any essential / core items in mind beyond Cospri's and Heretic's Veil. Aurseize and Ventor's would be good for MF. Not sure if it's worth getting Kaom's roots for the high flat life and stun immunity (would scrap all of Cospri's evasion but might be worth it overall). I have a lot of free energy shield scaling so hybrid defences are an option but I'm not sure what the best items for a hybrid character would be. I literally have no clue what the best weapon to use will be either. Apep's Rage would give me nice cast speed and Death's Hand would give me more crit, both give additional chaos damage so they look nice. The top contender's however, I feel, are Bino's Kitchen Knife, for poison damage and proliferation, along with Whirling Blades as a movement skill, and Eclipse Solaris, because it would blind attack based enemies (not sure how strong or consistent blind is). Also not sure whether to dual wield or use a shield, if dual wielding I could use any combination of two of the previous weapons. I don't see any great looking shields other than Malachai's Loop, but shock is kind of scary so I'm leaning towards dual-wielding. My Passive Tree: URL I know life isn't considered to be as good as ES at the moment but with my curses and Immortal Call I'm hoping I'll be fine even in solo play. Thanks for any help in advance."

148,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,The Current State of Summoners and Is Summoner the Right Build for You?,6,5flt3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/5flt3z/the_current_state_of_summoners_and_is_summoner/,2016-11-30 09:37:12,"Hey guys I'm a long time classic summoner player. I've played classic summoner from back when burning miscreations were the strongest spectre and snapshotting was a thing. More recently I've played perandus, prophecy, and a good deal of essence. I have played some flavor of the month builds and I'm often theorizing on ways to maximize currency gained per hour. I have a simple point to share with new players who are trying to determine whether they want to play as a summoner. Classic summoners are way better than people think and can take you far into the new league. I define classic summoners as those summoners who use persistent summons such as zombies and spectres. After a significant amount of trial and error, I can offer some powerful pieces of advice for people contemplating playing a summoner in this new breach league. I will look to uploading videos in the future but for now please accept this advice: -You must put your zombies in a +2 minion helmet. The strength and durability they gain from this cannot be understated. Link them with minion damage, melee physical damage, and the highest level empower you can get -People find spectres lacking because they pick the wrong spectres or link them with the wrong supports. If you don't know what to pick, use knitted horrors from dried lake. They're tanky and have good AI. They use a spear attack that has puncture built in. They thus benefit from hitting hard rather than fast. Link them with minion damage-physical project damage-slower projectiles-poison-added chaos damage. Pierce may be better than added chaos but I have listed the gems in priority order. Flame sentinels are a good choice too but I tend to come back to knitted horrors for whatever reason. -When you find them, raise map level knitted horrors. Map level determines the stats on your spectres. Knitted horrors you raise from maps are many times stronger than knitted horrors from dried lake. Despite this, knitted horrors from dried lake are capable of handling maps well. -Use mon'tregul's scepter and CI. I haven't experimented with shavs and lowlife but mon'tregul's is amazingly underrated. With it, you'll only have 4 zombies, but the zombies will help clear speed tremendously with the infernal blow effect that the scepter provides. They will also die much less. -get an umbilicus immortalis when you feel your own survivability is enough. Swap into offensive flasks like atziri's promise and witchfire brew. Use one forbidden taste for instant healing. -use vis mortis for the unholy might and +1 spectres -link ball lightning with curse on hit, vulnerability, and projectile weakness. Your minions will prioritize hitting the things that you hit with your ball lightning, so you can thus command them to attack high priority targets and they will all focus fire. -Use discipline and hatred. Link hatred with generosity. -spirit offering if you don't die, bone offering if you do. -Use necromancer ascendancy. Rush soul Weaver then commander of darkness then the offering ascendancy -make sure you get every minion node and prioritize going towards +zombie and minion Regen nodes first. Once you get your first minion Regen node, you'll notice you won't have to resummon your minions while leveling except on rare occasion(really tough fights). This is the key to leveling with a summoner( which isn't hard at all). -get as many jewel nodes as you can and make sure minion damage is one of the stats on every jewel you pick up. Summoners are fun because they provide a very casual play style that allows you to farm while watching Netflix. The investment amount is minimal( can be well geared and capable of high tier mapping with less than 50c investment). They can also do any map mod you can think of. This is excellent for a new league where you want to avoid having to reroll maps. -with the right defensive auras from a support, your minions can do end game content. My way isn't the only way to play summoner, but I've found it to be highly effective for casual mapping and Atlas completion. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll happily answer them. The purpose of this post was to increase interest in the classic summoner and thus potentially expedite positive changes to the classic summoner, including my (unrealistic) dream of rogue exile spectres.

Which puts us at a VERY comfortable **11.1% life regen**. We [need](URL only **10.8% life regen**. We get 2 * RubyFlask, and 2 * Divination Distillate **=Perhaps we won't need 2 copies of each, but not sure=**. Our last flask can be an amethyst flask (Since it is quite hard to get the requisite chaos resistance in general just from gear without ring slots) * *We do (DivDist + RubyFlask) wonky method since I don't have the $$ to get a Shav's. This means that we need to find a way to reach the resistance requirements without it, and this is my solution.* * [Auras](URL We want to run TempChains and Flammability/EleWeak, and get either cold damage to spells, or lightning damage to spells (for proccing ELEOverload). With the gear I have listed, all the requisite things cost like 1EX. (20 for intuitive leap, 30C for good weapon with enchant and the DivDists) The remainder goes into generic ES gear. This build will probably be VERY tanky since we have 75% Chaos RES , 80% Light and Cold RES, and 88% fire RES. We also don't sacrifice even 1 high ES slot in our equips. We get to keep Shield, Helm and Body. Ring slots also come with little to no ES and no spell damage, so we are losing NOTHING here to get RF + 8 Endurance charges. OpieOpie. We also don't sacrifice any slots that we can get spell damage on. So focus on getting that on all the available slots. **ED + Decay is broken, what happens when we add the last part of the degen trifecta? Let's find out.** Note that ED has quite a small initial hit, so we aren't gaining TOO much damage from adding ignite into the mixture, however since ED + Decay penetrates all res anyway, we don't lose anything for adding the fire damage. * -=* SKILL LINKS*=- 6L {ED + ControlledDest + RapidDecay + ~~IncDuration~~ VoidManipulation + SlowerProj + Empower} 3L {FlameGolem + ChaosGolem = - = [RF]} 3L {WB + FasterAttacks + Fortify} 4L (Blasphemy + TempChains + Vulnerability ~~Flammability/EleWeakness~~ = - = EnduringCry} 4L {Wither + SpellTotem + FasterCast + Increased Duration} 4L {Blood Magic + Discipline = - = Contagion + IncAoE} EDIT: Added a sentence stating that the burn is just supposed to add a little extra damage for boss kills. We need Contagion, shove it into this last slot here with Inc AoE. Put Endurance Charges with Blashpemy instead of Enlighten. Changed Flammability/EleWeakness into Vulnerability. Replaced IncDuration in main setup with VoidManip. It will scale the initial hit. Put RF instead of Minon Life."

Should I drop one, or is there an alternative way to maintain two curses? * Generating Power Charges. Reckoning and Riposte doesn't seem consistent.

If someone could help point out any way to help with maintaining charges, maintaining two curses, fixing my mana reservation or making my tree more efficient, I would really appreciate it. I am resigned to restarting the character, but before I spend any more currency fixing socket colors or buying items, I would like to have a more streamlined and hopefully build planned. Thank you."

The idea from his build is to stack evasion to scale the damage of your dreamfeathers, and apply large hits of poison that double dip on your projectile damage. His build looks pretty good, but I'd like something with more clear speed and less flasking. Looking at the pros and cons of occultist vs pathfinder for this build... Pathfinder: Free poison from ascendancy Immunity to elemental ailments on flask Vinktars for shock and dmg Almost 100% uptime on jade flask for a nice dmg+evasion boost More access to proj dmg on the tree Less mana reservation Occultist: Enemies have -20 chaos res for nice dmg boost Extra curse from ascendancy node Cospri's for tri curse, curse vs bosses and hex proof enemies, and free poison Higher clear speed from profane bloom, might only need LMP? Triple curse and curse effectiveness for sweet temp chains + proj weakness + vulnerability (witches brew flask) The hardest part of my variant is running two blasphemy curses and grace (which you pretty much have to run, otherwise, why use dreamfeather?). We take 12% worth of mana reservation to make it work. We also run alpha's Howl or heretic's Veil. We triple curse by using witches brew to apply vulnerability, although I'm still thinking about running some kind of curse on hit instead. That would save me some mana reservation and then I wouldn't have to use heretic's or alpha's Howl. Overall, I don't expect it to be stronger than pathfinder, but I think the chaos benefits and triple curse from occultist will make it competitive with better clear and less flasking/micro.

175,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,Mistress of Sacrifice Blade Vortex Witch Build,2,51wsc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/51wsc9/mistress_of_sacrifice_blade_vortex_witch_build/,2016-09-09 20:49:57,"Hello! Just recently got the idea for a new build by brainstorming because of the new Yorick release in League of Legends. Trying to make a hybrid caster/minion witch. [Build](URL Basics of it: Use Mistress of Sacrifice to give ourselves Bone Offering, along with MOM/EB/ZO. Have the damage mitigation of Mind over Matter along with achieving 78% block all the time via Bone Offering, Anvil, Champion Kite Shield with max block percent, and Tempest Shield. This should(if my math is right) mean I block 3.54 times more than I don't block, and thus a level 20 bone offering gives 2106 life for every hit I take. With the 1.42x effective life MoM gives you, that should be 2990 life. On top of the life Anvil gives me on block(the mana isn't really relevant) Planned auras include Hatred, Purity of Elements, and Blasphemy. That's 120% mana reserved, which 17% mana reservation(bumped up to 18% because it's the closest we can get in the tree) lets the build run 3 auras at once. Blasphemy could use Warlord's Mark for leech and stun and endurance charges(not that it's needed), or Vulnerability to add to the damage of blade vortex. The build includes minion nodes to increase the number of zombies at a time, but those are optional until you get everything else, I think. Minions serve to soak up additional damage(and to make better use of Bone Offering), as well as do damage on their own. Minions later on will also help via additional damage reduction, although there's only +44% armor in the passive tree. A unique I considered to help the minion side of the build is Skullhead, giving more block to the minions for more tankiness. Anything I forgot in the build, stuff I should tweak, or uniques I should look at which might help with the build? This is my first time making a Mind over Matter build, and also my first time trying to use Mistress of Sacrifice. I'm also worried that damage is going to be low, although the significant amount of skill duration lets Blade Vortex be kept at 20 spellcasts pretty easily, with minions on top of that."
176,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,Still a way to play bleed poison eq?

Gladiator: Ascencies - Versatile combatant -&gt; Gratuitous Violence -&gt; Violent Retaliation. So with the voidheart nerf, I was thinking to play without it since it is unreliable. My max block bleed poison earthquaker from last league had some sick gear so it did alot of damage with how OP voidheart + breath of the council combo was. I was thinking something along the lines of : 5L: Earthquake - Melee Phys - Poison - Fortify - Lesser Duration OR rapid decay since I don't plan on buying a 6 link for this character. If I find EQ being gimped too hard by not using lesser duration I'd scrap the rapid decay idea. For the way to get bleed, I was going to start off using jack, the axe since it is insanely cheap and has bleed on hit. Later in the league I will probably buy a high phys axe and craft bleed on hit. 4L : Ancestral Warchief - Conc effect - Melee phys - Faster attacks or Bloodlust support 3L :Endurance charge on melee stun - Riposte - Vengeance (to gain endurance charges) 4L: CWDT - Blood Rage - Immortal Call - Tempest Shield Curse setup: Blasphemy - Vulnerability or Enfeeble depending on how how tanky I am with gear. Eventually I will get a double curse amulet like last season and run both. I know EQ got nerfed but it is still the strongest and most used melee spell, I loved flying through uber lab and farming max keys for boxes with 0 difficulty. Would this ""nerfed"" version of a max block bleed psn EQ gladiator still be very effective in the uber lab? I know jugger is the way to go usually to farm lab but I just love how gladiator can still farm maps with ease since corpse explosion is really good."

The main source of damage would be RF, with a massive area (+35% aoe from tree, +40% from gem, +20% from gloves, 8% or 12% from helmet enchantment, and maybe +10% from Scion start if I get an intuitive leap). I would trigger Elemental Equilibrium and Elemental Overload with Blade Vortex, and curse with Blasphemy (unless I go dual curse and use BV-CoH). Ideally I would trigger BV enough as to no do it manually. I will manually cast Enduring cry for keeping up the 8 endurance charges, and gaining 8% life regeneration, at least until I complete core lab and can take the ascendancy point (but even then, on bosses...). And just cast 4 Searing Bond totems (staying idle is boring). The totems benefit from everything but the penetration on helmet and area nodes, I expect them to single-handedly take me out of thigh situations where I can't run RF because of mods or I need to kite. The Vaal Lightning Trap is for the shocking ground. * [Skill tree at level 67!](URL * [Skill tree at level 100!](URL I would level using explosive arrow (benefits from areas and fire) AAAAND YES, I KNOW, not enough sockets.

That's why I'm accepting suggestions. Thank you very much PS: Whenever I try to find hierophant RF builds I only find RF totem builds, if you know any, please link it here.

Was thinking of doing a cookie-cutter Lab farming EQ Juggernaut, but wanted something a little less flavor-of-the-month mainly to avoid increased costs of gear due to demand and hipsterness. I haven't played an ED build past 60ish, so I'm not really sure what works and what doesn't. Also haven't done a ton of the Labyrinth but I'd really like to farm a bunch of the Uber Lab.

Decent movement speed, Unstoppable and using a dagger so Whirling Blades. Really like the Juggernaut for Unstoppable, max endurance charges when you gain any, and the 20% chance to gain a charge when hit (by any chance does anyone know if Labyrinth traps will give you charges with this?). Essence Drain seems like a good boss killer etc. Really interested to see what kind of things this build can accomplish when it's optimized etc. Problems I see so far: Low % life, mana, cast speed. Need stats listed above on gear. Not sure if I can really pull off the triple Blasphemy without one reservation item or some other tweak.. anyone have some numbers to compare against as far as ED mana cost per cast or per second?

183,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,Vortex Degen Build,1,4lw3gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/4lw3gy/vortex_degen_build/,2016-06-01 02:32:04,"I've been planning a build based around converting Vortex's initial damage to fire using Pyre, combined with EE to make everything reeeeal vurnerable to the (presumably) non-converted degen damage. Combined with blasphemied Frostbite, cold damage is pretty much doubled against non-resistant enemies. Obviously, this entire build is contingent on the Vortex's degen damage being decent, and not being converted by Pyre. I'm having trouble deciding whether to go Elementalist or Trickster. I'd try to reach the Templar and Witch AoE nodes with both builds, putting Trickster in a slightly worse position. Also considering speccing into increased duration nodes, but the base duration is probably enough for any normal mobs to die from one cast, and for anything else recasting it every ~3 seconds should be fine. Elementalist has Liege of the Primordial and Pendulum of Destruction as ascendancy nodes of interest, granting 80% increased cold damage with both golems up, and an average of 40% increased damage respectively. Shaper of Desolation might work aswell, but removes Elemental Focus as a support gem option, and the shock duration probably won't be long enough to matter on bigger mobs. Paragon of Calamity doesn't do a whole lot, as degen damage isn't reflected, and Mastermind of Discord doesn't do anything as penetration does nothing for degen. Trickster has Patient Reaper and Swift Killer, granting 30% increased DoT and 24% more damage through 6 frenzy charges (tree, bandit, ascendancy). Using Blood Dance and going for some HP regen nodes to take advantage of Patient Reaper would make it easy to reach ~15% HP regen. After that it gets a bit iffier, but with 8 ascendancy points, speccing into Shade Form and using a combination of ES/Evasion/Life for defense could be viable. Works well with Carcass Jack too. Typing it out actually makes Trickster the obvious choice to me, but I'd love some feedback. Gear for both would be Pyre, Carcass Jack, Staff with + cold gem levels. Potentially Realmshaper when leveling, and Taryn's Shiver as a cheaper option until a +2 or even a +3 staff can be found. Trickster would have The Blood Dance. The potential support gems are Conc Effect, Inc. AoE, Elemental Focus (assuming it doesn't remove the chill from the degen, which it shouldn't (right?)), Controlled Destruction, Empower, Rapid Decay and Less Duration, probably in that order. Vulnerability and Frostbite on Blasphemy, combined with EE for a ~2.5x damage multiplier, depending on target resistances. Inb4 ""just go 12 grand spectrum, scrub"". tl;dr Vortex with Pyre+EE, focusing on the degen damage. Might play a bit like a RF build. edit: [Trickster skill tree](URL"

Ele/phys ST didn't feel interesting enough. I tried gimmicky Goddess Unleashed ST, which was fine until merc A4 where it hit a wall and ultimately was converted into a Oro's flicker. The Assassin ascendancy got a slight buff when it comes to dealing poison damage - *100 MORE damage when poison is applied by a crit.* That is absolutely insane. But I really hate the slow style of miners and trappers. There's a lot of dagger and crit nodes in the shadow area of the tree, and I found a Bino's from a prophecy a while back. So how about Viper Strike? The build got insane damage but ended up with about 80% max life. So yeah.. Then I noticed all the projectile nodes and life nodes near them, as well as travelling all the way to Scion life-2d-cube-thingy. Since ranged builds are by nature more safe I felt I didn't need that much life so I got about 150% and was happy with that. **[End skip]** **[General concept]** So here is the build: [poeplanner](URL The Idea is to deal high physical damage with ST and thus apply high DoT damage with poison. Since the build has a lot of attack speed and ST projectiles are likely to hit a target twice, should it need to, the poison stacks can potentially get very high. Also Bino's spreading the poison should help a bit with not missing mobs. I'm not quite sure about the ascendancy choices when it comes to Unstable and Deadly infusions. It might be better to go Ambush and Assassinate and generate power charges some other way. I'm not quite sure with wether to go Vaal pact or not. Bino's does give some regen, even after tthe massive nerf to it, and I'm not a huge fan of VP. This needs some testing. **[Gear]** * Binos for high phys damage and crit as well as the minor benefits of spreading poison and granting life regen. * Old one's ward would give a nice offensive boost. For high elemental/spell encounters swap to Saffel's Frame. A rare shield with life, resists and INT/STR since the build is quite low on both. * Other than that I would most likely use rares. The End Game Fantasy would likely include Rat's nest and Maligaro's/Facebreaker/Shadow and Dust(will have to wait until league ends). Maybe belly or Lightning Coil for a chest to maybe not get oneshot constantly since the defence is mostly the issue with this build. **[Gems(I have no idea what I'm talking about here)]** Trash: ST-faster attacks-faster proj.-proj. phys. damage-poison-Void manipulation or something idk Single target: ST-faster attacks-slower proj.-proj. phys. damage-Poison-idk, maybe Point Blank or Pierce or something else with %MORE multiplier, needs testing Then the standard CwDT-IC, Ice golem. As for auras, Hatred and Heral of Ice would liekly be the best since the build has high crit and physical damage. Cursing likely through CoH-HoI-Vulnerability/Temp chains. So what do you think? I will likely be testing this out in standard since I have a levelled shadow with passive reset and hopefully some usable gear. EDIT: how does into reddit formatting EDIT2:Dammit, maybe now?"

Without further ado, here is the build: [Blood Magic Bladefall Dual Totem Chieftain](URL ^ That's for Level 90. I'm level 80 now, and I'll share that version as well. [BMBDTC Lv80](URL ^ Boy, that just rolls off the tongue. --- **My links at the moment are:** **5L:** Bladefall + Spell Totem + Added Fire Damage + Concentrated Effect + Faster Casting (6th Link would be Iron Will or Controlled Destruction or Empower) **4L:** CwDT Lv7 + Increased Duration + Molten Shell Lv13 + Immortal Call Lv7 **3L:** Lightning Warp + Reduced Duration + Faster Casting **2L:** CwDT Lv1 + Summon Chaos Golem Lv3 **Misc:** Herald of Ash, Vulnerability, Enduring Cry --- **Uniques I am using are:** **Ming's Heart:** This one is easily the most necessary. Without it, we don't have enough damage to clear maps efficiently past t10 or t11. You could even roll with two, but I prefer to be safer. **Belly of the Beast:** I just needed a reliable 5 Link, and I got this at a steal for 40 Chaos in Perandus Softcore. Before then I had a 5 Link Body Armour that I bought for 1 Chaos and Alch'd into something acceptable. **Spire of Stone:** Stunned totems can't deal damage. Also, there's some vague synergy with Tukohama, War's Herald. Kind of? **Fluid Motion:** I wouldn't have the Dexterity for Bladefall without it. Barring very good rolls on basically every piece of gear that can have Dexterity, you're going to need to fill one of the four Jewel slots with this. I guess that's a build weakness? But I'm not sure how to fix it. **Two Rare Jewels:** I put these here because they are kind of special. I bought two Jewels with +Totem Damage%, +Physical Damage%, and +Area Damage%. One ran me 4 Chaos and the other 18 Chaos, and I consider the first a steal. You're looking at probably 40 Chaos to get these two from smart sellers, and they're a pretty important part of my damage. Each adds about 1,000 Tooltip DPS. They aren't necessary until somewhere like t11 or t12, though. --- **The general idea:** There's a few things that kind of interconnect and synergize, but the most important part is the Bladefall Totems. Bladefall deals a good amount of damage on its own, and can't be buffed a whole lot through the tree... More than Ethereal Knives, though, at least. A few leagues ago I ran an Ethereal Knives totem build that wasn't quite as good as this. Anyway. The idea is to capitalize on the Chieftain Ascendancy's abilities Arohongui, Moon's Presence and Tukohama, War's Herald. Arohongui, Moon's Presence causes enemies near your Totems to deal 8% Less Damage and take 16% More Damage from Physical and Fire. 'Near' in this case is almost the entire screen around them, so you are basically looking at always taking 8% Less Damage and dealing 16% More Damage. Always. Always! It's insane, defensively and offensively. More/Less modifiers are already great, and 16% is a huuuge boost. Tukohama, War's Herald is less insane but still very good. It causes Totems to gain 50% of your Armour, which is pretty nice. The build in total has 264% Increased Armour, and I presently have almost 9,000. That means at level 80 my Totems should have something like 35-40% Damage Reduction. It's a dangerous amount for a player looking to survive burst damage, but a Totem is a lot more expendable. That's just the first effect, too! It also makes the Totems immune to Fire Damage, which is kind of neat. It means I can throw them on Burning Ground without caring, and is convenient more often than I thought it'd be. It makes skills used by the Totem taunt enemies with a 20% chance on hit, which basically means my Bladefall Totems are now also Decoy Totems. Bladefall hits up to five times per cast, meaning it's almost a guaranteed taunt from one measly cast as far as probability is concerned. Lastly, it makes my Totems reflect 8% of their health to all nearby enemies as Fire Damage when they get hit. That isn't as great as it probably sounds, considering I don't take Totem Life nodes, but it does shred through enemies that hit quickly without hitting very hard. The tentacle needle spitter ladies, for instance, tend to melt if they're close to my Totems. I take Tawhoa, Forest's Strength as my last big Ascendancy node, but it doesn't do anything more than keep me alive. It's just a good defensive boost. I thought about going for Ngamahu, Flame's Advance but I don't need the DPS boost of Ignite as much as I like the safety of more Armour and Life (via Strength boost). Other quirks are using Concentrated Effect - That's not something I swap out, it's just always on. I find that Bladefall is almost better the smaller it is, because it packs the waves of the spell tighter together and makes them overlap more easily. It's all about those multi-hits. Also, I use Herald of Ash because it only reserves a measly 800 of my Life. I still gain the Regen as though I had my full 6,000 - And the build has 8.2% Life Regen / sec. I pretty rarely have to potion in the first place. I'm currently in t11 - t13 maps, at level 80 and going up pretty quickly. My tooltip DPS is 8,813, which you can double thanks to two totems, and it feels like it should probably be higher. Normal mobs and blue mobs don't last more than a second or two, and Rares don't usually take more than the lifespan of a single Totem-drop. So! Basically, if you like Totem builds this is maybe one that you should check out. The only investment I feel that it NEEDS is Ming's Heart, Spire of Stone and Fluid Motion. That's about 5 Chaos altogether..? Less? Probably less. I leveled with Flame Totem until the end of Cruel and then swapped over. I had enough to buy the Fluid Motion I needed then, so... Yeah! Let me know what you think. Let me know if I could've pathed better on the tree - I'm always looking to save points. Let me know if you try it out! [You can see my character here. He's CatViolin. There's also the Scion I mentioned that didn't work out! Yay!](URL"

While this build should be able to use almost any spell, the most synergy appears with Blade Vortex (for the insane 16 life per enemy hit by spells) and, to a lesser extent, Firestorm (simply because of the inc. duration from the tree). I've chosen to go poison because of the increased duration nodes, the double dipping from the Vulnerability curse, and the available chaos damage, and because there is no room in the build for crit.

It is basically a Scion (Deadeye, Occultist) ED poison prolif build utilizing a Bino's and the poison skill gem. It is also CI so that is nice as well. The build uses the duel projectiles from scion with projectile speed and damage to clear very well as well as using the Occultist for the -Chaos Res. The 100% Pierce you get from the Pierce Support Gem and Deadeye class, will actually allow you to get multiple stacks of ED on mobs helping with the regen (if you are running life). **6 Link**- Essence Drain, Controlled Destruction, Pierce, Void Manipulation, Rapid Decay, Poison (but not in that order) **5 Link**- Drop Poison unless you already have a bino's then drop controlled destruction instead **4 Link**- Abyssal Cry, Inc. AOE, Contagion, Faster Casting **4 Link**- Discipline, Clarity, Blasphemy with Temp Chains: in a Alpha's Howl helm (mine cost 20c for those blue rolls). You could also drop clarity and just have two blue if you want to use a mana pot. **3 Link**- Spell totem, Wither, Faster Casting (on shield or dagger) **3 Link**- Whirling Blades, Faster Attacks, Fortify (on shield or dagger: your movement skill) **4 Link**- CWDT, Immortal Call, Contagion, Temp Shield I run a few uniques I think you should pick up. Since you will be running CI: The Sorrow of the Divine is a great flask since it will give you 4% ES regen while on concentrated ground and allows for your Bino's life regen to apply to ES, along with taste of hate, and Atziri's Promise (since we run Ghost Reave as well). I also run Bino's, Alpha's Howl, and Winds of Change gauntlets. Now currently I have not had any problems with clearing on the build. Most of the time with just the Bino's Poison prolif it is enough to clear all mobs after a few casts. You could use the contagion to speed it up but I mostly just use the self cast ED and the occasional Abyssal Cry to clear large mobs fast. **Maps Cleared**: T15 [Colosseum Map, Abyss Map] T14 [Conservatory, Shrine] T13 [Courtyard, Excavation, Waterways] and I have killed Atziri multiple times (haven't tried Uber yet) I am currently Running CI because I was able to craft a decent 6-link Chest however I think Life based would be better because of the way regen from ED works it does not apply to ES. If you want to go life based I have also provided a tree below. If you go life and do not have a six link that is perfectly OK. Drop the Poison support gem off the 6L and add a consuming dark as your other dagger. This will allow your Chaos Damage to Poison and will really help out damage and regen from Bino's. **NOTE:** if you drop CI and opt for life you will be dropping Clarity and picking up another aura of your choice. If I went life I would personally go Heretic's Veil and spec into Dual Curse and run. Blasphemy with Vulnerability and Temp Chains. **This is my Current Set up and Gear **:URL **Current Build (CI)**: URL **Potential Build for non CI**:URL NOTE: remember quality on gems with this build is important as it really boosts your damage.

In order to make the mana work I would need to refund 5 points and pickup 16% reduced reservation (4% node by CI and 12% from the Charisma cluster) giving me 87% reserved, and get +1 curse (probably with a Doedre's Damning, could respec ascendancy but it seems not worth it, and yes eventually a +1 curse eye would be nice, but I don't have 12ex atm) Option 2: Run 2 curse with enhance and enlighten, and also run Discipline.

And i've noticed that 3 of the best in slot gems for Contagion Or essence drain, Are all multipliers. So the damage will be there without needing much. but I also grabbed alot. I Feel like scion is still the best -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Build - poeurl.com/s7f Details - I figured why not Iron Reflexes since the build is close to it. Grabbed some mana nodes with reduced/gained charges etc Has 6 Jewel slots, So ALOT, of damage can be gained from them. I find skill duration/AOE are very important for contagion spreading essence drain, So the chest of choice here is going to be Carcass Jack. Auras will be Vulnerability + Grace I will use Rallying Cry for damage and Flat mana regen, this fills the gap needing to use clarity on mana. In terms of damage We have no idea how it will turn out. I feel like the Atrophy cluster is OK, but Alot of points to get to the 25% definetly something to look at late game. But since a Large portion of the damage will be from Essence drain if a target is killed and spreads it, I feel that Making Essence drain your 6link is better in some option but im not entirely sure because not being able to test it. The build also utilizes frenzy charges, Which will be gained from Blood dance. Essence drain gives Nice regen to yourself. Aswell as having life regen from your frenzy charges, So survivability should be alright-ish. Dirty technique's seems to be a very nice cluster, DoT + Skill Effect Duration, Its also next to IR and on the way you can grab some jewels, life, And some nice flask nodes. I feel there is alot of potential as a life based build to use MoM/EB/ZO with Contagion. You could be able to run more curse auras. Another option i have been thinking about is dropping grace. And running tri curse, With Vuln/enfeeble/Temp chains, And Using abyssal cry aswell. This would make the mobs very slow and would also work well and compliment carcass jack. I also planned on using abyssal cry anyway. But so far this is what i have come up with. i will add more, or other variations, im currently working on a MoM/EB version "

222,vulnerability,PathOfExileBuilds,IWBM Chaos Marauder HC viable ( Guide. ),1,3vvret,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/3vvret/iwbm_chaos_marauder_hc_viable_guide/,2015-12-08 14:27:38,"Greetings ! I decided with the new Talisman leagues coming up that I may be able to help a few folks out who may be interested in running some of the new chaos skills but aren't necessarily inclined to play Shadow / Witch or any of the other common variants. So, I give to you, our brutish friend from the Karui lands...er...Greg ? I don't know his name. I will state first and foremost that I haven't made a lot of guides, but I did want to put this out there for any curious souls looking for direction. On to the build ! **Stats so far** : 150% increased armor 210% life 7.7% life regen per second 40% life recovery from flasks 145% damage over time / 74% chaos damage / 26% spell damage / 63% spell damage from strength off the base tree. 7 Endurance charges ! [Tree](URL **Pros** * VERY beefy HP pool, the build runs BM, thus it easily breaks 200% or more life with very little searching for life nodes * Scaling of skill damage comes primarily through strength, this gives us the benefit of even more flat HP and the perk of being capable of punching a hole in the space time continuum ( not all pros of this build directly validated by factual evidence. ) This makes finding sources of damage much easier in a new league and allows us to gain greater value from added stats on our equipment. * The build requires very little investment, simply a four link with contagion or essence drain should be able to handle most content, Doon Cuebiyari is a fantastic upgrade once we are able to afford it and it allows our spells to do an absolutely monstrous amount of damage. * Reflect is a nonissue, Bloodmagic maps are a non issue, We can easily adapt to a multitude of situations to clear even the most difficult of maps. **Cons** * The drawback of running a very high strength build that is primarily dependent on blue sockets comes in chrome colors. Some of the difficulty can be easily circumvented by chroming our Doon and using that for our primary skill ( yes, it will do impressive damage on a four link. ) * You are not edgy like a shadow. * Midgame for the build involves a great deal of travelling nodes, it can be difficult to start taking off until you get your skill gems and stats in order. *Skills* Our primary source of damage will most likely be Essence drain, we socket this into Doon with Void manipulation and Rapid decay. We will use Contagion to spread the massive dot from essence drain to other targets. We will link this with increased AOE ( other gems may include Rapid Decay and Ironwill if you want more damage out of this. ) Wither will be our boss / tanky rare debuff. We will link this with spell echo and increased duration to ensure we get as many stacks as we possibly can while Essence drain rots our target. For our curse, we will be using Temporal chains, it has a wonderful benefit of being both a defensive and an offensive aura for our spec. Temporal chains will increase the duration of our dots, and thus increase their damage ( it will also add longevity to our stacks of wither. ) To further increase the power of our CC ability with stacking withers and temporal chain, we will also use abyssal cry on tougher packs of mobs. This will bring them near to a standstill and the aoe explosions of chaos damage will help to finish off the pack and spread our essence drain more swiftly. For bandits, we will take Oak, Kill all, Oak or All. I believe the added endurance charge is worth more than our skill point. **Gearing** Our primary goal is to gain as much strength as possible via gearing. One should assume that if they are able to get strength on a piece of gear that they certainly should. For gloves, we will ideally use a rare with solid base statistics. Life, strength, resists are key. For boots, we will ideally use a rare with movement speed, life, strength if available and resistances. Jewelry presents an opportunity to use a secondary curse if we like with Doedre's Damning, If you choose to do this, I believe vulnerability is the next best offensive curse, and enfeeble would be ideal on a Cast when damage taken setup. If you are not using Doedre's, rares featuring strength, life, resistances and cast speed will be ideal. This includes necklaces. Belt : We will use a rare here as well, leather belts if we feel we are lacking life, but ideally a heavy belt base with a good implicit and high base strength roll, life, resistances. Our helm will be a rare as well, featuring life,strength, resistances and as much armor as we can obtain. Our chest will ideally be a lightning coil, for a friendlier budget, we can use a high armor base. A six link is not necessary here, but can be used. ( Essence drain / Void manipulation / Rapid Decay/ Iron will / controlled destruction/ empower ) Our offhand presents an interesting opportunity. We can use a second Doon to further benefit from Doon's unique passives ( 1% armor per 16 strength. ) This will provide a nice percentage increase in armor, but if we are lacking armor at this point, I suggest an armor based shield with life, resistances and as high of armor as possible. ( Lioneye's remorse fills this roll nicely, for very cheap. ) **Jewels** It is essential to know that the clear mind unique jewel works while using the BM Keystone. This means we have a VERY high source of damage in our passive tree. If one likes, they can take more jewel sockets throughout the tree to further scale their damage to disgusting levels. Alternatively, we can use simple rare jewels with strength, damage over time, life or chaos damage. **Leveling** It may be difficult to reach end game with this character as a primary contagion or essence drain build. You can mule these gems off of the classes that receive them if you wish to level as the build. In this case, I would suggest moving directly to blood magic taking only life along the way as we can. We will then move up to Templar to get our intellect high enough to use Contagion and it's companion gems. Until this point, we will use a lapis amulet to cap our strength. At low levels, the trap support gem can greatly increase the damage and effectiveness of contagion, however, it may be difficult to maintain the dexterity required, if you choose to do this, I suggest picking up Versatility from the marauder start and respeccing it later. The alternative to leveling with this build will be flame totem and searing bond, you can support them with ironwill ( rapid decay for searing bond. ) in a +1 fire weapon. This will get you quite far into the game, where you may more comfortably play the build. All that aside, I am totally open to critique and curiosity. I hope this has helped inspire you to create something fun in the upcoming leagues. Thanks ! -Never"

My target weapon is an Atziri's Disfavour, but it's certainly possible to self-craft a good %Phys/+Phys/%Aspd L83 Vaal Axe and use Vagan's Bleed mod at L7 (prefix). I think Disfavour will be the better option for damage though, since I get at least 4% More damage (MPD/BL, Added Fire gets +2% too) and more Stun Threshold Reduction when I need it. 2. I'll be using Bloodlust on my main skill while using Frenzy, Leap Slam and Vengeance to inflict the status. Both Frenzy and Leap Slam are supported with Fortify and Dual-Curse on Hit in a 6-Link, so I simultaneously weaken the mobs and strengthen myself with every utility skill usage. 3. Vengeance's primary purpose is to pull mobs to me with Empire's Grasp. Grasp will then let me 'trap' enemies while I DPS them down with Heavy Strike's 100% Knockback. Stun is intended to assist with keeping these mobs locked down. 4. I'm hoping that the buffs to Mana will allow me to get away from Blood Magic (the gem and the Keystone). I am curious, though, if I can sustain everything with just Mana Leech off the tree + a larger pool. I'm hoping that I can, since getting access to Grace + AA on mana is a godsend. 5. My plan is to Vaal GG amulets for a +1 implicit, but I will probably end up equipping a Windscream at some point. My rings, amulet, boots, helm and Jewels will all be rares. Other than Disfavour, Belly, Grasp, and a Phys Doryani's Invitation, I have no pressing desire for any other uniques. I am stacking armor with Grace-IR, using Fortify with the Rampart cluster, and running Arctic Armour with (at least) 5 Endurance Charges + Soul of Steel + Chaos Golem. I am casting Abyssal Cry &amp; cursing with Temporal Chains on top of AA's chilling, heavily disrupting the flow of combat. I am stacking 120% Stun Threshold Reduction (+ Phys Invitation flask effect) and perma-locking whatever gets close enough to me. I want to really maximize my life pool to make leeching better so I'm planning on a Belly of the Beast for my body armor. I want to be reasonably tanky, but I will still need good damage to maximize both Leeching and Stunning. I'm assuming that this is a 'good enough' level of defense and now I can focus on offense? I really want to avoid Lightning Coil if I can, so barring that or Taste I should be getting close to the point of diminishing returns (at least in theory), right? Some of my concerns: If my primary goal is to maximize average single-hit damage for Stun/Leech calculations, how much attack speed do I really want? Is Blood Rage enough of a bonus? I'm STILL somewhat confused about how leech works; I assume that stacking it can't really hurt me even if it's mildly inefficient, but I'm left wondering if there is such a thing as too much leech? What about damage; since I'm RT my scaling should start to hit diminishing returns at some point, but what is that point? This is the first real 'build idea' I've had in a while, and I just want to get it right. I appreciate any help that is offered."

With the 2.0 buff to it's damage, and now the ability to poison enemies, I think it might finally work. Obviously it might be a touch slow, but that's fine for hardcore. I'm planning on temp chains/enfeeble-blasphemy and vulnerability self cast to stack damage before they get in range of the aura. Also planning on running discipline. Using 2 energy from within jewels should also bring my es to 284% from just the tree. Obviously using Soul Strike quiver. I'm not positive what skill I want to use; tornado shot, split arrow, rain of arrows seem to be my options. I'm thinking RoA might be best to universally cover a group with poison stacks (hence the AoE nodes in witch). Here is the run-down of stats: (For reference, Darkscorn is about a 270pdps bow (top end)) Defenses: Immune to 25% physical damage (darkscorn) 330% increased ES from tree/jewels/int 15% more maximum ES 117% increased evasion from tree/dex (maybe I should run grace?) Ghost Reaver Soul strike 150% faster start of ES recharge Discipline+Temp chains+Enfeeble auras Offenses: 370% Increased damage (calculated for both chaos and phys portions) 41% increased attack speed (including Kraytan) 300% increased poison damage (including support gem bonus) 5% phys damage added as chaos 15% inc. AoE Vulnerability + (Temp chains) +2 Frenzy charges (including Kraytan) Links: 5L: RoA, Poison, Phys proj dmg, Faster Attacks, Added Fire/Leech 5L: Frenzy, GMP, CoH, Poacher's Mark/Proj. Weakness, Vulnerability 4L: Discipline, Blasphemy, Enfeeble, Temp Chains 4L: CWDT, Immortal Call, Inc. Duration, Wither 4L: Blink Arrow, Cast when Stunnned, Chaos Golem, Frost Wall Slots for Enduring Cry and Vaal Discipline I'm also thinking of running inc. Aoe/Conc effect for easy boss swapping, but I'll have to test and see how it goes. Aside from not knowing if this is going to work at all, my main concern is mana, since I only have 15% unreserved. I assume though I'll be able to just get enough mana leech (since I do 75% phys dmg) to make it work just fine. So, I'd appreciate some thoughts! URL Edit: I did some number crunching and figure I can get roughly 20kdps on a 4L (but with vulnerability and proj. weakness). Doesn't seem so bad. for the 5th link, AoE looks like the best option, especially for taking down bosses. the dps difference will be huge, and added fire won't scale my poison or leech."

Lightning Warp is for mobility. (I don't have enough dex for faster attacks in Leap Slam.) The bottom line is I have way more life regen than I need to maintain RF, which helped tank in lower levels, but now the problem is stuff that can kill me in just one or two big hits and regen doesn't help there. I'm thinking of cutting out the detour towards Duelist but I'm not sure where I would put the points freed up that way. I'm thinking maybe an extra curse and curse effectiveness, along with getting the Scion ring of life nodes, but that won't let me tank big hits any better. Otherwise maybe mana reserved nodes to add Purity of Lightning and switch to Lightning Coil?"
