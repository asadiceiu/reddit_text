I am currently able to make text bold, change its color, etc. So, I tried using the simple &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt; payload. For some reason, no matter what I put after ""src=x"", the text after it gets removed. I still get the broken image there, but the onerror is removed. Script tags are automatically removed. I've already tried escaping with ""&gt; Here's what I'm stuck in: &lt;span class=""font-caption-header""&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; I'm assuming this is happening because the browser is auto-correcting the code, but even when I did everything correctly, it still removes it. Any other payloads you guys would recommend for this situation? I already checked all the other browsers and it has the same result. There is absolutely no filtering on it."

2,vulnerability,xss,Stolen cookies arent working,4,dgbe5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/xss/comments/dgbe5d/stolen_cookies_arent_working/,2019-10-11 18:01:00,"First of all Im not very much experienced with XSS/ JavaScript so sorry if anything I say or ask sounds silly. Im doing some vulnerable vms and Ive successfully done similar ones using XSS and stealing cookies to log in to the site. However on this one, the cookies I get sent are useless and are changing frequently. When I set my browsers cookie to the ones I get sent to me, I still cant login. I can see when I inspect element on the page a content.js file which contains some xdebug stuff and using GMT date and time to set cookies. Is this whats causing me problems? How can I proceed? So far Ive though about: 1. Using the cookie I receive and the content.js file to somehow create a usable cookie. 2. Using the XSS vulnerability to inject JavaScript that will add a user to the site. (But I cant figure out how to do this) Also, the page I am injecting is messageboard.php so the cookies I am getting sent to me are from users visiting this page. However, I think I need the cookies from when users visit the Register.php page but I cant inject anything on to that page, only the messageboard.php page. Is it possible to get cookies from the Register.php page using the vuln on the messageboard.php page? Thanks!"

5,vulnerability,xss,"Found a Reflected XSS in a large ""not-small"" company, but they seem to ignore it so far.",5,7l9amu,https://www.reddit.com/r/xss/comments/7l9amu/found_a_reflected_xss_in_a_large_notsmall_company/,2017-12-21 23:58:23,"**TL;DR:** *as the title says, I've found my first vulnerability. It's a Reflected XSS. I contacted the company through e-mail, got a response saying they would check it out. But it has been 20 days and the vulnerability is still there.* I think that the Reflected XSS vulnerability could be used by crafting a malicious URL to steal credentials or trick users through Social Engineering techniques. Even though I'm not expert on the subject, since I've started in this field 3 - 4 months ago. But the vulnerability is trigger through the use of a GET parameters that is replicate in the page with no sanitation of input. However the user login (if stealing credentials is really possible) seems to be through another sub domain (xxx.notsmallcompany.com), which reply back with a cookie to the domain where the XSS is found. I'm reaching out to ask if is it normal to companies ignore this kind of vulnerability due to its low direct impact on their platform? Note: please, bear with me. As I said above this is all really new to me since I started just a few months ago. So I probably wrote something wrong there, especially the credential part. I have't done any other tests because the company didn't give me the permission to do so. Note1: English is not my native language, if something is hard to understand I'll be glad to provide further information. "
