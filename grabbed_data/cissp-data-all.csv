My server has secured boot- disabled. So understand that already vulnerable to other boot loader defects? But how realistic such boot loader/grub related attacks are? Insider attack? 2. Now, if I want to enable secure boot options are there really critical CVEs against it so that I am defending against by enabling it? I want to experiment to know how easy/difficult to exploit. 3. Just turning on secure boot suffices on BIOS settings or need digital certificates etc for point number 2? Is there a procedure for it? Thank you very much for your suggestions."

Does this count, or do I need an actual role within an InfoSec team? The reason I ask, is I think that obtaining this certification would only help me with my current role and to potentially move directly into InfoSec in the near future. Should I begin somewhere else?

I am deciding to use this time to study for the CISSP. I will not be able to take the exam until I return home, so the earliest I can take it will be around December. I am trying to decide on the best approach to ensure that I can cover the material well enough to pass, while also not stretching it out too much and losing information I studied. I looked at the 16-week study plan, as well as some other suggestions people have mentioned, and came up with the following plan: My goal is to read 2 Chapters per week of the Sybex book, following this process: * Read first chapter. * Watch a Kelly H. Cybrary lecture (corresponding with the lessons, based on the 16-week outline). * Re-read chapter and take notes/high-light important concepts. * Repeat for next chapter. * Take quiz on chapters covered. After I get through the 21 chapters, I plan to take 2 practice tests to gauge my status and then I am thinking I will spend a week on the Thor videos on Udemy, followed by more practice tests until the exam (revisiting any topics I seem to struggle with). Also, depending on my performance, I may read the 11th Hour CISSP a week or two, prior to the exam. As far as experience goes, I received my SEC+ earlier this year and last year finished up a MS CIS degree with a focus on information security. I also have worked for 4 years as a project manager and 2 years as a service delivery manager. Both of these roles have been involved in security either through governance/compliance management, delivery of security-based solutions, or vulnerability tracking and risk mitigation."

I passed the exam today within 120 min, and it stopped at question 101. I started the journey with 11 hours book just to get an initial overview about the material (very good book to start and finish with), continued with Kellys presentations on Cybrary (paid subscription)-this lady rock, and then started with the Sybex book which i really liked, yes it was big but the information flow was very easy to understand and to get the meaning of things (at least for me). I used CBK and AIO books just to read on things that I felt not secure enough after reading Sybex book. I had access also on Cissp online courses from linuxacademy and Linkedin, but I was not so fun of them. I preferred Kelly-Cybrary. Regarding questions bank: I took and exercised question from where ever I found them: different books, material which I got from the CISSP bootcamp(yes I took a bootcamp-not so worthy) but mainly from Whiley: official practice test book and online engine. NO Boson this time, I used it last year on CEH(which I passed), but felt that it doesnt helped so much on that. I need ti mentioned that, i tried the Discord group, but it didnt worked for me. Was to difficult to follow all the discussion there. But on thing that I need to mentioned are the videos from Destination Certification mindmap series from Rob. Huge thank to you . The biggest fear for me was language, as english is not my mother language, but fortunately, I felt difficulties regarding this just on a few questions. EXAM: as the most of you, I never felt that I was passing. There were questions that I knew for sure the correct answer, but most of them were with to possible answer which were so close with each other, and that made the exam more difficult. In this position i tried to chose the answer which showed best the end game and from a advisory/manager role. Had a lot of questions on networking and testing(which was good for me as I have worked with that), just a few on physical security, and strangely enough, nothing or just 1 on BCP. One thing that worked for me: go for the answer that you choose first, dont change it. It made much more complicated when I tried to think deeper. Btw: I have 4,5 experience within security (3,5 with vulnerability management/security audits, 1 as ethical hacker and penetration tester, and from September i will start working as a risk and vulnerability advisor). I have master in Information security, and I am certified with the CEH. Good luck to all of you, and thanks again!"

11,vulnerability,cissp,Comprehensive Exam?,1,gyij9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/gyij9j/comprehensive_exam/,2020-06-08 05:22:11,"Just failed the CISSP, but I am not ashamed or upset over split milk. Sorry for the long post but I know this exam is very important to many, for me it was a quick challenge that I failed. I did want to give my opinions on a few things you may not agree with so keep in mind all just my opinion. Maybe it will help some. This is my experience, your exam/experience will be different. Study material: the ISC 1,000 page book and exam questions book. Boson simulator, which I did very well on, also did well on the full secondary ISC question book with hundreds of questions. (I've heard folks fail when they engage too many resources. So I specifically went with the official ISC material.) Study Time: last couple months been intensely reading book, creating study guides, taking exam prep questions and simulator and Reddit. Passed many tests like this, and definitely put the time into learning the ordained ISC material. Not the issue. About me: Already have 7 IT Certs, 15+ years IT experience and 1 year of hard core Security Experience. Not a network guy, dont want to be but good bit of infrastructure/data center knowledge recently. Lack of 5 years Security experience is really not the easy answer to why I failed. Read on.... First mistake, found an open slot at Pearson 2 hours away, 5 days away and grabbed it. Only open slot for months due to Covid so I went for it. Studied intensely for last 3 days in addition to the previous months studying. Second mistake, used only the ISC materials and Boson. Didnt bother with any expensive, boot camps, videos, etc. Employment not dependent on this cert. Just for grins and giggles but was tremendously serious about it. Opinions: First off, this is not a comprehensive exam. Any CISSP you meet, just know they were not tested on the 1,000 page ISC book's concepts and were not certified based on their full Security knowledge. Though many certainly have that knowledge, they didnt have to prove that on this exam. Due to the test being adaptive it went down numerous rabbit holes. I believe I missed a question related to DAC/MAC early on and it kept on coming up. In affect, sacrificing questions of other important content to ensure what I knew or didnt know about DAC, a very small piece in the grand scheme of the Security pie. Same with Roles. Questions on my test, Biba, IPV4, IPSec, couple physical security, couple OSI like where a Firewall lies, maybe 1 DR, cloud questions, all pretty standard. The remainder was the six degrees of separation type questions with little obvious relation to the 1,000 page book or security concepts or the things you kinda need to know in security. (Yes I understand they expect the next level up thinking / slice and dice, with inferences and assumptions about the material and experience applied to answer questions, etc. Just like the PMP.) Things not even remotely mentioned on my test: Not a dime about encryption? AES, 3DES, RSA etc, No Cyber Laws, EF, AV, SLE, ALE, ARO, No BCP, RMF, viruses, logics, malware, DoS, threats, vulnerability types and how to remediate, wow. I could go on and on. I would guess 70% of the big white ISC book and test question book wasnt covered in a ""direct"" way. Now with that said, some of the deep dives could have referenced the 6 degrees of separation of that knowledge? Not sure. I know its only 100-150 questions but wow, little of this important security content was on my test. Advice: Find the missing gap areas beyond the official 1,000 ISC book. I know many are doing the $1500-$5000 boot camps, extended group sessions, video/online training, etc. Ill never do those. Not sure that all helps, based on the randomness of my exam. Also, keep in mind, someone has to fail. I believe its about 50%. My guess is that many passers could spend hundreds maybe thousands to pass this test. I have friends that pass with minimum studying with 100+/- questions. Ive been in IT for a long time and like you, I am a pretty good judge at folks IT/Sec intellect. I know some CISSPs that have English degrees/elementary teachers that did not pass the test I took, no way. There seem to be different tests (each test is different) and my guess is there could be a rigor factor placed by ISC on the test based on the taker and their ISC pursuits (immediate or 5 years). Again, just my opinion. When you sign up for the test you have to select if you plan to immediately certify or come in as an Associate? Interesting as to why this is information is needed? Next Steps: I would like to find an exam that tests true knowledge, (CISM?) rather than having to pass an exam by correctly guessing at 50% of the questions. I've spoken to CISSPs that said they had no idea they were passing until they passed, guessing at many, many answers. Wow. Additionally, I have IT buddies that have the CISSP (somehow w/o security experience?) but cant get into security, so I am beginning to wonder if like the PMP many are certifying for the initials, watering it down industry wide, employers know this and wont interview them. I work with CISSPs that on tech calls will say Im not very technical"" and so they call in (a real) CISSP to help out with the call. Very interesting, are these the ones paying 1000s to pass? Not sure. As you know, certifications are now a huge money maker all across the industry, we will will keep taking them since HR looks first at your credentials, then at your experience, trying to find a reason to remove your resume. Take Away: Finally, interesting to me, after failing the $700 test, not a single word from ISC? Like you dont exist. Wow. Seems like they would at least send a comforting note saying, Thats ok, lets get you prepared for your next shot, Attached is a list of classes, etc. Anyway, best of luck to all, keep doing what you are doing. Just letting you know my experience this first time, hopefully yours will go better."

16,vulnerability,cissp,I Passed the CISSP Yesterday!,1,hjfd8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/hjfd8i/i_passed_the_cissp_yesterday/,2020-07-02 03:58:24,"Man does it feel great to be done! This test was tough. I did the full 150 questions and had no idea if I passed or not. When I got the passing notice I jumped up and down in the testing center. **Some general observations:** * If you're thinking of taking the test, schedule your exam now, don't wait until you're done studying. * Everyone is going to have a different experience with the test, don't let these posts freak you out. * From my perspective, it was impossible to tell I was taking an adaptive test, no real pattern in questions getting easier or harder. * Do your practice tests in a mask! I wasn't bother by my mask because I took about 400 practice tests in my mask. * Don't spend your study time memorizing port numbers, ISO standards, bit lengths etc. It's ALL about understanding the security concepts from a risk managers perspective. **Background:** I have been working in InfoSec for 5 years. Spent some time as a Vulnerability Assessments analyst, a SOC analyst, and the majority of my career working in Threat Intel. Working in CTI, I have basically touched every domain in some capacity except for Software Development. My CTI experience prepared me well for the ""think like a manager"" approach, as we produce products for Senior Mgmt. daily. I don't have a strong architecture background so I spent a lot of time studying there, however didn't get many in-depth questions. **Study Plan:** I studied for two months. I used a few resources. First, I read the 11th hour cover to cover to get an initial base, took \~two days. Then I read Shon Harris study guide, domain by domain. This book is an absolute beast, but its not too bad, just gets a little tiring by the end. I recommend the Kindle version (I bought both like an idiot). My company paid for the CCCURe course so I would do the CCCURE quiz engine until I consistently scored above 75%. It should be noted that these questions are NOTHING like what the actual exam is like. They are mostly helpful to understand your baseline knowledge, you dont get asked on the test what port number corresponds with what service etc. While taking the quizzes I would identify areas I needed to improve on, and Id watch YouTube videos related to those topics. As I got a week out from the test, I read the 11th Hour again and watched Kelly Handerhans Cybrary course on the CISSP (50 bucks a month). I personally found her videos very helpful and way better than CCCUREs lecture. Then two nights before the test I read the Sunflower Guide, anything I didnt understand I wrote down and reviewed it. The day before the test I watched why you will pass the CISSP and that mindset is the **reason why I passed**. Ultimately, this video prepared me for the test more than any other resource. In hindsight, Id probably watch the Cybrary videos twice, similar to my approach to the 11th Hour. The number one take away I had was DONT spend time memorizing concepts like port numbers, key lengths, ISO standards etc. Focus on understanding the security concepts and youll be fine. The other MAJOR advice Id give is just schedule your exam and dont move it if you dont feel ready. I didnt feel 100% ready, but its all about the mindset, you dont need to have everything memorized. The topics with the most questions on my test were  access control types (RBAC, DAC), GDPR, cloud security. You guys can do it! You'll never feel 100% ready, but don't let that keep you from taking the exam. Good luck!"

Today, we are **releasing** a testable version that we would love your feedback on. You can test it on : [URL **What is it?** A tool to assess your IT security risks in terms of impact and vulnerability. It simplifies some concepts that the CISSP community is familiar with but other may not be. The tool will be free-to-use (for non-commercial purpose) so smaller organisations can do a self assessment before going on the market to get one of those expensive CISSP guys! It enables someone without much background to assess their IT security risk landscape. It is based on a combination of best practices and standards distilled from various sources such as the ISO27000 suite and NIST 800-53 but simpler. The idea is to have a one page overview. **What is the vision?** The vision is to have a full risk management suite in similar fashion, to empower all types of organisations to take control over their risk process and decrease dependency on high-end consulting and audit services. IT security is the first step, but we will open up to IT governance, project management, service management, data management, enterprise architecture, etc. **Would really appreciate feedback from this community. And in case you are interested in getting involved you can always DM me or** u/CoolingSoup**.** **Thanks for all the feedback!**"

I have 10 years of experience in vulnerability management with some overlaps in SOC &amp; IAM domains. I had been more of a passive member of this group from last 4 months however I ensured to follow each post, specially anything that comes from Luke Ahmed. I have tried to read a lot of content and major chunk of it came from stories shared on this group &amp; reddit by members irrespective of whether they passed or would attempt again. For me only 1 thumb rule worked --&gt; Clear your concepts - no ifs no buts no maybes. Coming to most curious part of aspirants, this I show I prepared: 1. Since I had not attended any bootcamp, I followed [studynotesandtheory](URL website. Honestly, this was an eye opener for me. Thanks again Luke for the awesome collection. 2. Watching videos from LinkedIn Learning/Mike Chapple (9/10), Cybrary/Kelly Henderson's (8/10) along with other YouTube content from MF prod &amp; SkillSet. 3. I read Sybex &amp; Shon Harris cover to cover. Since I am a slow learner, it needed few repeats of each domain. Advise: Read multiple authors. Try to understand and build your own practical examples. This will widen your understanding rather than just sticking to 1 Author. Note that you need to know the basics. Its okay to remember stuffs but I felt my exam was completely on concepts &amp; just remembering the content would not have helped. 4. Created a small group of CISSP aspirants from my team. This was the best platform to ask questions, understand from them &amp; share content. We discussed scenario-based questions and answers together. 5. In last month I recapped each topic based on CISSP exam outline. Referred other online videos wherever I needed better understanding. 6. On daily basis I was solving questions. a. Started with Official Practice test (7/10) b. Pocketprep for quick recaps (5/10) c. Pearson Practise tests (8/10) d. Boson Tests ExSim-Max CISSP (8/10) e. Comprehensive questions from Shon Harris (9/10) f. Practice Exam Book from Shon Harris (9/10) 7. I did a quick recap in last week from 11thHour Book ( 7/10), The Memory Place from Prashanth Mohan ( 8/10), Sunflower &amp; Netwrix Guide( 7/10) along with Prabh Nair CISSP Useful Link. Exam experience: 90% of exam was from familiar topics but nowhere like practice tests. This is where basics &amp; concepts helped to answer. There were moments where I felt its not going to work this time and probably, I need to come again. But in the end, it all went well. Summary: Exam is a roller coaster ride but the end is so relieving. Read as much as you can, practice test is going to help you to get familiar with question formats &amp; understanding of terms (MOST, LEAST, BEST, NOT etc) in selecting correct answer. Do not try to remember those answers but focus on why that is best answer. Thank you all for your guidance when I needed. Best wishes to those are going to write the exam."

34,vulnerability,cissp,Provisionally Passed (150 Questions),1,fj5rib,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/fj5rib/provisionally_passed_150_questions/,2020-03-16 05:19:58,"I am definitely grateful to be on this side where Ive passed the exam and can provide as much information as possible for other individuals. One of the main takeaways Ive gathered from my CISSP journey is rather simple  understand what is being asked. Larry Greenblatt (with a sprinkle of Kelly Handerhan here and there) was EXTREMELY helpful in thisI will expand later. Sources Used: Sybex 8Th Edition (9/10): Great starter source of information; though its a ton of information, this should be the foundational source. Once I finished going through this book and made necessary notes/highlights, I would use the 8th edition as reference material. I completed all practice questions and made note of the ones/subjects I got wrong. CISSP Study Guide by Eric Conrad (9/10): I would say this book was a bit more condensed than the 8th Edition; much easier/shorter read that helps to hone-in on the concepts and topics covered. I completed all practice questions and made note of the ones/subjects I got wrong. 11th Hour (9/10) I used this text during my final 3 weeks leading up to the exam. I find that this book was critical because it ultimately forced me to really understand whether I grasped each topic within the book (hence the fact that this book was not nearly as detailed at the other books Ive used). If I couldnt explain the topics/use cases well enough, then I would consult the other two texts for confirmation. Wordscapes (10/10): Yes, for some reason I was compelled to download this app as a way to expand my vocabulary. WeirdI knowbut I think this helped me during my journey. Plus, it gave me an excuse to get away from ""distractor apps"" like Instagram and Facebook. Boson Exams (7/10): This engine was helpful to see questions like most/least/best/worst etc, but was WAY too technical and dove in too deep into the weeds. The exam wasnt nearly as technical as boson. The answer explanations were pretty good though. Reddit (11/10): Being a stalker of this discord allowed me to fill in gaps and understand what was useful vs non-useful. Kelly Handerhand (11/10) Why you will Pass: I would find myself watching/listening to this video here and there to drill in her main ideas regarding this exam. After a while, I began to realize that the Sybex questions/test bank and other sample questions were not good enough. Larry Greenblatts one-on-one half-day training (12/10): I personally believe if I didnt take advantage of his training a few days before my exam, I would have failed for the 3rd time. Hes incredible to say the least (will explain more later). This was my third time taking the exam. First time I assumed I was ready after a week-long bootcamp, going through the Sybex 8th Edition, and somehow not knowing about the CISSP Reddit page  HUGE MISTAKE. Very nave choice. The second time taking the exam, I thought I was a bit more prepared but it was tough for me because my wife got really sick and I wasnt able to reschedule the exam. So I ultimately forced myself anyway; I couldnt focus properly and ultimately failed again. Things happen. To be completely honest, once I failed for the second time I struggled to find the energy and determination to go through this again. During a month break after the second failure, I purposely tried to forget about my failed attempts, and just cleared my mind of the stress. I told myself that I would go back in with a more calm but focused mindset but make it more fun. When I jumped back into the study journey, I studied with the intent of trying to figure out how things worked and whynot just memorizing concepts in order to pass an exam. This made the study process a bit less stressful. I went through the Sybex book and studied on average of 2 hours per day and did about 30 practice questions each day. My study habits were 3 days on, two days off  I found this allowed me to retain the information and allow my brain to rest/grow (almost like going to the gym haha). I was able to jump back in with a clear mindset and little to no mental fatigue. Weirdly enough, the Wordspaces app helped me a lot. Though I have over 10 years of general IT experience, Im not much of a reader so this held me back a bit. Wordscapes exercised my mind in ways to recognize various words that I might not see often which would lead me to figure out what these words meant and how they can be applied. This was really helpful for the exam because it seemed as if ISC\^2 purposely used different wording than what you may see in texts and other content. Fast forward a few weeks, I went through all of the study materials with a general understanding the content. When I would answer the practice questions getting an average of 85% correct, I knew I was closer to being ready. With that said, however, I only possessed foundational knowledge of the CISSP content. In other words, I could tell you what certain terms/technologies meant and when to apply them, BUT I didnt really have a high-level understanding of the Why and the ultimate Endgame. This is where Larry Greenblatt tied everything together for me to get the big picture. Larry Greenblatt offers 4-hour one-on-one trainings where he gives you 100 test questions prior to the virtual meetings where you must answer. Youre welcomed to use any source, including Wikipedia, to answer the multiple choice questions. Its amazing the wealth of knowledge Larry has, and his capability to explain things in a way that ensure you can understand and RETAIN concepts in a more effective manner (his real world examples are priceless). Oddly enough, I correctly answered (maybe) 30 questions out of 100 (crazy, I know lol he went on to say that many of his students get a lot of his questions incorrect but still go on to pass; that says a lot to me). His questions were very unique and thought-provoking  I would consider them rather close to the actual CISSP exam. My test has a mix of questions ranging from vague/technical/specific/to questions that involved things Ive never seen before. I would say the first 25-30 questions I said to myself wtf is this? Once I got through those, I would see things that were very familiar and was confident in eliminating two answers. There were times when I got questions that were amazingly easy and others were pretty difficult and required me to really re-read the questions/answers multiple times to really figure out whats going on. SDLC was a heavy hitter for my exam, probably because I got these questions mostly incorrect throughout (could be another reason why my test went to 150 questions?). Knowing what takes place during each of the SDLC stages was very helpful as well as what occurs before or after a certain ""scenario"". What is the question really asking? Who would really care about whats going on in this scenario? THINK BEFORE YOU ACT!!! I cant stress this part enough. It may seem that a bulk of the questions want you to enforce strong encryption or to get down in the weeds and fix something. Be carefulmany times Ive gotten questions where three out of the four answers were long-winded technical solutions then a lone non-technical answer such as assess results of a structured audit or conduct vulnerability analysis or ""look at this document and see"". In some ways, I leaned towards the non-technical answer. Somewhat reminds me of the ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" principle. Engaging in processes/tasks that helps you detect problems early in the process can allow for better decision making later. Whenever you want to prevent a problem, you must have things in place that would detect that problem first. Read like a lawyer, think like an IT technician, respond like a manager (this may be a slight variance from what Ive seen other places). Compartmentalization implements need to know while multi-level implements least privilege. Understand Statement of work vs rules of engagement; SOW outlines what work will be done, whereas rules of engagement states what wont be done. Governance sets directions; management ensure you go where you need to go. Audits helps to identify gaps; certification ensures compliance; Accreditation = Assurance = Attestation A lot of what I said can be deemed as high-level, but this is what I learned from Larry Greenblatt  this created a top-down perspective to really have an understanding of how to answer the questions. I will probably engage in a similar process when studying for my next certification (maybe CCSP), and definitely utilize Larry to tie things together and make sure I can apply the same principles from here forward."

I'm wondering about proving my work experience for the CISSP if I don' have an endorser. While my most recent job would be no issue and covers 2+ years of experience w Okta, Box, and 365 security, Sophos Central, Unitrends backup... I worked for 8 years at another job (bulk of my career) where I accumulated vast experience but left on very bad terms. I have serious doubts they will vouch for the details of the work I did there as both a systems admin and IT Supervisor. The work included AD user management, data management (access control), backup administration (Symantec) and the labeling/rotation of backup tapes to the bank vault, WSUS and patch management of servers, internal server and application vulnerability testing (Nexpose), RSA (MFA) implementation and management, email security and spam reduction (Exchange and ORF), physical security management (badging system to control access to areas of building and times of permitted access), anti-virus management (McAfee ePO)... I even crafted their Cybersecurity, Risk Management and Incident Response Plans... But as I said I left on very bad terms. While I can still reach my original hiring manager and he'd probably help, the company itself I have serious doubts. How might I deal with a situation wherein the company refuses to validate anything beyond verifying my employment there (if that)? Thanks in advance, appreciate any advice."

How deep I need to study for the CISSP, Specially for - 1. Security and Risk Management 2. Security Operations 3. Software Development Security 4. Security Architecture and Engineering 2. Should I stick with the Official study guide only or something else? 3. Is it enough to practice Boson simulator only along with Official Practice test book? 4. Can foresee any challenge to get the endorsement from ISC after passing the exam? I will really appreciate any comments on my queries."
37,vulnerability,cissp,MTD and RTO Question (in practice),1,f2ng66,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/f2ng66/mtd_and_rto_question_in_practice/,2020-02-12 18:16:15,"Hi guys, I have a more practical question just to understand the BIA (and follow up tasks) a bit better. Lets say we have completed the BIA. (before we are to put the BCP in place). At some point during our assessment we determine the MTD and RTO. The outcome of this assessment indicated that the MTD is less than the RTO for a specific system/business process. Does this mean that another process (and herein my question) kicks off to first remediate this 'vulnerability' before the BCP can be put in place, or does the BCP address this as part of the implementation phase. In other words, as part of my risk analysis / BIA process I detect a business process that is critical. The MTD is 2 hrs (as set by dept representative in the BIA), but in reality the RTO is 3 hours, resulting in a situation where it will take longer (by the technical staff) to recover the process / service than what is expected from the business (MTD). Some remediation/countermeasure to the problem could be to introduce a mitigating action by means of some form of redundancy or hot standby (as an example) to reduce the RTO effectively. My question is, at what point in BCP would allow for the 'remediation' of this scenario (ultimately to make sure the RTO is less than the MTD) Unless I am not understanding concepts completely, some assistance would be greatly appreciated."

The test I just took had zero content on ISO, NIST publications or frameworks. Only one question on Bell Lepadula. And that one was really just about MAC. No questions on cryptography, encryption algorithms, PKI, OSI/TCP models. Many questions on SDLC and vulnerability management. All of my questions were more about determining the best course of action to take in a certain situation vs verifying knowledge. Only one or two on ports, protocols, IDSs, etc which of course is my history - Network Security. I was a support agent for enterprise firewall, IDS/IPS and many related technologies for 12 years. Now I deal with PKI, and access control as well as some SDLC. Study materials: Humanelement Security online boot camp. Includes the Shon Harris materials 8th Edition as well as online test engine and flash cards. Also used ETE test engine.

42,vulnerability,cissp,Passed @ 100q with 40min left.,1,eb40ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/eb40ij/passed_100q_with_40min_left/,2019-12-16 07:17:20,"Just wanted to thank everyone here for their contributions and hopefully contribute something new and of value to the community. I booked the test 2 months before I began studying. I took a preliminary test as a baseline in Boson (random) and my first Boson score was 60%. Right before the test my Boson score was 98%. I would say that my main study material used was Boson. My background is about 10 years of IT experience in network and security. No auditing experience and only amateur coding experience. I am not well educated and what you would most likely refer to as self taught. Prior to the CISSP I held a CCNP and several certs from a firewall vendor. Materials used: -Kelly videos -Boson -CISSP official iPhone apps -Sybex 8th edition -11th hour -Youtube -Various sources such as NIST, OWASP, ISC2 official forum My opinion of the test is that (as others have said) english comprehension, experience and preparation are the key to passing. It is also not as scary as people make it sound. Yes, there are several difficult question but at least 45% of the test will consist of easy answers which you can decide in seconds and hit next. As you can tell from my time at passing if I did not finish at 100 I would most likely have failed. This was a mistake on my part. I was so afraid of the horror stories I see on this board regarding how difficult it was and how the first 10 questions would be the most important that i became overly cautions with answering each question. I would write down the important aspects of each question and reread each question 3 or 4 times and the answers before making a decision. The odd thing is that some of the questions were so easy that I was afraid that I was being tricked somehow so this caused hesitation with selecting the question. When I would reach a difficult question where anyone of the 4 could have been correct I would try to apply the ISC2 test tips posted here. This is what I did to prepare for the test: 1. I focused on Boson from the the first to the last day. Not only did I focus on improving my score but towards the final weeks I started to copy down all of the explanations for each question. It is not enough to know the right answer you must understand why the others are wrong. The key here is that the exact Boson question wont appear on the test but you may be asked a question related to one of the wrong answers. 2. I am a visual learner so I created my own drag and drops. I was having a hard time retaining information from reading the book. For me to retain info I would usually take notes on each paragraph while reading but I figured this would take a lot of time with the amount of material required. I realized that if I made a game out of the information on drawings.google.com it would allow me retain the info in a shorter period of time. I highly recommend this if you are trying to learn all of the steps of the SDLC, BCP, Cryptography types, Laws, etc. This was a huge a help and a huge confidence builder. Ex: URL 3. The iPhone apps. I used these heavily. They have great 10 question quick tests you can do whenever you have a free min. They aren't perfect but they are a great resource to keep yourself in the game and give you a bank of questions that are different from the Boson questions. Before taking the test I was scoring in the 80s on these as opposed to 90s on Boson. 4. I used the book as a reference and read the chapters on topics that I struggled to grasp the most. The Sybex did turn out to be valuable in the end as 1 question that I received on the test seemed to be straight out of the book. I was able to recall this answer only because of the book. If I had failed my plan was to read to the book thoroughly before retesting. 5. Questions that are most like the questions on the test can be found here: URL . This was a wonderful resource for me right before taking the test. I have curated all of the questions and answer and will provide them below. Good luck to all. &gt; CISSP test tips &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; URL &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; Which of the following is a key element during the initial security planning process? &gt; &gt; a. Establish system review time frames &gt; b. Implement a security awareness program &gt; c. Defining reporting relationships &gt; d. Institute a change management program &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: c &gt; Reference: Handbook of Information Security Management, edited by Ruthberg and Tipton, Auerbach, 1993, pg 75 &gt; &gt; Right, a few initial notes. You will notice a reference. Every exam question is (or was) backed up by at least two references from source security literature. Note that CISSP study guides are not source security literature. &gt; &gt; A key word in this question is ""initial."" Establishing system review time frames, security awareness programs, and change management programs are all important, but they come later in security planning. &gt; &gt; Note also one rather important point. All of these answers are ""correct"" in a way. If you are confronted with four ""right"" answers, and one of them is the ""management"" answer, that one is probably the one that will get you the point. Defining reporting relationships is both something you want to establish early in planning, and it's also the ""management"" answer. (One person I helped coach through the exam said that this one tip applied to about 10% of the total exam.) &gt; &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Which of the following is NOT an element of a security planning mission statement? &gt; &gt; a. Objectives statement &gt; b. Background statement &gt; c. Scope statement &gt; d. Confidentiality statement &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: d &gt; Reference: Handbook of Information Security Management, edited by Ruthberg and Tipton, Auerbach, 1993, page 73 &gt; &gt; This is the type of question that ensures you do not just memorize a bunch of security buzzwords. You have to understand the concepts behind them. What is a ""security planning mission statement""? Well, it's more simply known as a policy. What does a policy contain? Among other things, the background of your enterprise, your objectives, and the scope of what you are trying to protect. What you are going to do about confidentiality (unless you are an unusual company and either don't care about confidentiality, or it's really, really important) generally is in your subordinate standards or procedures. &gt; &gt; Don't get hung up on whether the question has exactly the wording you have studied. That way lies failure. Make sure you understand the fundamentals behind the words. &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; URL &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; In data processing systems, the value analysis should be performed in terms of which three properties? &gt; &gt; a. Profit, loss, ROI &gt; b. Intentional, accidental, natural disaster &gt; c. Assets, personnel, services provided &gt; d. Availability, integrity, confidentiality &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: d. &gt; Reference: Information Systems Security; Fites &amp; Kratz; Thompson Press; 1996; pg 54. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, in a sense this is kind of a trick question, for a couple of reasons. But it does have a point. The point is, choose the answer with the greatest breadth and application that does answer the question. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer a - incorrect - it's right, but applies only to business management. &gt; Answer b - incorrect - it's right, but applies directly to threat analysis. &gt; Answer c - incorrect - it's right, but considered mostly in business impact analysis. &gt; &gt; &gt; (There is a myth that says that if you see the CIA triad [confidentiality, integrity, availability] as an answer on any question on the CISSP exam, that is the correct answer. In fact, a friend, knowing of the myth, once specifically wrote a question so that CIA was wrong ... :-) &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Which of the following techniques MOST clearly indicates whether specific risk reduction controls should be implemented? &gt; &gt; a. Threat and vulnerability analysis. &gt; b. Risk evaluation. &gt; c. ALE calculation. &gt; d. Countermeasure cost/benefit analysis. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: d. &gt; &gt; &gt; Reference: Computer Security Handbook (3rd edition) Hutt, Boswirth, Hoyt; pg 3.3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A fairly simple question: it should be fairly obvious. Again, the principle here is to choose the answer that most broadly answers the question. All the answers are important parts of security and risk assessment, but: &gt; Answer a - this analysis does not address whether specific countermeasures should be implemented. &gt; Answer b - risk evaluation studies existing risks but doesnt address whether specific countermeasures should be implemented. &gt; Answer c - ALE is the calculation of loss expectancy but does not address whether specific countermeasures should be implemented. &gt; Answer d - correct - in a countermeasures cost/benefit analysis, the annualized cost of safeguards is compared with the expected cost of loss. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, one more point: if you saw this question on an exam these days, it should be reworded slightly. Acronyms in questions are now supposed to be spelled out in full. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Prior to implementation, a complete description of an operational security issue should specify threat, vulnerability, and &gt; &gt; a. safeguard. &gt; b. asset. &gt; c. exposure. &gt; d. control. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: b. &gt; &gt; (Reference: Fitzgerald, Jerry, Internal Controls for Computerized Systems, 1978, pg 7) &gt; &gt; This isn't really a type of question, as such, it's just one that a surprising number of people get wrong. We tend to concentrate on ""problems"" and forget what it is that we are trying to protect. Don't get that (or any other kind) of tunnel vision. &gt; &gt; Which, I suppose, is as good a segue as any to another point. Remember that the CISSP is a general, and even international, certification. When presented with a question, don't pick an answer that is specifically suited to your job or company: pick the answer that is most suited to security in general. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; What step can a company take to reduce the risk of its employees violating software copyright laws? &gt; &gt; a. Remove copy programs from personal computers. &gt; b. Install application licensing meters to prevent an excess of users for each license. &gt; c. Establish a company policy prohibiting the unauthorized duplicating of software. &gt; d. Prohibit the use of software on multiple computers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: c. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is another question that lots and lots of people get wrong. But, by this time, you should get it right because it illustrates points already made. &gt; Answer a - wrong - Well, it's possible, and might work, but it's not really practical, is it? Copying is a basic function of computers: users have a need to copy files. Besides, even if you took it off, people could put it back. &gt; Answer b - wrong - A meter notes and possibly alerts you to the use of software beyond the number of licensed copies. It may or may not prevent copying. It would help, but it is not a complete solution. &gt; Answer c - correct - The policy doesnt prevent copying, but does reduce the liability risk if employees are caught making illegal copies. (And that's the real risk in violating copyright, yes?) And it means you can fire them if they do. (If there's no policy against it, what did they do that was wrong?) &gt; Answer d - wrong - It's kind of impractical because more than one user may need to use the program. I mean, really ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and remember that earlier point about the management answer being the right one? &gt; &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Who is ultimately responsible to ensure that information is categorized and that specific protective measures are taken? &gt; &gt; a. Security Officer &gt; b. Senior Management &gt; c. Data Owner &gt; d. Custodian &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: b. &gt; Reference: Commonsense Computer Security; Martin Smith; 1993; pg 63. &gt; &gt; This is possibly as close to a ""trick"" question that you'll get on the exam. If you are just skimming the question, and the answers, the fact that the data owner is generally responsible for assigning data classification is going to jump out at you. Again, read the whole question. The key word here is ""ultimately."" ""Ultimately,"" senior management is responsible for everything. The security officer may play some role in data classification, but unless you work in a MAC (Mandatory Access Control) environment won't be the one making individual decisions. And the custodian just acts on behalf of the owner. &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; URL &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; Which one of the following is NOT a goal of the change control management process? &gt; &gt; a. Ensure changes are authorized. &gt; b. Ensure coherence of changes. &gt; c. Ensure changes are documented. &gt; d. Ensure correctness of changes. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: b &gt; Reference: Fites and Kratz, Information Systems Security: A Practitioners Reference, International Thompson Computer Press, 1996, 1996, pg 321 &gt; &gt; Change control management should ensure that all changes are authorized, documented, and correct. What the heck are ""coherent"" changes? OK, you could argue that changes should be coherent with policies, other parts of the system, or some other factor, but you know that changes are supposed to be authorized, documented, and correct, so why try and make something you don't know fit? &gt; &gt; Which brings up a point that trips up a lot of people in a lot of ways: just because you don't know it, doesn't make it the right answer. &gt; &gt; I don't know why this is so important, but it is. Maybe most of us lack self-confidence, and automatically assume that if we don't understand it, it must be something important that we've missed. However, if you really are a security professional, most of the time that's wrong. &gt; &gt; Which brings up another important point: most of the time, the right answer is going to jump out at you. Very often, your first response is the right one. Don't ""overthink"" yourself into a wrong answer. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Which of the following actions should management take when classified information must be made available to different user populations? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Increase security controls on the information. &gt; b. Raise the classification label to the next highest level. &gt; c. Disburse the information to multiple local area network servers. &gt; d. Require specific approval each time the information is accessed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answer: a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a case of read the question carefully, and read all the answers carefully. Note that increasing security controls doesn't necessarily mean just making the controls more stringent. It can also refer to increasing aspects like granularity, which is probably what is wanted here. &gt; &gt; Raising classification to a higher level doesn't help with disparate populations. Distributing files to other servers probably won't help with this problem at all. Requiring specific approval might work, but would be very time consuming. &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; URL &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; The PRIMARY difference between the TCSEC and ITSEC data classifications is: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. ITSEC classifications are based on integrity &gt; b. TCSEC classifications are based on government requirements &gt; c. ITSEC classifications are based on international requirements &gt; d. TCSEC classifications are based on mandatory requirements &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answer: a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've never seen a reference for this question, although I assume there must be one, somewhere. This is the type of question that proves that, no, you can't just get the right book and have all the answers. You have to understand that, although TCSEC is based on government requirements, and ITSEC is based on international input, and TCSEC does talk (at some levels) about mandatory (as opposed to discretionary) requirements, that the addition of integrity is a fundamental change over TCSEC (which was only concerned with confidentiality). You have to understand the concepts, and the implications. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; What is the PRIMARY use of a password? &gt; &gt; a. Allow access to files. &gt; b. Identify the user. &gt; c. Authenticate the user. &gt; d. Segregate various users accesses. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: c. &gt; Reference: Info Systems Security; Fites &amp; Kratz; pg 4; 1.2.4 &gt; &gt; &gt; Some of the easier questions you'll face allow you to quickly eliminate a couple of the options. In this case, while file access and other types of access are going to be related to a login process, they clearly aren't primary. That leaves you with two fairly similar options: identifying and authenticating the user. At this point you should be a little careful, and remember that identification is the function of the username. The password is used for authentication. &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; URL &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; &gt; An Access Control List (ACL) represents a set of subjects by using which of the following constructs? &gt; &gt; a. Group &gt; b. Capability &gt; c. Key &gt; d. Domain &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: a. &gt; Reference: Fites &amp; Kratz, pg 149 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can easily drop the key and domain answers here. You might be a bit confused by the group and capability options. Again, this is an example of ""if you don't know it, it isn't necessarily the right answer."" ACLs almost always have options for groups, even if that isn't always the primary use. Capability? Well, that's kind of related. It's an older term for what might now be described as an authorization that is digitally signed. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Which of the following is the LEAST important information to record when logging a security violation? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Users name &gt; b. Userid &gt; c. Type of violation &gt; d. Date and time of the violation &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, an easy one for you today. Just remember that the usere's name generally isn't known from direct evidence, but inferred from the userid. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; What determines the assignment of data classifications in a mandatory access control philosophy? &gt; &gt; a. The analysis of the users in conjunction with the audit department. &gt; b. The assessment by the information security department. &gt; c. The stewards evaluation of the particular information element. &gt; d. The requirement of the organizations published security policy. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: d. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reference: Computer Security Basics; Russell &amp; Gangemi; pg 72-74 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While analysis by users, the audit department, the infosec office, and possibly a steward have places or responsibilities for access control, determination is at the direction of policy. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; What role does biometrics have in logical access control? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Identification &gt; b. Authorization &gt; c. Authentication &gt; d. Confirmation &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: c. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reference: Computer Security Basics; Russell &amp; Gangemi; pg 57-58. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, I know that there is going to be discussion on this one. Authorization and confirmation are out, of course, but there are instances where biometrics are going to be used for identification (sometimes paired with authentication). The principle to keep in mind here is: don't fight the exam. The point is not to prove that you can come up with a counterexample, the point is what are most security professionals going to say. And most security professionals are going to agree that the most important and significant role biometrics plays is in authentication. After all, biometrics is the ""something you are"" that is the third pillar of authentication besides something you know and something you have. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Which of the following procedures could BEST be utilized to validate the continued need for privileged user access to system resources? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Periodic review and recertification of privileged usercodes. &gt; b. Periodic review of audit logs. &gt; c. Revoke processes which can grant access to sensitive files. &gt; d. Periodic review of data classifications by management. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: a. &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, this is one case where sticking to the ""management answer"" heuristic will get you into trouble. The correct, and pretty complete, answer is that periodic review and recertification of privileged usercodes will will verify the continued need for privileged access. Remember, the best answer is one that completely (or as completely as possible) answers the question. Option ""a"" does. &gt; &gt; &gt; Review of audit logs may not indicate privileged access and doesnt validate the need for such access. Revoking processes which can grant access to sensitive information may (probably will) be disruptive to ongoing operations. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer ""d"" looks like the management answer, but remember: review of data classifications does not address the privileges assigned to individual users, so it actually doesn't really answer the question. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; What is the BEST method of storing user passwords for a system? &gt; &gt; a. Password-protected file. &gt; b. File restricted to one individual. &gt; c. One-way encrypted file. &gt; d. Two-way encrypted file. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: c. &gt; Reference: Computer Security Basics; Russell &amp; Gangemi; pg 65-66. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A password protected file could leave the passwords in the file in clear text so that anyone with the password could see all users passwords, making it impossible to hold users accountable for what happens under their ID. &gt; The file restricted to one individual has the same problem as a. &gt; Answer c - One-way encryption means that the password file is never decrypted, therefore, only the user knows the password (and hackers that use a dictionary attack, but nobody's perfect). &gt; What is ""two-way encryption""? As I keep telling you, just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's the right answer! &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; What is the purpose of a ticket-oriented security mechanism? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Permits the subjects access to objects &gt; b. Assigns access modes to objects &gt; c. Grants subjects discretionary control &gt; d. Assures user access accountability &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: a. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reference: Handbook of Information Security Management; Ruthberg &amp; Tipton; pg 538-539. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could say that this is an example of all the answers being correct. However, the answer that most completely answers the question asked is the most correct, and therefore the answer that will get you that point. Answer a may seem a bit broad: after all, that's the purpose of any access control mechanism, and doesn't differentiate a ticket-oriented system from any other. But that's the most correct. Since no other answer (that you're given) distinguishes a ticket-oriented system from any other, ""ticket-oriented"" is irrelevant. &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; Which of the following is a rule-based control mechanism? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Discretionary Access Control &gt; b. Task-based Access Control &gt; c. Subject-based Access Control &gt; d. Token-based Access Control &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: a. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reference: Handbook of Info. Sys. Sec.; Ruthberg &amp; Tipton; pg 517. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Discussion: &gt; &gt; Answer a - some access control systems contain rules that are used to determine whether or not an individual can achieve the access requested. This is particularly true for discretionary access control. Remember your ACL (Access Control List)? A list of rules, right? &gt; &gt; &gt; For those wanting to answer b, c, or d, remember that if you don't know what it is, that doesn't mean it's the right answer.

This is one of the few cases where your first reaction might be wrong, since you probably triggered on the word ""password"" in the question. But remember that a ""one-time"" password is not the same as a static password. The one-time password generator in this case might be a token. Or, in some cases, it might be a list of one-time passwords that are crossed off or discarded after use. In either case, something you have. &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer a - Something you are is biometrics. &gt; Answer b - Something you have which in this case would be the token generating the password or a list. &gt; Answer c - Something you calculate is not one of the 3 authentication factors. &gt; Answer d - Something you know is a static password, not a one-time password. &gt; &gt; ################################################################################ &gt; &gt; The type of penetration testing used to discover whether numerous usercode/password combinations can be attempted without detection is called &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. keystroke capturing &gt; b. access validation testing &gt; c. brute force testing &gt; d. accountability testing &gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: c. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reference: Intrusion Detection; Terry Escamilla; pg 44-47. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, maybe you think that brute force testing is not penetration testing, but rather cryptology. That's a classic case of ""fighting the question."" It isn't going to get you any points. It also doesn't demonstrate that you know what using various inputs to gain access is called: brute force testing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, none of the other answers fit at all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Keystroke capturing, captures the information being entered so no guessing is involved.

Is it strictly based on name of your role, or maybe what was your primary focus? Because I've held a few roles dealing with security but weren't titled security anything. Basically my positions have been a sys admin where security was part of the job description, securing network access, file encryption, system patching, etc...and then I've had other sys admin positions where my official title is still sys admin but my role on our team was running the vulnerability scanners. Each time this was also working with the DoD so of course security is always involved when it comes to that type of data. Mainly wondering how in-depth ISC goes and how exactly they do it.

45,vulnerability,cissp,Provisionally passed CISSP! - 100 questions / 80 minutes,1,e3qie9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/e3qie9/provisionally_passed_cissp_100_questions_80/,2019-11-30 15:16:23,"**Summary** Wow. Such a relief to finally say I passed the CISSP exam first attempt... I took the test four days ago on Monday, 11/25; I just finally got around to making this post. I felt I had to give back to such an awesome community. I probably wouldn't have passed if it wasn't for all the takeaways I've gathered the last 5-6 months from this reddit page. As the title says, I passed at 100Q with just about 100 minutes left. Like many others can attest too, I felt like I was failing the whole time. I was 100% confident with only 5-10 questions; The rest of them I would get down to 2 very close answers which I had to really think about. I had to guess at a few. All in all, This test is HARD. The whole mindset thing is 100% true. You have to really understand the points Kelly H is making. You have to know your materials. You have to understand processes and frameworks. You have to take the time to study, layout a plan and truly commit. This exam is very much a managerial exam but do not underestimate the technical aspect. I came across some pretty technical questions in my experience (which I was actually happy about as they were easy wins for me). I felt like my exam was a little heavy in the software dev security domain. I also remember seeing quite a few questions on BCP/DRP, cloud, and communication security. &amp;#x200B; **My background** 26 years old, IT bachelors degree, CEH, been working in the field for just about 3 years now (applied to be an associate of ISC2). Studying infosec for 5-6 years, working for 3. Worked in vulnerability management, threat intel, and SIEM administration. Would consider myself a technical individual but not at all an expert. &amp;#x200B; **Study Resources Used** * Global Knowledge Bootcamp - **8/10** * Sybex Official Study Guide - **8/10** * Sybex Practice Exams - **5/10** * 11th Hour CISSP - **10/10** * Boson - **10/10** * Sunflower PDF - **7/10** * Memory Palace PDF - **10/10** * Phil Martin Essential CISSP Audible - **5/10** * Kelly H Cybrary MP3 files - **10/10** * This Reddit community - **100/10** **Study Approach** Studied around 120 hours total. Took a week long bootcamp (at my employer's expense) in June of this year, which kicked off the studying for me. The bootcamp was based on the Sybex Official Study Guide and in my opinion was pretty good. I always like a face to face course. Basically took off from studying all of July, with maybe an hour or two total of reading Sybex materials. Started back up in August. I only studied on the weekends for about an hour or two. I also started listening to the Phil martin audible (at 1.5x) or Kelly H Cybrary MP3's during my commute to work. I drive about 1.5 hours each way, 2-3 days a week. Kelly's was much better as Phil's voice just kind of put me to sleep. I started to commit to studying a little bit more in September but still didn't really buckle down yet. I would spend about an hour a few nights a week after work reviewing my notes from the bootcamp and reading the Sybex book. I also purchased Boson this month and took my first practice exam - which I scored in the 60s on. In October, I got more serious. I booked my exam in the beginning of this month. I would study a few hours every weekend and a few nights during the week again. I would really still only study about an hour per session during the week though. November - studied just about every day leading up to the 25th. I took all 5 Boson exams this month, each in simulation mode. By the end, I was scoring in the 80's (however, I was starting to remember answers). I started studying around 2-3 hours per session. I wrote a lot of stuff down in a notebook just because thats my style of learning. Sometimes i'd spend 10-20 minutes just writing stuff down in my head about any of the materials, just to see what I could remember. I took off from work that Thursday and Friday before my exam. I studied 5 hours Thursday, 5 hours Friday, and 3 hours Saturday. Took off Sunday. Reviewed some notes Monday morning, watched the Kelly H video for about the 15th time, and off I went. Leading up to the exam, I was feeling really solid on all of the materials. Make sure you take all the time you need to really understand everything. This exam is pretty insane. &amp;#x200B; Good luck to everyone!!!!"

I wasn't sure how ready I was but I had the money and just wanted to take a crack at it! I was pretty close because it said I was above in 3, near in 3 and below in 2. I don't remember which ones I lost my test result paper. I ran out of time to the point I had to speed read and select the best answer in seconds as opposed to minutes for the last 50. So I doubled down and studied harder and scheduled the exam again that October. The second time was way harder. The questions didn't seem like anything I studied for. To make it worse I had kind of a medical episode where I lost my vision. It was at about 100 questions in where my Vision went completely blurry and I couldn't read what was on the screen. So I basically guessed the last 50 questions running out of time and not able to see. I did make it to 150. I still have the resulting paper for that and it was below in the first 4 and near in the last 4. Study methods and materials are all the usual. I took a year-long Cybersecurity certificate at UW, I took Larry Greenblatt's paid week-long course, I did Kelly Handerhand and Thor teaches as well. I have read the 7th edition Sybex twice and 11th hour once. Currently I'm re watching Kelly and Larry and reading 11th hour and Sybex 8th edition. Oh yeah, I used the Sybex and CCCure the first two times. I have Boson for this go around. I do feel like this time around concepts are sticking a lot better and things make more sense. Well, see! I have it scheduled two weeks out but I have a lot of distractions/Life that is happening right now so I might reschedule for December to make sure I can properly review the entire CBK. One thing about this test is I feel that even if it was open book and they said sure take the Sybex book right on in and have a seat it wouldn't matter. BTW. I have 20 years in IT. Mostly SMS/SCCM patching and vulnerability remediation. My advice is don't give up! &amp;#x200B; My question is how did it go for other 3rd timers out there? &amp;#x200B; Thanks!"

Not necessarily directly in cybersecurity though. In the last 10 years, I've been a combination of technical and cybersecurity, working on security controls, vulnerability scanning/remediation, and accreditation package-type work. The official ISC(2) iOS study apps are almost too easy. Score high 90% pretty much always. This isn't to brag. I've been reading pass/fail stories here and it just seems I must be missing something. I understand this is a test that tests one's understanding of the concepts of the technology -- requiring answers from the perspective of a manager. Is there some hidden thing I'm completely overlooking? Other certs like CYSA+ you just grab their CertMaster and you know you've got everything needed to pass. Apparently not so with CISSP. :)"

(Hard work or Luck - always debate point but i will select little Luck factor also though i trust in hard work) \*\*\*\*\* 1) 40% book (ISC2 or Shon Harris) / Notes / Boson / Tester any material must read to get concepts. e.g. What is risk / How Vulnerability and patching related / How threat and risk connect each other. Try to connect processes as much as possible. 2) 40% Experience - There is no doubt that if you have experience then it will help you lot. In book some points are not there at all (means explanation straightly) But dont worry New birds (Below 10 years exp) - Surf Internet while studying as much as possible. - Specifically for new technologies and dont read as engineer (dont fix technology) but as manager from contract, Policy, Risk etc. Old Buddies (11 or 15+ Exp people) You have unique challenge that you either forgot or know half things - So fill that gap. Above Internet point applicable to all. e.g. In Cloud if data lost then what? New buddy say I will put DLP, FW etc - Old Buddy say I will check legal requirement and Exam answer mention nothing from above :) Sometime answer dont say best or worst thing then you have to read what is second worst and what second best Good option also. 3) 20% Luck (Accept this Risk) - That is reason 25 questions no marks. You will 110% face situation in 3 hour exam you might not have time to read long answers or all answers look like same so pray god and select. I did for more than 10 questions and most all face this so dont frustrate around this. 4) Overall English command is good to have. but not mandatory. \*\*\*\*\* Strategy Followed \*\*\*\*\* 1) 1 or 1.5 minute to read question and then read 4 answers and then apply all logic and select (best, worst) answer. Further you have to read question again sometimes. During Boson test - this is not really working for me if you follow same situation then focus more on key words. (E.g. Copyright - Expression, Literacy, WIPO etc) It will help you to eliminate answers. Remember nearly 60% time you will easily eliminate two answers and its not possible if you dont know concept or Key words. 2) Reading strategy and Exam strategy make two different things. \- Reading try different reference materials as much as possible and focus on Internet. This is not your school exam where you have one reference book and exam will also from same book. Even you memorize entire Shon Harris and ISC2 will not work that is reason test yourself - 1 or 1.5 minutes can i answer? - Do as much as Q&amp;A (3000 - 5000 is good practice) Practice make everyone perfect (Gender equality) 3) People suggest that book your exam first - I have below view \- If you have time and early bird in career then you can do it. Reason you read some concepts in university which you can apply (e.g. Software development - for me its 20 years back i read OOPS / DB concept and working in different stream now) \- If you are focus with knowledge and specifically people who dont have time / travel a lot then complete Reading and Test and then get little confidence and only look for date otherwise you will come into situation of frustration and reschedule. Dont be hurry also you have to do 8+ hours of work at office :) \* You are best decider balance between confidence and timeline and your priorities. \*\*\*\*\* Something happens with most of people: \*\*\*\*\* 1) You read 100 books and 10000 of Internet pages but you will be never ready that is reason read again my 1 to 3 observations. You have to solid with your concepts. Don't go deep in technology but focus on Threat , Risk , Process connection etc. (Exam will not ask 99.999% how RSA algo works) 2) People generally asked = In Boson getting 60% - 70% - 90% is this good or bad - 90% in Boson can fail also and 50% in exam can pass also so don't benchmark BOSON result What you should do is that where your questions gone wrong read BOSON notes - BOSON is only great to clarify things to build your concepts but people generally are outcome oriented so they decide BOSON result is everything - which you 100% avoid doing. (In last BOSON i got 69% (3 days prior) which was my highest score so just trust) There is no exact BOSON question coming in exam be clear on that. Best of luck. Nothing is Impossible."
51,vulnerability,cissp,Provisionally passed at 150 questions this morning!,40,ctpill,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/ctpill/provisionally_passed_at_150_questions_this_morning/,2019-08-22 10:14:28,"I've enjoyed reading others post about the exam so I'll share (and even share some vulnerability and emotion stuff) since mine differs slightly from most I've read. I've been in IT for 19+ years (like the dial up [dot.com](URL boom) and it's my passion. Been in Security for 5 and Compliance/Risk Management specifically (domain 1) for 2.5. I got my CISA last year and it felt like 50% of the questions or so are worded \*very\* similar to the CISA, the **most** correct answer, kinda thing. 50% weren't and the biggest help was Kelly's video ""why you will pass the CISSP"". I also did my best to quell my anxiety, get good sleep and not cram the night before (this is key for me, I need sleep) and took coffee and muffins in my car and stuffed my face enough so I wouldn't be hungry but also not feel sick, lol. (Hey details help, imo). Also I wore an outfit that I would be comfy in and used their earplugs and headphones. They give you that wipe off board, which I wish someone had told me! I wrote ""Think like a manager"". There were times I was like...do they REALLY want me to answer as a manager? Okay, I'll do that then. Staying out 'of the weeds' was helpful and even Larry's video about ""lawyers sometimes do better on this test than techs"", I thought, how would a lawyer answer? How would the test taker right this? like Eric Conrad suggests, so I bundled them all up and used them. I tried my best to remember I'm proud of myself either way, for learning so much. And I really am, that a test doesn't define me. I have a lot of shame based stuff in my family around ""whose the smartest person in the room"". I love concepts, I'm a big picture person. Study method : #1 I did whatever felt right TO me, this was key. I made it my life. I tend to be an audio learner and then gotta write it down to remember it even better. If I felt like I needed a break reading and go to practice tests, I did. If I felt like my brain was too darn full, I took a break. I studied off and on for 6 months , hardcore for 3. I used the 8th Edition Sybex, probably read about half of it. Listened to Eric Conrad's Mp3's of MGT class (grateful for that) , did Kelly Handerhan's entire Cybrary Course and made copious notes. I listened to the old Shon Harris ones for Access Control (she explains it great) and a sprinkle of encryption, but that really wasn't my weakest domain, imo, so didn't listen to all the encryption ones. I got the Boson test environment and the official practice tests and honestly, I think the official ones were better for me personally. Boson was very technical, and although I learned from it, it seems it's a better route to go if you want to do that instead of read books. I also read about half (skipping to my weak domain, network security, which ironically, I must have done well on because then it hit me up for a lot of other things, lol!) the 11th hour Eric Conrad book, and used his slides from the course. I think the key from everyone sharing is to do what works for you. Examine what you know about yourself, your potential weaknesses and work with that. I'm also glad I don't have to study anymore but also knew I was ready when it started getting repetitive. Also a big add, I did NOT ace my practice tests, I was scoring about 50/60% on them and I have two kids and limited time and the material felt repetitive so I just went for it and was willing to fail, or in this case, pass, yay! :)"

I went to submit the Endorsement and Background today, I pass yesterday, it told me I have to take the exam? Context: 100% Self Studied. I passed the CISSP through reading the Sybex book from cover to cover. I highlighted and resummerized concepts in my own words written within the book. I don't like the Sybex Book as it's a bit aloof and inaccurate at times; such as on the vulnerability assessment topic, it left out a critical step, which was to validate patches which were applied to a vulnerability. I decided to read the 11th hour from cover to cover. I finished the book this morning and took the exam this afternoon. The 11th hour is way better than Sybex; however in certain area it's a bit too brief, but way better than Sybex. I did not take any practice exam/ practice questions. I prefer to spend time understanding the concepts as opposed to the practice questions. I did learn something important when taking the CISSP; it's not a technical exam and therefore before every question follow this order of precedence: 1) Human Life 2) Legal 3) Management 4) Technical I often found the choices were often the best in each of the following four listed and therefore pay very close attention to ""what"" the question is asking, Good Luck!

I bought Eric Conrad's Eleventh Hour CISSP and at first I thought it was the very best thing I ever did. As I compared it with Shon Harris' CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Seventh Edition, I realized the former covers like 60% - 70% of Harris' book. What concerned me the most of the Eleventh Hour, is that even in Domain 1, basic concepts like vulnerability, threat, risk, etc., are not defined.

Since studying, I had a promotion, got married, bought and sold a house and became a stepdad. All the while I somehow managed to find time to study. Last weekend, my wife and I learned about a miscarriage of our child so our spirits have been low. I'm glad we finally have something to celebrate. &amp;#x200B; I've been in software development for around 15 years and the last half have been focused on security. I'm currently an architect responsible for activities such as secure design, threat modeling, vulnerability analysis and code reviews. I knew from the beginning the networking domain would not come easy! &amp;#x200B; I arrived an hour before my exam started and was allowed to take the test early. My initial reaction was I was going to fail! So many of the questions seemed unrelated to what I learned and I wasn't sure of a definite answer. I kept telling myself these are the throw away questions... STAY FOCUSED. I didn't waste a lot of time on a single question. Process of elimination is key! Don't get upset if you don't know the answer to the question..some of the answers will ""automatically eliminate themselves"". &amp;#x200B; Questions 95-100, I started slowing down as I knew I would have more than an hour for last 50. At 99 I was fully pumped to go extra rounds with this beast of a test. When my test ended at 100, I was shocked. I hadn't felt certain I passed, so my reaction was ""Let me go to 101 I need more chance to prove myself!"" &amp;#x200B; My general advice is persevere through the tough questions.

I studied for about 1.5 months for the CISSP, purely reading the Sybex 8th edition book and doing practice problems. Thought the exam was pretty tough, lot of vague questions in which you usually narrow down the answer to 2 options but both apply depending on the scenario. After passing, I looked over the material for the CISM and thought there was a ton of overlap, so I skimmed through a friend's CISM All in One McGraw Hill book, did a bunch of practice problems, and signed up for the test a week later. Thought the CISM test was easier than the CISSP, very similar question style, but very high level on risk, strategy, and incident management. &amp;#x200B; **Advice on taking both tests**: CISSP definitely covers more material since it includes security testing, networking, and other domains that the CISM simply doesn't have. CISM's focus was purely on risk, strategy, incident management &amp; response, and business continuity. If you do what I did and took the CISSP first, make sure you review and really focus on the 4 domains for the CISM. I do feel there was a lot of overlap but the biggest advantage of taking the CISM right after the CISSP was knowing how the questions were going to be asked, stay in that same mindset of analyzing the questions and you should be fine. Do practice problems, lots of them. If you are a slow test taker, I would suggest dedicating some time for practice problems and exams and actually time yourself.

This reddit thread helped me way more than any advice I've received from peers / colleagues, and I work in an InfoSec department at a rather large multinational company. Figured I'd give a little back, maybe it helps someone. **A little bit about me** I'm 28, have been working in IT for the last 4 years, with InfoSec roles in the last 3. I'm based in a third world country in Europe where a big multinational IT company has several offices with +2000 employed nationwide. My roles have been around Vulnerability Management (very basic and didn't really help me for the exam) and as a Client Security Manager, which helped me a lot for Domain 1 (security &amp;risk, bcm) as well as a bit from Domain 7 (especially disaster recovery). My technical skills have been my drawback in preparing for the CISSP, especially around network technologies. **How I prepared** Work sent me to a week-long bootcamp. Completely useless, would not recommend. The test &amp; certification isn't really something that a trainer can really provide added value to - it's a lot of information that has to be crammed in. Not spectacular by any means. I learned the 8th edition of the Sybex book like in College. Read it all, took notes, wrote about 2 notebooks worth of them, took the end-chapter practice tests, and only moved forward after scoring +90%. Bought the official practice tests and took them like real life CISSP exams. Took as many free tests as I could possibly find online, although that didn't really help.Didn't really have funds to by everything I wanted to buy (like Boson). I started studying around Dec 15th and took the exam on the 31st of January. **How the test went** Questions were honestly a lot more difficult than the practice tests show. Around question 20 I was sure I was going to fail, and at question 100 I paused before hitting ""next"", and was 100% sure that if the test closed at 100, I would fail. It didn't. Gave me another round of 50 questions which went smoother, and with a good result at the end. :) "

Sorry for the long write-up! First off I'd just like to thank everyone within this community. I might have been a bit of a lurker, but everything I've read and all success stories have definitely helped me with the exam! Background: So, to start off; I'm 25 years old and have been working within IT for about 5 years, starting of as a networking consultant which involved managing firewalls, IDS/IPS, large wireless networks and basic switching/routing assignments. Before that I studied Networking technology and IT-security at a Cisco Academy here in Sweden. We had a couple courses which involved security in the shape of firewall management, and one course which involved basic penetration testing. This is where my interest in security started. I took the CCNA while working as a networking consultant (although I took the academical CCNA/CCNA Security/CCNP in college). When my previous employer (consulting firm) started developing an internal cyber security group I jumped at the chance and changed my orientation from networking to pure security. Since this group was relatively new I got the opportunity to help develop services and products which was very interesting! My assignments as a cyber security consultant involved (among others) penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, web application testing based on OWASP Top 10, and assessments based on CIS Top 20. During this time I took the CEH certification. I really don't like EC-Council, but the exam helped me with the basics of pentesting and understanding the technology. In march of this year I got the opportunity to attend a five day CISSP exam preparation course in London through Learning Tree. Honestly, it wasn't great. It did give me the basics, but something that really bugged me was when the teacher couldn't explain WHY some practice questions were correct or not.. Didn't get me ready for the exam, but built the groundwork for me. In August I changed employer to a bigger consulting firm with a bigger focus on management, since I wanted more experience within informational security. They didn't have an assignment for me yet, so i got the opportunity to really focus on taking the CISSP exam. Study material: * courses through Skillsoft * Kelly Handerhan's free Cybrary videos * Cybex 8th edition * Cybex Official Practice Tests 2nd edition * CISSP All-In-One 7th edition * ISC2 CBK book * Boson test exams * 11th hour 3rd edition * Sunflower PDF So for the last 4 months I've been able to study for about 4-8 hours a day (weekends off). I started off with the Skillsoft videos, but I felt that the studying really started when i began reading the Cybex book. I prefer this book to the CBK or AIO because of how it was written compared to the AIO which to me was a bit too technical or deep-going for my taste. My best advice are the Cybex and Kelly Handerhan's videos. Kelly's videos were really great! She explained concepts in a very good way which stuck to me for the exam. The Boson test exams were also great! They were probably the questions that most felt like the real exam questions (although they still were pretty different). I do feel like i did the boson exams too early though, so by the 2-3rd week before the exam I had memorized the practice exams and they didn't really help me anymore. The day of the exam: I started the day with watching Kelly's video about [why you WILL pass the exam](URL and Larry Greenblatts [CISSP 2018 Exam Tips](URL which got me in the right mindset for the exam (really helped!). I got to the exam center about 40 minutes before the time that I had booked, but was able to get started directly. The exam: This was.. Interesting.. I had read a lot of write-ups where you never thought that you'd passed when you were done, so i tried to have that in mind, but man.. This was tough! It started of relatively easy, but escalated pretty fast. The final 20 questions where just crazy in that you couldn't understand what they were actually asking for. I also tried to have in mind how the test works in that you get easier questions if you answer badly and harder questions if you are on the right track, but I felt that I got a pretty good mix of easy and hard questions at the 40-60 questions mark. When I answered the 100th question I had about 1,5 hours left, and thought that if it ended now I was sure to have failed.. And it did. The cursor started to spin (loading), and after a few seconds I got the screen that I was done. I definitely felt like I had failed after those difficult last 20 questions. I went to the bathroom before getting my print-out, heard the printer in the background and went out to get the result. Like i said, I was SURE that I had failed, but when I saw the paper (facing the wrong way, so I read it upside down(?)) and saw that the first word had an exclamation mark after it my pulse went up to crazy. When I finally took the paper and read it my jaw physically dropped. That feeling when you read 'Congratulations!' was just incredible! Never felt anything like it! And that was it! I went home (shaking the whole way home) and poured me a beer that I'd saved for just that occasion! After a few days I started the endorsement process (without getting a mail from ISC2, just tried it) and got endorsed by a colleague, so now I just have to wait for ISC2 to review it before it's official (and i can crack open another beer saved ;)!

The first sections on Business, Policy, and Risk Analysis are GOLD. \-11th Hour book - Read this next, cover to cover, for a bit deeper dive into all the topics than Kelly can cover in 13 hours of videos. \-Boson Tests - I took a few directly Kelly's videos and was around the 65% mark. After reading 11th hour, and focusing on weaker areas I was around 80% on the last exam. I wouldn't be too concerned with the % though, as there are a LOT more technical questions on the Boson tests vs the real exam. Make sure you read the details for each answer and understand WHY they are right or wrong. \-Sybex Study Guide / Practice Exams (Only read 1 or 2 chapters, mainly to make sure I covered my weaker areas such as SDLC). Took all 4 practice tests from the practice book and made sure to understand all answers (started at 70% on these, and ended up around 80%). The questions are almost as good as Boson IMO, but not quite as detailed in the answers. \-Larry Greenblatt's CISSP Test Tips Videos (watched this right before the exam) to reinforce mindset and test taking strategy. \- r/CISSP posts and comments &amp;#x200B; Comments: I wanted longer to study for the exam but I had to reschedule it. Was about 50% sure I'd pass it going into it, but it all worked out. Understand the core business principles more than anything else, so you know how to think properly for the questions (ie business goals, policy creation, and risk). Most of the questions are conceptual and require thinking like upper management and a risk advisor. A very large portion of the deeper technicals and memorization was NOT important on more than a few questions. "

I read the book 3 times and studied the concepts that I thought was important in the English version, including kerberos, RAID, laws, etc. Many of the concepts were studied from the answer explanation. I know that my study was very discrete and unorganised. However, I think it is still okay to pass the exam with the knowledge I had at that time. After all, what I missed was the details, which made me missed 3-4 questions in the exam only. For the second attempt, I only got 2 domains above proficiency level and 1 domain near the proficiency level - even worse than the 1st attempt... Forgot to mention, I scored 66% in the practice test which I did 2 days before the examination. I spent less than 1 minutes for each question in practice tests. So if I answer the questions carefully like I'm doing the exam, my score should be 7x%. &amp;#x200B; This time, I read the Official Study Guide once and made my own notes in a very detailed way (107 pages). I started doing the practice test 1 month before the exam (2 hours per day, spent more time during weekend) and got 65% - 73% across the 8 domains. Then I started reading the Official Study Guide 3 weeks before the exam and finished the reading + notes taking 3.5 days before the exam. For the remaining 3.5 days, I studied my own notes, tried to memorise everything in the notes, and completed a after-domain practice test (scored 76%) . This is a very rush schedule and I got into a panic before the exam because I thought I could not finish memorising all the concepts in the notes. I even planned to schedule the 4th attempt! On the exam day, as my exam scheduled at 3pm, I woke up at 7am, studied until 2pm and was super worried about the exam. In fact, I could only memorise 80% of the concepts before stepping into the exam centre. However, after finished the 50th question, I was feeling good and knew I am going to pass! After I submitted the answer of the 100th question, unsurprisingly, I passed the exam! &amp;#x200B; **My Suggestion** I would like to share my views and suggestions to those who are going to take CISSP exam 1. No need to read multiple textbooks. I read other posts in Reddit saying they read multiple sources of textbooks to prepare the exam. However, I think reading the Official Study Guide is enough. Almost all the concepts you will see in the exam have been covered in the Official Study Guide. I don't think it worths spending months to read other textbooks and sources as I only encountered 2 questions in the third attempt that the concepts are not covered by the official guide. I don't remember the details in my first attempt, but for the second attempt, the number of question was similar. 2. Google the concepts when you are clear about them. Searching for answer and reading wikipedia are much more faster and efficient than reading other textbooks. 3. Be very careful for the first 20 questions you answered. From my experience, I feel that CAT will keep asking the domains that you are not familiar with. If you answered something wrong, the following questions will be harder. So you should think more than 3 times for the first 20 questions before you submit your answer. I did not do it this way for my second attempt and set 1.2 minutes as the deadline to submit the answer. It is no need to worry about the time. As far as I know, many people finished the exam at 100th or 10X th question. I spent around 40 minutes to finish the first 20 questions and the difficulty of the questions obviously decreased. 4. Luck is very important. If I were given the same set of questions in my second attempt and had answered them carefully like this time, I think I could have passed it (although I would give wrong answers for some networking questions). 5. Review the answers you got wrong in the practice test before the exam. I found around 5 questions in the exam were from the practice test. 6. Don't give up if you failed before. Hope all of you pass the exam!"

After this, I went on to do Masters in Digital Security and then worked as a research assistant in the field of computer security and human-computer interaction for about 10 months.

On 25 June 2018, I failed the CISSP exam. Background: I have only been in the InfoSec space for about 2 years. I have experience in physical security, incidence response, access control, and otherwise arguably enough experience to satisfy the CISSP requirements for certification. However, until early 2016, I didn't start learning about IT security. In August of 2016 I started my MS in Information Security and Assurance. While the class load wasn't particularly tech-heavy, I can see now that the classes were preparing me for the CISSP... especially those concerning risk management and business continuity practices. So anyway, to the exam. I arrived at PearsonVue an hour early and they let me start before the scheduled time. I took nearly 160 (of 180) minutes to complete 150 questions. By the time I was at question 125, I really figured I had bombed the exam (I have heard if the exam stops at 100, it means I earned enough points for provisional certification). With my intent to respect the (ISC)2 code, I can say that none of the questions I had looked anything like the prep questions I had from the (ISC)2 CISSP exam book or from the Shon Harris or 11th Hour books. Most of the questions were of a technical nature. I went in ""thinking like a manager"" but I didn't think like a ""manager"" that knew a whole lot about technology. My exam did not seem to be ""heavy"" in any particular domain; but I would say that I wish I had learned more about penetration testing. Admittedly, I scanned my text books rather than actually did a deep-dive into any of them. I typically studied anywhere from 1-2 hours a day, 4 days a week, for the last 3 months. Clearly, it just wasn't enough studying married with experience. I would take practice tests and consistently scored in the 80s... but it was a lot of the same questions over and over again as the question bank was only about 1200 unique entries. My plan is to take a break, focus on some other training opportunities (log analysis, network security, and vulnerability management) and reassess in about six months. Anyway, not passing doesn't impact my life too much. I don't need it for my job (not right now, anyways) but it was painful to my pocketbook. My recommendation is if you are new to InfoSec, you should probably study more than 1-2 hours a day for 3 months... and you should probably have a solid understanding of both the technical and managerial aspects of IT."

I've started practising using free practice tests right now since I am not in a position to pay due to change of jobs, homes and all. Currently using the [securitydocs.com](URL and [mhprofessionalresources.com](URL as an option. Will be buying the Boson tests, 11th Hour &amp; AIO next month when I can actually pay for it. I was allowed to work only in Application Security for 5 years, and some 5&amp;#37; in vulnerability assessments due to company mismanagement and silo based work culture.

Cryptography is a major weak spot with 20&amp;#37;\~ scores. My plan to approach for the exam in mid-September is as follows: * Study from 11th hour at the start and the AIO * Proceed completely with AIO 7th edition (and / or any alternative / suplement to it) * Give practice tests on the weekends from the sample practice questions in the book, Boson tests, etc. * Two weeks prior to exam dive into 11th hour again and a few more practice tests. * Do this everyday for 6-7 weeks * ??? * Profit! I understand securitydocs and mhprofessional isn't accurate, but those are the cheapest options what with house movement, job change, wedding, all happening within 2 months bankrupting me. I am even using an old laptop that shocks, so you can appreciate why I am not buying the books and resources immediately. Due to circumstances I am tied to one domain, and CISSP would allow me to gain a stronger insight if I hope to grow. Any suggestions, alternatives or additional guidance that you can provide would be really great! "
76,vulnerability,cissp,"Passed the exam, I am now an Associate of (ISC)! (March 24)",30,86tbm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/86tbm2/passed_the_exam_i_am_now_an_associate_of_isc²/,2018-03-25 01:25:34,"Hi guys! I passed the CISSP exam (CAT) an hour ago and it has been one hell of a ride. I still can't believe I actually passed, I just checked the ISC^2 site and it says passed!! After months of daily lurking on this sub I finally get to make my own post :). This is probably the toughest exam I've ever sat. Before I delve into details of this exam, here is a list of resources I used: ##Resources used (bold = most useful)## * **Sybex** (8/10, I read this cover-to-cover and skimmed the summaries in the last few days) * Cybrary.it - Kelly Handerhan's videos (8/10, great summary of the CBK) * 11th Hour (8/10, read this the last few days - very helpful) * **Boson** (9/10, most useful test engine there is although often too technical) * I also had the Shon Harris and the official green book, I tried to read them but there is way too much extra information. I would rate those 3/10) * Bootcamp (1/10, this did not prepare me for the exam at all) ##Background## For those that care: I only have 2 years in the security field (mostly ISO 27001 auditing, compliance and cyber security risk management, not very technical stuff). I hold a bachelor and master in IT (which was only useful for the OSI/TCP/IP and SDLC part lol). This is my first actual certificate in security, I do hold some basic ITIL, Prince2 and TOGAF certificates. I have been studying since January, so it took me around 3 months. I was spending 3 hours a day and most of my weekends (up to 8 hours) to study. ##The Exam## Okay, so the exam started and I didn't understand the first question. I felt like an idiot lol. I feel like the questions were formulated fine, but that a lot of the questions have two pretty good answers that are both valid. Unfortunately, you need to adapt to the mindset of ISC^2, which in general is conservative. I got the full 150 questions - I did not have time for the last two questions and just chose a random answer. I feel like almost 60%, if not more, of the answers I gave were educated guesses. I started by eliminating two answers (this is, if you ask me, the best way to handle this exam). Most questions had one or two obvious wrong answers. There were only a handful (maybe 15?) direct questions. **Most questions were asking about the BEST or PRIMARY answer. So you really need to apply the concepts you've learned**. Thinking back, most of what I have read and prepared was not in the exam. During the entire exam I felt miserable and was already planning on when to take the resit. You can understand how happy I was when I heard congratulations :) The topics that stood out the most were (keep in mind, this test is adaptive, so this doesn't apply to everyone): * VoIP (I got like 10 questions regarding VoIP, most of it I didn't know the answer of directly) * SDLC (know the roles and activities of each phase) * Cryptography (know which algorithms are weak; what key to use in a situation; which ones provide non-repudation, authenticity, etc.) * OSI and TCP/IP questions, pretty high level stuff * Common Criteria * BCP/DRP * Cloud (a lot of cloud questions!!) * CHAP/PAP/EAP (caught me totally off guard) * Vulnerability assessments (make sure you know the processes) * I had like 5 drag and drop questions, they were pretty straightforward (connect this standard/protocol with this description or what role for this task) I obviously can't be more specific due to the NDA, but I feel like more people have reported that VoIP, BCP/DRP and SDLC are emphasised in this exam. If you have any questions please post them, I am happy to help! Next objective is going for CRISC and CIPP/E, which thankfully are not as huge as CISSP. PS: [I will be giving out my books and resources to anyone needing it, I'll make another post for this, not pictured is the Sybex book.](URL ## Some exam tips ## * Read the question. Like actually read and understand it, there is a lot of extra information that you don't need to answer a question. Don't be like me and take too long with each question though, calculate 2 minutes for each question. * Think like a risk advisor, you never touch anything. Verify and report to the owner. * I studied pretty intensively, but there were still a lot of questions I had no idea what the answer was. Don't stress and stay calm while you eliminate wrong answers. Go with your gut feeling. * Listen to [Larry Greenblatt's](URL exam tips right before you do the exam. * Focus on SDLC, Cloud and VoIP, I have a feeling these topics will become even more prevalent after the April update * Boson is the best test engine there is to help you prepare for this exam in terms of how they ask questions. Neither Shon Harris nor Sybex nor 11th's test exams came even close to the real deal. If your budget allows, go for Boson (I swear, I don't work for their marketing team). "

As most of you already know, it's not an easy test. Thank you all that have contributed to this beautiful sub and have shared your experiences. For those that are planning on a retake, rest assured that this new format cuts it down to 3 hours and a possible 150 questions (if you really know your stuff, you pass at 100 questions). The questions are still as challenging as the linear based exam, and will include material from the entire CBK. The only main difference in my experience, was how the questions would become increasingly difficult if I felt I was not answering correctly. The algorithm takes the score from your previous answers and adjusts the exam based on your capabilities, therefore, disabling you from going back or flagging questions for later review. They were all very challenging questions, and yes I answered them like a manager would. The exam as a whole covered a variety of questions from all 8 domains, but I felt like I answered most technical questions at times. i.e. OSI/TCPIP, IPSec and AH and ESP, a wide range of Encryption/Hashing Technologies, many PenTesting/Hacking questions, Software Development and Database Security. In case you're interested, this was my study strategy for the last 2 months. (Its not worth mentioning, I took a 1 week bootcamp. Not worth it, company paid so I appreciate the time off work.) 1. I watched every Sari Greene video on every Domain from this site: URL which charges a fee for access OR if you are DoD or Gov Employee it is free for unlimited access. It was over 24 hours of video that she covers really well but its not deeply detailed, just enough to have an understanding of the concept. I took many notes on important processes and steps, like BCP, DRP, BIA, Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Assessments, EAL, Software Development Life-cycle, including the various methodologies like, Waterfall, Agile, SW-CMM, Spiral, etc. 2. I periodically looked at the Sunflower Guide pdf. This was a very GOOD document to have. Make sure you use this and have a good understanding of each of the items in it. 3. After I watched the Sari Greene videos for each Domain, I took a 100 question exam for each domain on URL which we should all have access to. 4. The Sari Greene videos are concepts taken from the BIG BOOK CBK. So, they all closely match with the Sybex book. Taking the 100 question exams for each domain helped me reinforce and better understand all the concepts in the CBK and Sunflower Guide. 5. There is no substitution for hard work and investing the time and effort. Ultimately, you have to really understand every Domain and every concept in that Domain. Memorizing acronyms, policy numbers, cipher types, and web application attack types is not going to cut it. You have to understand the material. Once again, thank you all for contributing to this forum. Best of luck in all you future endeavors and certification pathways."

At the same time my employer registered me for CISSP bootcamp in July 2020. However, I didnt want to wait till July and booked myself in March 2020 for exam but plans changed unexpectedly cos of COVID. So pushed my exam to July. Bootcamp got postponed to Sept 2020 , however I proceeded with my plan of giving this exam in July without bootcamp. Here is a list of sources I used.. This list is not exhaustive, lol  OSG  read 60 % of it.  AIO &amp; CBK- referred it for key topics and also did some light reading for heavier domains D3,D4, and D7.  Adams IT pro TV- saw both 81 hrs and 33 hrs , very useful and notes are super good. [**URL  Eric Coles SANS video- 60 hrs : Extremely useful in laying the foundation  Thors Notes + some of his videos, very good indeed. [**URL  Luke Ahmed SNT : Really good to clear concepts, dint practice his questions. [**URL  MF Prod YouTube- Saw his videos for all domain: really very good and free ! [**URL  Fsecure Bootcamp Youtube- very good and free resource as well [**URL  Rob Witcher: Destination Certification videos on Youtube- Extremely good, these were on my playlist for last 48 hrs prior to exam [**URL  Software defined networking  Eli Youtube [**URL  Academy of Cybersecurity bootcamp [**URL  Discord  Certification Station : Really helped in getting clarity on key concepts, wise words from everyone really helped in passing this exam. [URL  Referred memory palace and 11th hour too. **Test Engines used:** Wiley , Sybex chapter end questions, AIO 5th edition practice exams, CCCure, BOSON, Discord (Certification station), Adams QOD, IT Dojo, Some of Wentz questions. Also saw, IT Dojo, Kelly- Why you will pass, Larry Greenblatt CISSP 2018 tips  Youtube. Altogether, I practiced 2500-3000 questions and averaged 70-75% in my practice exams. **Strategy:** Started with book, used videos and other sources listed above in parallel. Also took questions to test my preparation level. Took off from work for 3 weeks to focus better. Methodology might differ from person to person, but I took my notes and revised them EVERY night before going to bed, every day! Same goes with processes. Using multiple resources is the KEY. Also if you get bored with one domain, try to switch or do some other, it helps. Before reading any concept, try to pause and think for a moment WHY are we doing it, that really helps to build a more holistic picture. If you are unable to get the answer, read the concept and then try to analyse, what is the end result, where is it helping us? Why are we doing it? Question yourself everytime you read anything J 2 weeks before exam: Did close to 800 questions spread over 8 domain, revised all 8 domains from multiple sources. 1 week before exam: Started with full length practice tests , one 150 ques test per day. Also did revisions and talked out processes aloud. 3 days before exam: Stopped with questions and just focussed on revision. Revision for me was  Adam notes, Robs Videos and self-hand written notes + memory palace. 24 hrs before exam: Kept very light, just some revision. Dint stress.. 12 hrs before exam: Closed the books and distracted myself totally, went for a long 2 hour drive. No revision Morning of exam: 30th July, 2020 Some 30 mins of revision for cryto keys and D4 authentication protocols. That is all. Outside the test centre: Anxiety definitely builds up, I did these to control my nerves: 1. Ran 3 full laps of underground parking lot of the test building. This helped. 2. Picked up a conversation with a lady waiting outside the test centre- she sounded more nervous, so stopped my talks, lol 3. Went to washroom and told myself aloud in mirror  I can do it. 3 times. It helped! **About the exam:** One question at one time- that is the mindset I went with, and a DO NOT GIVE UP attitude, no matter how hard the questions got. Also, I read ques 3x times , tried to understand what exactly its asking, and then move to options. I was able to narrow down to 2 options for 70% of the questions. It was OK for me in terms for vocabulary, most questions were tricky, few were soft balls. I turned the timer off at Ques 1 itself, it plays with my mind. I took 1 hour for the first 30 questions. Started getting real easy ques after 76th Ques. Finished the exam at 100q in 120 mins overall. **Could I have done something differently in my CISSP journey?** Yes and No, lol No-&gt; because I passed. Yes-&gt; There is always a room for improvement J I should have maintained 8 notebooks for 8 domain. All my notes were a total chaos towards the end. Lessons learnt- I should have been more organised. **A BIG THANK YOU to everyone in Discord who helped me pass this exam, All the wonderful advice/ suggestions really helped till the very end. Altogether, I feel blessed to be part of such a community! J** (MilesToGo on Discord)"

A bit of background, I am currently working as a Security Engineer for a large corp in Australia. I have a masters in Cybersecurity and a bachelor in IT. I have also been in IT for about 10 years now (L1 &gt; L2 &gt; Infrastructure) and in the last 3 months I completed AWS Architect and AWS Security certifications. Now, I would like to go after another cyber cert and after tossing up between OSCP and CISSP I decided to go with CISSP. Reason being is that I am not looking into becoming a pen tester (that is more of a hobby than a career) and I think CISSP would definitely open a few more doors for my career. From reading a lot of posts these seem to be the go to study materials, but before I commit, are there any other materials that are recommended or any of the below ones that are not worth it.

91,cybersecurity,cissp,CISSP Fail and then Pass,1,hqammn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/hqammn/cissp_fail_and_then_pass/,2020-07-13 17:01:49,"For about 2 years I've been studying off and on for the CISSP examination. Here's the materials I've went through and my thoughts: **Written Material** * CISSP All-In-One (too much detail given what the exam actually asked) * (ISC)2 CISSP Certified (this was more to the point) * CISSP For Dummies (solid reference) **Videos** * IT Dojo CISSP Videos (you really should listen to his explanations through and through as the same type of questions do come up) * Udemy (material was okay but not memorable) * CybRary YouTube videos (some nuggets of wisdom that helped with a few questions) * CISSP Prep Videos (this helped break down vague processes into memorable order) * SkillSet (material was okay but didn't memorize) * 11th Hour on Audible (I realized passive listening doesn't solidify knowledge for me) **Practice Exams** * (ISC)2 CISSP Practice Exams (excellent source) * CISSP All In One Practice Exams (somewhat ok, although too detailed) * Boson (this was the perfect simulation of the exam) **Other material:** * SunFlower (best for waking up in the morning to review and before passing out) * ThorTeaches (good to skim over, but hard to memorize) * Boot camp (I seriously dont feel this was worth it but I may have had the wrong experience) **First Attempt February 2020 (Fail)** On the Boson exams I was getting 60-65% and 70-75% on the other practices. On the day of the exam I was a bit nervous because I didn't pass the CISM before this exam about a year before this one and the 700 bucks was hanging over my head. However, I thought unlike the CISM, maybe the CISSP will be a little more focused and perhaps putting 700 bucks for passing will force me to study harder than I did for the CISM. Before the exam I kept thinking to myself other tips like ""think like a manager and not like an engineer,"" ""it's a mile wide and an inch deep,"" ""understand why you got something wrong and not just memorize answer"" and that ""you'll run into 'Best choice' questions a lot so keep in mind you're here to advise - not fix."" With all the material above and tips in hand I was fairly confident that I memorized just enough to be able to answer high level questions. So, day of the exam, I walk in, bit nervous trying to hold all what I studied to memory (I believe this to be my mistake but more on that later) and the moment I click signed the NDA the first few questions came up I had absolutely no idea what the answer was or if even any of the materials I studied covered this. Then by question 20 I knew this was the beginning of the end. This is like the CISM all over again; vague questions with very subjective answers on material that I either did not do a good job of memorizing, full understanding/grasping or come across on my source material as well as 10 years in CyberSecurity. Why did I waste all that time remembering who the hell Zachman was and different cipher modes when the majority of the questions was an exercise in reading comprehension. Throughout the exam there was frustration, even resentment, brewing in me even at the notion that this was considered a gold standard. With the printed results of my failure at hand I frustratingly went home in bitter resentment and even more annoyed at the money lost. **Second attempt July 2020 (Pass)** Here's the deal, I am a manager, and yes, a lot of the questions you have to take the vague approach to things. Never in my life has choices boiled down to nuances over expected clear direction/recommendation of risk levels. Why? At the end I know my position is to give the company a level of predictability in a cost effective manner. So why was I not able to think like a manager in this exam? I kept thinking on how terribly worded some of these questions were and there's no way to challenge it. I realized there has to be a different approach for me to pass. I started reading Reddit posts on CISSP fails and succeeds. This was everything. The reason was that it became comforting to know people had the same issue of knowing possible 15-20 questions and mostly best guess scenarios. Meaning, no amount of memorization will determine your exam results because I know for a fact each of the study material above have similarly worded processes and steps, but its not use memorizing them to a T. Yes, this is an adaptive exam and it will try to find your weak spots. With that in mind, I went in without thinking of just pure memorization. Dont do like me, looking at things an inch wide and a mile deep. Meaning, dont go down trying to memorize all Shon Harris language, but get the themes, the jest of whats said and think of throwing blotches of information in categories youve organized. Heres an example, each book/video goes into what they feel encompasses SDLC. They will use similar words and themes for each phase but heres the approach I to build a strong grasp of material: *Step 1: Build the base* Start with a memorization technique. With SDLC I think IDIOD (Initialization, Design, Implementation, Operation and Deployment). Each book had different terms and create a quirky story around it : The IDIOD is asking for requirements, doodles, testing, monitoring and self disposal. *Step 2: The breakdown and ask yourself through part of the process whats the expected outcome* I for I need stuff! like requIrements, pIa and a bIa (privacy and business Impact assessment) D for Doodles Diagrams, Risk and Verification. I for Implementation will Validate the testing and controls weve put into place. O for Operation for Continuous Monitoring and Assurance. D for Disposal for safely removing it. *If the steps above dont fit he question then apply the following:* Human Life if always importnt Remember the Canons (PAPA) Remember the CIA Remember the ultimate outcome of things and summarize it accordingly. Principals over solutions (like in a multiple choice question comes up with vague nuances and youre in in doubt  pick process and documentation over specific technical implementation. If they offer technical solutions, opt for the Picard lets have a discussion while were being fired at  approach. I swear this approach would get me fired anywhere else in the world but whatever you just need to pass the exam right? Finally, what helped me the most: DONT PANIC! These ARE frustrating questions and I kept a tally, like almost every Reddit post I saw about 15-20 questions I knew the answer right away and the rest were educated guesses. I opted to apply for principals and tried to pull myself out of the weeds throughout the exam. On the day of the exam I get to question 100 and I paused for a moment recalling other threads saying the exam just ended there and oh no, question 101 came up. Damn it, I was already making the concession speech in mind that it was a tough break and that Ill go for it for a third time but somewhere around question 110 it stopped and a printed congratulations you provisionally passed was handed to me. I got him, celebrated with a drink and decided to write this post. Hope this helps."
92,cybersecurity,cissp,A test of mental fortitude. Passed at 100 questions.,2,hrucah,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/hrucah/a_test_of_mental_fortitude_passed_at_100_questions/,2020-07-16 05:33:46,"Hi all, I've been lurking here for half a year. I've read almost every post and decided to share my experience to help the wonderful community as I think it is slightly different than most and my intent is in hopes that it might help you feel better if you are feeling unsure/alone/negative at any point before and during your exam. Know that it is part of the rollercoaster of a journey, that's what makes it exciting. A little background for context as always. **Formal Education (3 relevant years, not much remembered):** I had some technical education in IT in my teens but I furthered on with a degree in something totally unrelated, but life throws you opportunities when you least expect and back into the industry I went. **Work experience (4 years) Tldr (Not much to help):** Unlike most of the posters here, I have very little work experience in this field. I have 2 years doing Ops governance in a project (telling the technical guys what I want) providing 2FA services, it was not a technical role and my focus was mostly on ensuring things were up and running by tossing SLAs at people. The only experience I felt I gained was what the 5 types of authentication are when brought over to the context of CISSP lol. Another 2 years I swapped roles as a Cybersecurity Engineer, this was a technical role and since I was involved from the Implementation phase onwards, I had some idea on the SDLC processes and NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001 due to project certification requirements, but I was really lacking in relevant experience on a higher level since I was running through checklists more so than understanding the broader picture of the intents for these documents as I was more of a Data Custodian and SecAdmin. CISSP was a semi-requirement for the project and I was encouraged to take it by my superior, which to some of my peers was an undertaking beyond my ability as I lacked the depth and experience and they felt that I should be taking a less challenging Security cert. The only other cert I hold is ITILv3. **My Prep**: **Input:** I took 4 months to prepare, I spent about 2 hours each day (Maybe 2-3 times a week), and 3-4 on weekends (every weekend). I will not rate my study sources, as I did not use many compared to most other posts, so to me, these are all great and sufficient to pass. 1st Month: CISSP Official Study Guide (8th Ed) I had to read this cover to cover, I lacked the experience and every page had concepts and words new to me. Took me 1.5 months to complete it. I had an excel where I'd dump anything alien into it so that I could research it on days I didn't feel like reading. I also did the MCQ test questions and tried to understand why I got them wrong. I scored around 85% before moving on. I did not touch the open-ended questions at the end of the chapters. 2nd to 3rd Month: Boson Test (95% on average by exam date) From all the recommendations, decided to try it (Had discount voucher). I actually spent quite a fair bit of time in Boson, I'd copy out the explanations for concepts I could not grasp into that same growing excel sheet. Questions are more technical than the exam. As others said, it has MOST, BEST etc which is similar to the exam but I don't think that mattered to me. I'll explain more later. 3rd to 4th Month: CISSP Official Practice Tests (2nd Edition) (92% on average by exam date) I bought this with the official guide so I decided to use it since I didn't rely on many other sources to find out what my weaker domains were. Questions are very straight forward unlike the actual exam. It is purely to test your **memory** of the concepts. Be careful :) don't get complacent with just remembering. I watched Kelly's why you will pass video and Larry's Spock and Kirk video since everyone was talking about it. I only watched them once at the start and that set the stage for how I would prep my understanding of the material I encountered. Last week before Exam: 11th Hour by Eric Conrad. I ran out of fresh material so I got this book. It is more palatable compared to the official study guide, things are worded in a more ""why did they do this"" manner and simplified to the essence of it. Maybe in hindsight, I would have read this first to get a high-level understanding before reading the official study guide. I speed-read through it only to stop on concepts that I still could not fully appreciate. Glanced through the various NIST documents. Please briefly read them so at least when some terms come up from inside, you will not feel lost as you may not have seen it before...... ;) ;) ;) This video by Tom Mangiacapre helped me understand Kerberos better than any others did: [URL **Materials I discarded** There is a quiz that is from the Shon Harris (mhprofessionalresources website) book online that others have shared. I felt it was too deep and didn't do it after trying a few quizzes. Sunflower pdf did not work for me. There were some things which I had not come across even till the last day of my exam. I decided I was gonna consider those out of my scope because I didn't see them in both Eric Conrad and Official guide. I decided to trust the 2 books and 2 question banks would be all I needed. **Output** 1 excel with 100 items which I could finally understand the terms nearing exam date. 2 pages of handwritten notes squeezed in small writing on blank sheets. No flashcards, no 100 pages notes, no colorful mindmaps **My struggles (Struggling I've been through it! You're not alone):** Many of you preparing for the exam may have this issue, and I struggled weekly with this. *Did I study too deep? What is inch deep and mile wide?? How deep is deep enough? How wide is wide enough? Should I memorize all the bits and keys lengths of all the crypto algorithms?* *How well do I need to memorize the NIST or is recognizing what 800-34, 800-37, 800-53, 800-64 etc sufficient?* *Is knowing what is on the 7 layers of OSI enough? Do I need to know how each protocol works individually? TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP probably, what about the structure of the packets they're made up of? How about RPC? What is that? Do I want to divert my time to that?* *Is being able to list the SDLC sufficient? I understand what they are on each stage but in what way can they question me when it comes to security? -ponder ponder-* *Cloud is popular now, do I need to know more beyond knowing what is IDaaS, BaaS, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS?* *TCSEC/ITSEC replaced with Common criteria, do I need to memorise what is A1, B1, B2, B3 etc still?* *How many information flow models must I memorize?? There's so many!* *SLIP, PPP, L2TP, L2F, IPSEC it's getting technical here for me, is knowing which triad in CIA they provide sufficiently deep??* Some nights I lost sleep reading through people's posts feeling like I didn't go deep enough. Some nights I felt like I went too deep. It was a struggle. Everyday. And it weighed heavily at the back of my head. I decided the depth I wanted to focus on eventually without driving myself crazy, and I told myself ***""Know the gist of old technical concepts, memorize the details for in-trend technical concepts, and understand all the processes IN YOUR OWN WORDS""*** **Exam day:** I did not touch my notes 1 day before the exam. I knew I was going to be nervous if I tried to study and nothing would help. At this point, I knew relaxing was the best prep. No alcohol of course. Wokeup, had breakfast **(Its 3 hours, you will get hungry, it will distract you, eat)**, drove to the test center listening to chillout tracks in the morning empty-handed, and went straight for the exam. Did all the pre-exam stuff and got seated promptly for the exam. Took a deep breath. clicked start. I took 50 minutes for the first 20 and felt like I was never on earth going to pass, I remember others have mentioned the same about how they felt throughout the test and I told myself that I would continue to push through. I hit 50+ questions in 75 minutes. By then I was worried. Definitely not enough time for 150 questions. Maybe I'll just fail at 100 anyway? No push on. 90 minutes at 60+ questions. Oh it seems to be getting slightly easier. Did I do so badly till it's giving me freebies? 120 mins at 85+ questions. Hey it seems to be even easier and my pace is picking up, but I'm so gonna fail at 100! 135 mins at question number 100. Oh boy. 40 minutes for 50 more questions? I'm so dead I KNOW I FAILED. Submit. Blank screen. Exam ended. WHAT I FAILED ALREADY? Went out, took the slip of paper, and walked out without looking. Took a peep. Holy cow! IS THAT A TYPO? :) Exam guidances? Any for you? Sure. You read this far didn't you? Aside from those that are sprinkled in the content above.. hmm let's see.. Think like a manager/consultant? Yes.. I sure as hell was going to pick the technical answer sometimes, I was tempted, but I didn't. Of course, there are times when it's all technical choices, then yeah sure go ahead. Did any questions from quizzes I did appear? Yes and no. What do I mean? It's a well-written test, just not copy-pasted from your textbooks. If you memorized word for word, you're not going to see those words. You have to understand it. The majority of the questions felt unfamiliar, which is why everybody says it's difficult. It is not trying to trick you, it is testing your internalized understanding. You have to whittle it down to its essence to understand the options given to you. Yes, human safety is important, I've read that a hundred times but there are other things that are important too, don't ignore those! You wouldn't have a job if the humans are safe but other critical component of the business are lost! Inference and deduction are critical when reading the questions. What is the end goal the question is trying to achieve? Don't be distracted by distractors! If you consumed the book word for word without understanding what this exam is trying to gauge, you would still struggle to pass without internalizing core concepts and processes. MOST and BEST are normal things you face day to day even picking the BEST route to work with the LEAST amount of traffic, I never felt it to be something that had to be practiced thus my mention of its irrelevancy to me in Boson (Still a good test engine, especially the advanced options). More importantly, if you can't internalize the processes, MOST and BEST would be useless because you'd realized the answer choices would be impossible to compare since you have no idea what they are to make a proper comparison. You need to know the concepts to answer the questions in the exam, but the exam may not necessarily be trying to test those concepts. E.g. You need to know that a Steering wheel belongs to a car and it allows you to change the direction of a car, but not necessarily that the question is going to ask you ""What is the steering wheel for"". However if you never knew that the steering wheel is for a car, you would lose the ability to infer that the question was referring to a Car and not a Bike. Alright! with all that said, I wouldn't want to take it again. My brain hurts :) To those of you that come across my post however many years down the road it may be, I hope it helps soothe the uncertainty a little during prep, and I hope what I shared today runs through your mind when you feel like giving up in the middle of the exam and helps you to pass. Remember you are not alone, I experienced it too and I passed with what little experience I had, and what few materials I used. I didn't spend 2k on a crash course, I didn't sign up for anything, I didn't sit and listen to video lectures for hours. It is with this community that shared their experience that helped me pass, and with this post, I hope I can pay it forward to the community. We all have different ways of learning, and this is what worked for me. Thank you everyone for making me feel like I wasn't on this journey alone throughout. If this post ever helps you, do drop a note however many years down the road that you read this. It will make me very happy to know it helped you."

I have provisionally passed the CISSP exam on 13th July 2020! First of all, I would like to thank you for this r/. It helped me a lot when I was preparing for the exam and I promised myself that I must payback If I pass the exam. So, right now, Its time. *Sorry for my Grammar, Im not a native English speaker, but I want to share what I knew.* **Background:** 5.5 years of job experience as System Engineer, IT Audit (support financial audit), Compliance supervisor, and Cybersecurity Consultant (Mainly on Penetration testing). **Preparation time:** My actual preparation time is 2 months 14 days (According to the first material purchased date). Im not lying about the preparation time but I Give it All  I studied All the time that Im not working, sleeping, or eating. If my brain cannot take it anymoreI switch to my PS4..lol (Not more than 30 minutes) and come back to focus again!! **Material Used:** Its my style of learning that must trust the Official things the most, So, I never used the *All in one by Shon Harris* (Sorry.. and Rest in peace) as the others recommend but I heard from our community that Its one of the greatest books for main material except it may be too technical (I cannot say anything about this material, please correct me if I said anything wrong because I never crack this book). Here is the list that I used and score (from my point of view) related to it **PHASE 1: Studying (3 weeks)** **Cybrary  CISSP by Kelly H. (9/10)**: This is my beginning. Her videos are great. It makes you understand the concept of the CISSP and overview of the things you should know (and YES! You must seek for further details on other material). It makes you able to understand whats the official material talk about. I recommend this. (One deduction point for no details on cryptography topics, because Im very stupid in this part since I was in a University. I must fulfill all of this part from Sybex) **Sybex  CISSP Official Study Guide (9/10)**: This is the MAIN material that I used. I read it cover to cover, did all of the ends of chapters question within 2 weeks!! (And Of course!!, dont worry if you randomly open the book again after youre done, and dont know what Sutherland Model is.. Dont worry, Youll be fine later ...Read a cover to cover is just the beginning of this journey. ) It looks like a very thick book, and YES!! Its a thick book lol. But, if you try to read it chapter by chapter, youll be fine as long as you can answer YES I KNOW IT to the THE CISSP EXAM TOPICS COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER INCLUDE: topics at the beginning of each chapter! **PHASE 2: Practicing ( 1 Month)** **BOSON \[10/10\]:** As others said, This is the BEST material on my list. I used it as my secondary material. My style of learning may be weirder than others in our community. I didnt take the exam for a simulation test (A, B, C, D) and see the score, but I use the custom exam and put all 750 questions in 1 test. Then, I did it 1 by 1, even I choose the correct answer, I read all of the explanation (I keep reminding myself that I may luckily click on the correct one without a REAL Understanding of the answer) especially on the wrong choice, why its wrong, why my answer is correct... Then I use the custom exam again to random 150 Questions and did it as a simulation exam. At the point that I get more than 90%, I assume that I finished this material. (and take notes on other 10% that cannot answer correctly) **CISSP Official (ISC2) Practice Tests and Sybex Test Bank \[8/10\]:** This is another test bank that I used. I can say that this resource is used for testing your knowledge on Sybex book whether you know all of the terms and understand what it is only.Ive finished all of the Official Practice test book but not the extra Sybexs question bank (Maybe only 2 or 3 of the extra exam)  2 points deduction on very *straight through the point* question and *not combining each chapters knowledge in 1 question*. (and yes take other notes on other question that cannot answer correctly) &amp;#x200B; **PHASE 3: Revision and EXAM (All time left  1 day before exam)** \- At this point, you must know your weakness already. So, Read on that point. \- Google is your best friend at this phase. Google anything you cannot understand from the book (Even you read it 10 times), see the picture, view the random video, BUT! Keep in mind ... the details of it must be similar to the Sybex book. \- I use a random application on Play store (Mostly on Pocket Prep and Official App) to improve some small points when Im in any place that cannot read a book (Yeah! I mean toilet) and before going to bed. \- **Linkedin- Adam Gordon** (Thank you so much) Question of the day \- **IT-Dojo** Question of the day (Didnt watch all of it but it great too) \- **Discord** study group by ThorTeaches &amp;#x200B; So.. Heres come the **last week** before the exam, I used: **11th Hour Study guide by Eric Conrad (The famous one lol):** I cannot say that Im preparing for CISSP without this material lol. This material is recommended everywhere and I cannot skip it. And.. yeah, Its very good as everyone said. Great for the summary. I spent 2 days on this one (read line by line) **Thor CISSP Practice question #1 on Udemy :** This is the final material that I used to decide whether Im ready or not. Sit for real exam simulation on both of the question banks. Got 82% and 84% respectively. &amp;#x200B; **Last Day before exam** \- I watched Kelly H.s **why you will pass the CISSP** and Larry Greenblatt **- CISSP 2018 Exam Tips** And keep everything in mind. \- Before going to bed, did 20 questions (that Im very sure) to get more than 90%. The purpose is not to practice, but to tell myself YOU CAN DO IT. &amp;#x200B; On the exam day, I feel like I will fail all the time lol  after pass the question 100, I feel like this even more .. however, after 100 questions, I try my best to be calm, breath in, and out to start again You know.. It didnt help (hahaha) .. I feel like failing all the time like before, But I keep in my mind every single question THINK LIKE A MANAGER. And the exam ends at question 150 (That I feel 100% sure on that question lol). And walk out of the exam room, receive the exam result Then, tears automatically dropped after I saw Congratulation!!, body are shaking like 1 hour later. &amp;#x200B; **Tips:** \- This is very important; I will not (and you should not) compare which material is the most similar or closest to the exam. Because NONE OF IT ARE IN THE EXAM but COMBINING all of your knowledge is. You shouldnt seek for the brain dump or any pass guarantee. You should understand everything that the question asks and THINK LIKE A MANGER to answer as Kelly said. \- Read the question 2 times, Read the answer 2 times, eliminate at least 2 choices, and choose the BEST one. \- There is no point that you feel 100% ready for the exam just set it for yourself. **Extra** \- Endorsement turn around process in this period is very fast, I get all the process done (Include AMF) in only 8 days. &amp;#x200B; Any questions, you can PM me if I could help and not Break the ISC2 Ethics, I'm willing to help. Good luck!!"

Reading everyone's reports about the congratulations screen at 100 questions got my hopes up. When my exam didn't end at 100, my heart just sank. I managed to recollect mentally and hunker down for the remaining 50 questions but man did my mind waver. If there's any advice I have to give: hide the question number counter. It doesn't do you any favors to be constantly reminded of where you're at. I studied for roughly a year using just the Sybex CISSP textbook and Wiley MCQ database. Wiley is showing that I slammed exactly 60 hours of MCQs. For those of us who tend to commit terms to muscle memory, it's not that useful. I didn't receive a single definition or technical question. Everything was process oriented. If you understand the material, and more importantly, can decipher the true meaning of a question, that's half the fight. My history: I grauted Dec 2016 with a Bachelors in Accounting. I got my start with an IT audit function at a Big 4 firm and obtained my CISA in 2018. I subsequently transferred out to industry Internal Audit later on. All of my cybersecurity knowledge is theoretical, with no practical application. If a guy like me who ticks boxes and draws circles on screenshots can pass the CISSP, you can too."
96,cybersecurity,cissp,Where to go after CISSP+CCSP?,1,i0bit6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/i0bit6/where_to_go_after_cisspccsp/,2020-07-30 09:48:07,"Hi all, I passed my CISSP last year and recently passed my CCSP. I've been working in InfoSec (directly) for coming up on 2 years. Prior to that, I was a SysAdmin for 4 years and before that I was an IT Consultant for a few years. At my current job, I'm not entirely sure whether I see any room to advance into a new rule aside from moving into a ""senior"" role. We have a small IT Team and my manager and the CIO are both middle-aged and have been at the company for over 15 years (they don't plan on retiring or leaving any time soon). I'm at a crossroads right now since I'm not really sure where to go from here. I love being a techie and staying up to date on the latest nerdy trends, but I also would like to ultimately become a manager within the next few years. I saw the CEH cert and got excited about the material, but after briefly researching on Reddit it seems like that's not really a very prominent cert. I've considered the CISM, but some folks say the CISSP pretty much overlaps that already. Then I thought of maybe going back towards networking (CCNP and CCIE) but that seems like really a completely different direction than where I am now, right? Some friends suggested getting into basic development, like Python, since it might help me learn some coding/scripting that could be relevant for my job. I haven't really looked into that, but it sounds interesting. I really wouldn't mind going back to school, too, whether it's an MBA for leadership, something in cybersecurity to advance my current career, or something in computer science to add to my repertoire, but even then it seems like a lot of the programs out there are relatively new and not well regarded. I realize the decision is completely up to me and ""depends"" on a lot of variables, but I'm wondering if anyone here has any personal experience or even just an opinion/some thoughts to help me out? I'm super confused what to do next."
97,cybersecurity,cissp,CISSP and complementary certs and programs,1,i0ylhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/i0ylhb/cissp_and_complementary_certs_and_programs/,2020-07-31 11:30:25,"For a long time I was a network engineer who was at one point a CCNP and a CCDP but got bored with it after 20 years. One day I decided to tackle the CISSP after a manager I worked with as many of us were handed pink slips from Raytheon. I studied my a$$ off for 20 straight days and passed the exam the first time around near the end of 2017 when the test was still 250 questions. After that, a few months later I decided to tackle the CEH and in 14 days of moderate study I barely passed (72%). I wanted to have a management cert and a semi tech cert to complement it. For both exams I used the most popular books for each (gold book for CISSP and sybex for CEH) and cccure. When I got my second job after Raytheon my company took me to train for CCISO. The class was great as well as some website that had a bank of 348 study questions. I did well on that test (87%) out of 150 questions in just over 100 minutes. It felt like what getting a CRISC would be if it had sex with a CISM test. Feeling a little motivated I pursued ITIL foundations to get a process cert. It was easy. I went through the Axelos book and studied a sample bank of study questions for 40 bucks and passed 3 days later. A month later the ECC offered me the opportunity to be grandfathered into CNDA since I was an active CEH with a government consulting background. I submitted documents and paid the 200 dollar fee and that was it. Perhaps the easiest one out of the bunch. Since I was in auditing and conducting assessment for GRC activities I decided to do the CISA but a friend of mine just got the CISM. He told me to study the ""ISACA Real Exams"" videos presented by Cisco. After 5 days of intense study going over 5 or 6 different 90 to 110 minute videos with 100 questions each, I passed with a 504/850. 2 week later I decided ""what the hell, why not take the same approach for the CISA."" I studied 7 days at 4 hours a day to pass the CISA. I did not exactly crush it getting a 468/850 (450 is passing). During all this after my CISSP program, I started my masters program in Cybersecurity Management and Policy at University Maryland Global Campus. The great thing about doing a masters course or any program while getting certs or shortly certs is it will quickly fill up all your CPE requirements. Getting other certs is also a great way to get CPEs btw! Right now I am studying for PMP. I went through the app process and have been studying for 16 days thus far and plan to take the 5th of August. If I can get that then I will be in a select category that has an advanced degree in tech or management, a CISSP, and a PMP. The cool thing about CEH is that under DoD initiatives 8570 and newer 8140 is that it is the only CSSP (Certified Security Service Provider) cert that fills 4 of the 5 categories (CSSP Analyst, CSSP Infrastructure Support, CSSP Incident Responder, CSSP Auditor). CISM and CCISO each give me an IAM 3 level cert and they are also a CSSP manager cert (only CSSP category that CEH is not). A CISA is a CSSP Auditor cert and its one of 2 IAT level 3 certs. Of course CISSP covers both IAT and IAM level 3 but none of the CSSP categories. Recently I was aggressively pursued for a job with a high rate because it required a BS degree, a CISSP, a CISA, and a CEH. I did not take it but it it shows you how having multiple certs and a spectrum of areas can make you very marketable. Overall I did a masters and 7 certifications in about 26 months. Its definitely not impossible but 7 certs is not necessary but I recommend having 3 or 4 that complement your background and predilections. After PMP I am going for CCSP and a basic AWS cert to cover cloud and then its a wrap. Keeping up with the CPEs will be a challenge but for now I get plenty teaching cyber part-time but the annual fees will be about 1000 a year even after spending over 5k just for the tests! Hopeful this novel helps someone or motivates someone as well as providing some useful insights and/or perspectives. &amp;#x200B; Eric Davidson MS, CISSP, CISM, CISA, CCISO, CEH, CNDA, ITIL"

There were more technical questions than ""business"" questions, but they were not very low-level. I used [ITPro.tv](URL Cybrary, PocketPrep, and CCCure for practice exam access only and the ""How to Think Like a Manager for the CISSP Exam"" book on Kindle Unlimited. I studied very casually over about three to four weeks which the last week putting in an hour to an hour and a half a night. Overall, I feel like the ITPro and Cybrary (both use Kaplan) practice exams were outdated and some of the concepts were no longer best practices. I tried to watch some of the ITPro and Kelly Handerhan videos, but I didn't feel like I was learning anything. The Pocket Prep questions were the most similar to what I experienced on the exam (It was also the cheapest resource). CCCure didn't differ significantly from these and I only made it through a couple hundred of those and stopped due to the redundancy.

Was exposed to various projects that touch all 8 domains. However, I still consider myself to be a bit more technical (did mostly pen tests, vuln / threat management, and hands on security architecture and engineering stuff) so thinking like a manager was quite challenging for me. My study plan was all over the place. I was so overwhelmed with the amount of material covered for this exam that I felt like I needed to get a hold of every CISSP book and video course that Redditors recommend. Now I would like to share a clean, step-by-step study plan that I wish I had when I was preparing for this beast so that you can slay and conquer it too! &amp;#x200B; **1.** (Duration: 2 weeks) Start with **Kelly Handerhan** videos on **Cybrary**. This course isnt comprehensive but she does tell you what to focus on for the exam and it provides a good overview of what youll read in the official CISSP study guide book. Youll learn about the CISSP mindset which will be helpful while studying for the exam and taking the practice tests. Also great explanation of technical concepts such as Cryptography and Kerberos. **Take notes** as you go along! Mark the topics that she says are important. Link: [URL Watch Module 4: Cryptography section on this Microcourse: [URL **2.** (Duration: 4 to 6 weeks) Read the **(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide.** **All of it!** You may skip taking notes here though **(notes optional)**. Else youll take forever to get through this thick book! Just read it and try to focus on the important concepts mentioned by Kelly. If youre not a reader, then skim through all the pages. Do the practice tests for each domain as you go along. Link: [URL Also buy the **CISSP Official (ISC)2 Practice Tests**. These two can be purchased as a bundle. Do the practice tests for each domain as you go along. Link: [URL For every unsure / incorrect answer that you encounter on the practice tests, go back and reread it on the official study guide. **Note:** Make sure you take advantage of the interactive online study tools for these two books. Follow the instructions on the back of the books to access their online learning environment. But dont take the complete practice exams just yet! Just do the exams per domain. Also from this point forward, watch a couple videos from **ITDojo CISSP Questions of the Day** everyday on top of your assigned studies. Do it until you watch all of it. Link: [URL **3.** (Duration: 1 to 3 days) Read and understand BCP/DRP and SDLC by Larry Greenblatt found [here](URL I cannot stress this enough. **This was super critical to my success.** This will encourage and practice you to think like a manager / risk adviser. Keep at it until you understand the processes. Write the processes down. Tell a friend / a relative / your significant other about BCP/DRP and SDLC. Rubber duck them (also known as explain to them like theyre 5). Make sure you can confidently speak about the topic and explain it to other people. Do the quiz questions on the PDF. Link: [URL **Side note:** Some of the things that were very confusing to me while studying were SOC reports and types and ISO 27001 vs 27002. Kelly Handerhan did a great job explaining SOC 1 vs SOC 2 vs SOC 3 but she didnt differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2. Heres a quick helpful video: [URL Might also be helpful to understand what ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 are, how they differ, and how they relate to one another. I don't think you have to go into detail, just know the answers to the three questions I posed. Other than that the other laws / frameworks &amp; standards were easy to memorize / differentiate from one another. **4.** (Duration: 2 to 3 weeks) Now youre ready to take the comprehensive practice exams on the official study guide (6 bonus exams) and official practice test (4 practice exams). Again, for every unsure / incorrect answer that you encounter, go back and reread it on the official study guide. &amp;#x200B; **5.** **Optional:** For more practice tests, you may purchase the Boson CISSP practice exam. I find this to be too technical though and it costs $99! Although they provide great, detailed explanation for each question. A lot more detailed than Sybex. I personally think this isnt necessary if you go through all the materials I listed here. Also there are some people on Reddit who bought Boson but still failed. So in my opinion this wasn't critical for my success. Link: [URL Honestly if you're willing to spend another $99 on top of the Cybrary and book expenses, I recommend spending it on Larry Greenblatt's course instead. Along with the course comes a 100-question practice test which is the most similar to the actual exam out of all the practice tests I've taken. BUT, the correct answers are not provided so you would have to email them so that Larry can grade it... and Larry takes time to grade it... I've submitted my answer sheet to them 4 days before my exam and I haven't received a response or even just an answer sheet and now 3 days after I've passed my exam I still haven't heard anything from them. I think the reason is I may have had to buy a $450 half-day one-on-one review session with Larry which to me is too expensive so I just looked up some of the answers on Google lol. Took a lot of time but added to my knowledge. Plus he already has a lot of free (legal) material floating on the Internet (some of them I listed here - see #3 and #7) so I really don't think this is necessary either. Link: [URL &amp;#x200B; **Two weeks before the exam:** **6.** (Duration: 4 days) Read the **Eleventh Hour CISSP: Study Guide** to reinforce concepts. Do the top five toughest questions per domain since theyre there and theyre free! The more practice questions you do (from trusted, legitimate sources) the better! **7.** (Duration: 3 to 4 days) Watch **Larry Greenblatts free videos on YouTube** under the name **Max Quasar**. His process of elimination aka Spock and Kirk method helped me tremendously! Links: [CISSP Tips 2020 - Think Before You Act - With Larry Greenblatt](URL [CISSP Tips 2020 - SDLC - With Larry Greenblatt](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 1 ""Security and Risk Management""](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 2 ""Asset Security""](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 3 ""Security Architecture and Engineering""](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 4: Communication and Network Security](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 5: Identity and Access Management (IAM)](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 6: Security Assessment and Testing](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 7: Security Operations](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 8: Software Development Security](URL [CISSP Practice Question with Spock &amp; Kirk: Episode 9: Cloud Service Models](URL **8.** (Duration: 1 day) Two days before the exam, you may want to go over the BCP/DRP document on step 3 again. Just give it a quick read through. Make sure you still get it. **9.** (Duration: 17 minutes) One day before the exam, watch this video by Kelly Handerhan just to remind you of the CISSP mindset.

Everybody is different, but I don't recommend taking notes with this book because it will take you forever to get through it. I think it served as a good foundation for me though. \- Thor Petersen's CISSP Preparation Course (see sticky at the top of this Reddit) (9 / 10): This served as a great way to reinforce what the Shon Harris All in One course explained in extensive detail, using a different and more condensed format. \- Shon Harris Practice Tests / Official CISSP Practice Tests (both 7 / 10): Both did a great job of really challenging me and making sure I wasn't shell-shocked by the exam's difficulty. \- Kelly Handerhan's ""Why You'll Pass the CISSP"" and Larry's CISSP Exam Tips YouTube Videos (see stickies here): (10/10): I watched these two hours before the exam, and they did a phenomenal job of placing me in the right mindset, which is important.

Offensive Security and Cloud both look interesting to me right now, but I'm not 100% sure what I want to do next as I lack the exposure and have only been in cyber focused roles as a generalist for about 1.25 years. However, I do have enough experience in different CISSP domains from working in various roles for ~4 years such as sys admin, NOC analyst, and help desk to qualify for the full CISSP. I know that HR LOVES the CISSP and I understand that it's very marketable, but in the end it's a very big picture cert that tests breadth of knowledge and not depth. What are your thoughts? How did your lives change after getting certified?"

If something in an article sounds so outrageous as ""4 years of hard work and thousands of dollars is equivalent to a 3-hour exam at a fraction of the cost"", maybe see if you misread something. Maybe re-read the article and see if there are some key words you missed: [URL The secret is already in the title ""Equal to masters degree LEVEL"". Not to Masters degree, master's degree LEVEL. And the article goes on to clarify: &gt;The change will enable cybersecurity professionals to use the CISSP certification towards higher education course credit Can you see the part where it clearly states that is is in no way equivalent to a master's degree but equivalent to some amount of course credit? If we're unsure about the somewhat vague wording in the article, we can of course also look up what this ""RQF"" level means. Perhaps on the first google hit for ""What does RQF level mean"". [URL Wher there is a nice little paragraph explaining that yes, the size of the qualification matters. &gt;The size goes up from the smallest an Award, to a Certificate to the largest, a Diploma. All units on the RQF are awarded a credit number. One credit equals very roughly around ten learning hours. The thread I'm referencing is here: [URL There were only a few people that seemed to get that it clearly is not the exact same as a master's, with the top-voted comments all saying it's absurd. And even the people that knew it's different seemed somewhat confused. Reading comprehension is very important, especially on the web. Stop engaging with outrage pr0n on the internet, take an extra minute to see if you missed something essential when reading an article that sounds absurd or outrageous."

112,cybersecurity,cissp,Provisionally Passed 22 May @ 100 Questions,1,grazlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/grazlj/provisionally_passed_22_may_100_questions/,2020-05-27 12:24:35,"Long time lurker, first time poster, yada yada. I want to start by thanking everyone who contributes in this community on a regular basis. Your stories of struggles and victories have inspired me, your willingness to guide others has been more helpful than you know. I owe so much to so many of you. Background: I have 5 years IT and web admin experience plus 3 years in cybersecurity as a DoD contractor. TLDR: Passively studied for some time. Studied hard 3 months out. Cybrary and Thor video series were my primary. 11th Hour was a quick refresher. Boson Practice tests worth every penny. More on my journey... Ive been studying on and off for CISSP since August of 2018. It seemed that every time I would begin, I would find myself prioritizing something other than the massive books and the seemingly endless material... crazy right? My wife and I bought a fixer-upper, I got a promotion, we had our first child and a million other little things I wont bore you with here. In August 2019, I started with the Sybex books. What a snooze-fest. I appreciate the amount of content but I was studying late nights after putting my son to bed and after working all day. Falling asleep on my books was not how I wanted to spend my time. This is obviously a personal opinion, just not for me. Hardly used it. Switching gears, I went over and watched the Cybrary content with Kelly Handerhan. So thankful for her and her way of delivering that information. It really stuck for me. I know the content is no longer free (it was when I watched it) but if I had to pay, I probably wouldnt have and I would have missed out. I cant recommend this enough. If video-based presentations and slide decks work for you, absolutely check them out. The metaphors and analogies she uses really made things like Kerberos make complete sense, whereas if I had read it in Sybex, I probably would have had to read, re-read, then watch some convoluted YouTube video that overly simplified it and still not fully grasped the concept. I was taking too much time to get through the material. It was now February 2020 (5 months after getting serious). Enough with the dillydallying, I put my head down, finally put a date on the calendar, and put some skin in the game to the tune of a $700 exam fee. This was crucial. I cant recommend enough that you set deadlines for yourself. Remembering you have to pay to reschedule because you couldnt stay focused will get you back on track. I originally gave myself 2 months. Knowing that one video boot camp would not be enough, I decided to also watch the Thor Teaches videos on OReilly (which I had for free through work). Video courses seem to be my best way to absorb information. Another awesome resource. Thor is a little more dry than Kelly but I think hes also a little more in-depth. Great series. Highly recommend. I read the 11th Hour Book and spot-read areas of the CISSP Study Guide (Conrad, Misenar). I will also say that the Glossary in the back of that Study Guide is an awesome way to start building a word bank for flash cards. Side note, my exam was originally scheduled to be 29 April but was cancelled due to COVID. I jumped in and picked the next available date in my area with ended up being this past Friday. I got an extra month. The pressure was off. When all that happened, I took a break from the grind. This was a mistake. Dont let things sidetrack you or give you an excuse to slack off. You dont stop 100 feet from the summit to enjoy the view. Get to the top! Carrying on with my 600+ pages worth of notes, I decided to take some practice tests via Wiley that came with the Sybex book. The questions were ok and I felt like some sets were challenging. I took the advice of many here and hit Boson. Being completely honest, those tests crushed my spirit a little. I built out a tracker in excel to see how I was doing through each test. I could see if I was getting better or not and in which domains I needed to spend more time. I improved in most areas simply by taking my time and reviewing the explanations on every answer (right or wrong) after getting my scores. I will say when the test ended at 100 questions, I wasnt sure that I had passed. Clearly I either have a self-confidence issue or the test is designed to make you doubt every. single. answer. (I believe it is) Experience is your greatest ally on this test. Outside of that, memorization will get you a ways farther but only through true understanding of the concepts can you reach the finish line. Find a way that makes sense to you. Read, watch, take notes, understand, practice and repeat. Again, thank you to everyone here for the advice and to all of you still on your journey, keep grinding through. Cheers"

119,cybersecurity,cissp,Professional Development in Security Management: Passing The PMP &amp; CISSP,1,gcdvry,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/gcdvry/professional_development_in_security_management/,2020-05-03 07:01:59,"Hi All, I wrote this article last week to round out some PDUs for my PMP and shared it with my network on LinkedIn. Thought that maybe there'd be some nuggets in here for prospective CISSPs. Hope it helps! # Professional Development in Security Management: Passing The PMP &amp; CISSP ""How do I get ahead in Cyber Security?"" The number of options can be daunting and an alphabet soup of certifications can easily leave an aspiring practitioner frozen with indecision. [Reddit](URL user u/SinecureLife developed one of the most informative depictions of the overwhelming possibilities available, pictured in the chart below. This article is a guide to the Project Management Professional (PMP) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certifications for those looking to enhance their skillset and credentials. &amp;#x200B; URL Overview: Both the PMP and CISSP are considered top certifications in the field and require 5 years of documented experience as a practitioner of their respective domains. Both also offer associate level credentials for those who don't meet the experience requirements, as well as additional specializations once the initial cert has been earned. While the PMP is considered a challenging certification to attain, the CISSP exam is considered by most to be even more difficult. It is common to fail one or more attempts before passing either exam and doing so should not be cause for discouragement. The main difference between these two certifications is subject matter; the PMP is applicable to all aspects of starting, executing, and closing (i.e., ""managing"") a project, while the CISSP is a broad treatment of the existing body of information security knowledge from a management perspective. Both cover a broad range on information and can be described as ""a mile wide and an inch deep"". Many consider the PMP to be a ""mini-MBA"". &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL ### Value: Why do people commit hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to obtain these certifications? The main reason is that the return on investment is considered to be quite high, even in comparison to an MBA or other terminal degree. Additionally, many individuals find their desirability on the job market improves after obtaining one or both of these credentials. The CISSP meets numerous requirements under the DOD 8570 Information Assurance Baseline and PMP holders are increasingly included as a requirement for US Government contracts. Enterprising individuals are often able to use this information to help justify their companies contributing financially to classes and test registration fees. Both the Project Management Institute (PMI) and ISC offer professional networks among other certification holders and a myriad of opportunities to earn the necessary continuing education credits necessary to maintain the certification. The following statistics represent the average salaries of certification holders across the U.S. PMP Salary: National Average $66,137; Washington, DC: $71,988; San Francisco: $80,658 (Glassdoor) CISSP Salary: National Average $112,000; Washington, DC: $125,466; San Francisco: $146,964 (Payscale and ZipRecruiter) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL ### Testing Mechanics: Both exams are administered via Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) which means the questions get harder as correct answers are registered and the number of questions on the test varies, within a predetermined range, based on the test taker's performance. For example, the number of questions on the CISSP exam can range anywhere between 100 and 151 questions based on a proprietary algorithm and still end in either success or failure. The best advice is to do your best and stay relaxed, especially if the questions start to seem impossibly difficult (because that means you're doing great!) Both tests also include several unscored questions that are used to validate the quality and difficulty of the question for possible inclusion on future question sets. Since these questions aren't marked, use this information is remind yourself that questions which look like gibberish may be unscored and to simply do your best with the knowledge that it may not count. The CISSP and PMP both exam rely on choosing the ""best answer"". The tests frequently present 2 incorrect answers and 2 or more answers that are all technically correct. The most difficult aspect for many is identifying which of the correct answers is the ""best"" response to the prompt. This is also something that many practice tests don't accurately simulate. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL ### Preparation So, what does it take to pass these two exams? Hard work *and* smart work. The most efficient way to approach either of these exams is to set a schedule that roughly follows the following milestones: **Schedule a 1 week boot camp 2-3 months out from the date you plan to begin studying** * This is optional (though highly recommended) for CISSP, however PMP requires a 35-hour training before taking the exam, which this will satisfy * Use the 2-3 months for independent study. The boot camp should be a supplement to your existing efforts and an opportunity to fill in knowledge gaps, rather than a full-on crash-course * After attending the class you'll have a *much* better idea where you need to dedicate your effort and you'll be able to use that to form a plan for intensive study **Schedule your exam** * Your instructor will almost certainly tell you to schedule the exam as soon as possible. You never know more about the subject matter than you do in the 1-2 weeks after attending the course and your likelihood of passing begins to diminish after that window * Similarly, it is harder to study intensively for an extended period of time. If you schedule your exam for 5 days after your boot camp it will be much easier to maintain focus and avoid distractions than if you wait 2 weeks or more * Use the time between your course and the exam to focus on studying. This means maintaining your normal routine except for time wasting activities.. Keep going to the gym, don't miss meals or activities, but use the time that you might normally invest in Netflix or Facebook studying instead **Take the Test** * The night before: put down the books. You've done all you can at this point and research shows your retention and overall performance will actually go *up* if you do something to unwind. Have a nice dinner, watch a movie or read a book, and get plenty of sleep! * Caffeinate. Both exams are long and full of wordy questions. You may find yourself reading the prompt multiple times just to decipher the intent of the question. Don't use the exam as an opportunity to experiment with deviating from your morning routine, especially if it normally includes a cup of tea or coffee. * Relax. If the test doesn't go your way you can always take it again. Performance anxiety and excitement feel very similar to your body so try to reframe any nervousness as anticipation to gain a mental edge. * Take breaks. Every 25 questions (or less) follow the testing center procedures to leave your station, go to the bathroom, or otherwise move around a little. In PMI and ISC testing centers this can be onerous, as it requires signing out, showing your ID, and for some even turning out your pockets, but *it's worth it*. Breaks will help keep you focused when you return to your testing terminal. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL ### After the Test * As soon as you finish you'll find out whether you passed or not, either from an on-screen prompt or when you check out of the testing center * If you didn't pass: Don't get discouraged! You're in the good company. Many PMP and CISSP certification holders don't pass their first time. Take time to unwind and focus on other things before you repeat the process for the next testing window * If you passed: Congratulations! You'll want to follow the necessary registration requirements from PMI or ISC, including endorsement, if necessary, and wait for the official confirmation of your results * Once confirmed (this process can take 6 weeks or more in some cases) be sure to update your resume and LinkedIn profile. You'll also want to make entries in your calendar to remind you of membership renewal dates * Plan ahead for your continuing education credits. Both certifications require a number of professional development hours to be logged in order to maintain membership. The last thing you want to do is let all of your hard work go to waste! ### Conclusion **Thank you for taking the time to look through this guide. Good luck on your journey and please feel free to get in touch with any questions. I will do my best to answer them!**"

I've never been a quick test taker and have never taken a test where I can't go back and look at the previous questions. That being said I was expecting to finish in about 2 hours to 2 and a half hours. Instead I took 2 hours and 59 minutes and 58 seconds. Not being able to go back made me extremely cautious before clicking the next button. Still though a pass is a pass. &amp;#x200B; Some background info on me. I've been working in IT for about 15 years although I've spent more than half of it at a shitty call center doing tech support. In the last several years though I've gotten my shit together, left that POS call center, skilled up, and held several jobs from server admin to network engineer. In my current role I'm part of a team that is responsible for the IT infrastructure for a community college. Also, I'm currently attending said community college and will earn my BS in Cybersecurity in August. Through the college program's curriculum and in preparation for CISSP I sat for and passed A+, N+, Sec+, and SSCP. I truly believe this helped my preparation. &amp;#x200B; The materials I used study are: * [ucertify.com](URL (this was the ""book"" provided to me by the college, I think its based on the Sybex book) * Mike Chapple videos (after watching him for Sec+ and SSCP I can tell that something like 50% of the videos are reused but maybe the repetitiveness helped) * Kelly Handerhan videos (Much better than the Mike Chapple videos) * Boson pracice exams (like everyone else says the explanations and being able to see where you're weak is the best reason for using Boson) * 11th hour exam book (started reading this about a week before the exam as a refresher and I found it to be clear and to the point) * [CISSP Discord](URL (Been part of this since the beginning but never really said much. There are amazing people there ready to help and there have been Q&amp;A sessions from people like Adam Gordon and Wentz Wu. &amp;#x200B; While everyone has their own way of doing things the best advice that I can give is to stay calm and read the questions carefully so you know what they're asking for. The exam is a roller coaster of emotions and most people (me included) will feel like they're failing before they've made it halfway though. If you believe in yourself, in your abilities, and keep answering the questions you might just surprise yourself with how good the result is. &amp;#x200B; \-Good luck"

125,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed today,1,ezsper,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/ezsper/passed_today/,2020-02-07 00:57:38,"Hi all, I just passed the exam (@100Q in around 1.5 hours). My experience has been similar to others, not may technical questions (but I'd say a good amount) and as usual the questions where you have to make a decision on what to do (so yes, think like a manager). My background: quite a few years (15) between network and security as a consultant. Member of OWASP, some certs (CEH, OSCP, AWS Admin and previously some Cisco), currently working for a cybersecurity vendor. So, in my case, domain 4 wasn't really something new. And I am comfortable with anything related to pentesting or app security. The tougher sections were risk management and security operations. I don't think I have a particularly good memory so I hate having to memorise lists, but I'd suggest remember at least the main ones. I started studying ages ago, but let's say I've focused properly in September. Having a full time job didn't make it easy, as I had to study when I finished and most of the weekends. I've probably over-studied, but better safe than sorry :-) **Study material**: I've used the official Sybex books (mainly for reference, I only read 2-3 chapters completely). I'd definitely avoid reading the CBK (it's way too much info) and also the Shon Harris. IMHO most of what you need is in the Sybex. My attention span is probably not the best, so I got bored reading and started watching videos (Kelly's - definitely the best). I also used some videos on Linux Academy, as I have a subscription from work, but didn't find them particularly good, TBH. Then decided to go straight to the tests and Boson is \*very\* good (I think it's the best). They basically formulate the questions similarly to the exam. No need to memorise them, as you'll hardly find one Q similar, but I thought it was great. I'd also suggest the free questions from McGraw Hill. I've also used Pocketprep (full version), which was ok to memorise some terms and useful when travelling (although the app suffers a bit when there's no connection and found it slightly buggy). I thought also the questions from the official Sybex (companion) book were also very helpful in terms of understanding the concepts. By the way, I've used Safari/O'Reilly subscription which will give you access to all the books you need for a decent price. I'd suggest doing that (but I know some people prefer having ""real"" books :-)). I believe the best help came from the discord channel maintained by SHP07. Kudos to him to invest time and money to allow people to exchange opinions and discuss questions and topics. I'd suggest using the channel and also support him with a donation. I've learned a lot from the people there on how to approach the questions and think like a manager. The exam is tough, but not that crazy as I was expecting. There are definitely questions where you'd know the answer straightaway, others that will require some thinking, but I'd say in most cases you will be able to exclude two of the answers. I can echo what others said in terms of questions (SOC, access controls, etc.) . 4-5 questions I had to idea about, but they were probably part of the experimental questions (I mean you either knew what that was or not :-)) I didn't think I had many questions about Cloud, specifically. Warning: every exam is different, so your might be completely different. I had more questions on security operations, but probably cause I've answers them incorrectly. As others pointed out, it's useless trying to remember the questions/answers, I'd suggest trying to understand why and why not for the questions. Oh by the way, I've used some mindmaps and excel spread sheet to help me with memorising things. It'd probably help also reviewing them just before the exam, &amp;#x200B; That is all, now some days of rest and probably CCSP next :-)"

I wanted to do something better, something more challenging, something where I feel the importance of my work but I didn't knew what I wanted. Looked into multiple departments (Wintel, Networking, etc), spoke to different professionals and decided to go with a career in Cyber Security. I'll be honest with you guys, I had zero knowledge about cyber security but I was fantasized, fascinated by watching YT vidoes, reading articles on security roles (I guess that's how people choose their career to become an Astronaut, Pilot, Army, Cybersecurity etc). Also, I wouldn't lie that money was one of the reason for me to choose this career, afterall everyone wants to secure their future. So, I flew to Ireland to study masters in Cybersecurity and completed it in October 2019. Since then I keep on applying for security related jobs across Ireland and have applied for 100+ jobs. I was able to attend only 2 interviews, one for pentesting, other one for API security. Even though I was able to answer most of the questions on pentesting tools and OWASP Top 10 theoritically, unfortunately was rejected for both the roles. I'm not afraid of rejections but I'm upset about not getting enough interview calls. My question is how do you screen a candidate with 4+ years of exp in other domain for security roles? Am I doing wrong, trying to switch my career in security after these many years of experience. How do I let them know, I'm ready to start my career from level 1 security? Can you please advice me, how should I approch an organisation for at least getting my profile short listed of an interview?"

But life happens and I ended up in IT (\~8 total years). Worked a couple tier 1 type Help Desk jobs for about 5 years. I've spent the last 2.5 years in Cybersecurity directly. My position, while ""entry level"" has offered me exposure to all of the domains to some degree (with Software development probably the the domain I had the least exposure to prior to my exam). I've also received 2 SANS certifications while in this position, which while substantially different in test TYPE, the material I was exposed to was a useful base to build upon. &amp;#x200B; I don't have anything new to add for study tips. This subreddit is filled with all of them already. But for reference - I read the CBK, the Sybex study guide, Eric Conrad's 3rd edition Study guide, and the 11th hour. I also watched the Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, Cybrary, IT dojo and other random YouTube videos. I took the Wiley practice tests (both from their study guide book and the other one they have), I did the questions in both the 11th hour and the other Eric Conrad book. I bought Boson and went through those on random a ton. I found a couple apps for my phone. I read this forum. I probably studied on (and off) for about 6 months (I got sick for a bit where I didn't do anything and December was pretty week sauce for studying with everything I had going on.) I kind of realized I did everything short of a bootcamp and figured I really need to bite the bullet and take the exam. &amp;#x200B; My best tip is when you hear that it's a manager exam or that actually it was more technical than someone expected because all they hear is think like a manger etc - is that you have to have the technical knowledge of the domains and then apply that technical knowledge in a managerial way. So more of an operational manager. If you work in operations/a more technical role, you wouldn't want you manager to have NO UNDERSTANDING of what you do, they wouldn't be able to do their job very effectively. &amp;#x200B; Further I'll echo that the questions are a bit weird (not all but a good number).

I have about 10 years of experience, between being enlisted in the Navy as an IT (8 active, 2 in the reserves) and two years experience as a network engineer working for a startup after my active enlistment. I studied for about three weeks specifically for this test, which isn't really relevant because the rest of my career feeds into each domain in some form or another. I got consistent high 70's, low 80's on Boson, and used the sunflower guide. My test experience was that of a high-level conceptual exam. I think I was weakest in domain 8 because it hammered me hard on it. About half of the test felt like common sense, the other half was some obscure nonsense that I had to read four times and guess at. Knowing the minutiae of port numbers and encryption key lengths will not get you there and is likely a waste of your time. The test will throw random scenarios at you, and you have to determine the best course of action. I'd say that 20% of the exam is gimme questions that anybody studying should be able to answer. The rest is up to your best judgement using everything you've learned, and putting the concepts together to answer something unfamiliar. Best of luck to all."

Very conscious about 1 minutes. Clicked started and used 10 minutes of the test to do more brain dump and wrote down on the note pad. **Go slow, stay calm, you can do this** I think my approach on the test day helped me passed: \- **Stay positive.** Never let the nervousness creeps up. Mentally: I have studied. Will sit and sort thru this. NEVER let my mind wandering like many people has said Failing thought, unsure, uncertain, garbage thought \- **Manage the clock:** Need to do 50 questions/ hr. I was only at 40 questions when 1:10minutes went by. Realized that I was behind, also with NO certainty about my answers. Stay in control and speed up a little bit. NOT thinking about PASS or FAIL. \- **At 98 questions 1 hours left.** Still behind but relative confident in time (NOT PASS or FAIL worry), manage the clock little better. Started to shake because mentally exhausted and thirsty - physically factors. Asked for break. Gobbled down water. Walked to the restroom stretching, chowed down a few grapes (less than 3 minutes). \- Back continued the battle!!! Reminder!!The clock wont stop when you are at break... \- **Not thinking of PASS or FAIL**. But conscious about the 100 marks questions. Passed 110, test still going, 115 mark/ stopped being conscious about test ending. \- **Mentally ready to 150 questions**. Then 130, stayed focus and realized that I was a head of the clock 20 questions/ 45 minutes left. \- **Gonna slow down**Go thru another 15 (questions is shorter and easy to read) and still have about 30 minutes left for 5 questions. Last 3 questions. Very slow. 150q/ I still have 22 minutes left. **Gosh/thinking I should have MORE questions.** I am wasting 22 minutes. \- **Test end.** Still calm. Not at all that I was certain anything. Hope pass of course but surprisingly I was feeling in control and ease when I was on my way back to the printer to collect my result. Prepared for whatever **REALITY**. \- **Proctor handed to me the paper.** Opened it up. Scrambling my eyes without knowing where to look Split second. I saw Congratulations I grasped and fell on my knee burst out oh my gosh \- **Passed? she went.** I said yes. She said Congrats I still could not collect myself/shaking because of elation, release, hungry, exhaustion, mix of everything for another 5-7 minutes. I let all factors take over me ha ha Be prepared for questions style (not the content): BOSON is the closest. The most, the primary, the least, the first, not and negative, etc. about the process, and stuff. There some questions, that so confusing with 3 elements tangling. I only know what were asked 10-15 max questions. The rest, apply the knowledge, strategies and picked. I know I answered 1 simple question wrong after clicking submit why???because all knowledge/**learnings dancing, playing tricks!**easily. **My personal secret sauce: 4 of them. Combination of these are my success. Missing any of them could lead to failure.** **1.** Know your stuff meaning study and/or experience. **2.** Read and reread question (2-3-4 times ok) &amp; read like a lawyer. **3.** Reasoning based on your knowledge and take managerial action with the presented scenarios. The key sauce! **4.** Command &amp; control the test and manage the clock."
135,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed 1/6/2019 went the FULL 150 questions!,1,eq0lne,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/eq0lne/passed_162019_went_the_full_150_questions/,2020-01-18 00:50:04,"Wanted to say thanks for all the posts to this site, they were helpful while I studied. What is not helpful were all the posts that say hey I passed in 100 question in 60 minutes! That will give you a false sense during the test if the test does not stop at 100 (more on that later), and dont let that get in your head! It almost got me! My background: I have been in a variety of IT roles over the last 30 years in the Army, as a defense contractor and a Government Employee. Im currently trying to transition into a more focused cybersecurity role. This test is hard but not impossible, not in terms that you have to memorize things, but you have to know how everything works together (if that makes sense). My background is in Networks and Software Development so that helped. I have the A+, Network+, Security+, CCNA certs from 20 years ago so that experience helped somewhat. Ive worked partially in all the other domains, Im a master of none of them. I definitely think my work experience got me over the hump. I started studying for this back in August 2019, and went really serious November and December. This last month I just wanted to get over it. Source Material: I used some of the recommendations I found on this site. AIO: This was the first book I looked at and I quickly got discouraged. 8 long meandering chapters, topics all over the place, not readable. I put that book aside after the first 100 pages. Sybex: The domains are split into 21 chapters and it is much more readable. This also comes with an electronic tester. This breaks down the topics under the test items (example: 1.7 - Identify, analyze, and prioritize Business Continuity (BC) requirements). This was easier for me to zero in on topics I was not sure of. The AIO book is just one big chapter per domain. Essential CISSP (Phil Martin)  this book breaks the topics down into 75 chapters. If you are like me with a short attention span this is a good book for going right to the heart of the matter. Chapters are 3 to 5 pages long packed full of information. So if you only have time for 30 min study sessions I recommend this book. 11th Hour book: Its a good overall summary of the CISSP domains, but you will have to go into detail with the other sources. If you are new, and have no clue, this would be a good place to start to get a general understanding. BOSON test simulator: like a majority of people have said here, this is the best learning tool out there. Forget about memorizing any questions, thats not going to work. The simulator will point out which areas you are weak in, thats a tip to you to go back and do some research on the topic. I was only scoring low 800s on randomly generated exams in the end. Kelly videos: I watch the free videos up on the Cybrary website, they were somewhat helpful as an overview, but like the 11th hour book, you will have to dive into the topics elsewhere. They are good if you have no clue what you are doing. The test: The questions are fairly straight forward, nothing that made me scratch my head, but you did have to sit back and think. The strategy of eliminating two answers worked for some items, but not all cases. The first 30 or 40 questions I zoomed through in about 20 minutes, I thought this was going to be easy. And by question 50 they started to get a little harder and by question 90 I was like, OK this will end soon at 100. And I pressed that next button at 100 and.. 101. Shit!! OK a few more105, 106, and the questions are not getting easier. When I went to 150 I honestly thought I failed I had already resigned myself to take it again. I got wrapped up in that mindset that you just need to go to 100 or so questions to pass. BS. I gathered my thoughts together after question 110 and figured OK, they are giving me a chance to pass here slow down and read the questions. I think what I did in the beginning was zip to fast through the easy questions and I probably got some of them wrong. There were literally some real easy questions, I saw them and went right for the answer I thought it was without looking at the other answers. That probably tripped me up. 3 hours is a lot of time to answer questions so do not get wrapped up in this running out of time mindset. Take it slow, read the question no matter how easy it seems and look at all the answers. Dont zoom through it, it can cost you $700. In retrospect if I had to do it over again I would stick with the Sybex and AIO books and use the electronic questions from both (I didnt use the questions from the AIO book because I thought they were meandering all over the place and I was wrong, they are just as good a source of questions as BOSON and Sybex). After reading the Sybex book, I would recommend going someplace quiet and just reading the AIO chapters one at a time. For example, chapters 1-4 in the Sybex book contain all of Domain 1. After you understand all 4 chapters in the Sybex book, turn to the AIO book to see how they put it all together. Repeat. Make your own notes as you go through the material. Forget about memorizing questions, use the question banks to see where you need to study, I cant stress that enough as others have said. Take your time on the test and dont get wrapped up in passing at 100 questions that will screw you up if you go past 100. If you do, just keep your head down and keep answering questions the best you can. Going past 100 does not mean you are failing. In the end this is pass or fail so dont get hung up on scores because you are not going to see one anyway."
136,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed 1/17,1,er9bxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/er9bxp/passed_117/,2020-01-20 17:25:51,"Finally done! First attempt, 82 minutes 100 questions. First, let me say that this exam is not as hard as it is eluded to in this sub. Those of you reading this that don't know if you are ready or not to sit the exam, don't let the posts in this sub scare you into pushing back that exam date. I have started and stopped studying for this exam probably 6 times over the past 3 or 4 years. I was petrified, I was ready to get crushed by this exam that everyone said had them thinking in circles for 3 hours before sending them packing. Background - I have 7 years in IT, a B.S. in cybersecurity, started on the helpdesk and I'm currently the director of Infosec at a Fintech startup, enrolled in an M.S. program this spring. I have a demanding job, 2 young children, a wife, 2 dogs, a house to maintain and I'm the VP of a non-profit..... If I can do it you can do it. Study material - Sybex, Boson, cybrary, larry Greenblatt, study notes and theory, IT dojo Study strategy - My goal was to barely pass, and by that I mean study for the fewest amount of hours I could get away with, be efficient if you will. I started by reading Sybex, I made it to like chapter 4 and realized that this was not the way so I looked at the test objectively. Cert tests are weird because you can take them whenever you are ready as opposed to say a college course final where you started the course 16 weeks ago and that 16 weeks is the time you have to absorb the information for the final exam, you remember what you remember and that's it. realistically you could study until you memorized every single page in the sybex but that would take forever and at least for me be completely unachievable. So I bought the Boson test questions and started going through them in study mode. If I got a question where I didn't know what one or more the answer choices was I would write them down in a word doc. I did this for every single one of the Boson, Study notes and theory, and IT Dojo questions, something like 1300. By the time you start getting to the end of the question banks, it seems like there is very little you don't know. The last Boson bank I think I scored like 82 or something, study notes and theory I was in the 50's because his questions are crazy hard. If I wanted insight into something say like Kerberos, I would watch Kelly go over it. My advice is don't start out by watching cybray videos or reading the Sybex. Jump directly into the practice tests and figure out what you don't know, then spot study that material. Test experience - The actual test questions where not that hard, much easier than anything on study notes and theory. Honestly for all the talk that kelly and larry do about the ""think like a manager, don't just fix stuff"" I can't think of a single question where I had to decide between a technical fix and a managerial decision. What I can see makes these tests difficult is the English, It is VERY well written. They use uncommon synonyms etc. Reading Comp is the single most important thing you need to have to pass this test. I think the answer choices make this test difficult as well, there is rarely a question you read and you immediately spot the perfect answer in the choices provided. You have to analyze each answer and mentally go through this ""could be that one... ooo but that one is better.... man its a toss-up between these two, better just flip a coin. its exhausting. Specific stuff \- As others have mentioned make sure you know all the SOC stuff that helped me A lot \- Know OWASP in and out \- Know all the different names for stuff, for example, hashing could also be called one-way encryption, even though no one would EVER call it that. If there is something that has two or three different names, they will use the most obscure one guaranteed. TL'DR- \-Expose yourself to as many test questions as you can get your hands on and target study every question or answer you don't fully understand. \- Have a very firm grasp on English \- Know the most obscure names for common things you come across in the practice tests. Good luck!"

I studied my weak areas, came up with memorization techniques for various topics, did some practice questions, and none of it came up on the exam. I've read three different books, attended a boot camp, watched Skillset and Cybrary videos, and nothing. I keep seeing posts about how people have been in this field for 6 months or only studied for 2 weeks and manage to pass. It just shows how bogus this adaptive exam is. My background is 9 years in the field, BS in Comp Science, MS in Cybersecurity, Net+ and Sec+."

I want to start out by saying thank you ahead of time for any help. Background: Im fresh out of college (May) with a degree in Digital Forensics. I recently took the security + test and passed. My career dream is to be a CISO and I quickly learned the value of the CISSP cert. I started my job in June as a cybersecurity consultant on the business side. I help with a lot of risk assessments, data classifications, IR Plan development, BIA &amp; BCP development. Im also very familiar with the NIST 800-53 rev 4. 1. What are the best study tools for someone thats new in the field? 2. The security + cert and my degree should take two years off the requirement, right? 3. How long do you suggest me to study? 4. Does anyone want to make a study group? I am the worst at studying! I kinda wing things but thats not going to cut it for the CISSP test. Thank you!!"
141,cybersecurity,cissp,Late Post: Officially Passed! 150 questions 12/03/2019,1,e6yz1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/e6yz1c/late_post_officially_passed_150_questions_12032019/,2019-12-07 00:48:11,"Hey all, waited to post this because I wanted to make sure it wasn't a PearsonVue center fluke with a provisional passing. I sat and took the CISSP exam on Tuesday (12/03/2019) and had provisionally passed, just getting the official passing email from (ISC)\^2 yesterday afternoon. I've got to say, I was sweating throughout it, I knew from others that it was an adaptive test, and a few posts I've lurked on showed anywhere from passing at 111 - 137 questions. So when it had me go through the full 150 I was so terrified of making one wrong move and not passing it, it by far was the first test so far I felt my heart pounding in my chest before opening the results. Background: Just recently transitioned over into IT and Cybersecurity this year actually! Was doing more financial based work previously, but I found a program through a college (not sure if I can name it based on subreddit rules) that had incorporated industry standard certs (A+, Net+, Security+, Project+, CAPM, Linux+, SSCP, CISSP, and CEH) as the final exams for college credits while I get my bachelors and started it January 10th of this year. I got my first IT job (Helpdesk) back in May, and as of September I started working as a Security Admin for a CyberSec company. Prep: For a total of about three months I studied the uCertify CISSP Prep Textbook, watched through Mike Chappel's LinkedIn Learning video lectures, and as well used Kaplan question banks to prepare and focus in areas that I wasn't strong in. The best piece of advice I could say is if you're doing practice exams, don't just speed through it, if you get something wrong, read the reason as to why you got it wrong, learn from it, grow in your areas and really understand the content, not just get familiar enough with the question."

143,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed at 100 Questions - A review,1,eaq10u,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/eaq10u/passed_at_100_questions_a_review/,2019-12-15 09:00:27,"Me: * 6 years experience in low-level programming * 5 years experience on full stack web development * 3 years cybersecurity experience Resources * Boson Practice tests * Sybex 8th Edition full book * Sybex practice exams and questions Notes on passing * I sat one Sybex practice test and one Boson practice test to gauge how much work I needed to do. It highlighted three categories (consistently between both exams) that I focused on: asset management, identity and access management, risk management. * The sybex questions are worded easier but they still flex your ability to recall the information, the Boson questions are worded closer to the actual exam - it's that tricksy wording that will throw you. For example (and not from the exam) - we all have heard and know ""change management"" but Boson has referred to this as ""Control of variances"" which can mean the same thing in a given context. Being aware of what the control should be independent of the name used to express it is important * Boson questions are important, I don't think I would've passed without that $100 to shore up the gaps * Memorising the following was helpful * the OSI model for name of the data unit, devices you expect in that layer and what they do/why you need them, * the TCP flags and their reasons for activation * risk management formula and how to use them (which becomes pretty self explanatory after you've used them in anger a few times: this is were Sybex questions were good, as there are a dozen or so that could exercise this for you.) * wireless channels, and their throughput, cable distances and throughput Prior to the exam, I was scoring 65-75% depending on the practice test and how I felt. After a bit of concentrated study on the weaker areas, I started pushing 70-85% - that's when I took the test. On a bad day, I could still fail, but odds were in my favour that I'd likely pass. I think the one piece of advice I have to give, was one I found lurking this subreddit for ages: think like a manager. Does the question put you in context of an advisor? Then advise to senior management. You're not trying to be _right_ in the real world, you're trying to answer the question with the information given to you."

Ultimate goal is to obtain a job in cyber security maybe as a CISSP or CCSP (since clouds are becoming very popular nowadays). I know I need 5 years of experience (or 4 with a college degree) to obtain a CISSP so I may get a job doing some IT after college, I imagine this is where Security+ may come in handy.

I didn't really study all too much for this exam, but that's mostly because of what I did leading up to registering to take the exam. I did one practice exam from Boson and created some flashcards based on the Sunflower PDF and reviewed them once or twice. What was most instrumental in my passing was recently completing my Bachelors in Cybersecurity at WGU, and the associated certs that came along with that. I came in to the test with an SSCP, and CCSP completed through WGU which probably helped the most along with a class focused on encryption. The CCSP was probably the most helpful based on what I saw on the test. If you're a Cybersecurity graduate, have the CCSP, and are a good test-taker you should be able to do well on this test with minimal extra study."

It was my first, and thankfully only, attempt. There is really no describing what the test is like and I am very happy I do not have to do it again. It always made me scratch my head when I read posts made by individuals who passed the test that stated they were convinced they were failing during the test when in fact they had passed. How could so many people be convinced they had failed when in fact they had passed? Was it luck? Well I can tell you that I experienced the same exact feeling during the test, and it wasn't just a ""man this is hard I do not think I am going to pass"" feeling. It was a ""Wow I really didn't study enough - what arrogance I had to even sit for this exam? I should just walk out right now, this is embarrassing"" type of feeling. I always thought the time limit of 3 hours was such a joke because I was cruising through 150-question practice tests in 60-90 minutes, It took me an hour to get to 20 questions yesterday. The last 50 questions I was doing as fast as possible because at that pace I was not going to be able to finish in time if they made me go to 150. As for the test, It was as if each question comes across as both vague and extremely specific at the same time. The questions are easy to over-think while at the same time fairly straightforward if you read it carefully. Same goes for the answers. My Background: 5 years in Risk Management/ D&amp;O Insurance, 5 years in Cyber Insurance Underwriting and 6 months in Cybersecurity Strategy consulting. I have my Sec+ and that is the only cert I had before taking the CISSP. I always thought I would be swinging above my weight by attempting this exam but some (good) life things are occurring in the next few months so I decided to bite the bullet and schedule the exam so I would begin studying. I studied for 2.5 months straight with the last 4 weeks living and breathing the material. I used a lot of study material/methods, and some would say too many. It worked for me because I liked that I was hearing the same concepts and explanations described to me in different ways. While the content is basically the same, Kelly Handerhan and Thor Pederson and Shon Harris explain them in different ways with varying levels of granularity. It allowed me to put missing pieces together and better frame what a particular control, strategy, protocol, etc, was really about. This method was why I passed the test. You cannot simply ""remember"" what you read in a study guide to pass the test. It is very much how you apply what you learn in various scenarios, with an emphasis on process and prioritization. Questions like ""What happens IMMEDIATELY after....?"" and ""What is the most EFFICIENT way to..."" were the toughest questions because you had to understand how something works, or what the word ""efficient"" really means in that particular context. The questions on the exam seem as if they came out of the twilight zone. There is no other way to describe it. They are written in such a way that makes it difficult to even remember it after the fact. I could probably only regurgitate 2-3 questions that I got on the exam. I have outlined my study material, below, but I will say from the get-go, there is no test bank that comes close to replicating the question style in the real exam. You just won't find it. While Boson and the ISC2 Test App comes the closest, its really not that close. Primary study materials: 10/10 - Shon Harris Study Guide - as many say, this book is very dense but for someone without a technical background it was a very good read. I had to read Communications &amp; Network Security as well as Software Development sections twice because they were my weak areas but overall it is very comprehensive. 10/10 - MF Prod (YouTube): I almost never see this as one of the resources that gets utilized for studying for this exam. I don't know the guys name but to me, as far as ""bootcamp"" style lectures, this is the way to go. This guy does NOT mince words. It is EXTREMELY comprehensive. He explains concepts 5 different ways so you *really* understand what he is talking about. He translates technical concepts into layman's terms and back again. It is free and honestly I would not have gotten through the more technical aspects of the exam without having sat through the series. 9/10 - Boson Practice Tests - As many note, this is a great way to learn the material by taking tests, tailoring to weak areas, and having the concepts explained. As I mentioned earlier, the questions are really not at all like you will find on the exam. I am surprised that some people think they are similar. I would say they come the closest out of any test bank but they are not really that close. I would not have passed without this. 8/10 - Kelly Handerhan Cybrary: Very easy listening and she explains the concepts well. It feels like you're hanging out with someone rather than having her regurgitate material to you. I recommend watching at 1.25x speed because she talks slowly. 8/10 - Thor Perderson, Udemy: Sometimes hard to understand but it was a great supplement to the other video series I used. He explains some items in more detail than Kelly but not as much as MF Prod. This was just another vector to make sure I fully understood the concepts. 8/10 - 11th Hour - I read this book the day of the test. My test was in the afternoon so if you have the time it is a great way to keep all of the concepts fresh in your head walking into the testing center. Obviously, this should not be used as a primary study resource for most people, but it was helpful to me. There were a few questions on the test where I could directly pull from this book that I had read that morning. 8/10 - ISC2 Test App for iPhone: I would do 10 or 25 questions whenever I had any amount of free time. Standing in line somewhere, in the bathroom, in the elevator, before bed, when I woke up, on conference calls. It was a way to live the material as much as possible. Explanations aren't that detailed, however, so I would only use this to fill in some gaps to keep material fresh. 7/10 - IT Dojo YouTube Series - I watched maybe 25 of these. They were good to keep the material fresh but I discovered it too late to really be effective for me. I wrote or typed about 100 pages of notes. Total study time was about 125 hours, not including the time spent on the isc2 app. Happy to answer any questions but I am sure none of what I just said is new to anyone. Happy New Year"

It was a big help to me prepping for the exam. Especially the Boson exams, which I would not have found if it weren't for this group. Background: 30-ish years software development with MS tools and technology stacks, began stretching into cybersecurity in 2015; GIAC secure programming cert in 2016, GIAC web app pen testing cert in 2018. Current role is split between software development and cybersecurity advisor for a smaller business unit at \~100 employees. 10/10 - SANS 1 week CISSP bootcamp; course materials from this class were main prep materials. Highly recommend this class. I got my employer to sponsor me for this class. 10/10 - Boson exams; these were excellent in identifying weak areas; after each practice test determine 2 - 3 weakest domains and focus on those, take next practice test, rinse &amp; repeat. For me, the pratice tests were very helpful in getting me in 'game shape'. 10/10 - Larry Greenblatt's CISSP exam tips video; watched it a couple times the day before the test, very helpful in explaining how to understand and approach the test questions, especially the Spock &amp; Kirk metaphor. Do yourself a favor and watch this video - you'll be glad you did. Two other materials I tried but found weren't helpful for me were Kelly H's video and the Sunflower guide. These are popular materials but weren't helpful to me primarily because of the SANS class I took. What a great way to cap off the year! If I can do it - so can you. Aim high. Work hard. Stay focused.

148,cybersecurity,cissp,CISSP Official Study Guide,1,eir0wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/eir0wx/cissp_official_study_guide/,2020-01-02 12:20:54,"Hello all you wonderful people! I was wondering if any of you would have any wisdom to share regarding CISSP exam. Below I outline where I am at (long post warning!...sorry!) **Background:** I am preparing to take the exam on on the 7th of January. Here is what I did so far: 1. Read the Sybex official study guide cover to cover and did most questions. 2. Watched Kelly Henderhan videos and took notes. 3. Did most of the questions on [studynotesandtheory.com](URL as well as watched many of the videos. 4. Watched many other misc YouTube videos on the subjects I got questions wrong on. 5. Purchased Boson examination package and plan to do as many of these tests as possible. 6. Reading through other topics that I feel I need a brush up on, etc Practice questions vary a lot. The vast majority of them (including the official study guide) are generally straightforward technical questions. [Studynotesandtheory.com](URL is an exception -- their questions are technically intense but also play mind games with you as I would assume the exam would. Can't wait to see how Boson will be. Regardless, I am wondering if: &amp;#x200B; 1. If something is not in the official study guide, is it safe to say it will not be on the exam? There are so many processes, frameworks, etc, to understand, but some things just have to be memorized -- you either know them or you don't. I also have a Shaun Harris book that I reference sporadically. However, the book covers lots of stuff that Sybex does not. Even online sources disagree. For example, some say that EALs for Common Criteria do not need to be memorized. Some say *definitely* know all of them. 2. Due to variation in practice questions I really do not know what to expect. I get it that there will be a lot of the worst/best, except, least...etc on the exam and often times all answers will be ""right"". Also, many people tell different stories about the usefulness of a question set. For example, some people say that if you use Boson you will be over-prepared (which sounds good to me!), but others say it is a complete waste and is nothing like the exam. 3. I have taught cryptography, cybersecurity, networking, and OS for quite a while. Also, published a sizable amount of cybersecurity research. Yet, I have to say that CISSP requires you to know many things that we normally do not cover. Though I grasp the materials, I often end up thinking about questions too deeply due to my knowledge and experience and it sometimes misleads me out of the CISSP mindset. I did watch quite a few videos and they helped and I am getting better. However, sometimes I am still in a situation where I narrow everything down to two choices (which is 95% of the cases when I do not know the exact answer) and have to guess based on my interpretation and reasoning. Now, there are many ways of interpreting the question and coming up with the answer--even when using CISSP mindset and approaching things from risk management perspective etc. Anyone else had that issue? How did you get by it? 4. Do you think I did enough to prepare? 5. Anything else helpful you can share? Thank you for the community and sorry for the long post!"

I just passed today (provisionally, but shouldn't have any problems). The test was HARDER than I thought it would be. A good 1/3 of the questions contained terms that I didn't know at all from my studying but I was able to piece-together based on experience and study what they were after. The questions (for me, they're different for everyone since it's an adaptive test) were mostly on software development process and security management process. There was a tiny bit of technical, I'd say 10% technical facts, but NOTHING like what I studied or what my practice tests were like. I memorized the OSI layers and used a clever mnemonic I found: Please Do Not Touch Steve's Pet Alligator (I have a friend Steve who is from Australia so it's feasible to me that he'd have a pet Alligator). Sat down for my test, wrote that down as the first thing, and then never once used it. Not a single question on OSI. Background: 20+ years experience in IT and Cyber. Currently a team lead for cybersecurity on an aerospace defense project - needed the CISSP to justify my current role to the customer as I have zero degrees or certifications before this, absolutely none. Study: 9 days of crunch. 2-4 hours/day average. Don't judge, I have two jobs and 4 kids. I'm not lazy, just busy. Yes, I read fast. Study materials - Sybex 8th edition - great book. Easy to follow, just enough detail for the most part. Lots of questions on the test though that I don't remember seeing in the book at all. I love the online version. I loved the Wiley practice tests that came with it. Shon Harris book - terrible book with lots of great detail. I simply couldn't read it, it took material that I love and made it so dry and boring that I just couldn't do it. I stopped after the first chapter and then just occasionally used it as a reference. A [fun 10hr video](URL by a bright and articulate 19-year-old named Sagar Bansal. I'm 42 and I found Sagar to be hilariously arrogant but also generally correct and good at teaching. I enjoyed his colloquialisms and his opinions as much as I enjoyed his accent. Sagar makes the material more interesting. The video lacks detail in some areas and is - by far - not complete enough on it's own... but it's still good and it helped me understand some aspects that I didn't quite get (and didn't really even realize that I didn't quite get) without it. &amp;#x200B; Practice tests - Previously mentioned Sybex/Wiley tests - good tests, I wish they gave better feedback on which domains you're lacking-in but I appreciated the detail behind the answers. PocketPrep CISSP (iOS) - surprisingly good tests and feedback for your phone. You can do quick 10q tests when you're standing in line at the store or long 150q tests while you're studying. I liked the difference in approach. I wanted to do Boson but I decided it wasn't worth the effort of setting up a Windows VM just to run it. I didn't want to pay a fee for practice tests that are clumsy to use due to the proprietary software platform. I'm sure their questions are great but if they want to stay relevant they really should switch to a 100% web-based test. &amp;#x200B; EDIT: I forgot the most important detail! The entire test I felt like I was failing! I only felt confident about maybe 10% of my answers, seriously, I was psyching myself up for failure but still trying to do my best so I could have an accurate readout at the end of what to study when I go back. When the test ended at 101 questions I was like... wait, what?! THIS TEST WILL PSYCHOLOGICALLY MESS WITH YOU. Don't let it, be prepared."

154,cybersecurity,cissp,FAILED @ 150 in ~ 2 Hours (Long Drawn After Action Report),1,dyc4hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/dyc4hv/failed_150_in_2_hours_long_drawn_after_action/,2019-11-19 11:08:56,"Hello everyone. I just got back from the testing center and as the title states, I failed the exam. I went all the way to question 150 in a little over 2 hours and while I'm not necessarily upset I didn't pass, I'm a little sad I need to tackle this beast of a test again. I hope this feedback can help someone who might be in the same boat as me as I feel like more people post in this sub when they pass vs. when they fail. First off, my experience includes 6 years of System Administrator and Cybersecurity work in the DoD. My job provided me with a seat in a week long boot camp course which covered the ""meat and potatoes"" of the domains, providing a foundation of knowledge to build around. Alone, this definitely wouldn't have done a damn thing in preparing for the exam. I ""studied"" on and off for the past month and a half or so and my study time was mainly the downtime at work when there wasn't much going on. As soon as I was given a task, the studying would cease. At home, my study time was comprised of a few patches of a few minutes at a time when I would read books and take practice quizzes but stopped studying as soon as the kids started asking for stuff. (If you're a parent, you might understand what I mean and might want to take that in to account if you are in the process of creating a study plan.) When I had free time, I would use that time mainly to review what I had already consumed to strengthen my knowledge. Much like everyone else, I thought the exam was pretty tough, but not devastatingly hard. I also don't think the wording was as tricky as a lot of people make it out to be. The questions were pretty straightforward to me. (And that's coming from an American who failed English twice in high school.) The ""think like a manager"" approach was definitely key for some questions, but I wouldn't say that it was the proper approach for the entirety of the test. Rather, I put myself in the position the question was asking. There were definitely technical questions on the exam. I believe those are the ""gimme"" questions as they are short questions with short answer choices. The test has a good way of letting you know you're not doing so hot in a domain as you'll notice a similar question pop up again and again if you're not hitting the nail on the head. If the question seems like it doesn't belong on the test, it's probably one of the placebo questions that aren't graded. Despite quite a few claims, I think the exam was similar to a couple of practice tests that are used by multiple people (read below to find out-this might be key if you have not yet taken the exam). The materials I used were: Books: \- Sybex CISSP Official Study Guide (Barely used, read a total of 3 pages but it was so dry it made me thirsty) \- All-in-One by Shon Harris (Used as a reference to the book below when I needed elaboration. The language used in this book is easy to understand and honestly if my exam wasn't already scheduled I probably would've used this as my primary resource) \- Essential CISSP Exam Guide by Phil Martin (Main source of studying, chapters were sort of in line with the AIO book but summarized with the important details. I used this book mainly because its only a little over 300 pages) Videos: \- Kelly Handerhan's Cybrary Videos (Played mostly in my car to and from work and continued at home. I'd say this resource is a good appetizer before consuming any big books. Kelly is funny and she describes things really well, but obviously there's so much more information than what she covers in the videos) \- IT Dojo CISSP Questions on YouTube (Caught a couple of videos before bed a few nights a week or when I was doing chores around the house. These videos are a great knowledge checker and a good way to get familiar with random bits of information that have a good chance of being on the exam) Practice Tests: \- Boson ExSim (Took one full exam, scored 57%, didn't read every explanation to my wrong answers due to how exhausted I was when I took it. Some say this is the closest thing to the exam but not anywhere close to the actual exam. I disagree and think otherwise) \- Skillset (Signed up for one question a night, these questions get repetitive but the explanations might teach you a thing or two) \- CISSP Pocketprep (Did all the available free exams questions of the day. Questions were extremely simple and straightforward, explanations not necessarily the best IMO, I scored around the 60-70%) \- [Cccure.education](URL (Good exercise questions, and allows for an easy way to customize exams and review answers. This and Boson were equally effective in preparation for the exam, again IMO) Why I think I failed: \- I didn't cover any one domain in its entirety, in any book. I only read a handful of chapters from start to finish and skimmed through the rest hoping that I would have been exposed to the information I needed to pass the exam. My practice test scores reflected how wrong I was. Every practice test I took I scored anywhere from 50%-70%, which leads me to my next point. \- I didn't take enough practice tests, and when I did, I didn't spend enough time reviewing why I was wrong. I think had I reviewed, I would've been able to increase my scores dramatically, thus building confidence entering the exam. \- I was banking on the exam being completely different from all the practice exam resources out there. In reality, they weren't too far off. My thinking was flawed in that if I was scoring 50-70% on these practice exams, the other 30% has to be material I know from my day-to-day job. \- I was not prepared mentally. I was so anxious and nervous for the exam. While I understand the normality of the feeling, I think I let it get to me a little too much. Coming from someone who second guesses themselves a lot, let me tell you that there is nothing to be afraid of. As someone said in a comment on one of the posts in this thread, you either know the material or you don't. That's a perfect way to summarize this exam. \- This one might be more of an excuse than reason. I'm literally always tired. My work hours are always changing and my free time is always consumed by some thing. I think I could've afforded to be a little more selfish and prioritized my rest. (If you can't sleep, read some CISSP study material, it'll knock you right out.) \- I scheduled the exam too early. I didn't allow myself adequate time to study. If you know you don't have a fighting chance at passing this exam, do yourself a favor and reschedule. There's no shame in taking extra time to prepare yourself. If you made it this far in my report, I want to say thanks for reading and I wish you (and I) good luck on (y)our (next) exam! If you have any tips for me to add to my upcoming study plan please share them with me as I am absolutely dreading the possibility of failing a second time!"

I'm so grateful and thankful for this community especially to those people who share their experiences whether passed or failed, it means a lot as I digested every information I can learn from. The resources I used. * **CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide by Shannon Harris**, very deep in technical details. I did not fully read this as I felt like overwhelmed with technical information. However I use the audio version of this book (*listened all of it*) during my commutes. * **Sybex CISSP Study Guide 8th edition by Mike Chapple**, read from front to back one time only. I believe this book is very good for someone who is not yet familiar with CISSP CBK. Although this book is quite dry but nevertheless its a good resource. * **Udemy Thor Pedersen CISSP online training** * **Cybrary Kelly Henderman** * **Youtube IT DOJO channel,** each day I always watched at least one of his daily questions. What's even better is that Colin Weaver response in case you have some doubts of the answers. * **Sybex CISSP Practice Test 8th edition**, I only take until chapter test, I run of time so I decided to focus only on Boson. * **Boson CISSP Simulation Test**, it's true that this is more closed to the actual CISSP exam. I would recommend to spend time understanding on the explanation on each of the answers provided even if you got it right. * **CISSP Pocket prep (android)** It took me more than a year of preparation with on off study due to busy life. Last September decided to go for the exam, I booked the appointment for October 24 but eventually decided to move to this day as my confident level was like around 60%. Since September all I did was to take as much practice test I can and to review every item to understand why I made it wrong, my confident grew to like 80%. See below screenshot for practice test tracking. All the blank status are not taken. URL Practice Test Planning The night before this exam, I relax myself by watching funny videos (*basically positive videos that will make me smile*). Never touch nor read anything related to the CISSP. Sleep early, though I need to drink melatonin. During the exam, I came early. I did my best to remain relaxed, calmed, focused and stay in control. Before I clicked the begin exam, I took a deep breath and say silent prayer (*whatever the outcome I will always be grateful*). First question was already a surprised to me! But I kept my strategy of taking easy and use time to read and understand well the question and the provided options. Though when I arrived at question 80+ I started to panic a bit because I realized that I'm taking too much time on per question, at 86th question my remaining time was around 66 minutes. Then at 100th exam stop and asked to go to the facilitator for the results, the remaining time was around 52 minutes. When I saw the paper it says congratulations! By the way just to give you a bit of my background, I'm Software Engineer by profession for about 12 years on a cybersecurity industry and played the role SSO for about 2 years. Hope this information will help someone on thy CISSP journey. Once again thanks a lot."
156,cybersecurity,cissp,Update from Previous Post,1,e0619u,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/e0619u/update_from_previous_post/,2019-11-23 06:36:28,"So, here I am replying to my post from 7 days ago. Today was the day that I was scheduled to challenge the CISSP behemoth. I was expecting the worst because of several reasons. 1. As I stated in my OP, I have been studying off and on since June, but have been very busy in my job with several projects going on. It's been very stressful and I have been working a lot of overtime to stay on top of everything. We are implementing a new mail server, migrating our ERP to an entirely different cloud platform, implementing a server based HPLC management platform, rolling out O365, upgrading our file server, upgrading and migrating Server 2008 servers, getting all our desktops to Windows 10, and restructuring our shared folders, upgrading our timekeeping system in our plant, among several other things. I have been studying on my lunch breaks, or whenever I can. Sometimes listening to Kelly H. on my headphones at work. Not much consistent, quality study time. 2. It's deer season in Missouri, and my son and I hunt every year. I expected we would bag a deer on opening day, and we didn't so we hunted all last weekend. (Don't judge, we eat what we kill.) Well, he got popped in eye with his scope taking a shot at the biggest doe we ever saw and had to have 7 stitches in his face, so I spent most of last weekend in the deer blind and in the ER. No study time. 3. Felt sick Wednesday night, most likely to a questionable Popeye's Chicken Sandwich. Maybe should have had Chick Fil A instead. Love that chicken from Popeye's though. 3. I took off Wednesday and Thursday afternoon to study. We are adding onto our house, and a couple of contractors decided to stop by and discuss HVAC and garage doors. Studied some, but kept getting interrupted. Plus, I'm not one of those guys that can work from home...I'll play my guitar, friends will stop by, we'll end up drinking and playing corn hole all afternoon. 4. My boss came in Thursday morning and asked me to go to the Chamber of Commerce dinner last night, so I didn't have any time to cram last minute before the test, and I drank several adult beverages. 5. Overslept, woke up at 7:20 and had a 9:00 am appointment at the testing center. I get up, planned on going to Starbucks and getting a nice latte and sitting in the parking lot and reviewing. It's raining outside. I broke the zipper on my favorite pair of jeans. Bad omen. I got ready and made myself a cup of coffee at home, careful not to drink too much so I didn't have to go to the bathroom excessively. I'm just sitting there, staring down at this cup of coffee, and I just got pissed off and said fck it, let's go fail this mother fcker and get it over with so I can at least see the test and know what to expect next time. So I headed to the exam center and signed in 40 minutes early. So, to digress a minute; emotionally, I went back and forth when I would read this sub. I would read write-ups and be like, there is no way that test is that hard. There is no way the questions are THAT difficult. Then I would tell myself, ""don't get over-confident."" And I would go back to, ""there is no way I could fail that."" Reddit was getting to my head. Some guy with 50 years experience and a Ph.D. in Cybersecurity would fail and a single mom with 12 kids that studied between breastfeeding passed. WTF? Are people on here trolling? I would also think about my post after the test..whether I would be writing about passing or failing. I went in, signed in, went through the enrollment process with the palm vein scan, thinking to myself the whole time, ""type 3 authentication, enrollment, throughput, crossover error rate, false acceptance rate...(curious how many people actually do that when taking this exam.) The nice guy gives me my pens and laminated sheets and takes me in and sits me down. I put my earplugs in, and glance at the guy next to me who is taking the PMP. I read the question on his screen and was like...""Damn, sucks to be him."" I accept the agreement and hit start. The first question kicked me right in the balls. I was like, ""really, 149 more like this? WTF?"" 30 questions in I am thinking I would have better luck taking that $700 to the Casino and putting it all on red. What the sh*t have I done? About question 94 I look at the clock in the corner of the screen and I don't know if my mind was Jell-O pudding but I got confused and thought the 147 meant 1 hour and 47 minutes (107 minutes), not 147 minutes. Maybe those numbers aren't exactly right, but I freaked out and started clicking questions like crazy. At some point I realized my mistake and slowed back down, but then I had to piss like crazy. I raised my hand, took a break, splashed a little water on my face and came back. I kept getting questions on Domain 8, so I knew I was doing poorly in that domain. Lots of information I had NEVER seen. I was thinking to myself, is that a good sign, or a bad sign? Too many Reddit posts had me analyzing the totality of the test the entire time instead of focusing on the question. Towards the end my brain was shutting down and I was reading a question and the first word was ""What"" but my brain kept saying ""When."" I really had to work to focus. At 150 the test stopped and I was so defeated. I knew I failed. I walked out and the guy signed me out. The lady handed my my paper folded over with no expression. I read about people not looking until they got out to their car, but I couldn't resist. I looked, and I had passed. I let out an enormous sigh. A lady in an office laughed and said she loved that sound. I was getting emotional. I took my stuff out of my locker went out into the hallway, sat down, and cried a little. I think it was the stress leaving my body. I'm a manly guy, but I admit I cried a little. I went out to my car, and on the windshield, was a parking ticket. Joke on me. I appreciate all the people here that posted something. Every post helped me in some way, from those that passed and those that didn't. I also thank God, and most importantly my beautiful wife, who supported me to achieve this personal goal. There are harder tests, maybe more prestigious tests, but this test is no easy target and should be respected. It truly is an inch deep and a mile wide. Those that thought it was easy, good on you. I consider myself a fairly intelligent person and I have taken a lot of certs in my day, and this was one of the hardest. My materials...Sybex Study Guide and the Test Question Book, 11th hour, Kelly Handerhahn (1.5 times speed while I was working on my house or in my car), Sunflower, Memory Palace (better than Sunflower, but longer and not as concise), PocketPrep, and Boson. PocketPrep is just good for terminology, the questions are too easy. Cheers, my friends. I will stay on here and help others any way I can. Mark"

Very confused on what career to choose. I am very close to giving CISSP exam, But I am not sure what path of cybersecurity to choose. Google has wealth of information BUT there are some conditions which is making it tough for me to make my mind, hence i have come here for help I am Enterprise architect for 10 years .. means, I do high level design, mostly around Digital transformation (API, Integration, cloud, etc). Thing is that I Don't want to be technical, I am weak in Infra / network and have not done coding for last 10 years. In that light, I was thinking whether Risk Mgmt (ISO 27001, etc) would be good career options? But i see pay is not as good, Also I want it to be semi-technical as all my experience will go waster .... OR .... Another one i am thinking is IDM (Happy to do little coding, if needed) but mostly I will learn AD, ailpoint, CyberArk or Okta, etc and be IDM architect... but is there even a demand for IDM ""architect"" or demand is around hand-on and deep product understanding ... Any thoughts? Thanks!"

I just passed 2 hours ago. Like a lot of you I was stopped at Q100. I felt pretty confident that I would pass but there is always some doubt. I had the (mis)fortune to get fired from my job last month so I made studying for this my fill time job for the past 6 weeks, 9 to 5, five days a week. That really helped. Background: 20+ years in IT, small-med businesses, most recent was 5 years as director of IT for 300 person company. Some Consulting, no formal training. Halfway through masters in cybersecurity. What I used: Official Study Guide (10/10)- its really long but I read every single page. And the index is a great reference when understating why I messed practice questions Kelly H (12/10) She's the best. You can download a 60 page PDF of her study guide for the videos, not sure if its on the free version, but I signed up for $49 a month Insider Pro with a coupon. Boson Practice Tests (11/10) I did them ALL. And another post a couple days ago pointed out something I didn't know, you can make custom exams consisting only of questions you have missed or not seen, so you don't keep answering the same correct questions. Pocket Prep paid (6/10) Questions are really easy but good to keep your head in the content. I scheduled my exam for 145pm today. Woke up, went for a quick run and dod 2 more 150 question practice tests on Boson. I did at least on practice test each day for the past week. That really helps. The questions I saw on the exam were a LOT like the Boson questions, but Boson throws some random stuff in about software dev and security that are from other sources, not the CBK, and I saw nothing like that on the test I took. My advise: read the study guide cover to cover and do all chapter quizzes. Then with Kelly H start to finish. Then do ALL the Boson practice exams and go back to the Book for clarification. &amp;#x200B; Just take the test, you will pass if you put in the work."

I was studying almost 5-8 hours a day. Started off with the Official Guide, I made my own notes, its the best way for me to understand the material. I already knew a couple of domains theoretically thanks to my studies. Finished the guide in a month, did all the questions at the end of every chapter. Then I doubled down on the Official Practice Questions (\~1300 questions). After finishing the guide, I would give one domain test, every day and passively listen to Kelly. I could have done it in 2 months I think but I lost some steam midway in October. I had my exam scheduled for 15th November initially, had to push it back because I didn't feel very confident. In the next 15 days, finished the Boson tests, read every answer I got wrong, finished the 11th hour book. About a day before the test I got the feeling that I have prepared well enough and sat down to play Warframe, much to the dismay of my mum. **Exam morning:** Just passively skimmed over the first 15 chapters of Sybex, looking at stuff I had forgotten and wanted to look at. Reached the test center about an hour before test start. Got the shittiest photo of mine clicked ever( I look as if someone mugged me and forced me to sit for the exam), palm vein done. **Test:** I blame reddit for scaring me, the first couple of questions were so damn straightforward, I went in legit fearing the test. I felt there will be lots of twisted questions and huge paragraphs and convoluted answers but I think I was pretty lucky. Most of the questions were from what I had studied and read up on. There were those few that made me wonder if there was an error in the question itself. Thankfully encountered only one of those. **My take:** I feel that the mindset with which you go in matters as much as the technical knowhow. And be prepared to encounter questions that seem to land out of the blue. My test was evenly distributed over all domains, no more of one than the other. Make sure to learn to refresh your mind at the beginning of each question, no use thinking about the previous one. A good strategy for this is believing that all the questions that seem weird or especially confusing are from the pool of 25 experimental questions!! Kept me sane! An associate finally, now to find a job. Another grind coming up! Cheers people! I will be around to help!"

I wasn't sure how ready I was but I had the money and just wanted to take a crack at it! I was pretty close because it said I was above in 3, near in 3 and below in 2. I don't remember which ones I lost my test result paper. I ran out of time to the point I had to speed read and select the best answer in seconds as opposed to minutes for the last 50. So I doubled down and studied harder and scheduled the exam again that October. The second time was way harder. The questions didn't seem like anything I studied for. To make it worse I had kind of a medical episode where I lost my vision. It was at about 100 questions in where my Vision went completely blurry and I couldn't read what was on the screen. So I basically guessed the last 50 questions running out of time and not able to see. I did make it to 150. I still have the resulting paper for that and it was below in the first 4 and near in the last 4. Study methods and materials are all the usual. I took a year-long Cybersecurity certificate at UW, I took Larry Greenblatt's paid week-long course, I did Kelly Handerhand and Thor teaches as well. I have read the 7th edition Sybex twice and 11th hour once. Currently I'm re watching Kelly and Larry and reading 11th hour and Sybex 8th edition. Oh yeah, I used the Sybex and CCCure the first two times. I have Boson for this go around. I do feel like this time around concepts are sticking a lot better and things make more sense. Well, see! I have it scheduled two weeks out but I have a lot of distractions/Life that is happening right now so I might reschedule for December to make sure I can properly review the entire CBK. One thing about this test is I feel that even if it was open book and they said sure take the Sybex book right on in and have a seat it wouldn't matter. BTW. I have 20 years in IT.

Not necessarily directly in cybersecurity though. In the last 10 years, I've been a combination of technical and cybersecurity, working on security controls, vulnerability scanning/remediation, and accreditation package-type work. The official ISC(2) iOS study apps are almost too easy. Score high 90% pretty much always. This isn't to brag. I've been reading pass/fail stories here and it just seems I must be missing something. I understand this is a test that tests one's understanding of the concepts of the technology -- requiring answers from the perspective of a manager. Is there some hidden thing I'm completely overlooking? Other certs like CYSA+ you just grab their CertMaster and you know you've got everything needed to pass. Apparently not so with CISSP. :)"
164,cybersecurity,cissp,Would it be worth it for me to try to obtain the Associate of ISC2 with my background?,2,dmqkug,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/dmqkug/would_it_be_worth_it_for_me_to_try_to_obtain_the/,2019-10-25 12:56:09,"Hello everyone. Im currently a Junior Undergraduate Student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Information Assurance (Cybersecurity) from an NSA/DHS Accredited Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense. I also plan to take some additional Computer Networking and Computer Forensics Courses outside of my Major and Minor as Open Electives. So with my background, do you guys think that it would be worth it to become an Associate of ISC^2 now and achieve the CISSP when I get the right experience. Or do you guys think that Ill already be competitive enough with my background when I graduate and enter the workforce next year. Im planning on doing some Red Teaming/Offensive Security once I graduate."

If not maybe you can tell me which cert to get. I am an accountant at a small CPA firm. However I have recently taken on an interest in cybersecurity. To my luck, our firm is expanding our services to our clients, and we want to expand into IT security and some cybersecurity. I quickly volunteered to take up projects for that. Is this CISSP right for me? As far as I know is is about cybersecurity management. Background: I'm only an accountant but I do have my a+ cert. I have never worked in a job for cybersecurity however it's my understanding that is a requirement for CISSP? I understand the very basics of networking and security but obviously I'm no expert. Any words of advice? Boss said he'd pay for training as long as it's reasonable."
166,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed the CISSP,30,dnm8v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/dnm8v6/passed_the_cissp/,2019-10-27 11:30:46,"Many thanks to this group for helping me select the study material. THANK YOU!! Im an old guy restarting in the Cybersecurity realm. Passed the CAP a few months ago, I took that to get a feel for the ISC2 questions. My study materials: I first read the whole Sybex book. Meh, it sure gets boring at the end, seems to repeat a lot of material. You can definitely tell there is more than one author, could really use a consolidation and purging of duplicate material. A lot of information that you just can learn by reading, but I wanted to read it once to know that Id seen everything ONCE at least. Reading and highlighting as I went through. Took a month and a half or so. I did create 100 or so flash cards from stuff I thought important at the time. After I read the book, I scheduled exam 5 weeks out. To force myself to study. I did all Sybex questions online. Bought the extra book with exam questions. I did the 6 Bonus tests and then looked up every question I got wrong in the tests, cut and pasted the part of the book on that section into a word doc to review later. Did the BOSON tests A-D, was going to do E but ran out of time. These are good tests and with answers, I didnt have to look them up. Cut and pasted the wrong answered questions and questions I had trouble with (even I got it right) into word docs to review later. I had the corresponding iPHONE apps for the Sybex, but rarely used. Someone on here recommended the CISM app, and I bought and went through 100 or so of the questions. Seemed alright. Right kind of questions too. Cybrary, did the whole Kelly CISSP video set. I recommend these most. Excellent study tips and many of the areas. She says if it is a stream cipher on the test, it is RC4, if it is a block cipher, it is AES. She also said, unless the encryption has the length in the name, then do NOT bother trying to memorize. Kept me from even trying to memorize all those lengths and different types. I watched all the Larry Greenblatt videos too. I liked them, but he gets more off topic than Kelly does. I bought the Udemy CISSP online stuff, never got to it. Ran out of time. I really liked the Kelly Handerhan why you will pass the CISSP, recommend to all. I even liked the counterpart guy why you wont pass the CISSP, but his is more of a sales pitch. But he had some good points. I looked at Sunflower CISSP thing, too complicated for me to study from. I looked the the Thor ....but barely. I watched IT Dojo questions of the day, while driving to work and back. Probably got through 80 of them. Some good questions and some bad questions. I would have preferred he just stick to standard questions that I could just listen to and try to answer before the answer is given, but some of his were huge questions where you had to read half a page and try to answer, I could not do while driving. I did NOT like his intro music/jingle either, way too loud and then voice was too quiet many times. Gave me a headache sometimes trying to listen to on my drive. Dont get me wrong, they are free and had some good points. So wont hurt you either. I was NOT confident at all going into the test, but Ive always been a good test taker. If I waited until I was really comfortable with the material, I would have had to wait much longer. Going through the test I was not confident I passed at any point. I was watching intently as I clicked submit on question 100 and surprise surprise, it said I was done. I was pretty sure I passed then... but still said a little prayer before opening that folded paper. 100 questions, just under 2 hours. A lot of the questions were not worded that difficultly. I expected worse, but I still had to just do an educated guess on many that I was NOT sure on. I expected LONG wordy questions, but many wore standard length questions and pretty straight forward. My recommendation is to go take the test if you are waiting and studying for more than 3 or 4 months. It was NOT as bad as I expected, it was the toughest test Ive ever taken, dont get me wrong....but I expected worse. Thank you all for your study reference suggestions."

I was super nervous during pretty much the entire exam. The questions were unlike any of the practice tests that I had taken. About 80 questions in, the answers started getting a lot easier, so I was certain that I had failed, and the adaptive test engine was trying its hardest to give me questions it thought I could answer. Background on me: Bachelors in Computer Information Technology and a Masters in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I've got Security+, GSEC, CEH, and CHFI certifications. I've been in the security field for 5 years now (2 as a SOC analyst and 3 as an Analyst 2/Engineer). My current security team is pretty small. We've got the ISO, a compliance analyst, and myself, so I get to wear a lot of different hats at work that have exposed me to a lot of the topics that the CISSP covers. A few tips that I'd like to pass along: Be as familiar as possible with the decision-making process. As you go through practice questions, don't just try to get the right answer; try to understand _why_ the right answer is the right answer. To the extent possible, take as many practice tests as you can in simulation mode (where you don't see the correct answers until the end). I found that when I would do study mode (where you get immediate feedback on your answer), knowing that I got an answer right gave me a confidence boost going forward to the next question. Study mode is great for learning the material and understanding the why behind the correct answer, but you don't get that immediate feedback during the real test, so it's important to get yourself in that test-taking mindset. Explain concepts to friends as much as you can, especially concepts you're finding more difficult to grasp. The best way to learn is by teaching somebody else, so grab a friend or family member and teach them topics as you study to make sure you understand something. This is especially helpful if your friend/family member isn't a techie. Your CEO/CFO/COO might not be technically-inclined either, so it's great practice to explain difficult topics in a way that someone who isn't a security professional can understand. Resources Used Boson Exam Environment - I found these practice tests incredibly helpful, especially as they give feedback after a test about specific areas you're struggling with. (ISC)2 Official Study Guide and Official Practice Tests - I loved the practice test questions, though they still didn't quite reflect the kind of questions I saw during the actual exam. I skimmed through the Official Study Guide for areas I knew I was weaker in. If the Study Guide didn't quite help me understand, I moved on to.... Cybrary (Kelly Handerhan's CISSP Course) - Kelly does such a great job explaining topics. This eventually became my go-to resource to study. She even includes links to pre-made flashcards, which were really helpful as well. I honestly don't think I would have passed without these videos. I highly recommend using this (free) resource for your studies. I was a longtime lurker in r/cissp, and I really appreciate everyone sharing their experiences and lessons learned. Hopefully some of these help you along your path as well. If you have any specific study-related questions, feel free to comment below."

Then from 2016-present I have been in college studying cybersecurity and digital forensics full time. Note: I'm not listening 100% of what I think influenced me passing the exam, just what I think is helpful. Timeline: Prior to October 2018: I watched Kelly henderhan's cybrary videos at some point. October 2018: I got the newest edition of CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide by Shon Harris when it was abailable and began to read it painstakingly slow. Spring 2019: I'm ~400 pages into the book with no idea of how much I'm absorbing and lacking a real study plan. My progress begins to slow even more at this point. July 2019: my coworker recommends ""Why you are going to fail CISSP"" by Leo Dregier. I look into his claims about practice tests being a superior method of studying. I begin to read similar claims and purchased Boson's CISSP ExSim based on this subreddit's general consensus. August 2019: I begin to take full practice tests on the train to work and using the failed questions to create flash cards of the content that I reviewed throughout the day (Occasionally referencing the CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide for more detail on unfamiliar concepts/terms/etc.) I eventially amass a few hundred flash cards and go through them all at least a few times a week. September/early October 2019: I am able to pass Boson simulated exams with &gt;750 points consistently AND passing each domain AND get most flash cards correct. I then switch to using the premium pocket prep phone app during my train commute. No flash cards, but use the question flag option a lot for questions that just arent committing to memory easily, retesting failed questions the day after I got it wrong. 29 October 2019: I watched ""Why you WILL pass CISSP"" by Kelly Henderhan. Exam day: 30 October 2019. 4am: wake up, shower, do school work and watch ""why you WILL pass CISSP"" again. 6am: drive to test center and pick-up a banana, an apple, a boltfarm mocha coffee drink and a water. 7am: I sit in my car outside the test center and eat my breakfast, listening to hype music. 720am: stress poop 730: Enter Pearson vue waiting room, got enrolled and seated. ~930am: Receive printout of provisional pass. Major take aways: -reference books are for reference, not cover-to-cover reading, duh. -study test taking techniques a bit, not just relevant content. -practice as much as possible to the real thing as you can."
170,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed! 100 questions 110 min,22,d5bewo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/d5bewo/passed_100_questions_110_min/,2019-09-17 13:31:26,"I've been following this subreddit for a couple of months and now it's time to contribute back. All of the previous pass/fail posts helped me in my preparations and setting my mindset right. Background: BS Network And Systems Administration MS Network Engineering and Cybersecurity 3.5 years of Cybersecurity Analyst role &amp;#x200B; Study materials: Thor Teaches Videos - (2 rounds: 1st when I started, 2nd week before the exam) - Great, straight to the point. Kelly Handerhan Videos - Great FedVTE Videos- good 11hr Hour - Weekend before the exam (awesome review before the exam but not enough for study from scratch) Sybex Book 8th edition - Referenced from videos and 11th Hour (mostly last week) &amp;#x200B; Practice: Thor Teaches All tests Sybex Book 8th and Sybex practice 2nd Official practice tests CISSP phone apps &amp;#x200B; 2.5 months of hard core studying. 1-3 hrs weekdays and 8-12 hrs on weekends. Everything was put aside and only work, sleep , study cycle over and over. You have to be dedicated in order to pass this exam. I have to say that experience plays a big role in passing this exam, at least it did for me. I would not have answered several questions without my experience. For me it was a 70% management/30% technical exam. But it's story different for everybody. You need to know your technical stuff as well in order to pass this exam, but you have to know how to apply this knowledge and experience. As others said, you absolutely have to know the fundamentals, you have to be able to apply critical thinking and your experience when answering questions. You have to know the concepts and follow the process with a ""security advisor/manager"" mindset (that's when Kelly's video comes to play, watched it several times) As for practice questions, there are no similar questions available for this exam, they are just different. But I really liked Thor's and Official Sybex Online bank questions, they help you to reinforce your knowledge and point to your weak spots. The exam was hard enough and had multiple very tricky questions (pay attention and read carefully), but it wasn't harder than what I expected. Unlike many other people I felt confident after 50 questions; may be questions got a bit harder in the second half, but I still felt pretty confident in the end. I have to confirm that many questions had 2 very close/correct answers and I had to go through elimination process in order to answer. I kept in mind that I might need to go all the way to 150, but was expecting it to end at 100 mark. I will reiterate it again, the exam is designed for you to pass, I didn't feel even a single time that it is designed to fail me. You just really need to study hard and know how to apply your knowledge and experience, how to apply the concepts and how to follow the process, policies etc. Sometimes you have to go with your gut feeling, it happens, it's life. You can do it! It is not as hard as you might think. I was really stressed out before and during the exam, but it turned out pretty well. Good luck!"

Me taking the CISSP exam was rather involuntary, I do hold several European certifications for the kind of work I do (data protection in reference to the GDPR, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, etc.). My employer insisted on an ""American"" certification though as well as me taking the test in English instead of my mother tongue, so I used the: * 11th hour book for a quick glance on what this all is about * the ""official"" CISSP study apps from the App Store * Boson CISSP exam prep * 1 to 2 hours a night in a 3-week period to review the material. I passed provisionally after 106 questions. The whole thing took about an hour including registration, etc. My particular test was extremely biased towards some (at least for me) obscure reports and instruments (SOC, DoD procedures, etc.) I do not know whether the test adapted to me having difficulties with those particular items. Anyway, I was very surprised when it suddenly stopped after 106 questions, telling me I have finished. At this point in time I would have been unable to say whether I passed or failed. Maybe someone of you can shed some light on that, is it good or bad to stop at this point? In terms of preparation and tools, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend any of what I used: * 11th hour is exactly what it promises: a quick glance, nothing more, nothing less (I bought the 3rd edition on ebay for cheap) - absolutely not enough when you do not yet have a very solid grasp on the matter * the two ""official"" testing apps were $14.95 of wasted money: illustrations in horrible resolution, a fair number of wrong or at least very unclear answers. One of the two apps got an update 2 weeks ago and the quality is better now but still nothing to totally rely on. * Boson: good structured material but IMHO tainted with too many technical details from specific vendors and too little overarching management. In my exam I have not had a single question going into the technical detail of boson like ""what specific control/technology Microsoft or Cisco recommends but does not enforce"" None of the test tools I used produced anything close to the questions shown on the real exam so simply memorizing would not be a good option."

Some relevant background: I live in a smallish city (about 4 hours from a large city) with few opportunities for cybersecurity people (currently, ONE cybersecurity position listing CISSP as a req), so pickings are very slim. The large city 4 hours from me has a TON of jobs requiring CISSP (a couple hundred). I have 3 years of risk management experience, and almost two years of information security specific experience. Here's an update 2 months after receiving my ISC2 ID for CISSP. * Received a small (8%) raise from current company after getting CISSP * Applied to 8 jobs: * interviewed with 4 of them, * received a ""we'll pass email"" from 2 of them * didn't hear back from 2 of them * Of the 4 I interviewed at: * 1 did not make an offer (the position really wasn't right for me) * 1 made an offer ($40k more than I make now, but involved relocating which I couldn't do) * 2 I am waiting to hear back from after initial interview * Today I checked ""Let recruiters know you're open"" on LinkedIn, so we'll see how that goes Overall, disappointed about the lack of opportunity in my small city. Big cities seem to be where CISSP pays off. CISSP will not make up for lack of experience. Even with CISSP, HR people have still asked me incredibly mundane questions - but I think this is par for the course as far as the interview process is concerned."

Been a lurker here for the past 3 months, as I prepped for the CISSP. I got a lot of good info, lots of hope, and many great resources from here. So, like many others, I thought I would detail what I used and how, in the hopes it will help someone else, as I was helped. Background: 7 years in the field, working variously as an auditor, pen tester, junior sys admin and ISSO. Not super technical overall, but also not straight nontechnical. In the ""fingers to keyboard"" area, I am better than Geek squad but less skilled than a sysadmin with a couple years experience. In the nontechnical area, I am very solid. MSc in Cybersecurity, have CISA and Sec+ certs. I took a bootcamp that provided a voucher almost 2 years ago. I ended up scheduling the exam for May this year, and rescheduled it twice. Once from May to last week, and then to today from last week (I freaked out and decided I needed time for Boson and Sybex exams). Other than that bootcamp, which I didn't really retain, everything else used was stuff from here. Kelly Handerhan videos 10/10: I started watching the free Cybrary ones, got halfway through, and then used the 2018 updated ones instead (watched from start to finish). Great breakdown of material, and I think she really does a great job highlighting what is likely to be tested. ISACA: CISM app (free version) from Acesoft Corp. 10/10: Someone on here that passed a couple months back recommended this app, and it was amazing. I feel like this was the best set of questions to use for exam prep. Paired with Boson exams, it will let you know where you stand. Highly, highly recommended. Sybex 2018 official guide 6/10: undoubtedly this has pretty much everything in it for passing. I couldn't make it through the book, however. I read the first 3 domains, the exam essentials for domains 4 and 5, and part of domain 8. Horribly boring. I would still recommend reading it as a primary source, but you can get your info other ways too. CISSP for Dummies 8.5/10: Pretty solid. Has some Dad jokes type humor, so a bit more palatable than the Sybex, and gets to the point much more quickly overall. I made it through over half, then used it to tighten up weak spots found during question practices. Sybex practice exam questions 2018 7.5/10: Not the greatest questions, but it does a good job of letting you know where you are weak. I did not use the print questions, I used the test bank. Explanations are lacking sometimes, but every question you can take helps. I scored low 80s avg Boson exams 10/10: the Boson exams are great for a brutal, crushing blow to your confidence (lol). First one I scored a 68. Subsequent takes went better, with me averaging mid 70s overall. I think that they are very technical and go to many external references (RFCs, MS product/services documents, Uni of Cali papers), but that is actually a good thing. If you can make it through those and READ every explanation, it will prepare you well. Kelly Handerhan ""Why you will pass"" and Larry Greenblatt ""Exam tips"" videos 10/10: both of these folks are extremely talented at helping you understand the mindset needed. Kelly's video in particular was very helpful with the overarching exam tips; I watched it 3 times, once minutes before walking into the exam. Larry's take on breaking down questions is awesome. Misc: I flipped through the Sunflower pdf, as well as the CISSP Memory Palace notes (I believe the latter is on Thor's site). Excellent quick references, but I didn't use them much. I also used 11th Hour a small bit when I briefly studied with another person back in May. Seemed good. The week before the exam was pretty much a battery of exam questions from all 3 sources listed. I did somewhere around 1500 practice questions. I used the Cissp for Dummies and the exam essentials at the end of each chapter in the Sybex guide to review where I was weak, then did more questions. Day of the exam (today), I tested at 1:15 pm. Before I drove, I did 120 questions from the CISM app. I got to the site around 12:10, watched the Kelly Handerhan ""Why you will pass"" vid, then went in and took it. I hit it at 100 questions in a bit less than an hour. I honestly thought I failed, because there were some things I did not recall seeing in ANY study material. Sorry it is so long. I hope this helps someone, and thanks to all who have posted tips, resources, info."
181,cybersecurity,cissp,Second exam in a week,1,crer17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/crer17/second_exam_in_a_week/,2019-08-17 10:09:00,"Hello, I have a CISSP exam next Saturday. I failed once last December and have not considered retaking it a while because I was busy transitioning from Air Force to a civilian life. I had 4 years and 2 years experiences of Air Force as a cybersecurity and network technician contractor. I have Network+ and Security+ certs long time ago. I want to pursue a CISSP with an experience of less than 10 years because I am a fast pacer. I am very worried because I have taken all Sybex CISSP practice exams, all CISSP Pocket Prep exam, and all Boson practice exams and none of the exams are more than 70% for the first attempt. When I make a second attempt I get 80% and above for some exams. I just took the last Boson exam and did still get 65%. Again, I have an exam next week. I do not know what domain(s) I am weak at. If I have to give you the example: for the first domain, I get 75% on the first Boson exam, and then get 55% on the third exam, and go up again to 75% for the fifth exam. I was delighted because I had some improvements on questions related to management. For Boson, I am the strongest at domains 5 and 7, but for Sybex, I am the weakest at those domains. All I can do now is just go back notes I took from Kelly Handerhan, wrong and flagged questions, and my personal notes. In this situation, I am still optimistic about passing it. I believe in myself that I can make it. As of now typing my thread here, I am very smoked after 8 hours of work and 4 hours of study and the exam. But I can still study more and be more prepared for the exam. I will be appreciated if you can comment some advices that I can take. Once I pass it I am very excited to share more experiences here. Thanks in advance!!"

I've following every single post from the past one month and everyone are doing a great job in helping each other. **Background**: I'm a software engineer with one year experience. Completed my masters in cyber security. I want to be the guy who can review code and find vulnerabilities, write scripts, develop automated tools for security and pretty much anything a software engineer can do but with most of my focus on cybersecurity. I'm kind of confused as to where I should start like what should be focus or any certifications/courses that would help me to get better at becoming a software security engineer. &amp;#x200B; Forgive me for the bad english.

183,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed @ 100 questions in 90 minutes 8/19,20,ctr3fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/ctr3fs/passed_100_questions_in_90_minutes_819/,2019-08-22 12:27:38,"Hello all, Have only been lurking for a short while but I spent about 3 weeks preparing for the exam. I have about 10 years in IT working as a Sys Admin, Cybersecurity Admin, ISSO, etc. Was a pretty stressful experience but I'm glad it's over with. Here are my thoughts: 1. Kelly Handerhan was great. While she doesn't go as in depth as some of the things I saw on the test, neither did the books so I can't fault her or her videos. They did what they were supposed to do. 2. CCCure.org did a good job of reinforcing the basics but the way some of their questions are phrased sucks. I think it's just a matter of going through and doing some QA on them. I'd like to say, that there is no way that these questions compare to the ones on the CISSP however. 3. Larry Greenblatt did a nice job of keeping me entertained while watching the amount that I did. I can't say that he was any more in depth, but he gave me a different view on the information than Kelly. 4. I read through Shon Harris' book and the Sybex book. I would recommend the Sybex over Shon Harris. Shon Harris is way too lengthy/wordy to be worth the time. I think that the Sybex equivalent does a great job of going through the things that will be covered on the exam, but again not as in depth as you can expect to see on the exam in some questions. 5. Used the CISM Pocket Prep app and I'm glad I did. While those questions are definitely more broad, the app slaps you in the face pretty early if you're not strong on governance and in same cases 3-4 answers look correct which is good preparation for the exam. 6. I didn't have an exam where I was forced to think ""Am I a technician or a manager in this case?"" Everything was pretty managerial. I feel like I can count the amount of technical questions/easy questions I had on my fingers and toes. 7. The questions asked on this exam were mind blowing at some points. I had to read, re-read, re-read again, and re-read for a 10th time in some cases to understand what they were trying to ask. It wasn't completely clear on some of them so I had to pick the words out of the sentences to throw something together that I assume they were asking. I think ISC2 can do a better job of rephrasing them. There is no testing software, question simulator, or the like that will prepare you for the way those questions are asked. I thought that I 100% failed that test and put my head in my hands numerous times thinking that it was over. Most of that might have been the stress/anxiety of taking the test and not trusting my own judgement. You really have to trust your gut in this test and go with what you know. I think that's where experience comes in and the reinforcement of the basics to try and piece the questions/answers together. Overall, happy to have it over with. Thanks for all the advice on this forum. Has been helpful."

I am not what you call a technical expert as most of my career has been spent making policies and standards for my organization and enforcing them as needed. So when they say you don't have to be technical to pass, I'm one of those guys. Certs: Security+, CBRITP, CBRM &amp;#x200B; Testing Strategy: I've been studying on and off for a year and got serious over the previous 3 months. To ensure I passed, I even cutout gaming in the final month to ensure I focused on passing. I used the following: Sybex official study guide 7th ed: 8/10 Dry read, but it's definitely going to cover you as far as introducing you to the material. I read it cover to cover and used it strategically to spot check my weaker areas. Sybex online test bank: 7/10 Awesome tool that helped me find my weakness areas, but the questions DO NOT hold a candle to the actual exam. Boson tests: 9/10 I did all of the questions and the explanations in there are top tier plus the format is closer to the exam than any other. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who wants to spot check their domain knowledge. Mike Chapplan's course on LinkedIn: 6/10 I'm not a video learner but it was great background noise and I occasionally gleamed something new from passive listening. Cybrary/Kelly Handerhan: 10/10 The way that lady explains how to get into mindset of the test and also Kerberos really kept me in the game. Larry Greenblatt vid: 10/10 Different perspective, but not contradictory to Kelly's. This subreddit: PRICELESS. So many good insights to gleam from others even if it is ""I don't want to be that guy"" &amp;#x200B; Test day: Let me just say that the test was no walk in the park evident from me going over 100 questions, but like many other Redditors, I was happy because it meant the machine was still considering me worthy. I wrapped up in about 2 hours and like many I felt that creeping dread of failure, but once I saw the printer only spit out one sheet the only thought I had was... ""That's not long enough to tell me everything I screwed up..."" Needless to say, I'm now on my merry way to playing my videogames again. Good luck everyone."
185,cybersecurity,cissp,Provisionally Passed Today @ 100 Questions!,36,cwozxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/cwozxi/provisionally_passed_today_100_questions/,2019-08-29 04:46:59," First of all, just wanted to say thank you to r/cissp! You guys are the best! I first started studying back in December. I bought the Sybex book and read it in its entirety and was wanting to test in January but work/life had other plans. I actually set a test date and ended up bumping it twice. I really buckled down and started studying again about 2 months ago. I start my Masters program in 2 weeks and wanted to get it over and done with before that and it had been hanging over my head long enough. The primary tools I used were the Boson exams (thanks to all your recommendations!), Kellys cybrary videos, and the Sybex book/practice questions. Initially I thought I would re-read the Sybex book it in its entirety but I ended up just referencing it to fill in the gaps. My weakest domain was domain 4 so I also watched some Network+ videos on Udemy to help give me more of a foundation in that area. My background is not super technical. I was active duty military for 6 years, separated 2 years ago and realized most of the jobs where I live were cyber related in some way. So I decided to go and get Security+. Im a government contractor now. I spent a few months teaching initial cybersecurity training and then moved over to conducting security control assessments. I think what helped me the most was the Boson questions. I remember the first time I took one of the Boson tests I scored in the 60s and I felt super defeated. The detailed explanations for each question really helped me to understand why the answer was what it was and why the other choices were incorrect. I also liked the format of the questions. The Sybex questions seemed to be more recall/recognition as opposed to comprehension. This morning I woke up and watched Kellys Why you WILL pass the CISSP and took my dog for a long walk to get some of the nervous energy out. Then I headed to the test center. There were some questions I had zero idea about and dont recall ever seeing before but I tried to use the mindset Kelly talks about and I think that helped quite a bit. I took my time and reasoned through the different answers for each question, even if I was pretty positive I knew the answer after reading through it once. I had the feeling I was failing the entire time and when the test stopped at 100 questions, I was sure I did. I was so surprised and happy when the lady at the test center looked at me and said I dont know if I should shake your hand or give you a hug. Definitely a great feeling."

My background is in cybersecurity consulting for a big 4 company, doing a lot of work in governance, operations and processes. I recommend first using Kelly Handerhan Videos first, and then read 11th hour CISSP, then Sybex book for areas you're weak on, assuming you already have some background in cybersecurity. Use memorization techniques in ""Unlimited Memory"" by Kevin Horsley for things that need memorization (concepts such as the different security models) and watch youtube videos for things that need understanding (technical topics such as TCP/IP and Kerberos). Take regular BOSON practice tests and the tests in the back of each chapter of the books to gauge your understanding of the information, but don't get too caught up in getting every single question right on BOSON or even scoring very high. I was never able to score over 75% on any BOSON test. They have very specific ""you know it or you don't"" memorization style questions and I'm more of a conceptual learner. I found that the question mapping to domains was a bit arbitrary, and that its better to look at the chapter section references on each question to really hone in on what you need to study. While I didn't originally intend to, I ended up reading the entire Sybex book, which is an easier though longer read than 11th hour CISSP, which is just chock-full of info. There were a few places in both books where it seemed the writer was just copying from some standards document and didn't actually understand the concept- for those sections I searched for a Youtube video to provide better clarity. I ended up getting a crash-course on computer networks from studying for this exam. The actual exam has more scenario based questions that test understanding of the concepts, but there were also quite a few memorization questions, so don't ignore memorization when its needed. Usually I was able to eliminate all but 2 answer choices, and just took the best guess. The test started pretty easy but got much harder in the 2nd half- I bet I was missing at least 50% of the last 40 questions if not more. TLDR: don't get discouraged by BOSON test performance, trust in yourself and you can do it!"

189,cybersecurity,cissp,Provisionally Passed @ 100 Questions: Strategy &amp; Experience,29,cff7ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/cff7ko/provisionally_passed_100_questions_strategy/,2019-07-20 10:00:21,"I'm happy to announced that I passed the CISSP exam today my first try at 100 questions. I wanted to share my experience and study strategy for those currently studying for the exam. **My Experience &amp; Education** I've been working in IT for almost 20 years (off and on) with the last 7 in Cybersecurity for a large Federal Government agency with a focus on security governance. I have several IT certifications, including the Network+, Security+, Project+, ITIL, and others. I also have two graduate degrees, an MBA with a concentration in Information Assurance &amp; Security Management and an MS in IT Network Management. I also have a lot of experience teaching IT, as well as have taught a GMAT prep course while in grad school, which helped in my CISSP exam prep. **My 3-Week Study (Cram) Strategy** I don't recommend it, but I was able to get all of my studying in a matter of 3 weeks (out of necessity). I attended a CISSP bootcamp a year ago (paid by my work) and was given an exam voucher that expired this month. Well, I forgot about it, was studying to re-certify my lapsed Net+ and remembered 3 weeks ago. So right after I finished re-certifying my Net+, I jumped right into my CISSP studies. Like I said, I did attend a boot camp, but in retrospect, the online classes I took where 1000x better. The only thing I liked about the boot camp was the free exam voucher. **Books** I had the official ISC^(2) Student Guide, but wasn't impressed, so I purchased numerous other books and ended up focusing in one two: * 11th Hour CISSP 3rd Edition: I read through this twice. * Essential CISSP by Phil Martin (Audio Book Version): Then I listened to this in my spare time until I was done. I am planning on buying the print edition of this book as a reference guide because, imo, it's that good. BTW - it's an update to his Simple CISSP book. I have the AIO, Sybex Official Study Guide, and CISSP for Dummies, but really didn't use them at all. In fact, I didn't even crack open the AIO and Sybex books. **Courses** * Kelly handerhan's Cybrary Course * Thor Pedersen's Udemy CISSP Courses I loved both of them. I started with Kelly's, then went through Thor's courses (he has them broken up into 4 courses). I think both were exceptionally well done. I tried watching some others, but these were the two that I found where the most beneficial for me. **Practice Test** * Boson's Practice Exams: 74% Average (took each test once) * Sybex Official Practice Tests (Online Test Bank): 78% Average (took each test once) I found both of these to be good, but I did like the way Boson worded their questions somewhat similar to the CISSP. I also liked there very length explanations for each question. I purposely only took each exam once, because I wanted to make sure I didn't memorize questions. **Exam Mindset &amp; Strategy** * IT Dojo's CISSP Question of the Day * Spock and Kirk CISSP Videos * Kelly Handerhan's Why You Will Pass the CISSP Video * ARECyber LLC's How to Pass The CISSP Exam Video All four of these were invaluable. The put you into the correct mindset to properly tackle the exam from a strategic perspective. I would recommend watching Kelly's and ARECyber's videos at the beginning of your studies, before you start taking your practice exams and again right before you sit for the exam. They'll help you ensure you tackle this exam with the right mindset. **The Actual Exam** It's not an overly technical exam. I honestly felt like I wasted 80+ hours trying to learn the technical aspects of things in the 8 different domains that I didn't need to know. Like others have said, nothing is quite worded like the actual exam and you'll have to make an educated guess on a lot of your questions, but that is where strategic test taking and having the proper mindset comes into play. If you can narrow down your choices to two possible answers, your odds of getting it right just went up drastically. I will say that I feel like I made an educated guess on nearly half of the questions. Additionally, go into the test thinking ""big picture"" like a business owner, CIO, CISO, or risk manager would; don't go into thinking you're an IT operations person fixing things. Always relate everything back to ""business-minded"" decisions, policies, procedures, standards, the CIA triad and how that relates to data at rest, in motion, and in use for each of the 8 domains. Furthermore, understand that you must get a passing score on all 8 domains and 25 of the 150 questions are non-graded experimental questions that might be graded questions on future tests. So if you see some off-the-wall questions you didn't see in your studies, don't freak out, make an educated guess and move on. Also, I can't stress this enough. Be sure to ""slowly"" read the question and make sure you understand exactly what you're asking. Don't speed through the questions; I read several more than once to make sure I fully understood what they're asking for. Secondly, rule out questions that definitely are incorrect with the goal of focusing in one two that are possible candidates; then choose the best. This is a subjective test that is a ""best"" answer selection for most and when I when I didn't see a clear cut correct answer (there were some that were), I picked what I thought was the best putting my MBA-hat on. I honestly feel that the course doesn't represent that study material well. If you don't have the prerequisite technical and business / management experience combined, this is a very daunting test. I'm very lucky to have gone to business school and have earned my MBA because that was probably one of my best assets going into this exam, along with my experience working in IT and Cybersecurity for several years. I had to keep reminding myself to put my MBA hat on during the exam and ask myself, ""What would our CISO do?"" to help me properly answer the questions. Anyways, I hope this helps. If you have any questions, please let me know."

Reading everyone's tips, links and experience with the test was immensely helpful and I am truly very grateful! Test Details: Provisionally Passed on question 101 in just over 90 minutes. As many people before me experienced, I really had no clue how I was doing during the exam itself. At certain points I was pretty worried or frustrated, and remembering the feedback from you folks truly helped me push through, pep talk myself to not go on tilt, and stick to my testing strategy (which came from the videos suggested here). When it ended I was pretty nervous and actually shed a tear of relief when I saw that I had passed! As for the test questions themselves, how you approach them is the key, very few are as straightforward as Boson or any other practice test I used. At certain moments I found myself using nearly all of the strategies in the videos below. &amp;#x200B; Study Details: 8-10 weeks of consistent study. 1-3 hours most week nights, 3-4 hours sat/sun. Final week&amp;weekend was pretty much all my free time studying and taking Boson practice exams. * CISSP AIO (7/10) Started with this, got through the first two domains and it wasn't quite clicking. Thats when I checked Reddit and went through 6 months of posts and made a huuuuuge list, which I then scoped (or was it tailored??) down to my needs. (sorry, couldnt resist) * Sybex Official Guide - (9/10) Yes, it can be a slog, and some of the explanations are a bit lacking, but most of the content is there. * When I could not master a concept or two in the Sybex book, the AIO book helped fill in gaps + Wikipedia/Google. * 11th hour I read Cybex book cover to cover and took all chapter tests, highlighting concepts that were new/not intuitive to me as I went. I then went back a second time to just my highlights and further explored those topics taking notes in OneNote. * LinkedIn CISSP Vids (Mike Chapple ) during walks and in my car (7/10). Got through 4 domains and quit. They helped some. * Kelly Handerhan Cybrary Vids (9/10). She is great, wish I could have taken one of her online classes. You can tell there is more content than just what is up there for free. * Cybrary paid subscription - Labs/Tests, etc (6/10) I only took one of their practice tests, and it was meh. Cancelled after one week. * Boson (9/10). Took all tests once confirm what everyone says. Closest to the real exam, but much more technical than the test. By the 4th and 5th test I started skipping the super technical questions like manually encrypting text. Not necessary. After taking each test, I then went back through all the marked and incorrect questions, read through the explanations and took notes like crazy. For really great explanations, I would print to OneNote to save for future study. Overall a great resource. * Cybex Official Practice Tests, hard copy (8/10) - only took two of them and one online * CISSP Pocket Prep (8/10) - only the freebies * Sunflower PDF (7/10) - Read through half, just didnt jive with me, some of the abbreviations used I was unfamiliar with * Kirk/Spock How to Pass the CISSP vids - (9/10) - loved them and they really helped. &amp;#x200B; Day before the test ( I took the day off): Quickly glazed back over my highlights from the Cybex and AIO books, just for those terms I hadnt seen in a while. Read the 11th hour book. Was surprised to find new info there.

Attempted to read through all my notes, about 30 pages, but underestimated how much time that would take and got 60% through, I only gave myself an hour.

To be honest, I wasn't confident that day even though I did a lot of effort beforehand, but nonetheless, I jumped the gun and did it. When I stepped into the exam room and started the exam, I was totally taken by surprise. The exam questions aren't as straightforward as the quiz I had taken. Honestly speaking, I had lots of questions which I could not have the answer straight away and I had to do elimination of the wrong answer till I figure out the correct answer. It is really an English test and the questions had to be understood properly. Halfway through I was gonna give up because most of the questions I'm wasn't confident in the answer but I persevered through. When I arrived at the 100 questions, the exam ended and I thought I was sure going to fail it. Luckily, when I went out, it wrong Congratulations, You'd provisionally passed the CISSP exam. I was overjoyed. My experience in the cybersecurity space is exactly 5 years but I'm not technical or IT trained at all.

Studied 3-6 hours every day and completed the chapter questions, and a couple of bonus exams. \- Sybex Tests: 7/10 - Did a few of the domain questions in the last few days, overall it helps reinforce important concepts but isn't a good template for what is required on the exam. \- CISM App by Unity: 10/10 - Did about 100 questions, and have to agree this is very similar to the actual exam. 4 Days Prior to the Exam: By this point, I had written down approximately 250 pages of notes. Revised my notes in the final few days, and did a cursory read of Sybex again (Third iteration). And as countless others have, watched ""Why will you pass CISSP"", ""CISSP Tips"", and ""Kirk-Spock"" by Kelly Handerhan, Larry Greenblatt, and Max Qasar in the last few hours. Exam: The exam, which I was prepared for, was heavily focused on making decisions. Some of the decisions could be directly correlated to the concepts driven in the book, while a majority required elimination. And to echo the sentiments of everyone on this thread, it is as much a test of your interpretation, as of your security acumen. At most, only 5% of the questions were direct ones! Final Suggestion: If you noticed, the number of questions I did while preparing, is hardly comparable to an average applicant. And the reason I chose to go about it this way, is because what is often understated about the exam is that you need to be confident while assessing the situation put in front of you. Confidence for me comes from knowing and being able to recall every bit of detail. And to summarize, your learning techniques must be based on what works best for you, as compared to adopting a pattern which has been successful for other candidates. At the end of the day, the exam is a combination of facts and, decisions based on those facts. So the best preparation, in addition to learning, is preparing for what you're about to face."
193,cybersecurity,cissp,How I Passed the CISSP,20,cn7x7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/cn7x7v/how_i_passed_the_cissp/,2019-08-08 02:21:32," So, even though it has only been about a week since I passed the exam, I have received multiple messages asking how to study as well as what are the main things they should study in order to pass. Many others have contributed to this group in some way, and now that I have had a little bit of time to process things, I wanted to give my humble opinion on what is required to pass the CISSP. First off, coming into this exam, leave your other certifications at the door. Having A+, Security+, CASP, MCSA, and MCSE I can tell you that none of the aforementioned certifications were even close in comparison when it comes to format as well as how to study for this exam. In the past I have outlined exam objectives, read a book or two, practiced hundreds of questions and managed to pass. It was a formula that I have been programmed with much like anyone else that has gone through the traditional school system. Unfortunately, I knew after trying the CISSP once on a free voucher that old methods would not work for **me** (key word here). In 2017 I sat the traditional exam (250 Q, 6 hours). I completed a boot camp through the local community college and had to take the exam within 60 days, pass or fail, or pay for the course + the voucher. The course was crap, and due to other unforeseen circumstances in my life was unable to really engage the material in the short time frame that I was given. Either way, I still had to attempt the exam. I decided I was going to use the opportunity to focus more on the structure of the questions and identify the deltas I needed to work on. The format of the questions were obviously quite different than what I have had experience with in the past. On Security+, you might be asked What is PaaS?. On the CISSP you will be asked Your organization has a custom application running on a third-party distributed cloud service. Through an internal audit, it is discovered that PHI is present in the application. What would be the MOST appropriate step to take to remedy the situation? There is a stark difference between these questions, as one can be solved by recall and the other is conceptual. The latter question has multiple concepts and, arguably, multiple domains of the CISSP CBK. You would have to know what a PaaS as denoted by a custom application hosted by a third party. This along with distributed systems is part of Domain 3 objective 3.5: Assess and mitigate the vulnerabilities of security architectures, designs, and solution elements. PHI is involved with a third party, so Domain 1 objective 1.2: Applying due care/diligence and 1.3: determine compliance requirements (Contractual, legal, industry standards, and regulatory requirements) all are part of this question. Taking all of these things into account is how you should arrive at the correct answer. I knew going forward I had to go about this test a completely different way, as knowing the concepts would not be enough. I would have to learn how the domains tie together, and how things might be applied in a real world setting. I think this is where the experience part really comes into play, and because I have been in IT for only a few years at that point in time, I would have to find an effective way to close the gap. I think the first thing anyone should do before attempting the CISSP is to know YOUR learning style. I dont mean what has worked for you in the past. If the goal is understanding, conceptualizing, and applying, how would you go about doing so? I would check out this article at [URL , which discusses the learning styles and how they are instructed. For the purposes of the CISSP, I needed instructors who use real-life examples, applications, and hands-on approaches. Much like an apprenticeship, I needed to learn from someone who has been there, done that. For my needs, I figured a book could only go so far on concepts and application without becoming extremely bloated and in the end overwhelming/too big to digest. I decided I would stick with video series who have real cybersecurity professionals who can break down the concepts, and tie into an overall picture. For this, I stuck with Kelly Handerhan and Larry Greenblatt because of their expertise as well as ability to fundamentalize  different subjects. I did not watch the videos straight through, and I only moved on when I honestly felt like I had a great understanding on a particular subject. My mindset was How do I become a CISSP? and not How do I pass the CISSP?. I would stew on different concepts and pose questions to people in my work space on how they might have seen things in the real world. I also would spend random periods throughout the day googling different white papers just out of curiosity. I also realized that video series have similar setbacks that books do. They can be too short and not cover everything in the CBK, or too long and not be easily digested. This is why people stress using different learning strategies to achieve a goal. In order to meet the objective of conceptualization and application, I decided I would learn no better than being in a position where I can ask thought-provoking/situational types of questions. I was able to accomplish this by attending Larry Greenblatts online boot camp twice. I did not attend these boot camps until after I have spent maybe a year and a half to two years of on and off learning. I emphasize learning because, again, I had little experience to rely on to simply study. I wanted to make sure I had this so I could have substantive discussion with Larry and other students in the class. That combined with Larrys excellent approach to relating every objective/subject to a part of SDLC really made for a wholesome experience that for me, connected the dots and bridge gaps in my comprehension. I attended his online boot camp twice in early and late 2018. As a last run through, I spent a couple months watching the video series by Sari Greene until may of 2019. I stopped and took a couple months off, and just on a whim I decided to take the new CAT exam with the goal to narrow down my weaknesses. I passed the exam last week. When you ask what are the main things to study in order to pass the exam, anything in the CBK outline is fair game. A term may not be used, but the concept behind it will. It may also blend other concepts. The purpose of the CISSP is to gauge your understanding of the entire picture, and this is evident in how the questions are formulated and how the exam adapts to focus on your weaknesses. Experience normally is what allows you to more easily tie everything together, and because I lacked that I had to approach this exam in a way that was right for me. If there are any takeaways from this long post, I believe it starts with being honest with yourself. When answering a question, how did you reach a specific conclusion, and what concepts did you utilize to reach that conclusion? Identify what your gaps may be, and approach studying in terms of how it applies to the real world. Know your learning style. Just because I learned a specific way does not mean it will work for you. Your time spent on certain things could be drastically faster than mine. It depends on an individuals experience, comprehension, and even perseverance. Some people need to see things demonstrated while others can read a book and practice questions. Find out what works for you. Take bits and pieces of different methods and resources mentioned by other wonderful individuals in this group and tailor it to you. Also, you WILL be a CISSP. &amp;#x200B; Thank you, I hope I at least helped someone with this long rambling!"
194,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed @ 150 Questions,2,byt8j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/byt8j1/passed_150_questions/,2019-06-10 14:02:56,"I provisionally passed the CISSP exam yesterday evening at 150 questions with only 5 minutes left on my exam timer. &amp;#x200B; Background: Working in IT since 2004 starting out as a college lab manager and gradually moving up in my field to a System Administrator with specializations in Linux. I spent 5 years in the military as a cryptological linguist working cyber security before the military adopted a specialized cyber security MOS. I then moved back into a Linux System Administrator position supporting Linux virtualization in a SecDevOps environment. I was picked up in a cyber security engineering position supporting hardening and policy efforts specific to Linux environments and moved my way up to support an ISSO position. Afterwards I shifted gears and am currently working as a tester lead for an independent third party security assessor in support of risk assessment decisions made by an Authorizing Official. &amp;#x200B; To recap - I started my experience in the Security Engineering, Communication and Network Security, and Identity and Access Management Domains. I added experience with the Security Operations Domain with my military experience and then expanded into the Software Development Security Domain with my SecDevOps work. I then added some aspects of the Asset Security Domain to my work experience and then followed up with the Security Risk Management and Security Assessment and Testing Domains with my current work. My career path has touched all 8 security domains. &amp;#x200B; To study I utilized they Sybex Study Guide and 1st edition Practice Tests. I also utilized Eric Conrad's 11th Hour CISSP Study Guide. I began cursory studying the month before the scheduled exam. The week before the exam I came down with diagnosed strep and early stage bronchitis. The weekend prior to my exam I completed my final for one of my Master of Engineering in Cybersecurity Policy &amp; Compliance courses. The week of the exam I worked 60+ hours leading an on-site assessment of a system for cybersecurity compliance which left me with little to no time to read or prep for the exam. The morning of the exam I was able to sit down for a couple of hours and briefly read through all 8 domains in the 11th Hour CISSP Study Guide. I then had to work a couple hours around my house before leaving for the exam because of previous storm damage. &amp;#x200B; I went into the exam stressed, overworked, still somewhat sick (on antibiotics), and with very little study prep the two weeks prior. I would not recommend. &amp;#x200B; I tried to plan and budget my time on the test by spending enough time on each question to be able to complete 150 questions using the full time allowed. I did not expect to get to question 150 though, I honestly thought I would get to question 100 and then Pearson would stop the test and tell me to go home, take some meds, and sleep off the week and then try again a month later. When the test stopped at the 150 question mark I honestly didn't know what to think. When the testers gave me the sheet of paper that started with the word ""Congratulations"" it was an exhilarating feeling ... I then promptly went home, took some meds, and went to sleep. &amp;#x200B; Hopefully this will help some people out there with the experience and prior knowledge to take the exam, it is passable even on a very bad day or even a very bad couple of weeks. I honestly think that, while the study material was helpful, the most helpful aspect going into the CISSP exam is experience in the field. I wouldn't have survived the exam if I didn't have the mental muscle memory from experience to rely on. &amp;#x200B; Provisionally passed the CISSP exam June 8th."
195,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed CISSP in first attempt 137 mins at 100th question,20,c174wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/c174wn/passed_cissp_in_first_attempt_137_mins_at_100th/,2019-06-16 16:45:22,"My journey for CISSP has been quite happening. Being naive in security, I decided to prepare for CISSP (although Associate) to start with Cybersecurity certification path. I have only 2 years and 11 months of total experience as security analyst in security operations, penetration testing. For CISSP, it took ample amount of time (8 months) in researching the concepts, learning the domains, corelating the concepts (as Luke says), practicing questions. I referred following study material: Sybex (study line by line, 4 times) Kelly audios along with each domain Sybex practice questions (2 times) (800 questions) Attempted full tests from Sybex (400 questions) Covered all IT Dojo questions (106 questions) Did all AIO and practice book questions (more technical than exam point of view) (700 questions) Joined study notes and theory membership for a period of month Did all questions (560) Scheduled exam (30 days remaining for D day) Attempted Boson practice tests, each per week (750questions) along with revision After 48 hrs of last boson exam, I attempted CISSP exam on 14.6.2019 Got passed at 100th question Happy thereafter.  Key learnings: 1. Understand your weak areas from practice questions. Work again on topics. 2. Go through the complete process of learning without rushing or competing with peers. (4hrs in week day and 9 hrs on weekends ---- in last 3 months except some causal outings..) 3. Keep yourself motivated, read blogs as much as you can, I joined r/cissp group on reddit. 4. Understand the processes and correlate with other domains. 5. Align your security thoughts with organizational objectives, if possible try to apply in real day to day work. 6. NIST standards are really good, whenever have time just skim through some important ones. Good luck to all aspirants. You can do it.."

197,cybersecurity,cissp,A Test About Honesty,17,c1rzxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/c1rzxh/a_test_about_honesty/,2019-06-18 05:35:28,"Hello all, I just wanted to share some ""broad"" test tips for those who are looking to take the test, or who have failed and taken the test. One thing this test will do is test you on your honesty. I have seen alot of posts in this sub of people who both passed and failed. Many (not all) of the post discuss having 10 to 15, or even 20 years experience, 80% on Boson and Sybex quizzes, countless hours of studying daily. But heres another way to think about it. &amp;#x200B; \*Do you 'honestly' have 10 to 15 years as an IT manager who is proficient in all of the knowledge areas? or maybe just 4 years of actual management experience and 10 years as a technician working your way up. Maybe you work for a small business that doesnt require VPNs. Maybe the data you work with doesnt require all the cryptographic measures. Maybe a major incident has never happened while you were there. This test isn't a validation of your work experience, it is a measure of your comprehension of the Domain Areas ISC2 wants you to be familiar with. &amp;#x200B; \*Did you 'honestly' understand the questions you missed on the quizzes, or was there hope that you would recognize a similar question on the test and know the answer? I was guilty of it too. It is easy to get in a mode that you think you could possibly see very similar or exact questions on the exam. You won't. And if you did, I wouldn't trust them. I found that some of my questions could have been either answer by the addition of one word, being singular or plural, or being absolute or not. If you aren't getting the marks you like on your practice exams, don't get bent out of shape. In fact, look at it as an opportunity to review and really understand the concept. That will benefit you more in the long run. &amp;#x200B; \*Did you 'honestly' study like you said you would? Or did you just have really long cramming sessions? The CISSP has alot of material. It isn't a test to cram overnight. It isn't a test you can just memorize. Did you re-read the chapters in hopes to memorize what Sybex wanted to tell you? Or did you re-read the chapters, then sat in your chair and pondered how this would be done in a real life situation? This test isn't about how many flashcards you read, how many times you read a book cover to cover, or even how many resources you used. It's about understanding. Cramming and Regurgitating isn't understanding. Even though the information is short, this is where the Sunflower PDF comes in handy. A spouse, friend, family member, coworker, stranger on the bus should be able to ask you about a topic, and you should have the confidence (not specific definition) to be able to explain what it is to them. When they ask questions about your response, you should be able to answer those responses. This is true comprehension and understanding of the material. &amp;#x200B; \*Do you 'honestly' want this certification? Or did someone tell you to get it for the prestige, or the pay increase? This test will absolutely not benefit you if you want to be a hand's on, technical person. This cert is not meant for someone who just needs to focus on one domain at their job. This cert should not be exclusively used for monetary gain. This certification should be sought after by a professional looking to continue advancement in their career, as a signifier that you are proficient in the broad spectrum of cybersecurity. If you only want to be a network guy, a system admin, an incident handler. There are dozens of certs that will satisfy that. But the CISSP probably wont be one of them. &amp;#x200B; Hopefully no one is too offended by my post! Its just something that I thought about when I went through my journey, and what I've seen in this sub. If you are still interested, relax and just take it! The best advice I recieved from someone who was already a CISSP was to ""Do some yoga in the morning, and listen to your favorite song on the way there"". This is a ""you either know it or your don't"" kind of test, especially with it being a CAT and nature of the questions asked. Either way, best of luck to all of you!"

Submitted for endorsement by ISC2 and waiting for the response like everyone else. &amp;#x200B; Experience: * 4 years of cybersecurity in the military * B.A. in IT/Networking * M.S. in cybersecurity &amp;#x200B; Studied for around 5 months, about 15 hours per week then about 10 hours per day leading up to the exam because of a boot camp. &amp;#x200B; My study materials: * Udemy - Thor Pedersen: Watched every video and took notes as a run-through for all domains. Set a good foundation of the topics I needed to know. * Cybrary - Kelly Handerhan: Great series, really explains topics in a way thats easy to remember. Went through every module and also took notes High recommend. * Skillsoft: Decent for listening to in the car but pretty dry Gives an okay overview of topics but missing details * InfoSec Bootcamp * Did the Flex Pro online course with a live instructor * Another great resource - had an excellent overview of topics and went into the weeds when appropriate, but you should study before going into this or you'll quickly get lost. * Provided a myriad of extra documents to reinforce the boot camp * Also nice to have someone to ask questions to * Work paid for it, so it was totally worth it but probably wouldnt have done it if they didnt * I must add though, that the 'exam pass guarantee' they offer is contingent on you: completing the pre-study course material (lots of videos on each topic but do-able), Scoring a 90% on the pre-study assessment and each of the daily practice exams (Seven 250 question exams - very, very unlikely and extremely time-consuming), attend 85% of the course (I attended every minute of instruction for the course but disconnected the online session during lunch breaks and it counted against me), and take the exam within 2 weeks of the final date of the course (I highly recommend this anyway). * Boson * Very good resource * The wording of the questions had some similarities to the actual exam, but the best part was the explanations of each question on why the answer is what it is * Be sure to read the explanations of every question if you have the time, reinforces questions you got right and really helps with ones you got wrong * 11th Hour * Useful for looking things up last minute * I went through all questions and read the end of chapter summaries in the parking lot before the test - very helpful for the short term memory * Used Sybex 8th edition to fill the gaps and answer questions that arose after taking practice tests * Kellys Why you will pass the CISSP * Watch it. And watch it a few more times! * Great resource * It really gets your mind into thinking the right way for the exam * Larry Greenblatts exam tips * Another must watch. * Both Kelly and Larrys videos complement each other to set your mind right * He teaches you how to approach and dissect each question which is a critical skill on the exam &amp;#x200B; Other tips: * I agree with others whove said you will never feel entirely ready for the exam, so make a study plan, stick to it, and go take the exam * The wording of questions can be tricky, but its imperative you read the question, then the answers, then the question again slowly while breaking it down to find out what exactly theyre asking you - then eliminate the wrong answers (not necessarily just finding the right one) * Dont expect the correct answer to pop out at you like other exams * I want to emphasize the fact that the test engine totally figured out my weak domain I went into the exam knowing there was one domain I was weakest in, and the last 50 questions were very heavy on those topics. So be sure to be proficient in all 8 domains because you can theoretically ace 7 of them, and still fall below proficiency in one, leading to a failure. &amp;#x200B; Final note The test is challenging but definitely do-able so dont be too intimidated by it!"

I picked up my Security+ two years ago and now a new opportunity has come up where I could move into a very cyber-focused position with a lot of upsides. While I believe I would be a front-runner for the position based on my knowledge of the environment, players, etc. I want to go into this position as strong as possible. I am much more of a manager than a techie these days and I didn't have a lot of trouble with the policy questions on the Security+, but rote memorization of specific cryptographic methods, ports, protocols, etc has always been a weak spot. I ended up doing pretty well on the test, but I know the CISSP is a whole different animal. I've been reading through a lot of posts in here and checked out some of the recommendations for practice exams, books, etc, but I was wondering if there was a good, low-cost practice test I could take to gauge just how much work I have ahead of me. I actually want to schedule my test to motivate me, but don't have a clue as to how much time I really need. I tried a couple online and one iPad app and I averaged around a 70.

206,cybersecurity,cissp,6 Factors That Could Affect Your CISSP Certification Training,0,bsehsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/bsehsr/6_factors_that_could_affect_your_cissp/,2019-05-24 18:52:09," CISSP Introduction: Cybersecurity is considered to be a huge consideration in todays world due to the ongoing rise of cyber-threats, phishing attempts, in-house security breaches, and other forms of hacking. However, the number of credentialed which the security experts is actually decreasing, rather than increasing. That means demand for these pros is at an all-time high and would only be continuing to grow as the gap between supply as well as demand increases. The first step in achieving one of these coveted positions is considered to be learning about how to become a certified information systems security professional (CISSP). Below mentioned are 6 factors, which if you dont have the knowledge about, could really affect your CISSP Certification Training. Also, it is recommended that you have proper training, which you could gain through the SPOTO so that you could increase your chances of achieving this certification. 1. Earning CISSP Credentials: Earning your CISSP credentials would require that you would have to meet the current CISSP requirements. Yes, there is quite a lengthy testing process involved, but it would also go much deeper than this. You would be needing a significant amount of previous work experience, or you could become an Associate of (ISC)2 combined with a little less real-world knowledge with security work. &amp;#x200B; URL 2. Required Work Experience: Perhaps it would be considered as the single most difficult requirement for those aspiring to earn their CISSP certification is the work experience that would be needed. You would be needed a minimum of five years of experience which would be working in the real world as a security professional. You should be able to show proof that you would work full time in this role, and that you would have experience in a minimum of two out of the eight domains which would be highlighted in the (ISC)2 CBK. 3. Associate of (ISC)2: For those who have not required the above-mentioned work experience, it is possible to become an associate of (ISC)2. If you wish to do this, you would be needed to pass the CISSP exam, and then you could work as a security professional. You should also have six years from the date that you clear the exam to earn your full CISSP credential. If you are unable to do so during that time, you would be needed so as to retake the exam once more after you have acquired at least five years of work. 4. CISSP Examination: The actual exam would be consisted about of 250 questions and you would be having about six hours to complete them. They are the mixture of multiple choice and what the organization calls now as an advanced innovative question. These are drag-and-drop questions, and hotspot questions that would be designed so as to measure both bits of knowledge as well as cognitive skills. 5. CISSP Endorsement: Once youve cleared the CISSP test, your work wouldnt be yet done. You would need to complete the organizations endorsement process before you could actually earn your certification. This would be required that you would have the endorsement form, which would be digitally signed by an existing (ISC)2 certified professional, who would be considered as a member of the organization in good standing. 6. Required Candidate Background: (ISC)2 doesnt allow that just anyone to take the examination. There would be considered as a rigorous background which would be screening that would be involved and you would be needed to ensure that you meet these CISSP requirements before you have started the process. The organization states that no refunds would be given on exam fees or other expenses if you wouldnt meet background requirements and have already taken the test.

Also refreshed on everything I had learned to keep it in the head. &amp;#x200B; On exam day I read up on my last notes, then had a phone meeting just before the exam so I had a really early lunch and was slightly late to the center The room was hot and packed with other test-takers and the seagulls outside the open window didn't help at all, but I passed after 101 questions and about 1h45. &amp;#x200B; As for the questions... it wasn't quite what I expected. No strange wording, not too many ""think-like-a-manager"" and very few where I couldn't quickly identify the two most irrelevant answers. I actually found the questions easy, the hard part was that almost 80% of them had two answers that could in some sense both be correct. &amp;#x200B; Some notes: I could probably have skipped the Handerhan videos, and the 11th hour book didn't give me that much. I would probably have selected the Sybex book instead of the Shon Harris if I were to do it again. The Boson+CCCure combo was nice, especially with all explanations. Youtube videos are excellent for explaining concepts, you just have to find the good ones. The sunflower PDF didn't give me much, but then again I took a lot of notes and post-its."

Judging from what people say about the exam and how its a broad overview of topics, I feel fairly confident I can pass although it could be a false sense of confidence. My plan is to 1) skim the question 2) skim the answers 3) read the question carefully 4) read the answers carefully. Additionally I am going into the test with a ""critical"" mind while not losing focus about what I have studied. This could be a costly mistake.. I feel as long as I pick out the relevant parts of each question I will be able to narrow down the 2 remaining answers to a coin flip. Better yet, I will be able to nail the exact answer for most of the questions (I hope). Also by thinking outside the box while maintaining the methodology processes and their respective duties and functions, I will do fine. I've read the sticky and everyones recommendations and I know I am swimming against the advice of others. As I understand, practice questions only help so much during this exam. When lawyers and non-IT people pass this exam I have confidence I have a leg-up."

I hit submit after answering #100 and it told me I was complete. One of the two proctors was standing behind me with a smirk on her face so I figured I either did really good or really bad. Well turns out I did really good! &amp;#x200B; I know everyone asks the question(s) about what all did someone study and how was the test. Well here we go: &amp;#x200B; Study material and prior experience: &amp;#x200B; Study Material: \- Sybex 7th Edition (read cover to cover) \- Sybex 8th Edition (got it for 20 bucks off Amazon just to review any new material) \- Sybex Practice Exams (all 1400 questions) \- McGraw-Hill Practice Exams (these seem to be really technical in nature) \- Skillset Practice questions (these are very easy and possibly build up, but I didn't go that deep) Prior Experience: \- 16yr Army vet with MOS's ranging from Tactical Networking Switching Systems (31F/25F), Information Systems Operator (25B), Network Defender (25D). \- BS in Computer Networks and Security \- MS in Cybersecurity Technologies \- SEC+, CASP, CISM, GSEC, GCED, GCIH, CEH, and ITIL \- Currently one of the leads for a Tier II Cybersecurity Service Provider (CSSP) within the MDA &amp;#x200B; My background has exposed me to so much that when I was reading questions it wasn't that I was unfamiliar with the material, it was the wording that slowed me down. I read the Sybex 7th edition in about 2 months while finishing my Masters then spot checked myself and really studies nuanced details for about two and half months before taking this test. I have always felt based on listening to others talk about this test that it was going to be a lot tougher. Therefore, it was a proverbial 'monkey on my back.' &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure my post will help anyone, but I will try to help anyone who asks. &amp;#x200B; Thanks!"

Recent interest in career advancement towards cybersecurity. **How I prepared for the CISSP:** Security+ (obtained 10/18) SSCP (obtained 02/19): I had a voucher for this cert. I read that this had overlap with the CISSP and felt like it would be a good stepping stone. CISSP Android app (Magic Bytes Soft)  7/10: I like being able to prep for an exam at anytime from my phone, and this company had an app for the SSCP (which I also used). Getting the pro version gets you many more questions. Some errors in writing, but the value was in the detailed answers. Kelly Handerhan Cybrary videos  10/10: Closer to the exam date, I watched all of Kellys videos. These were gold- her explanation of major concepts (like cryptography and Kerberos) is something I highly recommend to anyone pursuing the CISSP. Training Camp bootcamp - 10/10: I asked on this subreddit what bootcamp would be the best. The majority recommended TC and they did not fail me. Again, the key to passing this exam is in mastering the concepts, which the instructor stressed throughout. Also to read every question at least twice! I took notes of everything said, and on the day of the exam, read through all my notes in order to review. Sunflower PDF  9/10: Read and highlighted it A through Z. Took my time on the last 3 days before the exam to read every single line. Very helpful! I also used the Boson practice exam and the 11th hour, and although they were good tools, I did not use them long enough to give them a proper rating. **Exam day:** I took a self-imposed 8-minute break after question 50 (1 hour into the exam). I reached 100 near the end of the 2nd hour and got ready for overtime when I received question 101. However, after answering 107, the exam stopped. I passed! I would read on this subreddit how many felt that they were failing during the exam, and I was no exception. Many of the tech terms were ones that I did not even encounter in my test prep, but again, having a clear understanding of the concepts made the difference. Thank you, community, for all of your help!"

Also, I have over a decade of IT/Cybersecurity experience. During my last exam attempt, I was 100% sure that I got an encryption question correct and my exam ended immediately after. (Perhaps I had gotten too many questions wrong and there was no way I could have passed at this point; this was question #108 I believe and I was feeling very confident in my answers during the exam, so I was shocked when I learned that I had failed.) At this point, I am beyond frustrated as I don't know what I should do to pass the exam. Any advice would help and would be greatly appreciated. &amp;#x200B; Thank you."

I sat in my car in the raid for a good 15mins staring at the printout. I detest failure and when you're the sole person responsible on exam day, its one of the worst feelings. I honestly don't know what more I could have done to prepare. In the last 2 months I have attended a boot camp, read both the ISC2 Official Study Guide and the Eric Conrad CISSP study guide, took thousands of practice exams, did the 15hr CISSP Kelly Handerhan video course on Cybrary, watching 'Why you will pass CISSP (mindset)' and spent around 20hours doing practice questions. Only 1-2 questions I really felt lost on but I certainly didn't get many from my preferred domains. And that's how this exam is structured. To hammer you and get you to fail based on inputs (as best I can tell). It doesn't really care so much that you hit 700 but that you are proficient in ALL 8 domains. For me based on the quest I got I was below proficiency for 3/8. &amp;#x200B; My background includes various support roles, compliance/audit, and cybersecurity spanning 9 years. I have a B.S. in Computer &amp; Information Science (2010) and a M.S. in Cybersecurity (2017). CompTIA Network+ and Security+ CE. Thankfully I did not pay for the course/voucher as it was provided by work and it is not required for my position since my Masters exceeds it (DOD). Losing out on $700 would have been the icing. From here (career-wise) I plan to focus on my job, maybe take CEH for fun next time it comes around, and enjoy life. If I get another chance at CISSP I'll take it but at this point in my career it would only be used as a tie breaker for a promotion between me and someone else. No real pay bump based on my region."

Just want to say thanks to the community it's been a fun ride. I passed at 110 questions and about 90 mins left. I honestly felt most of the questions were very straight forward and had the right answer jump out at me immediately. Some info about me I just graduated with a degree in computer science and applied math in December 2018. I spent 4 months in school as a server technician and have been a SOC Analyst for almost 5 months now. So even though I lack a ton of experience the exam is definitely very doable. I first tackled the CompTIA Security+. I started studying for that the week I graduated and took the exam in mid January 2019. Upon passing that exam I went straight into studying for the CISSP exam that night. I was feeling really motivated. I really do think that studying for the Security+ had a lot of information that translated over really well into studying for the CISSP. I put about 15 to 20 hours a week in studying since mid January. I was determined to pass this the first time. Study Materials: 1. The Sybex Official Study Guide 8th edition. I thought it was a great resource kind of gets in the weeds a little bit with details. I read it cover to cover and read the chapter summaries and bullet points multiple times. 2. 11th Hour CISSP Study Guide. I read this one in a night at work and honestly I hated it. I personally dont think it added anything to my studying at all. 3. Sybex Online Exam Practice Exams. I learn best this way by doing practice questions over and over till it hammers in the material. Anything I kept getting wrong I would re read that section of the book till I grasped that knowledge. I did every practice exam 7 times and was getting 95% or better on all of them at the end. This was my best resource for solidifying my knowledge. I attribute some of my ability to pass this as I am still kind of in school mode so I can study really well and know how to manage my time efficiently. I am also starting my Masters program in Cybersecurity in a few months so this was a great way to keep me in that mindset of studying. Overall I read a lot of great advice from the subreddit and thought I would like to add my experience and tell you it is definitely possible. Dont let your lack of experience hold you back. You can do it. Now to build my experience and become fully certified. Sorry for the rant and formatting I am on my phone.

Just wanted to fill everyone in on my experience as I found this sub reddit extremely helpful and motivational during my studies. I passed this morning at 101 questions in a little over an hour. &amp;#x200B; Experience I have almost 6 years in the cybersecurity world. Risk Management, Cryptography, Policy, is what most of my regular day to day duties are. I also do Cyber Defense Analyst work but its not my primary job. &amp;#x200B; Timeline and materials &amp;#x200B; SYBEX 7th edition- Purchased this book last year. I got through about 600 pages of it before I decided it was hurting more than helping. It definitely had the information required but just not my learning style. 11th Hour- Not a bad little book, a tiny bit dated but with the CISSP who cares, you need to understand the practices and policies not so much technologies. I read through it twice. Once when I gave up on SYBEX and again about 2 weeks before the exam. Kelly Handerhan Cybrary Videos- As everyone has already said, definitely worth the watch (considering they're free). Good information that is still relevant to the test and her tips that are scattered through out the series are almost worth the watch on their own. I watched the series all the way through twice. Once about 3 months before my test date, and again a couple weeks before and took notes this time around. CBT Nuggers 2018 CISSP- I don't hear a lot of people talk about this video series. I thought it was worth the money and it definitely provides a different viewpoint and content delivery style than Kellys videos. The visuals helped me immensely. YouTube- I watched a few random videos on things like networking, OSI model, etc just to help reinforce some of the concepts. IT Dojo CISSP Questions of The Day on YouTube- These were not to bad. I probably watched about a dozen of them on stuff that I felt I needed more explanation on. The questions are harder then they need to be but his breakdown is what makes the videos worth watching. SYBEX ISC2 Official Practice Tests- Honestly, I barely used these. I maybe went through three of the domain tests. Questions were not that great and explanations were underwhelming. BOSON- I'm not going to say to much as everyone else has already said it a hundred times. But these were good, I feel they overprepared you from a technical standpoint but their summaries after each question on why the right answer was right and why the wrong answers were wrong is extremely valuable. They also help with your reading comprehension and narrowing in on your weak domains. Kellys Why You Will Pass CISSP on YouTube- Holy \*\*\*\* this video was key. I watched it about 6 times throughout my studies including 30 minutes before walking into the testing center. &amp;#x200B; I hope this helps you out. Like I said, I found reading about peoples successes on this sub to be extremely beneficial and motivating. I wish you all luck in your CISSP journey."

I have a CCNP and at one point in my life was SQL certified, and my career is in cybersecurity. I took a bootcamp course, read the Sybex book cover to cover, read the 11th hour cover to cover, listened to all the Kelly Handerhahn cybrary videos (multiple times), took tons of cccure tests, lots of sybex tests (the only one I didn't do was Boson b/c I have a Mac and ran out of time to get a virtual environment spun up). This was about a 14 month process, and I really ramped it up for the last month. Really felt like I knew the material inside and out, for each domain. Had questions on there in topics that I had never seen before, and that weren't in any of the resources I used (I went back and double checked). I will acknowledge that I was using a later version of the books, so hopefully the new ones are updated, but I had heard from multiple people that it shouldn't have mattered. And for me to not encounter these topics at all, in any of the materials, seems strange to me.

I honestly have never participated/belonged to Reddit before, but after seeing everyone else's posts and prep, I figure I would share my story. Yes, I passed CISSP test Mar 5th (130 questions. Might have been about 125... don't remember, I was kind of in a funk, more on that later). Yes, I studied for just under 33 days. BUT: I also got my C|EH certification Jan 30th... and I put a couple of months into studying that, and there is a lot of overlap between the C|EH and about half the domains in CISSP. My history: Retired Air Force: But spent all of my career in Non-IT realm (I was aircraft technician, and later public affairs guy). Since I retired, here is my relevant experience 1 Year ADT/Access Security installation 1 Year Video Teleconference installation 1 Year Network Admin (Mainly cisco and Satellite based WAN stuff) 1 Year Systems Admin (windows/virtual server environment). &amp;#x200B; Currently a senior in a Bachelors: CyberSecurity program at the local university ==================================================== What I used: I only used 1 book. [Shon Harris All in one: 8th edition.](URL (Seriously, that's all I used. Had I known this site existed, I probably would have grabbed all that other stuff) ==================================================== How I studied: I originally planned on a 60 prep period: 1 week per domain (The Shon Harris book only has 8 chapters, 1 for each domain). As I read through the material, I realized that some of the domain didn't require as much work because of my C|EH studying, and in early February I bought the test for Mar 5th. I cannot stress enough the importance of setting a deadline for yourself. You will never be ""ready"" for this test. If you wait until your confident, you'll (or at least ""I"") would never have tested, and probably would have slacked off in my studying. And then I studied, somewhere between 4-7 hours a day. (4 on work days, 7 on weekends... not religiously, but as a general rule). I would first simply read the chapter--not highlighting, not deep-diving-- , to loosely familiarize myself with the material (This probably took the longest portion of each studying... each chapter is about 200 pages). Then I would load up the ""Digital Material"" that comes with the book (1400 question bank at [hub.totalsem.com](URL and would customize a test, only drawing questions from the 1 domain. I would first do a 50 question test, and on every question that I did not automatically know, I would look up the section in the book, and re-read that section of the chapter... highlighting the relevant material. After I did that, I would take only domain relevant question tests (150 at a time) in true exam format, and review the results (and explanations). I would then reread the sections of the book that dealt with the questions I missed. Waited until i was consistantly scoring 90% before moving on the next chapter. (Yes, I understand this leads to test memorization, but I tried to avoid that where possible). After Each domain, I would take a ""cumulative 150 question"" test including questions from all domains I had studied... again, not moving on until I was scoring over 90%. The week of the test (Starting Mar 1st) I would review the roughtly 2-4 pages of ""key concepts"" that came at the end of every domain. Anything that didn't make automatic sense, was reviewed. 2 days before the test, I started doing the ""Comprehension"" questions that are the index of the Shon Harris book. ==================================================== Summary/Motivation All in all I probably put 200 hours into studying. That's a LONG slog in just a months time. I kept my motivation because where I work (in a NOC) I can SEE the section of my floor I want to be (The security and compliance side of the house). Those guys are making 40% more than me, for essentially the same amount of effort. I have a newborn son (Born Dec 2018), and know what income level I want to be when he's old enough to appreciate it. I work nights so when I'm ""awake"" the rest of my house is asleep on the days I'm not working, making a bit easier to study between bouts of diaper changing and feedings. I know the certification isn't going to guarantee a job (I still am lacking lots of experience) but, it'll get me through certain doors faster than no experience AND not certification. &amp;#x200B; ===================================================== Impressions of the test My test experience was: My god that was awful. It was easily the hardest, or at least the test I felt the least prepared for I've ever taken. I knew by question 30 I was in trouble. I was mentally exhausted, beating myself up over questions that I had already answered and couldn't do anything about. By question 70 I was knew this was a failing effort, and I had wasted $699. At Question 100 I had almost entirely given up, and was just going through the motions. I don't even remember the last 30 questions or so, because I was just reading and answering... I was exhausted, and down-trodden. The test ended somewhere around 130... I walked out of the room. I didn't even look at the sheet of paper they gave me. ( I didn't know that they print multiple sheets of paper in the event of a failure). I made the trek out to my car, and called my wife to tell her that this had NOT gone so well. That's when I looked at the sheet of paper and realized it said ""Congratulations, you have provisionally passed!"" My impressions and advice: This is NOT a brain dumpable test. You cannot simply learn that Blowfish is a symmetric cipher or that Diffie Helman is the asymmetric. You must understand why one is used and another one is not (Or why 1 asymmetric cipher (SAY DH) is used as opposed to another asymmetric (RSA). You can't simply know that GDPR is the European privacy standard, you must understand the mechanisms for how they are enforced in multi-national companies, and when it would apply to folks who don't belong to Europe. Congratulations, those are technical questions... but how about Business Continuity plans and Policy adherence? You have to understand them... not simply know them. Don't make my mistake: you cannot waste your energy thinking about questions that you already answered. It will do you exactly zero good. You'll exhaust yourself before you are even half way done. "

I know there are a million posts here of people who have passed and what worked for them. Butttt, my question is... I am leaving out of the military here shortly and just scheduled my test for the first week of may (as they are paying for it and why not). So what would you all recommend on cramming for this exam in just over a month. Keep in mind I've been doing cybersecurity for about 6 years and a lot of the material I at least recognize and understand basic concepts.

After that I transition into Cybersecurity and last September got my CEH certification (fairly easy with all the training and courses I had to do for the army to get into the cyber branch.) Ive been doing 4 maybe 5 of the domains for these last 5 years so most of the information wasnt new to me. Study materials: *started with a 2 week boot camp on 2/25/19 *Sybex 8th edition official study guide - 10/10 (its all here just not served on a silver platter) *CBK 4th edition - not rating this one as I only used it for the domain questions, they arent easy. *kelly handerhan cybrary - 10/10 (the fact this is free still blows my mind. This includes why you will pass YouTube video.) *11th hour - 7/10 (this is worth the read regardless. It can only help to further your understanding of the topics.) *Sunflower - 7/10 (I studied these hard the last 72 hours to drill in anything I was weak on.) *Boson - 7/10 (these questions are good to drill in the material and worth the money. All that said you get what you put in, study the answers you got wrong because that in depth knowledge will be needed.) I got a solid 80 hours in during those 2 weeks with maybe an hour or 2 max after class at night. After that I studying about 1-3 hours on work nights and no more than 4 on the weekend.

Going forward, I am pursuing opening a risk mgmt consulting business or an ISSO type role - basically, well rounded expertise in the industry. My question is this, what is a good cert(s) to pursue after CISSP that would compliment and expand a CISSP cert? The main certs I was looking at are OSCP, CISM, CEH, and PMP. CEH is attractive because, one, I could easily pass it (I am ready for test, but not excited to pay $1200 for an HR cert) and, two, it looks impressive for people who don't know much about cybersecurity (let's be honest, that's its value and it's nothing to balk at). Of course, PMP looks like an all-round valuable mgmt cert; OSCP is a highly valuable technical cert; CISM doesn't look like it would add much to CISSP, but I see its name a lot. Anyway, you get the idea, and there are many people on this threat who have much better knowledge than I of what to pursue and what is valuable in the industry to potential employers and clients. I appreciate your thoughts. "

Some background information on me: I have a BSn in Computer Information Systems, 3.5 years combined in help desk (during this time I obtained A+, Net+, and Sec+) and recently moved into cybersecurity as a junior analyst about 6 months ago (I feel the Sec+ is what really sold me), all in the same enterprise environment. In my 6 months of working as a junior analyst, Ive done a variety of tasks involving SIEMs, alert reporting, incident reporting, and investigations. The bulk of my work though is risk assessment and mitigation so Ive been tasked with regularly meeting with senior management to remediate risks. My concern is that my lack of familiarity with the ISC2 exams puts me at a disadvantage and I really dont want to shell out $800 for an exam only to fail. Since I feel like Im fairly green to cybersecurity, I figured Id get SSCP and work my way to CISSP. Im also looking into leaning more towards risk management so Im really interested in CRISC and CISA so Im not even sure Im on the right path anymore lol.

I only need the one role plus my bachelor's to fulfill the requirements.,1,avj5cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/avj5cd/job_history_on_the_cissp_endorsement_application/,2019-02-28 09:10:42,"I have four years of experience doing cybersecurity which covers at least five domains of the CBK. This along with my bachelor's degree is sufficient for the five years of experience to gain my designation. I have other work experience that is relevant but not nearly so much as my cybersecurity role. Some experience in the travel industry is on the edge of qualifying. My most recent work experience as an independent contractor in a part time technician role creates complexity in determining exactly how much full time it counts for. Additionally, leadership at a previous storage company I worked for sold off the property for profit after we built it up. It is related in so far as we were responsible for physical security, identity and access management, security operations, etc...Proof of employment and a direct managerial reference are going to be extremely difficult to come by considering everyone went their separate ways when the property was sold. So for those of you who understand the review and audit process more thoroughly than myself, what would you suggest? Should I put my single most relevant cybersecurity role with my bachelor's degree and leave it at that? Or should I place everything down and take the risk of complications and confusion if I get audited? I have hear they investigate the most recent job history which are exactly the two that are most frustrating to quantify and prove employment at. As a third alternative should I perhaps place the two roles that I have that are the simplest to prove and have easily accessible references even though they are not the most recent and technically only my cybersecurity role is needed?

Used lots of good sources like: Sybex, Kelly, Boson, Thor, pocket prep app, IT dojo, Larry Greenblatt, 11th hour, AIO book, Exam Cram. Eventually, All You need is Sybex, Boson and Kelly. The rest are nice to have only if you enjoy it. Felt that 50% of the questions that were technical , were easy and other 50% were super hard and focused on process like risk management, software development lifecycle and BCP. Had to read questions 2-4 times and break it down to parts. (English second language) You are not only expected to know what each technology or process is but to understand and explain why one is better and what are the benefits or drawbacks of choosing it. I felt that more than anything it is an English test. I feel I over-studied, not because I really mastered all CBKs but because at some point, it is not effective. Eventually, on the exam, you are on your own and need to pick the right answer by using your judgment and not by pulling it from your memory. I dont think I could do much better if I had studied 6 months or failed if I studied only 2 month. I felt confident with less than 50% of my answers, the rest were more educated guess. I had a few questions,m that I did not understand the language and just randomly picked one answer. I was sure I failed and could not believe the letter printed said I passed! I relocated to the US recently and wanted the best certificates to show my worth to a potential employer, in case I need to. On last few days I had second thoughts of this whole cissp idea and if it really worth the effort. Dedicating last 3 months for studying cissp has taken a toll from me and from my wife and kids whom I didnt spend quality time at all. I gained weight and had less energy with other things like work and household .I definitely learned new things but not sure CISSP can dramatically advance a career of someone with 10-20 years of experience. It may be more beneficial at the early years of your career. I think lots of the topics covered by it are outdated and are yesterdays tools to fight tomorrows battles. Good luck to you all! "

My questions are: 1) Can someone clarify the rules regarding what I can call myself (Associate of ISC2, Associate CISSP, etc.)? 2) I've heard a lot of different versions of the rules, the most strict of which says I can't mention CISSP anywhere on my resume and can't even indicate that I passed the exam. If this is correct, what is the reasoning behind this? In what way is it unethical to indicate the I pass an exam that I did actually pass? 3) I was hoping to use the associate cert to get a foot in the door while I went back to school and gained the experience I need for the full cert. But if I can't even include the phrase ""CISSP"" on my resume in any capacity this is starting to feel like a huge waste of time and money.

Basically, we already know that the CISSP stands for the Certified Information Systems Security Professional which is an independent information security certification. It is offered by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, also known as (ISC) . The (ISC)  has created and maintained the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) on which the CISSP certifications are based. What is CISSP CBK? A CBK, which is sometimes referred to a Body of Knowledge, refers to a peer-developed compendium of what should an experienced professional in their respective field must know, which includes the techniques, skills, and practices that are habitually employed. The (ISC)  CBK is a collection of the topics which are relevant to cyber-security professionals across the globe. It establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles which are going to enable you to cyber-security and IT/ICT professionals worldwide in order to debate discuss and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding, categorization and glossary. Disadvantages of CISSP Self Study:  Lengthy Curriculum: If you prefer to study on your own, the first difficulty that you are going to face it the course curriculum. Yes, it is available on their website, but it is too much difficult to study it all. Even if you are able to go through all of their study material, but you are never going to be able to remember it all.  No Expert Advice: You are a fresher or you may have gained some other certification, which could give you somewhat idea in this certification, but naturally, you arent an expert and trust me even Experts sometimes need an Expert advice. So you are going to need it too and that you cant get it in studying independently.  Realizing Weak Points: Another disadvantage of the Studying on your own is that you will never realize your weak points, as you have never given any exams and you are unaware of what is your weakness. You may take some tests on your own, but it is never going to be like the one which you are actually going to give. CISSP Testing Centers: There are numerous study centers that you could join. But do remember that all of them arent going to be the best for you. You will have to choose the one which can give you high quality of study materials so that you could clear the CISSP certification in the first attempt. Personally speaking, if you really want to join a good training center the CISSPTOP would be the best one for you. Why choose Testing Centers: Career Growth: Learning through the Testing Centers would help you to go through a rigorous to test your knowledge. Its a thrilling experience to gain the[CISSP certification](URL It also ensures to provide you with a better, broader and deeper understanding of the concepts related to cyber-security. Acquire skills to protect organization: CISSP testing centers involve practical exposure in order to apply the knowledge and tools of the cybersecurity. The CISSP Testing Centers takes into consideration the real-time environments and give the practice tests in accordance with it and they also and consider the risks involved. There are many other advantages but only few training centers give it, like the 100% passing guarantee, money back guarantee and lots more. So you now know that what to look for while selecting a training center.

In my opinion, everything is expensive, as long as perseverance, maybe the world will be touched by you. I am a 90s, I dont have a lot of work experience. I havent been working for 3 years, and I dont have any work experience. So my sharing may be more suitable for the information industry with less experience new participants (A lot of friends have doubts, it takes only 5 years of experience to apply for CISSP). Yes, it really takes 5 years of work experience to apply for a certificate, but before that, you can still able to take the exam and if you have passed. You can apply for an associate member of ISC first. When you have 5 years of work experience, you can apply for a certificate directly without retake. Specific exam details, relevant precautions, regulations, etc. See ISC official website, Cybersecurity and IT Security Certifications and Training | (ISC) 2) The [**CISSP exam**](URL is more like a marathon. If 10 people participate in the competition, 5 people will give up because of the long distance. Three of the remaining 5 people are abandoned in the middle of the game because the marathon process is not the start but the final sprint, physical exhaustion, it will be abolished and there are last two people who still rushed and past the end. The other person is exhausted 10 meters from the finish line. Can you succeed? Look at the last ten meters and are you continue for that? 80 % would give up, 20% would be rush for that. This is a horizontal metaphor for my one-year preparation process and after taking the CISSP exam. I am the latter of the two people who eventually passed the finish line. The specific plan can be as follows (personal advice, varies from person to person, everyone chooses appropriate) 1.AIO 6TH (at least 2 times) 2.OSG 7TH (read at least 2 times) 3. On the basis of the above two books, start to get some exercises (the exercises can be found or the training institutions will send by the teacher, ISC official practice must be done again) 4. In the process of reading the book, do some summary yourself, after tea, after eating, take a look, add knowledge points. You can also buy some of the materials that others have prepared for and summarize the documents, which are used to consolidate the knowledge points. It is much more comfortable than the ""big bricks"" that you read more than 700 pages every day 5. For some erroneous exercises, practice with questions used to supplement missing knowledge points, summed up the skills of doing the exercises. CISSP exam, everyone said that the exam covers more than 1,000 knowledge points, so many knowledge points, how can they be completed, can only rely on accumulation one by one 6. Prepare for the exam, process application, credit card payment, etc."

242,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed - Thanks and Tips,1,9ntziq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/9ntziq/passed_thanks_and_tips/,2018-10-14 01:05:58,"Thanks for all the information on this sub, especially the pointer to the Kelly Handerhan videos. The course and her test tips were very useful. In addition to the videos, I used the Sybex 8th Edition Book and the online quizzes. Been studying since May with an average of 1-2 hours every couple days and then more like 5 hours a day the last week. I passed at 100 questions. I have 20 years of IT experience and have had technical certs in the past, like MCSE, CCNA, etc. This was definitely a different kind of test. I also currently work in Cybersecurity, but I think that somewhat hurt my objectivity, I had to back up and say how should something be done in general, not how did we implement this. Others have said it, but I will reiterate, pay very close attention to how the question is worded, especially the verb used. There may be 4 answers that are absolutely something you want to do to make a particular project or program successful, but only ONE that you can actually do in the phase that they are asking about (planning, implementing, etc.) I don't know if that ensured success, but it gave me a ton more confidence in my answers when I could say, ""I can only do B when I am planning."" Not new, but know more the processes involved and what happens in various phases of SDLC or project management. Plan-Do-Check-Act is a good high level memory tool, make sure you are not trying to do something before you plan it when the question is about when something happens. Few fact questions and a lot more BEST, WORST, FIRST, WHEN type questions. You need general understanding of the facts to recognize terms, but you more need to know processes. Lots of stuff about cloud and SDLC. I will post more as I think of things. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Long-time lurker, first time actually creating a post. I provisionally passed this morning, and I am very excited. (Sorry for long-winded post) As compared to most of the individuals I've been reading in this sub, I have a very atypical background. I'm early 30s, did almost 12 years active duty in the USMC, and just got out this past February - \~4 years in the infantry, and the remainder in the Intelligence Community. Thus, no billets specifically labeled ""cybersecurity"" or anything of the sort; however, I have been a lifelong ""computer guy,"" and I interned as a network administrator as a senior in high school. For you military types: I highly recommend [URL It is five days of free training, ending in two chances to sit for an Associate Analyst certification exam. I did the QRadar training in March, having only some exposure to actually implementing or conducting enterprise cybersecurity, and passed. I subsequently was hired onto the cybersecurity team at a F500 company (its a household name, but \*reallllly\* close to the 500th place). I've been doing enterprise cybersecurity since mid-2018. I began studying for the CISM in August. I scheduled the exam for October 1 to hold myself accountable; the primary study resources I used for that were the ISACA question bank. The CISM cert is very much in line with my DoD experience in the IC, so that helped out a lot and is what qualified as my necessary experience. I am an avid consumer of Information Security podcasts in general: Beyond the Network Cisco IT, Brakeing Down Security, Business of Security Podcast Series, Cyber Switched by (ISC)2, ISACA podcast, Security All In. I passed the CISM on my first try, and immediately scheduled CISSP for October 30 due to the amount of overlap I had seen/read about mainly in this sub. I blasted through the [skillset.com](URL CISSP stuff \*solely\* for the insurance. I do NOT recommend it as a legitimate study resource. I listened to Kelly Handerhan on Cybrary throughout the month while I was at work - so not diligently paying attention, but passively absorbing it. I also downloaded the Boson exam questions because I'd read (again: in this sub) that it was more technical than the actual exam, and the very technical questions were my weak points (mainly Cryptography). It took me right at two hours, and 110 questions, but I passed. If you have a good understanding of security as a business function, I think that is a great foundation. Kelly Handerhan is absolutely fantastic, and I listened to Larry Greenblatt's tips this morning on the way to the center. I bought the 11th hour book, but only read the crypto and the SDLC sections - I recommend having the book on-hand due to it's brevity. If I can do it, ya'll can too. Good luck and Godspeed!

Many of the terms and concept appeared was not found in the study material. About 70% of the questions were on 50%/50% guess. BTW, I would say difficult question would be a good indicator in an APT as it suggests that you are on the right track. I find the level of difficulty is more close to the question in the All-IN-ONE by Shon Harris, but it is like more on the conceptual side than technical. I had more than normal software testing and cloud-based questions. It could be the APT kept check of my performance and stress on my weakness, or that is the experimental questions.....

249,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed CISSP 11/5,1,9v4lop,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/9v4lop/passed_cissp_115/,2018-11-08 10:23:36,"Hey [r/cissp](URL Long time lurker, but I have been on this subreddit religiously for the past 4 months reading every new post that came up. Since this subreddit was a great resource for me, I thought I would share my studying and exam experience with everyone. **Background:** Army vet with a masters in cybersecurity and currently work as a technical lead responsible for scanning government systems for FISMA compliance. The other certs I hold are ITIL foundations and Security+. Overall, I would say that I have about 5 to 6 years of on the job cybersecurity experience. **Resources Used:** **CISSP Study Guide, 3rd Edition, Eric Conrad (6/10)**  This was the first book I picked up based off Amazon reviews and before I knew about this subreddit. The content was informational, but I felt that it was a bit outdated. I went through the book cover to cover one time answering all the questions in the process. I didnt pick up the book after that. **(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide 8th Edition (9/10) ** This was by far the most used resource for my studies. I heard a lot on this subreddit that the content does repeat frequently and can be reworded in some chapters (thinking that the authors had responsibility for different parts of the book). For me this was perfect in order for me to retain the knowledge. Seeing the content over and over again helped with retention of the material. This is how I used the book: 1. Read the book cover to cover. Skipped sections (not chapters) that I knew from previous experience. 2. Read the book again cover to cover (a lot faster this time) highlighting all the terms that I could not explain fully. 3. Revisited the highlighted portions multiple times to ensure that I could explain the concepts from memory. **(ISC)2 CISSP Official Study Guide 8th Edition Online Practice Tests (7/10) ** I took these when I had spare time after work or on the weekends to ensure that I was picking up the concepts. These were relatively easy and mostly served as refreshers from the book. In addition, the site itself had a lot of latency at times. **Boson ExSim-Max for CISSP v2018  (9/10)**  Based on what people said about these questions, I got a discount code and purchased the package. Its essentially a no-brainer since they have the No Pass, No Pay guarantee. As people have said before, Boson is more technical than the actual questions that are encountered on the exam. Nonetheless, the format on how Boson asks questions is similar to how the actual exam asked them. The feeling of thinking that two answers could be right on Boson is the same exact feeling I felt when I took the exam. The biggest mistake I made with these questions is taking too many custom exams and I started memorizing questions and their respective answers. If I could do it again, I would not do any custom exams and wait until I was fully prepared before tackling a full exam. The most value you can get from Boson is when you are seeing the question for the first time. I was scoring over 80% on each exam, but again, some questions I saw and remembered what the answer was. **Cybrary CISSP Course, Kelly Handerhan (8/10) ** Although I did not go through the entire course, this is a great free resource that provides a great overview of CISSP concepts. There were a couple phrases that stuck with me such as PGP is a good IDEA or People Don't Need To See Paula Abdul that helped me with retaining some of the interconnections between technologies. I really couldnt believe that it was free course since it simulated what a boot camp would offer IMO. **Eleventh Hour CISSP: Study Guide, Eric Conrad (6/10)**  I ended up borrowing this from a friend and reviewed it during the last week prior to the exam. The concepts and the information were similar to the CISSP Study Guide, 3rd Edition and the questions were exactly the same. I know the r/cissp community holds this in high regards, but this wasnt as much help for me. **CISSP Practice Questions Exam Cram, 3rd Edition (1/10) ** The questions werent even close to the other study resources I was using, let alone the actual test. I even found incorrect answers on some of the questions. Not useful at all and discarded it after the first practice test. **Taking the Test** I left 3 hours prior to my actual test time even though the testing center was only an hour away. I wanted to make sure I had enough time to have breakfast and relax before I got there. On the ride there, I listened to Larry Greenblatts CISSP 2018 Exam Tips and Kelly Handerhans Why you WILL pass the CISSP. I highly suggest watching those two videos before taking the exam to get your mindset right. The actual exam was much harder than I ever thought it would be. My version of the exam was also less technical than what I previously thought. Memorizing bit sizes, protocols, and the details of various technologies was not as helpful during the exam. I feel like ISC2 wants you to learn the overall process of why things are the way they are. Knowing processes, business continuity flow, and incident response were key for my success. I never felt like I was doing particularly well during the exam and I felt 100% confident on maybe 10 questions that I encountered. After I hit the 100 mark, I started to accept that I lost $700 dollars and I began feeling discouraged. Then I remembered that most people that post on here feel the same way throughout the test and the best thing is to keep pushing forward and dont admit defeat. After question 150, the exam stopped and I was told to go to the front for my results. The training proctor that was there before was not there, but I saw a sheet print out of the printer and I knew right away those were my results. The training proctor came back and glanced at the sheet once, looked at me, glanced at the sheet again, and quietly said, Congratulations. I could not believe it! I thought for sure that I failed. **Conclusion** I feel like my current experience did help me for the exam. I know the risk management, business continuity, and incident response processes since I have produced them from scratch numerous times at my current job. My advice is to not get caught up so much with the technical details, but instead understand the life cycles within the broader concepts of the studies. Also, during the exam, keep saying to yourself that you a risk adviser and your job is not fix things. Good luck everyone and thanks to this community for the motivation to keep going! By far the best resource."

Will try to list what all I've done and what I'm looking for. I've been studying on and off for months with a bit of a break recently. Background: over 15 years in IT, mostly sysadmin from home desktops all the way up to small project management and design, with the usual smattering of network+ stuff, and I've done some small scale software development. Plenty of .mil contract time working the sysadmin side of IA/cybersecurity, some higher level work in C&amp;A (now A&amp;A) and local security policy. I have two Boson exams left. I'm hitting above 80%. I've found those are sort of okay for indicating domain weaknesses, except sometimes the limited number of questions for some domains skews the results imo. I did take notes on missed questions. I did all the official practice questions (official book and the separate practice questions book) a while ago and was hitting 90% towards the end. For all questions I only did them all once, I can't get any use out of repeating them since I'll recognize the questions and answers. I polished off the 11th hour this week and made a few notes where things weren't familiar enough while reading and will study those. I did the official sybex book to start earlier this year and also did an isc2 boot camp. I'm going to review the big processes: BCP/DR, risk management and assessment, SDLC for familiarity with the order of steps, and others I'm probably forgetting at the moment. Going for large steps and not memorizing every damn detail (eg know when BIA happens but not necessarily memorize the exact 5-9 substeps of every piece of BCP/DR). I'll review mnemonics on crypto, osi, etc. I've already listened to the older Kelly mp3s twice, simple cissp twice, free Larry G videos. I have the Sybex book and the study guide from the isc2 boot camp as references. I blew though all the it dojo test questions a while ago. I guess my question is what can I casually read or listen through this weekend to help? I can sign up on LinkedIn to get the Chapple videos or anything else, but if that's a long course that may only be useful for specific domains. I have free access to safari online but has the same problem. Maybe the newer Kelly H material? Would the all-in-one book be okay just to hit any troublesome domains? I don't care about cost, just looking for opinions on what else to grab if anything, and discussion to help me (and anyone else!) focus. Thanks."

Working on my endorsement process now, and sad of course that I have to wait another 3-4 weeks to get the final thumbs up from ISC2 but I will live. **Experience** - I've been a sysadmin for 7 years for a mid-level enterprise level org. Really let me sink my teeth in to a lot of great technologies and projects and with the semi-recent doubling down on security initiatives in the past years it's giving me an opportunity to make the pivot into infosec that I've been really hoping for. **Education/Certs** - I have my B.S. in IT (from a state school no less) and my M.S. in Cybersecurity from WGU (don't make fun, great program to get the book smarts needed at least, nothing really ""technical"" though). It gave me my CEH and CHFI, which really helped give me a solid understanding of many of the CISSP domains at the start. I also have my MCSA and A+ (doesn't everyone though?). **Materials used:** * **11th Hour (3rd edition)** - this was a good resource for the last 2-3 weeks of studying. No fluff, right to the point in each domain. This means if you don't have the core concepts down though, you'll miss a lot of the minutiae that could cost you some questions. * **Sunflower PDF** - this is useful, although I agree with the complaints as to formatting - it's pretty awful to read end to end. I recommend just focusing on the domains/concepts you're struggling with the most. * **Shon Harris book (2015)** - This was actually a really great resource, although it's a bit heavy in each domain. I started out reading from cover to cover but eventually started focusing on the sections I need the most help in. If you can make your way through it though it's hard to beat her insight in the 8 domains. * **Cybrary videos/MP3s** - Kelly Handerhan is a treasure and this series was critical to my success. I had the MP3s on my phone and listed whenever I was in the car. Lots of great points and tips here, and as it's free you have no good excuse to ignore it. * **Boson exsim-2018 tests** - Man these were excellent and extremely helpful (as many here point out). Get the Facebook coupon and go pick this up as it really helped me get in the proper test taking mindset. The question structure is very similar, although as some have noted it doesn't get super deep into the critical thinking like the real test can. Still fantastic and a huge help in identifying my weak spots for for further study. * **Larry Greenblat Youtube tips** - This was actually super useful, I watched it the day before my exam. I really recommend taking the 30 minutes to watch it, and follow the suggestions on how to read the questions, answers, and how to start narrowing down the correct choice. All in all, what I can say is read through the questions carefully and note what they are really, really asking for. There were times where after reading it I figured out ""Oh! They're asking for a process, 2 of these are just a concept."" - things like that will help you figure it out. Once you're left with two, you can really reason out the right answer. Before hitting next, I would explain to myself in my head and justify why this was the most correct answer to the question being asked. It's worth it to take the time, as you can't go back once you answer a question. Of course, that said I finished in about 70 minutes or so right at the 100 question mark. 3 months of studying all said and done, with the past month being the most serious. Not mentioned above, but I *did* sign up for Skillset.com's course just to have the fall back if I failed for a free retake. The questions are awful though and not a good resource at all for actually studying for the test. Question for those in the know, is it possible at all to mention on LinkedIn or anywhere that I've provisionally passed? I want to tout this thing now that I'm done, but don't want to anger the ISC2 gods. "

Actually this is my third attempt for CISSP and I finally passed! I failed because of the wrong study approach and would like to share my experience with you to prevent wasting money for taking multiple attempts. &amp;#x200B; **My Background** 2+ years cybersecurity consulting experience, including cybersecurity assessments, vulnerability analysis, IAM strategy consulting. Passed CISA in Dec 2016 &amp;#x200B; **Study Materials Used** CISSP Official Study Guide 8th Edition CISSP Official Practice Tests Sunflower pdf Youtube videos when I didn't understand the concepts (e.g. TCB) &amp;#x200B; **My Experience** I failed the first CISSP attempt with 660 scores in Oct 2017. I only studied a bootcamp notes (not comprehensive enough to cover the majority of CISSP concepts) shared by my manager. Since my manager passed CISSP by attending the bootcamp and studied the bootcamp material. I followed his approach, that is -- only studied the bootcamp material and took around 1000 questions from a practice test that I found in university library. That's why I failed. &amp;#x200B; For the second attempt in May 2018, I read the CISSP Official Study Guide 7th Edition in Chinese version because my first language is Chinese. I read the book 3 times and studied the concepts that I thought was important in the English version, including kerberos, RAID, laws, etc. Many of the concepts were studied from the answer explanation. I know that my study was very discrete and unorganised. However, I think it is still okay to pass the exam with the knowledge I had at that time. After all, what I missed was the details, which made me missed 3-4 questions in the exam only. For the second attempt, I only got 2 domains above proficiency level and 1 domain near the proficiency level - even worse than the 1st attempt... Forgot to mention, I scored 66% in the practice test which I did 2 days before the examination. I spent less than 1 minutes for each question in practice tests. So if I answer the questions carefully like I'm doing the exam, my score should be 7x%. &amp;#x200B; This time, I read the Official Study Guide once and made my own notes in a very detailed way (107 pages). I started doing the practice test 1 month before the exam (2 hours per day, spent more time during weekend) and got 65% - 73% across the 8 domains. Then I started reading the Official Study Guide 3 weeks before the exam and finished the reading + notes taking 3.5 days before the exam. For the remaining 3.5 days, I studied my own notes, tried to memorise everything in the notes, and completed a after-domain practice test (scored 76%) . This is a very rush schedule and I got into a panic before the exam because I thought I could not finish memorising all the concepts in the notes. I even planned to schedule the 4th attempt! On the exam day, as my exam scheduled at 3pm, I woke up at 7am, studied until 2pm and was super worried about the exam. In fact, I could only memorise 80% of the concepts before stepping into the exam centre. However, after finished the 50th question, I was feeling good and knew I am going to pass! After I submitted the answer of the 100th question, unsurprisingly, I passed the exam! &amp;#x200B; **My Suggestion** I would like to share my views and suggestions to those who are going to take CISSP exam 1. No need to read multiple textbooks. I read other posts in Reddit saying they read multiple sources of textbooks to prepare the exam. However, I think reading the Official Study Guide is enough. Almost all the concepts you will see in the exam have been covered in the Official Study Guide. I don't think it worths spending months to read other textbooks and sources as I only encountered 2 questions in the third attempt that the concepts are not covered by the official guide. I don't remember the details in my first attempt, but for the second attempt, the number of question was similar. 2. Google the concepts when you are clear about them. Searching for answer and reading wikipedia are much more faster and efficient than reading other textbooks. 3. Be very careful for the first 20 questions you answered. From my experience, I feel that CAT will keep asking the domains that you are not familiar with. If you answered something wrong, the following questions will be harder. So you should think more than 3 times for the first 20 questions before you submit your answer. I did not do it this way for my second attempt and set 1.2 minutes as the deadline to submit the answer. It is no need to worry about the time. As far as I know, many people finished the exam at 100th or 10X th question. I spent around 40 minutes to finish the first 20 questions and the difficulty of the questions obviously decreased. 4. Luck is very important. If I were given the same set of questions in my second attempt and had answered them carefully like this time, I think I could have passed it (although I would give wrong answers for some networking questions). 5. Review the answers you got wrong in the practice test before the exam. I found around 5 questions in the exam were from the practice test. 6. Don't give up if you failed before. Hope all of you pass the exam!"

Its easy and fast to complete an order with us! - Most of our certifications meet the requirements of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8570.1. - Thousands of government employees and contractors are members of the (ISC) community. - Weve developed a certification to align with the Risk Management Framework (RMF). - (ISC) Certifications Meet the Requirements - Weve got you covered. - You need a cybersecurity certification that meets the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8570.1. - Refer to the chart below for many (ISC) certifications that qualify. Our certifications are noted in bold, and theyre organized by Directive 8570.1 position category and level. - Please note, the certifications below are **the only commercial certifications the DoD will accept as fulfillment** for the 8570.1M requirement. - More Information on Directive 8570.1 - Directive 8570.1 requires every full- and part-time military service member, defense contractor, civilian and foreign employee with ""privileged access"" to a DoD system  regardless of job series or occupational specialty  to get a commercial certification credential that has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). - (ISC) was **the first** organization to receive ANSI accreditation under ISO/IEC Standard 17024 for its CISSP certification. All of the (ISC) certifications above meet these requirements. - Directive 8570 divides the workforce into position categories that have various levels. It also specifies the types of commercial certifications that qualify for each of the defined categories. 3rd Party Opinions about Certifications ======================================= From Reddit thread - As I understand CompTIA CASP is less intense, yet more technical, than ISC2 CISSP. Both satisfy the same reqs under DOD 8570 \[editor's note: almost true, **IAM Level III** with CISSP but not CASP\]. - If you don't have the experience requirement for ISC2 and the CISSP, you won't pass the endorsement process until you do. You will have a ""associate of ISC2"" until you gain the required experience. So if you need a ""fast"" cert, compTIA is probably the way to go. It is still a stepping stone, then you can focus on the CISSP. - As said, you won't get a full CISSP without the experience. However, ""Associate of ISC2"" meets DoD 8570 requirements. In addition, you've got, I believe, 6 years to fulfill the experience requirements (which would be 4 years experience for you). - From a personal opinion standpoint, if you're going into the policy side, CISSP catches people's attention and can help put you on people's radar. Just make sure you have the knowledge to back it up :) &lt;URL A typical (ISC)2 certification ladder begins with the SSCP certification. If you pass the SSCP exam but don't have the required work experience, you are granted the Associate of (ISC)2 credential. (The same applies if you pass the CAP, CSSLP, CCFP, HCISSP, CCSP or CISSP exams and don't have the required work experience.) However, candidates who achieve the SSCP generally move on to the CISSP, and then specialize in security architecture (CISSP-ISSAP), security engineering (CISSP-ISSEP) or security management (CISSP-ISSMP). Where CISSP Fits vs Other ISC2 Certifications --------------------------------------------- - CISSP - Leadership &amp; Operations - SSCP - IT Administration - CCSP - Cloud Security - CAP - Authorization - CSSLP - Software Security - HCISPP - Healthcare Security &amp; Privacy "

Figured I'd share my experience. &amp;#x200B; **Background** I have about a year and a half of security engineering experience. Before that I did network engineering and linux system administration for almost 2 years. Prior to that, I did about 2.5-3 years working in various levels of technical support for a variety of IT products and services (storage controllers, ISP, etc). As far as security certs are concerned, I have Sec+ and CCNA Sec. I've also spent some time working towards the OSCP, but do not have that yet. I have a significant number of certifications in non-security topics (CCNA R&amp;S, A+, Net+, Lin+, Proj+, AWS CSA Associate, etc) My bachelors was in IT - Security and I'm almost done with my Masters in Cybersecurity. &amp;#x200B; **Study Materials** Boson CISSP Questions Official Practice Questions Book Cybrary CISSP Videos (Kelly Handerhan) &amp;#x200B; **Time Spent Studying** Probably about 4-5 weeks in total with varying degrees of intensity. Towards the last week I was putting in about 2-4 hours a day and the last 2 days before the exam I spent all day studying (10+ hours). &amp;#x200B; **Reaction** My immediate reaction was that I felt the test was very hard. I was somewhat surprised, because I'd felt that I had study fairly intently and none of the practice exams were overly difficult by the time I went to take the exam. Admittedly, I didn't read any books and only watched the Cybrary videos, so perhaps that's where I made my mistake. I felt like I was guessing on almost everything, but my exam stopped a little above 100 questions, so I guess I was doing better than I felt. The Boson's helped, but not as much as I would've thought. Same with the official practice questions. I think ultimately, the most helpful thing was my security experience and the fact that I have a fairly well rounded skillset (Done some networking, some programming, some security, some cloud, etc). &amp;#x200B; **Comparative Difficulty** This was definitely harder than the Security+, but mostly because of the way the questions are asked. (What's the ""BEST"", the ""MOST"", etc). The CCNA Security was much more difficult, I actually failed it twice before I finally passed. I'd say this ranks as maybe... the 2nd or 3rd most difficult certification I've taken, mostly because of how wide it is and how in-depth the questions are, as well as the way the questions are asked. &amp;#x200B; **What's Next?** I think I'm going to look towards the OSCP again. I may do CEH just because everyone seems to want you to have one out here, but I'm not sure yet."

The funny part is that the test was not so bad but since coming back from deployment at the time I did not have time to study for 3 weeks leading up to the exam. I had prior 6 months of study but those last weeks to keep up were critical and I failed it. It was heart breaking to say the least but I then decided to go get my Masters in Cybersecurity at WGU. Once I complete my Masters I will give it another shot. I love this field since I done prior jobs securing networks. My current job does not require it but I want to move up in position in the next 3 to 5 years. So to all that fail, don't quit but just take a break and decide different routes. My studies were no different than what everyone on here was doing already. But my only advice is try tons of different study banks. This way to see how tricky some questions can be.

I have my A+, Net+, Sec+, and CEH. The CISSP was a requirement for work. I am a contractor, so all study materials and the test were out of pocket. Every resource that I used provided value. **Resources:** Official Sybex Study Guide - Critical to understand what content is on the test. Official Sybex Practice Tests - A perfect representation of the test. 11th Hour CISSP, Conrad - A perfect way to identify any ""missed"" topics really quick Simple CISSP, Phil Martin (Audiobook) - Great way to sneak in studying into your background noise. Boson Practice Tests - It's a mile wide and a mile deep. Which is nice for proving that you understand the source material. Sunflowers Review Sheet - Not a bad way to stuff some data into your brain at the last minute. **Actual method of study:** **Phase I 60 Days Out -** I started listening to Simple CISSP whenever I was in my car, grocery shopping, or if I had free time. The audio book wasn't my primary focus, but I would always try to listen closely if there were new terms or a concept that I didn't grasp completely. I completed one of the full practice tests from the Sybex Book, as well the first Boson Practice Exam. I did the Sybex tests cold (no answer checking until the end) and used ""show answer"" on the Boson test to check my progress real time. If I missed a question, then I highlighted that section of the Sybex book, skimmed it, and then read it later. **Phase II 30 Days Out -** I listened to Simple CISSP for a second time using the same approach. I attempted to read Sybex cover to cover, but gave up pretty quickly. I resorted to skimming and only reading material if it was unfamiliar to me. I left my computer running (and disabled automatic updates) and answered Boson Questions every day. With Boson, I would answer questions until I got 5 wrong. Then I'd look up and understand the answer for those five. Sometimes I'd get 50 questions done in one sitting, other days it would just be 5. **Phase III 5 Days Out** \- I took 5 days off from work to prepare. I started every morning with a 100 question Sybex practice test and timed myself. Then I'd read a section of 11th Hour, and then I'd grade my exam and go back to Sybex to dig deep on anything I missed. I worked out and played video games the day before the exam. The night before the exam (5pm - 8pm) I printed out the Sunflowers Review sheet. I'd skim the page and then crumple it up and make a shot for the trashcan. **Test Day -** My test stopped at 100 questions, which took one hour. This was perfectly in line with the tempo that I set from the Sybex Practice Tests. In fact, the Sybex Practice Tests were the best resource to get a feel for the questions, which were a mile wide and an inch deep. No specific technologies, just questions about lowering the risk for your organization."

Took official practice exams and was doing well but very few of the questions were similarly formatted. Took almost the full time but was stopped at around 130 questions. When I got my results I was crushed...for about 20 mins. I put on the speech from rocky where he talks to his son about not letting obstacles keeping you down. Took some time to think and be honest with myself. I realized this felt more like a what not to do/trial run. My exam was scheduled for 8 am and I stayed up late the night before practicing and reviewing. Went in on empty stomach (30 hours without food). These were things that I did really wrong. I am not trying to make excuses, as I can honestly say I didnt give it my best shot. Didnt read through the material in the books as closely as I should have. I will go over as much material as I can and once i am done with that i will schedule it for an afternoon so i can make sure to do the usual good advice (get a good night's sleep, eat a proper breakfast, trade my soul to the devil, etc).

263,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed (provisionally) 8/1,15,93q3eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/93q3eo/passed_provisionally_81/,2018-08-02 01:44:41,"I keep reading the printout over and over to make sure it's real, but somehow I passed. 50 minutes, 120 questions, and it's all over. **Background:** Accounting Major (2015), Passed CISA in 2017, working as an IT Auditor for the past 3 years. While occasionally my auditing work would touch on security, I essentially had no experience or background in security going into this. **Motivation:** I don't particularly like IT Audit. I think it has given me a solid foundation for my career, but rather than spend my days reviewing user access approvals, I want to pivot my career into Cybersecurity. However, as an accounting major, there understandably wasn't a lot out there for me. I'm hoping that by becoming an Associate of ISC2 I can show employers that I am committed to learning and expanding my technical knowledge base. And oh god I hope someone hires me for this in the next year so I can get the experience and not have to take this test again. **How I prepared:** I started studying June 30, as I had the week off work for the 4th of July Holiday. I also took off a few days last week and this to top off my studying. Every day between June 30 and test day, I studied for at least 15 minutes (even though sometimes this was just doing practice Qs on my phone before falling asleep). 1. June 30 - July 8: I started by watching Kelly H's Cybrary videos and taking copious notes. I would usually watch once at regular speed, then watch it a second time, pausing as necessary to take down the important information and make my notes as clear and concise as possible. 2. June 30 - Aug 1: I listened to the Simple CISSP Audiobook around 3.5 times. Driving, doing laundry, cleaning, gym, walking somewhere for lunch, brushing my teeth, I had it playing in the background as often as possible. Whenever it finished I would just start it back up again. 3. June 30 - Aug 1: Pocket CISSP app for IOS. I paid the $30 to get all the features, and used this almost every day when I had a little downtime. The most useful parts of this were being able to see how I was doing in each domain, and spend extra time drilling questions from that one, as well as having the answer explained for each question as I went with a section reference to the Sybex book. The books had explanations, but on the big practice tests they didn't say which domain it was from, or include a reference of where I could find more info if I wanted to read up on it more. 4. July 21 - July 22: Over the course of 2 days I read the 11th hour CISSP cover to cover and highlighted/annotated important sections. Additionally, as I read 11th hour, I reviewed my Cybrary notes, and augmented them with info from 11th hour as needed. 5. July 23: Using the official Sybex Material, took my first practice test, and around 75% of them correct. I feel good about this, and note my weak areas are mostly in Networking Protocols, and Security Operations 6. July 24 - July 28: I open the Sybex book for the first time. From reading here, and from what my peers said, I didn't expect this to be a great resource, which is why I saved it for last. My plan was just to read the chapters I struggled on, but I ended up spending the next 4 days reading it cover to cover and doing all the practice questions for each chapter (Both multiple choice **and** written.) As with 11th hour, I augmented my original Cybrary notes as I went along. My notes were done outline style, so there was plenty of room to add more stuff to them. 7. July 29 - July 31: Did another practice test, scored 89%, feeling really good. I felt like I had concepts down. I went through all my notes and made a study guide of things I wanted to memorize and spent these days memorizing my page of things to memorize and doing more practice questions. 8. Aug 1: Test day! Skimmed through my highlights in the the 11th hour Cryptology, Network Stack, and SecOps sections while commuting to the test center (I take the train). Went in, wrote down as many things from my memorization pages as soon as I sat down, only to find that memorization was not a key to success for this test, and I ended up not referencing the sheet once. My conceptual knowledge is what I think got me through. When I went to get my printout, the first one printed out ""fuzzy"" so the guy had to print it again and it was probably the most agonizing two minutes of my life waiting for the reprint. He wouldn't give me the fuzzy version for me to see if it said pass or not. **Reflection:** In hindsight, I think I studied just the right amount given my lack of background/experience in the security space. Knowing what I know now about the study materials, I would use the same ones except the audiobook. I don't think I retain audio information very well, and giving my brain more time to listen to fun stuff would have been nice these past few weeks. If I were advising someone on how to study I would recommend: 1. Read 11th Hour CISSP first. It's not a long book, and gives a solid overview of the exam concepts. 2. Watch the Cybrary Videos and augment your 11th Hour Notes with them. Kelly's teaching style helped me learn easy ways to remember more difficult concepts, and most importantly talks about getting in the CISSP mindset. I do not think I would have passed without these videos. 3. Sybex Cover to Cover, and do all the questions, especially the written ones. I feel the written ones made me understand instead of memorize. For example, not only did I know the network stack in order, but I could give 2-3 sentences about what each layer does, and common protocols at that layer. Make sure you really understand the concepts, and you aren't just regurgitating. 4. Do a practice test midway, and 2-3 days before your exam to identify your weak points. 5.

This is going to be a long piece of writing so if you are running out of time just see the following facts: * Total IT education/experience: 6 months in IT audit three years ago * Study time: 310 hours in 4 and half months * Exam result: Passed in 137 question in 132 minutes with the God's blessing! If you have a time, please feel free to read through**.** **Background:** I have a degree in Finance but currently working in accounting field with Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation. IT in general has been my area of interest since I started career in accounting field and I was able to finally narrow it down to cybersecurity in the beginning of this year and decided to switch career. After many hours of researching, I found out that CISSP is the golden certification to have in the field and it did not require experience to sit for the exam; therefore, I decided to take the exam and shared my goal with the people around me as well as online CISSP candidate communities. I had many negative and discouraging feedbacks from the people but it did not stop me from pursing and only made me wanting to pass it more to prove them wrong. I came up with a strategy to tackle the beast one step at a time. One thing I learned from studying for CPA exam was that nothing is impossible until you give up. As I have stated earlier, I was not an accounting major and I barely had enough accounting credits to sit for the CPA exams (I needed 18 credits in accounting at the time of passing along with 2 years of experience to be licensed). I was able to complete all 4 parts of the exam at first try in one year after putting in just about 700 hours of studying while serving in US Army and it helped me to get the job with one of the biggest accounting firm after leaving the military. For CISSP, I gave myself 4 and half moths (couldn't give myself more time because my wife is due with the first baby in July and I didn't wan to take a chance) with 300 hours of studying time. I used the stop watch function in my watch to record the studying time very strictly. (for instance, I stopped the watch when I had to use the bathroom while I was studying). [Actual study hours from excel](URL **Study Materials:** I was lucky to have access to safari books at the client site and almost all the well known study materials were available. Following are the study materials I have used in a chronological order: * Cybrary: I have listened to Kelly almost every time I was in the car by myself. Time I spent listening to her is not counted for the study hours. * Shon Harris AIO Exam Guide 7th edition: Needlessly to say this is the best reading material for the exam. Took me about 160 hours to read word by word and gain decent understanding in overall contents. This is definitely one of the better reading material for someone who has no experience and background like me as it had more detail explanation with easy to understand analogy. I think end of chapter questions are way to technical for the exam. Averaged 75&amp;#37; (272 Qs) * Total tester: this is included in the CD that comes with the book. Issue is that it generates random questions from pool of around 1700 questions and chances are you will see the same questions again which wasn't really helpful. Only went through about 700 questions and averaged low 80's. * Never had chance to do the 142 questions in Appendix A * CISSP Official Study Guide 7th edition: Used as a supplement reading material to AIO and mainly used to see the practice questions at the end of each chapter and averaged 72&amp;#37; (420 Qs) * CISSP Study Guide, 3rd edition (Eric Conrad): used for same reason as above and I think this book is more concise than AIO. Took quiz at the end of each chapter and averaged 84&amp;#37; (120 Qs) * CISSP Official Practice Test: I think the explanation for the answer was usually not adequate to understand why I got the questions wrong. Averaged 75&amp;#37; for the questions (1300 Qs) * CISSP Practice Questions Exam Cram, Fourth Edition: I have not seen this book recommended from other posts but I think this is much better than CISSP Official Practice Tests. It provides very detail explanation for the answers and it helped me a lot. Averaged 69&amp;#37; (1037 Qs) * Larry Greenblatt's review: I bought the review course ($100) and I don't think it was worth it. He is good but each video clip was really long to stay focused and there were way too many distractions (side talks). His free youtube videos were more helpful. * Boson 2018 edition: I think this was actually the closest to the actual exam and only found out about this testing engine 4 days before the exam. Averaged 76&amp;#37; (750 Qs) I also have used the Quizlet app to memorize the terms and mindmap apps to create mindmap for each domain. I spent lot of hours (20+) creating those as I was reading AIO but never have really used them. I got to memorize majority of terms and domain contents after hours and hours of reading and solving over 4,000 question and reviewing them thoroughly. **Exam Day** As you might have noticed already, English is not my first language but I still applied for the English CAT anyways because all my study material was in English. For the fellow ESLers, English will not be an issue on your test as long as you studied with the English material so feel free to sign up for the English CAT and take advantage of 150 questions! I got to the testing center about 30 mins prior and I was able to sit for the exam after the registration process. Questions didn't seem much more difficult than practice questions. Some of them were definitely confusing but most of them I was able to eliminate 2 or 3 choices. I took the first break after 100 questions with about 90 mins remaining on the clock. My advice is that make sure you bring a good source of energy (maybe chocolate?) for the exam. I had a very light meal about an hour before the exam and I could tell that I was losing focus after 100 question due to lack of energy and was feeling sort of light headed after 130 questions. Thankfully the exam stopped right at the point where I was going to take another break. **Conclusion** If you have read this far, I apologize for the poor piece of writing as my intention was to provide useful information to the fellow candidates but my limitation in English writing didn't allow me to share to the fullest extent. In my humble opinion, CISSP is definitely a tough exam but difficulty level was not much different from of CPA exams. I firmly believe anyone can pass this exam as long as one stay disciplined and put in right amount of efforts since this is a knowledge based exam. To all the CISSP candidates out there, I would like to finish with my favorite quote ""Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishments"". Good luck everyone! "

I'm a 23 year old looking for some Career advice. I graduated College with a degree that, while not technical, is directly related to security analysis (My Senior Thesis was a Cyber Threat Assessment on US Critical Infrastructure), and for the past year I have been working as a technician/Jr Sysadmin/Helpdesk/Everything at a small MSP (Just my boss and I) with a very experienced and knowledgeable Sysadmin who is a wonderful teacher and mentor. Before this job, I started with little to no professional level technical skills beyond an interest and working knowledge of Windows and Linux; I took a very intensive Networking and Cybersecurity class in college (Very intensive as in I spent countless nights in the lab, slept in a sleeping bag in there, and probably worked on that one 4 credit class more than my other 12 credits combined) and learned a lot, but didn't even scratch the surface when it comes to what I need to learn regarding Technical skills. I also became familiar with the Cyber Kill Chain methodology of analysis and am very experienced when it comes to writing analytic reports and delivering presentations. Since then, I was lucky enough to get a job with a great boss that gives me a ton of hands-on experience with everything, you name it. Configuring UTM appliances, monitoring network traffic, Building, hardening, and deploying Virtual Hosts and Servers, running Cat5, you get the deal. I passed my Sec+ after about a month of teaching myself and am looking at the Comptia CySA+ for my next cert, as I live in a primarily DoD City and would like to become a Cyber Security Analyst, and it fulfills the correct slot in the DoD Req's list. However, an Associate of ISC/CISSP (I know I don't have the experience) does cover much more and seems to be preferred among the community. I suppose my question is, Is going for the CISSP the better move, and will it be relevant to my intended career path? (sorry for the wall of text)"

During my years of software development I also helped manage a small network in our lab which consisted of mostly linux boxes. My current position revolves largely around product lifecycle and the RMF. On my exam I received/answered 100 questions, and it took roughly an hour. My printout told me that I had provisionally passed, which I was not very happy to see because I didnt understand what that meant. It turns out that its really not a big deal, and if you see that then as long as you didnt cheat you can safely assume you passed. By the book it could take several weeks to get your official response, but mine showed up the next evening in my email. The only books I purchased were the ISC2 CISSP Official Study Guide, and the Eleventh Hour CISSP. I watched the Cybrary training videos, and I also attended a 1 week bootcamp a couple of weeks prior to taking the exam. The ISC2 book was dry, but comprehensive. I checked out a few other books as well, but this one was more to my taste (I like my texts to be drier, more like a reference book). The same thing for the Cybrary videos. I would recommend checking out several different video sets to see what seems to work for you. The bootcamp was something my employer paid for. By the time I attended it was basically a review and not all too different from the videos I had watched, except I could ask questions. The bootcamp is also pricey, so if it is not an option for you then I wouldnt worry about it and just pick a video set online. I have a wife, kids, and a full time job so it took me roughly a year to feel prepared. My approach to studying was as follows: 1) Read the text cover to cover. I had no intention of learning the material at that point, only of becoming exposed to it. I had no misconception that I would remember more than the highlights when I finished. 2) Read the text cover to cover again. This time I created flashcards as I went through. I limited my flashcards to terminology rather than concepts. I tried to keep the definitions simple and high level. I wanted to learn each and every acronym; even if I didnt understand the meaning I wanted to know what it stood for. I also made sure to create flashcards for the different ports and protocols; also with no misconception that I would know much if anything about the protocols, just that they were associated with particular ports. This was my attempt to learn the language. I made a LOT of flashcards, and it took a LONG time to study them all to a point where I felt comfortable. I would recommend that even if a term seems simple and you already know it, make a flashcard anyway. Sometimes how the term is defined/used for CISSP is different from how you may understand it. 3) Read the text cover to cover yet again. This time around my intention was to begin really learning the concepts. Having learned the terminology I wanted to now go deeper and start tying it all together. This is where I started watching the videos. I would watch all of the videos for a domain to hear somebody explain the concepts. I would take notes while I watched them on things I needed to concentrate on. I would then go back and read the chapters on that domain to reinforce what I had learned, and to learn what I had not understood. At the end of each chapter I did the written lab, and the review questions. For the written lab I did not worry whether I knew it off the top of my head, and used the book material as reference. I felt the point there was to think through the problem and find a solution. For the review questions I did not reference the book, and used it as a rough measure of how well I knew the material. 4) Start really testing myself. I used the Official ISC2 Practice Tests. I would first read the chapter from the Eleventh Hour CISSP on a domain, then take the practice test for that domain. I would score the test, and then go back and study the material related to questions I got wrong. Once I completed all of the domains I took each of the full practice tests, reviewing material from questions I got wrong. It is worth noting here that the practice tests I have are from the old style and so the domain tests were 100 questions, and the full tests were 250 questions long. I was consistently testing at 85% and above, mostly in the low 90s. Looking back now I would not recommend the Eleventh Hour CISSP book. It was too high level for me, and was not inclusive enough of some material. To each their own though. Specific Notes: I will STRONGLY caution against taking the same tests multiple times and putting any value the score you get after the first time. Once you have seen a particular question it is easy to remember what the correct answer is without understand why it is correct. In this same vein it is just as important to understand why the wrong answers are wrong as it is why the correct answer is correct. Take as many practice tests as you can get your hands on, but know that the questions may not be reflective of the exam style, but will at least test your knowledge. The new CAT exam is an interesting beast. You will get at least 100 questions, and up to 150. My understanding of how the exam works is as follows: Each of the questions has a difficulty value (internally to the test algorithm). These values are used to calculate a sort of competency score while you take the exam. You will need to finish your exam with a competency score of at least 70% to pass. Answering a less difficult question correctly will raise you score less than answering a more difficult question correctly. If you answer a question incorrectly then you will be next presented with a less difficult question. By design you will start off with a low difficulty question and a baseline competency score that is below passing. This means that it behooves you to be able to answer the more difficult questions because as you answer questions incorrectly not only does your score go down but the immediately following questions will not raise it back up as much. There are also still 25 unscored questions that are being tried out for possible use in future exams. These could be wildly difficult so while taking the exam do not get discouraged if you encounter something like this, have faith in your knowledge! Memorizing the material will not be enough to pass the exam. You will have to understand the concepts, and be able to apply them. Also, keep in mind that the questions will expect you to answer as though you are a consultant to management, not a technician. Keep your perspective at the level of whats best for a company as a whole. Everybody has a different experience question-wise. Do NOT listen to people who tell you that you need to know this or don't need to know that. You need to be prepared to answer questions on ALL of the material. If you do not already have your Security+ then know that once you have thoroughly prepared yourself for the CISSP you will also be 90% prepared for the Security+ exam. I read through the CompTIA SYO-401 study guide to fill in some of the gaps and passed the SYO-501 (they had updated the exam since I had bought the book) exam a few days before I took the CISSP exam. This relationship is not reciprocal. Having a Security+ cert does not mean you are 90% prepared for CISSP. Do whatever it is that you do to prepare for exam day (sleep-wise, eating-wise, etc.) but remember to breathe during the exam, and trust yourself."

If you have been around the cyber circus you will have plenty of time to answer. However I would suggest to pause and reread the question and reanalyze your answer before you click next. I did not find the exam difficult apart from the ambiguous questions/answers at times. Do not take me as example, organize a serious study plan. I did not even read the Sybex ... but I have been doing risk analysis/SOC managing/incident response/pen-testing/sysadmin, etc ... The experience was useful on some questions.

Folks with just general IT knowledge can do very well on this exam imho. Study habits: Off and on for 1 year (a few hours a week). The last 2 months, 4 hours a day. The last 2 days- 14+ hours per day. Resources: Books ICS2 Official Study Guide 7th Ed- Read it once cover to cover. Used it for review when needed. Excellent resource. 11th Hour by Conrad- Read it once cover to cover. Great resource. Exam Cram. Read it once. Surprisingly helpful even though it isn't mentioned much on these threads. Shon Harris- AIO really really really old edition. Used as a reference, but I did read a big chunk of it (BCP, DRP, SDLC, Crypto). Very good resource. Official ISC2 Guide to the CISSP CBK- Used as a reference. If you are the type of person who enjoys reading this, stay at least 100 yards from me and my family. Software Requirements 3rd edition (microsoft)- good knowledge base if you have the time/need to read it. Tests Boson- Yes, use them. Some of the better prep questions. Not an exact match of course.

ISC2 (Sybex) Official Online- Great resource to get the base knowledge (aka definitions). ISC2 Official (Android)- Get it. Another great base builder. Exam Cram book- Thumbs up. CCCure- ""I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.""- Vincent Vega Videos Kelly Handerhan Videos/Cybrary- Helped more than I expected. Especially ""think like a manager"". I spent a lot of years in the trenches. This was a very hard mindset for me to get into. Kelly helped. ITDojo- found this guy by accident. His questions of the day rock. I used his videos for launching deeper dives into material I wasn't that sure about. Skillset- great refresher material to review before the exam. Misc. Stuff I've read just about all the NIST documents, CMMI docs, CC docs, PCI docs, HIPAA docs, ISO docs, COBIT docs, etc that you can name over the years. Did they help? Yes. Do you need them? If you aren't knowledgeable in a particular reg, standard, etc at least glance at them, or download an FAQ/Quick Start Guide/Best Practices guide. Caveat Emptor When you are weak in a topic, be wary of those who say ""for the exam, all you need to know is..."" Each exam is different for everybody. So, how do they know? Also, this is a test that is based on experience in the real world-not just definitions. Not trying to stress you out. Just being real. I am the type of person who needs to know ""how"" things work or see it used first hand. That helped me. My point is, if you really have no clue on a topic, dig deeper. Spend 30 to 60 minutes digging deeper instead of 2 minutes memorizing a definition. My drive to dig deeper definitely helped. No, I can't give specific examples. NDA. Key Points: Use multiple study guides and question banks. A key to the exam is knowing the 100 different ways to describe the same thing.

Background Masters in Cybersecurity, 4 years IT Audit Internal and external/ Consulting Studying Materials (in order of most helpful to me) Sybex 7th Official Study Guide (if you dont have it get and READ front to back, made flash cards from material (BCP order, Ports, etc) this was my reference and CISSP bible 9/10 Boson (hands down the best questions 9/10) (Averaged about 77-82% btw all the tests) 11th hour (read the week before definitely helped tie it all together 8/10) Kelly Handerhan Cybrary (I downloaded the MP3s and listened to them to and from work definitely helped keep the information in my head 8/10) Sari Greene (8/10 used to review last minute weak areas. To be honest didnt get through all the videos but the test taking tips and what to expect sections were just what I needed to hear the night before. Used free trial for these) Official practice tests (these were good but focus on the concepts otherwise youll just end up memorizing 7/10. Did every domains set of 100 and both mocks. Averaged high 80s/ low 90s these questions definitely the easiest) CCCure 7/10 (good not bad but definitely preferred the Boson questions. If you need new questions then for sure worth it. Averaged about 80% on mock full 100/150 test) David Miller Videos 7/10 (these were good but superrrr long and detailed. I got through them the week before since my boot camp canceled on me due to water leak (oh the irony of not having continuity plan) but they were almost too detailed and too long to me. If you have the time for sure useful. Used free trial for these) I studied off and on for about 6 months didnt get serious until about 3 months ago after I kept putting it off. But yeah glad its over! As everyone elses experience NOTHING like the practice tests and truly based on the concepts. I also felt like I was failing the entire time and felt only confident about 15 questions. It wasnt AS bad as most folks made it out to be but definitely a lot of questions where I felt 2 answers could be correct. When in doubt WENT WITH MY GUT. Test stopped at 100 questions for me. No score just said I passed. Thanks again! "

I really really wanted to take the old 250q version but I'm glad I didn't because I was getting jittery by the end. It feels like I'm not getting my (or my employer's) money's worth for just an hour of testing but whatever, guess it raises the barrier to entry and as I learned with the MCSE, certs decrease in value as more people acquire them. My journey started when I took the DSST Cybersecurity test for college credits. The CBT Nuggets for CISSP was what I used for that and it made me think that the CISSP was attainable. A year, another video training, a thousand+ practice questions and a boot camp later and now I'm just an endorsement away. Main reading was the 11th Hour and the Sunflower PDF. I also listened to Simple CISSP on Audible at least 3 times. Gah, I don't know what to do with myself now. Gonna see Last Jedi soon."

I hate reading. So I have all the study materials. All you can think of (sybex 7th ed, cybrary videos, david miller, shon harris mp3, conrad pratice test, shon harris practice exam, sybex test banks, securitydocs, youtube, eleventh hour etc). But I just cant read the book (sybex 7th ed). I don't find the book boring, I just cant focus to read more than 5 pages a day. I used to love reading, but after spending over a year reading more than 30 pages a day. I just can't read much anymore. I once failed the exams back in 2015, studied the official book, and watched the keith baker cbt nugget (all within a month) and sat for the exams. I failed woefully. Around 570 or so. After that, I realized the question types (scenario-based not what is), and that I actually don't have the experience. I now have some hands-on experience in cybersecurity (government-related) 1.5 years now, some technical (networking, and basic computer) experience of about 10 years, a PhD in InfoSec (mostly DDoS, Cloud Computing and NetSec experience. Not much of policies or management), and also I teach computer security classes part-time as an adjunct. My problem is I just cant focus to study it, and when I start, I feel like I know everything. The mp3s (handerhan, and shon harris), its like I have memorized the audio. I literally know the next words, cos that is all I have been listening to, for the past 2 months. (I actually deleted Spotify, and deactivated all social media.) I personally know that I need to learn more, but I am still stuck on page 300 of the Sybex book. And i just cant read anymore. I am set to take the exams in March 2018, but I wanted to finish the book before Jan, so I can use the 2 months to just keep practicing the questions. Well, it is not going to happen, cos there is no way I can study the remaining pages before the end of December. My question, do you think I can ignore the readings, and just keep playing with the practice questions from now till the exams time. Sorry for the long post, but I am just checking to see if there is anyone out there going through such."

Caveats: I spent a lot of time preparing with study of the materials and I work in Cybersecurity management. I was comfortable with my knowledge set before I scheduled my exam. Strategy: Realize that there are 2 broad formats for questions: 1) simple direct questions 2) situational questions, those that provide some information or a scenario before asking the actual quetion. I dedicated myself to reading the question first always for both types, yes before reading the information or scenario. If I could think of an answer to the question I kept it in mind. What happened next depended on the question type: for direct questions I read the possible answers and selected the one that best matched my answer. For situational questions I then read the information /scenario followed by rereading the question and answering the question in my mind before reading the options and selecting the best match. In addition to any question that I wasn't 100% certain of my answer, Any question that had one of the following qualifiers, I marked for review : NOT, BEST, MOST, LEAST. Sometimes rereading those questions later will ensure that you are actively meeting the qualifier word's condition. I forced myself to take 2 breaks one during the test around half way. The second, after I answered all the questions, but before I began my review. The second break was the longer of the 2. I didn't even think about the test itself during the second break, rather I spoke with the woman working at the test center about other topics : I was trying to ensure that when I started the review I was doing so with as fresh a mindset as possible. 2 breaks was the right number for me but I know that many people would benefit from more, the key is taking breaks when needed and one before review.

FWIW, I was in the mid to high 80s on the official Sybex practice tests and high 70s on the Boson tests. My prep strategy was different than most, however. I wasn't actually planning to take this until a couple months ago, but I was in WGU's MS Cybersecurity program. It turned out that the degree filled in the major gaps for me. I bought the CISSP practice tests before I graduated and discovered that I was hitting 85% on multiple domains without any study. The program covered areas that I had no exposure to, like secure software development and risk management. Plus it got me a CEH certification as well. Following that, all I did was read through 11th hour multiple times, and I read a few chapters in the Sybex study guide on areas where I needed more depth. And lots of practice questions so I knew where to study more deeply. Less than a month after graduation, I passed the test. If you have the time, consider that program as an alternative to a bootcamp. I finished in two terms which cost $6000 total."

I also started a masters in cybersecurity and I really liked it. I changed to a new program and due to some misunderstandings with financial aid, I am not doing it anymore. Is it even worth getting a degree in cybersecurity? Would it just be better to get my CISSP? What is the best way to study? What is a realistic amount of time to study per day? I haven't taken any standardized tests in years (GMAT &amp; LSAT). Part of me feels like I should have to do A+/Net+/Sec+ before I do CISSP, but I am not sure.

I am going to be straight up and say that I did not put as much effort into the last couple weeks that I feel like I should have to be truly prepared. My background: - Military ~10 years working Information Assurance and secure network communications - Two years experience working with National Security Agency and US Cyber Command - B.S. in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity from University of Maryland University College - Security+ - Network+ - CCNA: Routing and Switching I got a voucher for my exam and I believe that led to my lackadaisical attitude in regards to really putting the nose to the grindstone and studying. I spent a long weekend reading a singular book and taking practice questions on the official CISSP app. The app is OK, but I can't speak enough about the [11th Hour CISSP Study Guide](URL **This book is amazing!** Everything is laid out cleanly and easy to read without destroying your eyes with walls of text and unnecessary diagrams, charts, and figures. There are little snippets in that say ""Exam Alert"" or ""Crunch Time"" and high light important facts that need memorization. There really was nothing I saw in the book that wasn't covered on the test in some way. Seriously, it is a great investment. I have the Shon Harris book as well. I remember it coming in the mail with the Practice Exam booklet in its fancy box and was so excited to dive in. I got about 35 pages in and just couldn't anymore. The material is very dry and way too comprehensive for the test, in my opinion at least. The 11th Hour book does a much better job at giving you the meat of what you need with a small side of potatoes. The Shon Harris book gives you all the meat you need but stuffs you with a buffet of sides that makes you hate yourself after partaking. Again, this is my opinion and you may not have as much work experience as me and may need the foundational knowledge the Shon Harris book can give you. My test experience lasted about 3 hours. I felt like I had more than enough time to answer everything and then go back through the ones I flagged. Honestly, there isn't a whole lot to sit there and think about. Either you know the answer or you don't. Sitting there staring at the screen isn't going to help. Choose something, flag it and move on. If you have time at the end go back and review. Good luck to everyone about to take the test! I, for one, am very glad to be done with it."

Thoughts on the test: Worse and better than I thought. To elaborate, the questions were very broad. It is quite literally a mile wide and an inch thick. Some areas of the test seemed really easy; other parts seemed greek to me. I walked out of the exam expecting a failure. Talking to other friends that are certified, that's how they felt too. I finished the exam in just under 2.5 hours. I flagged like 60 some questions, reviewed the first 7, changed 2 (I knew they were wrong the first time), said I'm not going to change any more of my gut answers at this point, and ended the exam. I took one break at the half way mark. I *highly* recommend it. Nice little pause from looking at the screen and it calmed my anxiety a bit. I walked into the exam, and as soon as I got started, i wrote down ""Think like a manager"", ""policy"", and wrote down the asymmetric algorithms. Resources: I studied off and on for roughly 6 months. I really hunkered down 2 months ago. **Cybrary.IT videos**: Say what you want, but they helped me more than any other material. Yes, seriously! Kelly H's way of remembering the asymmetric algorithms stuck in my brain easily, among other topics. She just has a way of explaining things that, for me, really helped. Is it a one stop shop? Absolutely not! However, I did get a lot of great information from them. I watched all the videos twice, some videos even 3 times. **ISC2's CISSP App**: Did all the flash cards, tested each domain. Noted what I missed, researched the subject area. Waited a week, took the tests again, repeat. Once I mastered the app, I was a little more confident. The big thing is don't just memorize the questions and answers. It does you no good. I also read, and once again, don't judge me, the **CISSP for Dummies** book. Some really funky wording and terrible puns, but an overall great resource. This was a recommendation from a certified friend who said, ""Look, this sounds like a joke but...you should look at this book. It actually helped me."" Final week before the exam, I read **11th hour** by Eric Conrad. I will say that anything i didn't fully comprehend, such as BCP process, I read more into in **Shon Harris' CISSP book**. That book, I maybe read briefly and mostly just different sections here and there that I needed more info on. I didn't go cover to cover as it is far more in-depth than I believe is needed. The test was absolutely the hardest thing I've ever taken. My background is DoD Cybersecurity. Ten plus years of experience. To those testing soon, good luck! **Take deep breaths. Use common sense.** Also, for those that are easily distracted like me, use the ear plugs to help tune out other testers. There were a lot (12-13) other people taking various exams along with me. Lot's of noise and people coming and going. "
295,cybersecurity,cissp,Passed CISSP 4/10/2017 (First Attempt),18,64ve9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/64ve9u/passed_cissp_4102017_first_attempt/,2017-04-12 12:08:41,"I enjoy reading about others' experiences as I ramp up for exams, so I thought I would share my own. &amp;nbsp; **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE** &amp;nbsp; *I have about 5 years of directly-relevant experience across the following roles:* &amp;nbsp; Assistant Network Administrator &amp;nbsp; SOC/SOX Information Systems Auditor &amp;nbsp; Cybersecurity Strategy and Infrastructure Consultant &amp;nbsp; Penetration Tester &amp;nbsp; **RESOURCES** &amp;nbsp; *Sybex CISSP Official Study Guide, 7th Edition* &amp;nbsp; I did not read this through, but only used it as a reference. &amp;nbsp; *Sybex CISSP Official Practice Tests* &amp;nbsp; I took each of the 100-question domain tests (skipping domain 6 and 7 that I did not feel required attention after skimming), and then I brushed up on missed concepts and definitions using the Official Study Guide and Google. &amp;nbsp; *Cybrary CISSP Course (8 Domains)* &amp;nbsp; Kelly Handerhan recently released a new, 8-domain version of the CISSP course. I watched many of the videos in the course, and mostly took away some decent test-taking tips. Nothing groundbreaking with regard to the content. &amp;nbsp; **PREPARATION** &amp;nbsp; After going through the routine indicated in the above resources, I took the first full practice test in the Official Practice Tests book, scoring a **79%**. I went back and jotted concepts that I got wrong, and even some I got correct but was curious about the other distractors. &amp;nbsp; Disappointed in the first score, I made flash cards for all of the concepts that I wrote down from each domain's practice questions and the first practice test. **Simply physically writing my notes down on cards was surprisingly effective**. I then took the second practice test, with no breaks, and scored an **89%** the day before the official exam. &amp;nbsp; Finally, of course, I jotted down notes from that final test, and then also wrote down flash cards. I'd say I put in a little over 50 total hours of study spread out over ~3 weeks, and I felt over-prepared once I got going during the actual exam. &amp;nbsp; **THE TEST** &amp;nbsp; I didn't do anything special or put a lot of thought into sleeping patterns or breakfast... Honestly, I thought my test was at 2PM, and then I happened to check my email at 11AM to find the address to the testing center, and I discovered the exam was actually at 12PM. I packed my stuff up from the office and headed out. &amp;nbsp; The test itself was extremely straight forward, in my opinion. I've read a lot of horror stories online about the difficulty of this exam, and they are simply not true. 20 questions into the exam, I knew it would be smooth sailing. I flagged any question that I thought I didn't feel 100% confident in, and even some that I thought were correct but knew that CISSP might argue a different distractor. I told myself that if I had fewer than 50 flagged questions at the end of the exam, I would not go back and review any. Slightly over two (2) hours later, I had 38 questions flagged, so I skipped the review and submitted my exam. Five minutes later, I was handed my printout with, ""Congratulations!"" at the top. &amp;nbsp; **TAKEAWAYS** &amp;nbsp; If you have the right experience (as you should), this test is not the beast that everyone makes it out to be. I feel like the gravity of this test has been diluted by cert-chasers and other professionals that embellish their experience and/or have limited working knowledge across most of the domains tested. &amp;nbsp; The official materials from Sybex are more than enough to get through this exam. If you're scoring 75%+ on the two (2) full practice tests from the Official Practice Tests book, then I think you're probably set. I think those tests were very similar, and of equal or marginally-greater difficulty, compared to the actual exam. &amp;nbsp; **MOVING FORWARD** &amp;nbsp; Onto the endorsement process, of course. &amp;nbsp; Feel free to ask any questions for additional insight, or even reach out if you need clarification on a specific question or topic that is troubling you. &amp;nbsp; Best of luck to everyone!"

However, I am also a graduate with a degree in Mathematics, which I scored a rather low grade on and as such is almost worthless. I feel that I shouldn't be excluded from roles because of this as I found during my time at university, that although the work ethic was not there, I was easily as intuitive as my peers. Since finishing university, I have spent a year in recruitment, which I hated and was let go from for not achieving the sales targets (I was in a bad position from the start anyway). It did fix my work ethic though. I took my CCENT and passed, and missed out on my CCNA R&amp;S by 2.5%, which at a score of 80.1%, I believe shows a decent understanding of the topics. They have changed the syllabus recently, and I am awaiting new study material to prepare for next time. I'm currently looking at Graduate positions within the industry, only to be quickly rejected because of my classification of degree, however most of the security consulting schemes mention certifications such as CISSP, CISA and CISM as the qualifications you will be working towards. I have had a brief look over a CISSP Study Guide, and truth be told, despite there being a large amount of material, it seems within my grasp. So my question is, with a decent understanding of networks, a good understanding of cryptography (my best module during my maths degree), and the feeling I could understand the vast majority of the CISSP syllabus, would it be fair to say that I should attempt the CISSP exam? The reason I ask is that the CISSP is known for being a more senior level qualification, yet with graduates being tutored towards this qualification upon leaving university, it also seems that it should be possible for a person in my position to achieve a passing grade."

I just want to explain my own personal level of knowledge and experience before someone reads this and says oh that's easy, I'll just do this and then they fail. Background: I have ~7-8 total years of system engineering and cybersecurity work plus another additional ~7-8 years of intelligence work. My current job is a cyber lead. With that being said, going into taking the CISSP, I felt like I had like 25-50% functional knowledge of the general ideas presented in the CBK. -I took the InfoSec institute 6 day bootcamp, online version. I have nothing but great things to say about that company and their training. If I had not taken that course, I would not have passed today. -I actively listened to all the lectures and took light notes. -I used about 25/75 split Sybex test engine/CCCure questions respectively. I *personally* feel like CCCure has the more test-like questions. -I took between 100-200 practice questions or more per day all 8 days of study. -At the end of the InfoSec Course, I took a mini vacation for 6 hours with my daughter and went on a train up north to a little beach community and chilled the fuck out to decompress, yesterday (Sunday) morning. -I read the CISSP Eleventh Hour study guide from cover to cover, but not in that order. -During all my tests all week, I took paper notes on what topics or specific ideas I got wrong. I also read online what particular topics people had trouble with. I used this 5-6 pages of notes to study the Eleventh Hour book, a few times re-reading the chapter that maybe I didn't have a solid grasp on the material. Here is the breakdown of my study that was successful in finishing the test. And when I finished, I knew that I had passed without even seeing the paper, if that gives a general idea of how I felt about my program of study. Reading Sybex Book: &lt;8 hours (just browsed it, answered some chapter questions here and there) Test Prep Class: ~60 hours Practice Tests: At least 1200+ questions over the week, no idea how many hours Eleventh Hour Review: 8-10 hours, comparing with my hand written practice test wrong-answer notes I took all week Anyhow, love it or list it, that was my study program. 8 days. moderate work/life experience background. I will caution on that: If you are an industry worker who has passed other certs and thinks their job covers the 8 domains and you can wing this test: you *WILL* be sorely mistaken, and this test will put you on ice. Do not underestimate the importance of knowing the CBK. This is not a test where you can memorize raw technical stats like port numbers or OSI model layers or device types and pass. If you're thinking about this test, I suggest walking into Barnes &amp; Noble, grabbing one of the test prep guides and trying to answer a few chapters worth of test questions and see if it doesn't humble you. You have to know the material for this test. You have to not just know the steps but understand the scope, purpose and minutiae involved with all of the security processes that the CISSP exam covers. Edit: grammar Edit 2: fuck how did I forget this part! Remember that Reddit post with the study about exercising 4 hours after learning? I ran every single day since last Friday. 2-3 miles a day. Normally I'm a twice a week gym guy. Let me explain how I feel that helped and why you should consider it in preparation of a test. One, if you run or exercise I promise you you'll be more fatigued around 9 or 10pm. I usually go to bed with my wife at 11-1am since we have kids and we like to enjoy our alone time. Well, sacrificing that for the week I honestly believe gave me an edge as I was a little lighter and better rested than I normally am. Being as physically light as possible is crucial to passing the CISSP. Also, I refrained from drinking alcohol all week and drank a lot of water which I don't think I need to explain the logic behind that %-) Edits 3-infinity: iPhone fat fingering"

I recently received my MS in Information Assurance (Cybersecurity). My next goal is to pass the CISSP and move my career in the direction of security, something I've wanted to do for some time. I've read lots of posts on here as well as other resources and this is what I came up with. Is it good or too much? I'm not a great test taker, never have been, so there is some anxiety.

Definitely have been scrambling these last few weeks to know the content, but it paid off. In total I studied for about 3-4 months for about a few hours a week and increased as I got closer to the exam. Exam prep was mostly of the Conrad book, 11th hour, CBTnuggets, and CISSP 4 Dummies. I have the AIO book and used it mostly as reference and the ""quick review"" section. Along the way I made my own google doc with cram notes that I would read and edit while i'm on the subway or travelling for work. It also made a perfect morning-of review document. The test was tough and taking multiple practice exams helped my brain fatigue. I kept hearing the phrase ""know your concepts"" and after this test, I know more about what that means. Plenty of technical questions, but know how they work in context with many other controls. The practice exams that helped me were: Total Tester from the Shon Harris AIO DVD, [Conrad](URL CBTnuggets, and the mobile app [Pocket Prep](URL It also helped that I have over 10+ years in Cybersecurity, InfoSec, and SysAdmin background. Many thanks to this group for helping me and others out. Once I get settled, i'll begin work on the email digest idea (see previous threads). edit: url fix"
305,cybersecurity,cissp,1st Attempt - Pass,5,33sjgw,http://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/33sjgw/1st_attempt_pass/,2015-04-25 15:05:46,"1. If you think dumps will help, find another cert. 2. **Learning the material** is the absolute best preparation. 3. 9 months out, purchase the **AIO 6th edition** and read it front to back. Defer reviewing the 1400 questions. 4. **CCcure paid subscription** with over 1500 unique questions. Before testing, I reviewed over 4000 questions (we'll come back to this) 5. **Stewart, Chapple, Gibson**... Read it front to back. 6. **Conrad, Misenar, Feldman**... Read it front to back. 7. **CISSP Practice Questions**, Michael Gregg. 8. Complete the AIO questions in the book and on the CD. 50 question reps, multiple sets from CCcure. ANY information or concepts you don't understand, refer back to the AIO and highlight the subject matter. The point of all the questions is to identify where your knowledge is weak and not rote memorization. 9. **3x5 cards grouped by domain.** Write out whatever you feel uncertain about as your test date nears (2 months out). I had over 150 inked up and used them for review the week prior to the exam. The reality is you have a $600 wager and many months of prep going into the exam. Cost and time aside, are you really going to revisit the exam or take the loss and blog about the cert being useless (because you failed)? The exam and the material is everything they say it is and knowing the material is absolutely essential. ~~I've met many ""IT professionals"" that didn't know the difference between a RAID array and a four slice toaster and for that reason alone,~~ you need to KNOW the material so as not to compromise the credential. If you have to travel a distance (as I did) to a testing center, consider a local hotel. A flat tire, heavy traffic, fender bender, etc. doesn't lend itself well to success on the testing day. Be prepared for the exam! For all the preparation, I did not plan for a sleepless night and barely managed 5 hours before breakfast and the exam. Benadryl or other OTC sleep aid is essential and I don't recommend anything illegal in the event you have to complete an SF86 in your cybersecurity career. 4 hours to complete the exam after skipping 2 questions. Took a break, circled back to answer the 2 and started to do a complete review of my answers and after changing 1 question I decided that the responses were good and finished the test. **You can pass the CISSP exam if you study and prepare well in advance.** Learn and truly understand the material for your confidence and ultimate success on the test.
