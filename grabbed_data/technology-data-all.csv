0,vulnerability,technology,Technological Change and Mental Health: How will the workforce of the future cope with the 4th industrial revolution?,2,hdtqny,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/hdtqny/technological_change_and_mental_health_how_will/,2020-06-23 00:51:44,"This article was published on [KevinMD](URL and [Psychology Today](URL Work is a necessary part of life. More than simply a means to a paycheck, work gives individuals a sense of dignity and accomplishment. Feeling as though one is participating in meaningful work, whether it is contributing to a massive project or an individual artistic pursuit, allows one to feel as though they have a purpose. While this urge to create or work appears to be a universal human trait, the conditions in which individuals work are constantly changing. This is particularly the case during or following major technological revolutions. Neolithic revolutions throughout the world transformed hunter and gatherer societies into sedentary farming communities. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution that began in Europe during the eighteenth century saw the rise of steam power, the precursors to modern factories, and technologies that led to the widespread decline of cottage industries, guilds, and artisanal labor in general. This was just the first of many such revolutions. It was followed by the Second Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which saw the introduction of electricity, the modern assembly line, and the use of interchangeable parts  particularly in North America and Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the middle of the twentieth century, was characterized by the rise of digitalization, computing, information technologies, and the globalization of supply chains. The latter process has led to the deindustrialization of many regions within the Global North (such as the Rust Belt in the Great Lakes region) and the accelerated industrialization of parts of the Global South, especially provincial cities in the Far East, which have become magnets for previously rural migrant workers ([nongmingong](URL or min-gong) who have been displaced by industrialized and automated farming systems. Some (most notably [Klaus Schwab](URL now posit that we are entering into a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will be characterized by rapid technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, digital networking, quantum computing, robotics, materials science, and genetics, and that these advances will once again radically change society. Some of these changes will undoubtably be good. Novel medicines will likely be developed that can prevent or cure a host of diseases. Advances in renewable energy technology, building science, and other fields may ensure humanity averts a climate disaster. The growth of decentralized distribution networks could allow us to eliminate a great deal of food waste. The list goes on. While all these changes have the capacity to eliminate suffering and to use resources more efficiently, the same technology has the potential to fundamentally alter the concept of the job by making work scarcer and more precarious for all but a privileged minority. **The Rise of the Precariat** All technological revolutions have made certain jobs, skills, and previous technologies obsolete. This is known as technological unemployment. For workers who are affected by these changes, they can either fight against the process or look for opportunity elsewhere. (Those in the former group are often called [Luddites](URL a term which refers to a group of highly skilled textile workers in eighteenth-century England who destroyed the mechanical looms and weavers that threatened their livelihood.) The fight against change, however, is not easy, as new technologies make products cheaper to produce and cheaper to purchase. This leaves them at odds not only with owners, but consumers, too. As adoption becomes more widespread, the fight becomes increasingly quixotic. This phenomenon is not rare, nor is it a relic of the past. If anything, it is becoming more common as computers have become smaller and more powerful (see [Moores Law](URL and the rate at which broader technological advances occur has accelerated (see [Kurzweils Law](URL For futurists and tech CEOs, this kind of disruption is considered good because it allows for more innovative solutions to problems and to replace existing markets. For [less educated and older workers](URL it can mean the effective disappearance of their professions. This has already happened to many manual workers who lack specialized training or experience. Millions have been displaced by globalization or automation that has occurred in the last fifty years  in regions like the Rust Belt, for example  and they have been forced to take refuge in the service economy or, more recently, by participating in what is known as the gig economy. Many theorists have taken to calling this new group the [precariat](URL (a portmanteau combining the words precarious and proletariat) because these jobs are oftentimes tentative or part-time. If the Fourth Industrial Revolution follows this trend of accelerating the process of displacement, these industries that have served as a refuge for the precariat will also see increased automation via AI and robotics, which will mean even fewer jobs. Combined with the rise in the number of people entering the workforce due to population growth, automation threatens to make it impossible to provide employment to everyone who wants a job. While technological advances have historically impacted workers who work primarily with their hands or do not require a great deal of specialized knowledge to enter into their industry, new technologies may affect even highly skilled and specialized workers whose work is solely intellectual. Even certain healthcare professionals, like [therapists](URL may share a similar fate due to advances in AI. If a therapy bot can offer services that are indistinguishable from a human therapist at a fraction of the cost and without the need to travel to an office or schedule an appointment, how long can this remain a viable profession for thousands of people? This begs the very blunt question: If these new technologies eliminate the need for tens of millions of jobs and there is no new industry to serve as a refuge, what is everyone going to do? **The Impact on Mental Health** While this is no doubt a fecund discussion, as this process will demand a restructuring and rethinking of how current economic, management, and political systems are organized, these potential changes present dozens of significant problems from the perspective of public health, especially mental health. Many of them have already materialized. I will focus only on two for now, as they both stem from the high likelihood that traditional employment will continue to be thought of as a necessary part of adulthood, even if traditional jobs may not be available to all adults. As work becomes scarcer, competition for available positions will become more aggressive. Those who manage to keep their positions may increasingly seek to prove themselves to be indispensable to their superiors, which could lead to an acceleration of the existing culture of instant accessibility wherein workers are always available via email or phone  even if compensation is still modeled on a 40-hour workweek. In an organization with leadership willing to exploit this vulnerability, they could tacitly demand workers perform duties beyond their contractual tasks, a phenomenon that has been described as [compulsory citizenship behavior](URL Even today, there is already worry that the erosion of the distinction between work and leisure times due to social media, work emails, and other duties is leaving individuals in near perpetual state of stress that can have a wide array of negative health outcomes. The proverbial giving 110% here takes on a sinister meaning, as it implies that one is expected to give more than what is possible to their job and that anything less is a shortcoming that is grounds for their termination. Apart from being an oppressive practice that seems ethically dubious, evidence suggests that such a demanding environment negatively impacts worker engagement and performance, and that [organization-wide productivity](URL may suffer as a consequence if such attitudes are made endemic due to toxic leadership. Conversely, many may experience another form of[ anxiety](URL should they continue to find it difficult to find steady work. Worse, some may fall into despair if they lack certain resources or abilities. Even if there is the implementation of a universal basic income to prevent the worst aspects of long-term unemployment or underemployment, there will likely be continued expectations and social pressure to have a job. Those who cannot meet those expectations will likely feel deeply humiliated, lonely, and resentful, and will likely experience many of the [well-documented](URL physical and mental health problems associated with [worklessness](URL (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, anxiety, and depression). **The Role of Mental Health Professionals** Such a paradigm shift has already begun and will likely accelerate during and following the coronavirus-related recession. One can be hopeful that these are temporary problems that will eventually be resolved by intensive reforms and changes in policy, but they are clear and present challenges that will not go away on their own for the foreseeable future. We need to acknowledge that these changes are happening and that the resultant stressors are having an impact on people from virtually all walks of life. For those of us who work as mental health professionals, we will have to become more attuned to these global phenomena to better understand our patients and their struggles. We will need to better empathize with the anxieties of those who feel as though they are only as secure as the caprices of their employers, as well as the anger of those who feel as though they have been cast by the wayside or lack a purpose. We must recognize the material circumstances that are shaping our patients conditions if we are to properly treat them."
1,vulnerability,technology,How to use technology to make new friends with people who actually understand you,1,geiq65,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/geiq65/how_to_use_technology_to_make_new_friends_with/,2020-05-06 22:04:34,"We all yearn for those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. This is how to make those friends even after you have left education: **1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you. **2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's [Facebook](URL posts or reply to people's [Instagram](URL stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way. **3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [Bumble](URL but it is more used for dating. **4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message. **5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message. **6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile. Have fun guys! Please comment below if you have other suggestions :)"
2,vulnerability,technology,Why Blockchain technology is making a revolution in 2020?,1,f08wfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/f08wfm/why_blockchain_technology_is_making_a_revolution/,2020-02-07 21:54:10,"Blockchain for business is the new industrial revolution in 2020. It has become the hottest field in the technology sector now, empowering crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. There are few business owners in 2020 who exactly know the potential of Bitcoin technology, its far-reaching application beyond Bitcoin. The adoption of [**Blockchain technology for businesses**](URL requires time and effort. But business owners need to understand the reason behind the popularity of this technology.  1. **Rise of Federated Blockchain** \- One of the latest trends of using Blockchain technology. Federated Blockchain provides private Blockchain for a more customizable outlook. It comes with some added features.  2. **Stablecoins is going to dominate** \- Bitcoin, an example of cryptocurrency is highly volatile in nature.

3,vulnerability,technology,What is Li-Fi?,1,e7brvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/e7brvl/what_is_lifi/,2019-12-07 19:09:52,"In the technical solution for future communications, some people think that the whole house's smart terminal is enough to connect to 5G, and some people think that WiFi will still stand on the throne of cost performance. Since each communication method has its own advantages and disadvantages, the brain hole may be larger, such as using the light bulb to go online. At present, the more likely fate of Li-Fi is still in places where high-security requirements such as radio signals are not allowed (such as radio astronomy telescopes, nuclear power plants, etc.) are easily interrupted or missing. The emergence of a complementary identity helps to achieve more stable and high-speed communication. And because there are no spectrum restrictions, Li-Fi will also provide the next technology exit for crowded 5G. It s not that I'm whimsical. In 2011, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, Harald Hass, made a speech using LED light sources to transmit data wirelessly. The novel term Li-Fi (light fidelity) was seen as a substitute for The technological light of WiFi. However, this technology is too advanced and unstable, which has caused it to stay in the marketing tactics of laboratories and some LED manufacturers. Compared with the momentum of 5G, Li-Fi, which has also been regarded as a ""WiFi disruptor"", is still an interesting gadget for niche geeks, and its development trend is not embarrassing. Does it really have that capability and necessity and can replace WiFi into our living space? The different trends of Li-Fi and 5G technologies also reflect the ""hidden rules"" of technology changes? What is special about Li-Fi, which has been placed on the Internet by light bulbs? With the announcement of the establishment of a new company to research (visible light wireless communication) technology in the United States, LightPointe makes Li-Fi appear in people's vision again. As the name suggests, Li-Fi uses visible light for wireless data transmission, and some people call it ""light fidelity technology."" The working principle is simply that visible light such as LED lights is used as the transmission source of the information transmission system. The chip is implanted to form a network access point similar to a WiFi hotspot, and the light source is controlled to send high-speed signals to control the network transmission of the terminal receiver. As long as there is light, I can access the Internet. Does it sound better than WiFi and 4 / 5G? The latter not only requires infrastructure with a huge capital scale but also has problems such as disconnection and radiation. Li-Fi is not the same. You can connect to the Internet by turning on the light tube indoors. You can still download movies at high speed while standing under the street light at night, and it is absolutely green and low-carbon and harmless. Unfortunately, when something doesn't look perfect, it must not be true. Li-Fi does just that. Unlike 5G's step by step, Li-Fi's development in the past decade cannot be described as difficult. The creator of the technology, Herald Haas, spent several years developing LiFi technology to the third generation, only to get rid of the conceptual level and become a real product. The performance of the third-generation ""LiFi-X"" has been greatly improved. For example, it is smaller in size and has a transmission rate of 40Mbps. It can receive side and backlight sources, which greatly improves the network effect. Sounds good? But this is obviously not the same as the commercial wave of 5G for all. Interestingly, when Haas proposed the Li-Fi signal chip solution, many smartphone mobile manufacturers were still studying the 5G standard. In other words, at the time, the industry's attitudes toward Li-Fi and 5G were similar, that is, they were cautious, and they hope to deploy it after the technology is verified. Emerging communication technology PK? Talking from the inherent insufficiency of WiFi Although the technical principles of Li-Fi now seem a bit incredible, the existence is reasonable, and the rationality of Li-Fi at that time was given by the natural defects of WiFi. As we all know, WiFi plays a very important role in mobile communications. Today we can access the network from anywhere in the space, including coffee shops and KFC. But the biggest problem with WiFi is also this. On the one hand, the signal coverage is small, and the strength and weakness change obviously, which makes the communication transmission unstable. When the speed of the network changes, lost connections, disconnected games, video freezes, etc. are all the crazy scenes often encountered. In addition, the security risks of WiFi have also raised unprecedented questions. The transmission signals of radio waves can be easily hijacked by hackers, thus completely exposing user information. Presumably, many people have had unpleasant Wi-Fi connections leading to information leakage, or their own Wi-Fi account has been unpleasantly shared and misused. This is more likely to cause anxiety in the early days of the outbreak of smart pan-terminals. Because multiple terminals and multiple users access WiFi at the same time, in addition to the decline in experience speed, when your home's smart door lock, health bracelet, camera treadmill, etc. are all connected in series under the same WiFi system, once a single hardware vulnerability is broken The serial risks brought by it are probably unimaginable. Finding and developing new communication technologies has become an area where engineers have long been involved. At the time, Li-Fi and 5G appeared on the researchers' desks at the same time. First of all, both of them have high advantages over WiFi in terms of the transmission rate. The planned speed of 5G is 10Gbps, which will be further improved after commercial use. The throughput of Li-Fi also far surpassed that of WiFi. At that time, the small miniature LEDs released by pure Li-Fi could transmit at 8 Gbps and theoretically could reach 200 + Gbps. Supporting hundreds of millions of IoT devices did not seem to be a problem. At the same time, the security of both is obvious to all. 5G communication authenticates users, which can effectively ensure user information security. Li-Fi uses the characteristics of visible light for transmission, making it impossible to bedside walls, and the wave-particle duality of light makes it difficult to be used, so it is almost impossible for information in the building to be leaked. More critically, unlike the large-scale investment required for 5G to establish a large number of communication base stations, Li-Fi almost does not require high operating costs, and it is sufficient to replace the city's visible light source with an LED with a transmission chip. Obviously, in the technological change replacing WiFi, some special chemical reactions occurred, which led to today's Li-Fi out. Three major nodes that explain the exit of Li-Fi and the superiority of 5G The business world is sometimes very metaphysical. New technology is superior and has no law. There are no absolute rules in itself. Often, it depends on certain causes or special conditions. Judging by the history of Li-Fi and 5G, this is exactly what it shows. In theory, Li-Fi has certain technical and application advantages whether it is WiFi or 5G. Why didn't it end up hitting both? 1. The technical tipping point has not yet appeared. If you want to replace a mature technology, the replacement technology must be of higher industrial value. WiFi is almost ubiquitous, and as bandwidth increases, Li-Fi still has a long way to go to become a substitute for it. As Jack Gold, president of mobile consulting firm J. Gold Associates has questioned: visible light communication has been tried for several years, this is not new, and getting a huge amount of bandwidth is not as simple as it sounds. One of the technical problems is the reverse transmission. How Li-Fi terminal equipment reflects signals to LED lights requires professional integrated chips to support it. It is still in the early stages of research. The second is the transmission distance. It must be laid out in the use scene without dead ends. LED light source to ensure the Li-Fi network, while minimizing the learning and adaptation costs, obviously also requires the continuous polishing of engineering solutions. The third is signal interference. Although the Li-Fi signal is not as easy to be hijacked as WiFi, it is easy to be interfered with. It is not only unable to penetrate the wall, there is a block between the terminal and the light source, and the signal will be cut off unless you have an LED searchlight on your head Mobile phones, otherwise disconnected from time to time may be made at a large group of ""stars will be dead without internet. 2. Industry synergy efforts. Compared with the baptism of 5G to the communications, semiconductor, terminal software and hardware industries, Li-Fi's industrial chain is longer, and it also involves many fields such as lighting and power. However, these areas lack the right to speak and guide the cutting-edge communication technology, which has led to the integration of chips, industry standards, terminal development, etc. required by Li-Fi, even though LED manufacturers are actively promoting and calling for Li-Fi. , Lack of sufficient industrial support. Although Cisco and EMC (energy control and IoT solution providers) have all expressed interest in Li-Fi technology, some companies have also started testing Li-Fi, but they are only staying in the exploration stage, and it is not important. Commercial decision. The lack of upstream and downstream collaboration in the industrial chain is in stark contrast to the rapid industrialization of 5G driven by communications and AI giants. 3. Challenges in end-market niche markets. Even if Li-Fi has reached the promise of realistic throughput and scale, it has also constructed a series of industrial ecosystems of communication + lighting + power. If its endpoint equipment cannot enter the market, it will be difficult for consumers to choose. fate. We know that mobile smart terminals have entered the stage of integrated and miniaturized design. For example, the Kirin 990 launched by Huawei not long ago is a SOC chip with integrated 5G functions. At this stage, the Li-Fi system can only appear in the form of a prototype. Its volume is large, and it cannot be deployed in various small and micro terminals. Increased distance of Li-Fi from the mass market. At present, the more likely fate of Li-Fi is still in places where high-security requirements such as radio signals are not allowed (such as radio astronomy telescopes, nuclear power plants, etc.) are easily interrupted or missing. The emergence of a complementary identity helps to achieve more stable and high-speed communication. And because there are no spectrum restrictions, Li-Fi will also provide the next technology exit for crowded 5G. Although its tuyere is still unknown, in these niche proving grounds, Li-Fi technology itself can also gradually iterate, looking for its own killer application. After all, the development of science and technology is better than finding the most valuable option among the impossible of countless trial and error.

12,vulnerability,technology,"More than three years have passed since BadUSB was announced, but we're seemingly worse off than we were. What can we do?",10,7po2mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7po2mc/more_than_three_years_have_passed_since_badusb/,2018-01-12 00:30:01,"In august 2014 the world learned of BadUSB: a design vulnerability of USB devices that allows a virus to install itself, or a part of itself, into the firmware of common USB peripherals like flash drives or webcams. Such malware can then spread by making any vulnerable USB device appear as any other kind of USB device, for example by posing as a keyboard and send keystrokes for a command to install the malware. Furthermore, the malware is invisible and hidden where no antivirus software can detect or remove it, protected by the firmware on the USB device. The researchers which found the vulnerability had many suggestions on how to mitigate it, but first and foremost they implored the manufacturers of USB peripherals to *disable the ability to update firmware over USB* going forward. This cheap and simple countermeasure would prevent any such virus from working, because it can then no longer hijack the USB device firmware. Since then, a number of developments have made the situation more dire: * There are several do-it-yourself BadUSB toolkits and proofs-of-concept available for download. The number of ""supported devices"" is already significant, and appears to be steadily growing. And this is just what is publicly available. * The recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities may help give the malware a foothold on a victims PC. Proof of concepts are readily available, techniques will improve and the recommended fix for Spectre is to replace the CPU with something non-vulnerable. * The WPA2 KRaCK attack is another new-ish vector for infection. Also has proof of concept. Fix requires patching WiFi clients (mobile phones, security cameras, network printers, etc.), but if your device is older than 2 years you will likely not get a patch. Infected devices may be able to go on and infect others. A WiFi worm sounds *fun*! * A bug in the Intel AMT engine discovered in may 2016 allows malware running in ring -2 (that's a minus), but requires physical access to a vulnerable computer. Physical access meaning the malware need access to something like... a USB keyboard. Patches are available but need to be manually downloaded and applied. A small consolation is that the bug is only exploitable on systems intended for business use, and not on consumer hardware. * There's also a regular stream of vulnerabilities from the guys working to reverse engineer Intel ME, and some of them provide possibilities similar to the AMT bug. The most recent issue allowed full debug and execution access to the Intel ME interals using only  you guessed it  a USB device with custom firmware. Think of all the ways that these things may be combined. Also consider that there are more money in malware than ever, thanks in large part to the success of ransomware and cryptocurrency mining, so we can safely assume that the resources spent making and improving malware are rapidly growing. Wouldn't it be nice if the USB device manufacturers had taken heed in 2014 and made all devices BadUSB-resistant by now, so that this increasingly central piece of the exploit puzzle is removed from the equation? It seems they have not. ""Firmware cannot be updated using USB"" is not a sellinig point or part of the spec of any USB flash drive that I've examined, and I've looked at quite a few. Or they could say ""BadUSB immune"" or something to that effect, but googling with ""site:manufacturer.com badusb"" provides no hits for the majority of well-known flash drive manufacturers, except for a couple that provide this capability (in the form of cryptographically signed firmware updates) only on high-end devices which also have FIPS-2 certification and a matching price tag. I don't need all that, I just want a basic simple flash drive that does not have a built-in security vulnerability! BadUSB resistance ought not be a market segmentation opportunity or an advanced security feature. It should be a standard! We *need* it to be a standard. What's going on here!? Is there any USB device manufacturer that has implemented across-the-board BadUSB protection? I get that they need to be able to flash the firmware at some point during production, but surely there has got to be some way to disable it by default and put it in ""flashing mode"" only when needed? Here are some ideas, off the top of my head, on how they could do it: Include a small switch, on the inside or outside, or require some specific input to some kind of sensor on it, like a cheap IR receiver diode (so you could use a universal remote to enable firmware updates), or only allow updates when the device has been plugged and unplugged thrice in under 10 seconds. TL;DR: USB device manufacturers are endangering the security of our computers through inaction. What can we do about it? "

The truth is, this was another template attack, and the resulting vandalism appeared on multiple pages, others affected that I've heard of were Bobby Fischer and a JFK assassination page. There were undoubtedly more. It no doubt confuses people because it is very hard to detect, since it doesn't appear in the page history of individual pages affected at all. Once most people, even a lot of experienced Wikipedia editors, have looked there and found nothing, they will be stumped. Rather worryingly, the Wikipedians who do know what's going on and fixed it in this case, don't seem to want to be open about which particular template was hacked, I certainly couldn't find it, and I know what I'm looking for. It is critical to know which template it was, because Wikipedia's security is modelled on the more eyes is best approach. They have already previously made changes to try and prevent this route of attack, but clearly it isn't working."

It even hit our beloved h3h3. I guarantee it was a [phone number hack](URL **A storm's a brewin.** This hack started hitting Bitcoin users hard a few months ago. Essentially, a hacker only needs to trick your cell phone providers CS into switching your phone number. It's easier than you may think. Even a PIN on your account might not help, because PIN can be bypassed if the last 4 of your SSN is known. When you combine this vulnerability with the new trend of companies like Google, FB and more asking you CONSTANTLY to provide a recovery phone number, or SMS 2 factor in the name of security, it's a GOLD MINE. It's quite ironic really. By the companies pushing users to enable SMS 2FA in the name of increased security, it actually LOWERED security. **So what can you do?** Disable all recovery phone numbers. Do not use SMS 2FA AT ALL. Basically, make sure that a takeover of your phone number does not allow a takeover of additional services. Assume your cell phone number can be jacked at any point, until the cell phone companies directly address this issue. There's nothing you can do to prevent a CS rep from getting fooled. Use Google Authenticator app. Or even better, use a Yubikey. You can use Authy BUT make sure multi-device is disabled. Authy has a feature where it defaults to SMS if it notices the app was deleted (AKA, if an attacker remote wipes your Android device, any services that you had Authy setup with, automatically switchover to SMS forwarding by Authy. BAD) If you want to go above and beyond: URL Fun fact: If your phone number gets stolen, and you had SMS recovery enabled for GMail, the hacker can login to GMail and use their remote wipe feature to completely erase your Android. This feature CANNOT be disabled. Shitty if you ask me :) I had this happen to a friend.. on 2 separate devices. Savagery. **In addition, we need to ask the cell phone companies to speak up. Having a PIN on your account does NOT fix the issue. They are accepting ZERO responsibility. What can we do?**"
16,vulnerability,technology,Can the issue of DNS server attacks like the massive one we saw Friday be resolved by browsers translating the human readable text address to an IP address internally instead of relying of DNS servers?,0,591vc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/591vc5/can_the_issue_of_dns_server_attacks_like_the/,2016-10-24 12:00:58,"As I'm sure everyone here knows, there were major disruptions to the internet on Friday when DNS servers experienced DDoS attacks. From what I understand, the sole duty of a DNS server is to translate a user's human language internet address request into a series of numbers - the IP address. Would it be possible for browsers to simply have an internal 'phone book' that was frequently updated, containing at least for the top 10,000 or so websites? The translation from text address to IP address would then be done before the request was even sent, completely eliminating the need for DNS servers. It wouldn't take more than a GB of memory, and it seems like it would be faster and more secure than making an external call to a DNS server, like cutting out a link of the chain, and this huge international internet vulnerability wouldn't be an issue."

But it seems that as long as they can make an OS update to your phone (which may require physical access), then they can override enough of the security functions so that a reasonable attempt to crack your password will be successful. I get that they don't want to install this on all iPhones, or even on one phone for the FBI, because it would potentially open up that vulnerability to bad actors. But they've always represented that they themselves cannot get at your data, either, and now they have admitted that they can do that merely by installing an OS update."
18,vulnerability,technology,Why does your favorite instant messenger has to die?,7,42ebk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/42ebk3/why_does_your_favorite_instant_messenger_has_to/,2016-01-24 14:34:09,"Graveyard of messengers, a place for Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Hangouts, ooVoo, Apple iMessage, Telegram, Line, Facebook messenger and hundreds of other messengers that would still be developed in the future. I was motivated to write this article by the threatening situation developing on the Instant Messenger market that threatens any future perspective developments in the area of Instant Messaging and video- calling, as well, I wanted to address those tiring questions with regards to what messenger is the best, right and secure. Over the past years the competition in the messenger market was as high as never before. General availability of the Internet and increasing popularity of Smartphones have made IM applications very popular. Many folks have taken this dynamics step further, by writing their own messengers. Every day a new application comes out, promising to revolutionize the messenger market in the way we communicate. You even get to see some absurd messengers once in a while like, Yo, that allows to send only one word at a time. Yet, every messenger continues to have their own audience, that markets exclusivity of their own service. As a result, we as customers over time, go after the features of different messengers, and have to install all of them to be able to conveniently connect with different people. All of this creates a really terrible situation, that at its root threatens the fundamental principles of communication. In this article, through numerous examples I will show you one very important idea: &gt; ""Why such an important for humanity area of technology, as Instant Messaging and audio-video calling cannot be monopolized by one single company and how such monopoly slows down the overall development of technologies and threatens the freedom and security of communication."" Beforehand I just want to throw a disclaimer that I am not hyped about open source and do not posses any phobias about proprietary products and use private protocols and software products in my daily live. I have provided concrete examples below, to exclusively demonstrate the core issues with existing centralized architecture. I do not have anything personal against the products or companies, to the contrary I think they still can evolve. Their model of work, their architecture - that`s what has to die and here is why. ---- Internet, as we know it, exists because of the open standards. All interconnections in the network starting from physical ( the coding on wired, radio and optical signals) to the application / protocol layers (HTTP, E-mail) are open and accessible to anyone. Anybody can create their own website, browser and e-mail client. You do not need to have permission, buy patent or sign any contracts. That is why we have so many Operational Systems that can work with internet, as well as wide selection of different applications that support major protocols. Imaging if you could send e-mail only from Outlook to Outlook. And before sending e-mail you had to find out what application does the recipient use. Or if the phone calls worked only among the same manufacturer. Samsung to Samsung. Apple to Apple, it's absurd isn`t it? But that is exactly how the situation looks when you have to connect with someone on instant messenger or make a video call. Commercial companies own the market, trying to get the largest market share, and profit from it of course. That is why every messenger becomes isolated from others, and companies fiercely compete for the users. This happened because at some point open standards could not longer keep up with increasing needs of the users and commercial companies could offer much more attractive solutions, that made commercial IMs very popular. At times of dial-up, no one could dream of such quality of the voice as Skype provides, especially for free. As a result, some statistics say that right now about 40% of all international calls come through Skype. The second wave of IM popularity came with the significant growth of Smartphone users. People suddenly realized, why would they pay money for SMS, if they can use IM for the fraction of the cost. SMS- market started to shrink, something that will soon happen to the phone market. Mobile operators know this very well, and are try to delay the moment of truth for as long as they can. First they try to block VoIP- services in their local networks, and later they try to mask for them. This situation somewhat reminds me of the fight of the copyright owners with the pirates: at first with the right to record on one`s audio-cassette, VHS and discs, and later on the internet by introducing Digital Rights Management ( DRM, ) and creating laws like the DMCA. That almost ended up in complete failure. The only difference is that mobile operators are part of very influential telecoms that own a significant portion of Internet networks. That is why the road from SIM-cards and mobile calls services is going to be long a and painful. However, there are already companies that support the new movement. For example, a new e-SIM standard developed in cooperation of Samsung and Apple would help the user to select the mobile phone operator right from their phone, without the need to purchase the SIM-Card. Such method would not be very different from any other existing subscription services. Just, look at the list of operators in your region, select the right plan, and pay by credit card. In such conditions users would always want to keep their phone number. iNum, had to become such number, that to my opinion have failed. Maybe instead of phone number there would and ID of the user`s favorite IM. In this case we can see that the user would need nothing besides the internet from the operator and all additional services would be ignored. Even today, as see some people use the SIM cards for the internet in their tablets being bombarded with different paid subscription services from ISPs, which just annoys the user. In the future, such feelings toward ISPs would keep growing stronger. It is seen that in such conditions the influence of messengers would grow to significant extent. From an alternative means of communication, messengers would move up to the primary method. Its frightful to imagine what would happen if the current tendency continues, and we would have hundreds of isolated and incompatible applications. &gt; ""Why Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangouts or any other proprietary application should never become the dominant global messenger? "" To see the whole threat of monopoly in the technology sector, it would be enough to take a look at business solutions that work only in Internet Explorer, forcing the users to use poor instrument in order to access required business solution. Or let's take a look at dominant electronic file formats. The leading position was taken by the proprietary doc format, and there is still no standardized format for all electronic documents. When it comes to security, the mass media often rises questions such as : Which messenger is the most reliable? Which one is the most ""secure""? By secure, most of the time, the security of the transport protocol is assumed, which is odd, because besides secured protocol there many other aspects that can create vulnerability to the user. It is not a right question to ask in the first place, and every time its asked, a specific threat should be outlined. Security - is not a final product, it's a combination of technology and architecture working together. So to answer the question correctly we would have to look and examined separately. Let's take a look at the security and functionality of different messengers below. **Skype** I have been using Skype for over 10 years. After browser, this is the second most used application on my PC. For me it's more than just an IM, it is a tool I use to hold business meetings, conference calls, talk with friends and create new friendships. I do not even create social media accounts, because I prefer voice and video over text. I have tried all of the features offered by Skype, and to me they are simply amazing. I have tried all development tools for Skype as well, such as Skype4Com, SkypeKit SDK. I actively tried to improve Skype, by regularly posting to bug tracker, till it was closed. As a result of using Skype **I have found 2 critical errors, that allow remotely close Skype client for Windows**. I truly ~~love~~, loved Skype, and as I believe I have enough experience and moral right to write all of this down. **Why Skype is great?** Today, Skype is the most advanced software in its market segment that definitely beats the competition. and here is why: **Quality of audio** Skype has the best technology in place, that provides the best quality for audio. Its codec (SILK) and the dynamic routing make call quality good, even for people with slower internet connection. **Connectivity-** Skype is a very sneaky software that can find a connection when the other programs cannot. You have probably seen it happen when the browser doesn`t load, yet you can use it to communicate. The reasons for it, is its ability to get through firewalls and NAT blocking, many companies can simply dream of such connectivity. **Encryption** For me, it's important to know that my communication is private and cannot be intercepted an analyzed. Even with government programs in place, such as Microsoft Government Security Program, which allows special agencies to gain access to my communication I can be sure that my communication is secure at least at the network level. Even the most advanced DPI systems experience difficulties in tracking traffic of Skype. *It's important to note, that the encryption at the network level is being marketed by messengers as a feature that makes them secure. I am going to explain why the encryption of traffic alone does not make communication secure.* Some other excellent features of Skype include its stability and functionality. Skype is stable and rarely crashes, you can use it for video conference and calls for many days non-stop without crashing. When it come to functionality, there are many, group calls, monitor sharing, file sharing, editing tools, call to phones. You can access all of them by navigating through the convenient application interface without the need for additional plug-ins and add-ons. **Why Skype has to die?** **Insecure ** Not only insecure, but its highly dangerous! Skype continues to disclose your IP-address, including your local address. Based on this information it is easy to find you current location and build a map of your movements. While, the bug tracker still existed, you could have watched how Skype spend over a year trying to fix a bug that allowed to create remote DoS for any application running on Windows. The vulnerability that allowed to remotely unblock the microphone took them over half a year to fix. I had to ask, almost beg the developers to pay attention to these vulnerabilities, that simply did not allow the user to use the application securely, without being exposed to external threats. When a vulnerability that allowed any account to be stolen was announced, simply by knowing the e-mail of the user, I tried to reach Technical Support to explain the issue for over a day, but wasn`t able to do so. Meanwhile Skype accounts of some notable people were stolen. Actually, after this incident Skype has failed to review its policy of account registration, and still does not require e-mail confirmation. You can still enter any e-mail when you register and the accounts would be displayed in the list, which allows to spam the search results, if one would perform search for account by e-mail. At this moment (!!!), I know at least two vulnerabilities, that would allow to block someone's Skype account, so that the victim would never be able to use it again. The attacker has to know only the Login of the target, without the need for password or e-mail. Again, I was not able to get any response from Technical Support and posted the issue to their forum. The issue is still unresolved. Such posts usually get replies from remote support centers that have no desire to investigate the issue further and simply reference some vague FAQ sections, failing to see the real threat on their side. Even though the messenger is secure at the transport layer, due to the size of the company and internal politics/ organization, many highly dangerous vulnerabilities are not addressed, to this day and if found, take very long time to resolve. At the same time, you can always see some new smiley`s with each new version release of the product. Let's get back to the statement: **Secured transport layer protocol does not make the messenger secure.** Its only part of overall security. And as a reader we have to keep in mind when we read another marketing nonsense, about three layers of security, the length of encryption, military grade security and other bullshit, that has absolutely no connection to real security. **Unpredictability** You cannot just take and write an alternative Skype client, because its protocol is closed and is often changed. That's why, the company has the decision power to decide which devices would be able to run Skype. Some time ago, SkypeKit SDK existed, that allowed to develop a client for integration on own devices. All you had to do, was to sign a few non-disclosure agreements, promise not to run the Skypekit on the server side, and create personal certificate ( that, in case of misuse could be taken back), and you could start developing. But later on the company changed its mind and decided to take down the support for Skypekit and block all existing purchased versions. Same thing happened with Skype4Com, and Skype for Asterisk. That is why if you decided to integrate Skype in one of your products, be prepared that tomorrow it may stop working and all of you development efforts would be lost. We face the similar situation with interface for the desktop client. After the release of another new version, you always look for ways to turn off crazy fantasies of the marketers, that create huge - smiley taking half of you screen, as well as make many other uncomfortable changes that you were used to before. That's the problem, you cannot predict what is going to be on the Skype's mind next, and it always poses a threat to the customers. The reason I spent so much time explaining details of Skype, is it because you can count it as a flagship in the industry of IMs. It has the richest arsenal of functionalities, and its competitors are very far away. At the same time it is the oldest and has many visible symptoms telling us it is time for it to go... For those who still think Skype as a service that should continue to be the leading messenger probably do not understand the whole seriousness of the issue, or probably because you did not face one yet. If you want to see how dangerous some of the open bugs are or if you do not believe me just leave a comment below saying: "" Want to test my Skype account for vulnerabilities"" Issues of Skype, in one way or another, can be related to all popular messengers. I am not going to look at its closer rival Viber, because I do not have much experience using it. But I will say a few words about others. **Telegram** I am looking at Telegram separately, because it is a messenger that at its core differs from the competition and does not have many of the shortcoming of Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp. Its often displayed as a long-awaited alternative to all existing messengers. In mass media it was advertised as so secure, that even terrorists use it. But unfortunately, in most cases people take security as a separate entity, without taking into account any particular threat, which is an absolutely wrong way of doing it. I, myself always use Telegram, and to be honest, I have to say it has amazing usability. None of other messenger have ever give me that sense excitement. Its stability with bad internet connection, alone makes it an exceptional choice. In the areas with weak signal, in areas were the device barely catches the GPRS, non of other messengers perform this well. But when we start talking about security and exceptionality of Telegram, unfortunately we have to say that is displays similar symptoms as its competitors do. **Why Telegram has to die?** **Centralized control** Which is the main issue of all outlined messengers. I often notice that people fail to see the seriousness of this argument. One may think, how bad can it be, if one single company has full control over your communication? They are all nice guys after all.., they do not ask for money, they provide convenient API, and smileys are really cool. But you should not forget, that any company goes after its own interest in the first place, and it's there for a profit. Today, under the pressure of another commercial company you see that the Telegram defines topics that you can and cannot discuss. Just recently in deleted over 78 forum posts on the topic of ISIL, just because of Apple`s request. What if they are going to ban something else tomorrow? Such company, having ""group on nice guys"" at its head would always confirm to more powerful structures. Such structures may consist of the whole Government State or smaller jurisdictions, especially those, in which the company operates. Therefore, at any point in time, some sort of information or activities can become undesirable for the overall politics or vision of the company, and it can make changes regardless if laws of your country allow you to do what was banned or not. Having one centralized company have full control over your communication, disregarding your opinion and say is a very dangerous position to be in. It difficult to say how the politics of separate Governments will change tomorrow, and the ease with which they can influence the instruments of communication is simply unacceptable. Upon waking up tomorrow morning you may realized that your ability use your favorite messenger is gone, simply because someone decided so. Let's take a look at some other issues of Telegram. **Centralized architecture** This issue goes closely with the one mentioned above. One point of failure allows at any moment to limit accessibility to the server for whole countries or even fully liquidate Telegram by the ruling of the Court. Servers of Telegram, together with chat histories, that are openly stored in there, could be withdrawn at any time if the government, in which they are located decides to do so. Even though that the client part of the Telegram protocol is open sourced the server side is still closed from the external audit. Basically, the security of regular chartrooms is based on the words of the Telegram team alone. It`s like them saying : ""We promise not to read your communication, we promise!""Probably they are honest in their promise, but the possibility in itself, for some group of people having the unlimited access to the private information at the scale of the whole World is simply unacceptable. **Authentication through SMS** Telegram is as secure, as your current mobile providers , because of the authentication through SMS. It's enough to remember how malefactors 5 times reissued SIM-card Beeline. Telegram helps to protect users from such plotters, allowing the user to create secret password, but it's not an option set by default. **End- to-end encryption** I have to admit is that use of such function in Telegram is very convenient. Especially, handy comes the ability to set a timer that self-destructs the chat history, so one would not have to worry if the companion would delete the history log at the right moment. But the procedure of key comparison is very ambiguous. Every time, the copy of the key is different and its unknown what channels are used to compare the keys. There is no possibility to once create the verification of chat key and to have the ability to verify its authenticity by yourself, as it is possible with OTR. In the end, without looking at the fact that Telegram has being developed really well and in most cases it is much more secure and usable compared to the competition, you cannot really say that it is significantly different from the competition. It is the same commercial product, bearing all the threats to the freedom of communication of the user. **But how about my favorite %messenger_name%?** All mentioned symptoms, to some extent relate to the majority of top messengers known today. Centralized architecture, and operational control by one single company, is the largest nail in the coffin for each one of them. That`s why there is no need to describe all of them individually. *Short table of popular messengers and reasons, why they have to die.* ICQ  Centralized architecture owned by Mail.ru in Russia.  Very vulnerable because of old connections with security agencies  Lack of end-to-end encryption Has to die? **YES** Viber  Centralized architecture  Tied to phone number  Closed protocol  Lack of end-to-end encryption Has to die? **YES** WhatsApp  Centralized architecture  Closed protocol  Tied to phone number  Lack of end-to-end encryption  Have to pay to use Has to die? **YES** Google Hangouts  Centralized architecture  Closed protocol  Google Account required  Lack of end-to-end encryption Has to die? **YES** Face Time / iMessage  Centralized architecture  Closed protocol  Works exclusively on Apple Devices  Lack of end-to-end encryption Has to die? **YES** **SIP and Jabber** Anyone who is looking for real security is forced to use good, old open source protocols. For voice communication it is - SIP + ZRTP, for text - XMPP + OTR. But on in comparison to the commercial services, we can say that most of the time these protocols are not working, than actually work. It looks a bit odd to me that in some cases while making calls through SIP, you can hear voice only on one way, experience problems with incoming and outgoing calls and have many other problems that commercial solutions lack. I do not want to think about NAT type, working with ICE and STUN, guessing ports, when I simply need to make a short call. That's is just disgusting . Similar story with Jabber. How can you even imagine that in 2016, your message can get lost simply because there was a lost connection with the server? Where is the normal confirmation message delivery and read receipts? Jabber is absolutely terrible with unstable internet connections and mobile platforms . Until all of these issues are fixed, we should not even start talking about competition of open source protocol with commercial messengers. I would be happy, if today there would exist at least one open source solution, capable of taking the place of dominant messenger in the world. But it does not exist. **What should be done?** I sincerely believe that this topic is extremely serious and it is important not to miss the right moment. We should not allow anybody to take over or restrict our fundamental ability to communicate. Such serious for humanity question, as a development of one single standard for instant messages and calls, should be dealt by organization such as IETF together with the leading IT- companies in the industry. A very good example is the story of OpenSSL. When a vulnerability heartbleed was found, everyone was terrified by how helpless the whole industry looked because of one mistake. After that an organization called Core Infrastructure Initiative was formed which consists of the larges IT-companies such as Cisco, Google, Intel. The goal of such organization is to support critical for the industry software products such as OpenSSL, GnuPG, Network Time Protocol and others. I hope, that people would become aware of the importance of open instruments before critical and fatal issues in current proprietary products would be discovered and that similar organization would be created in time, to work out and create proper standards. Internet protocol allows any node to connect to any other node on the internet. To the present day, it's not 100% true because of the issues with ipv4, but let's assume, that some years passed and everyone got ipv6, and every devise at any moment in time, with the connection to the internet have real, routing IP-address. This would allow any device, be it a Smartphone or computer to connect with each other without the need for the companies, that provide communication services. You just have to say you current IP-address to the other party. Add to it cryptography that can be supported by all mobile devices that allows to use encryption without much strain on the battery and we have an excellent solution. &gt; Such environment inevitably leads to P2P Utopia, in which people would be able to communicate securely by connecting directly, without third party services. While such ideas are being realized in the forms of different prototypes, that are weakly suitable for daily use, overall the situation keeps changing with each day, You can try out some of the available products today. **Tox** Probably, the most advanced instrument on the market that gets us close to P2P cryptoanarchy. It is fully decentralized messenger, with ability to make video and voice calls, allows screen sharing, and conference calling. All communication by default is being encrypted and is sent directly between users without servers. The client is available for Windows/Linux/OSX/Android. Unfortunately, the realization of the client is malfunctioning in some areas and some functionalities do not work between different platforms, but they continue to actively develop and grow. **Ring** Previous SIP-client of SFLphone. Now capable of working in 3 states: for regular SIP-caller (centralized), like federal service (with self-hosted server, that can connect with other servers) and fully decentralized. Roughly, with this client you can use SIP to call through DHT. Unfortunately the client for OS X is still malfunctioning and I wasn`t able to use all of its functionalities to the full extent. Probably there are more example out there, but I do not know any other clients that really work. These two examples are very far from being ideal and regular users probably would not like them. I have to say, that the success of one particular product measures not only in advanced technology, but also in its usability, design, ease of use and simplicity. Probably, before such technologies would be adapted, a lot of iterations of different protocols would go by. I am not prepare to say, how an ideal protocol should look like, but I would try to outline basic requirements below: **Open and developed for the interests of the Community** No company should have a monopoly over the whole architecture and development. The development should come as a results of collective discussions, just like stated by RFC. Licenses should not in any way restrict the use of the client. This does not exclude the existence of commercial clients, just like today there are paid E-mail clients and companies that make money on e-mail technologies. **Decentralized** By decentralization I do not necessarily mean exclusively P2P, in which there are no servers what so ever. Basic servers could exist, similar to super nodes in Skype, for example for transfer of large media information, hashing, exchanged of routing data, etc. Pure P2P network in many cases creates some difficulties, for example, for mobile users with narrow, unstable internet. It could be decentralization, similar to E-mail and Jabber, when there is a large amount of independent servers, that can interact with each other. Closure of one or several servers would not influence the system as a whole. Even if whole countries or continents would be cut off from the internet, the system would continue operating. Probably, the company should also foresee the continuing operation in case of failure on the server side. Also, client, if he wants, should be able to delegate the storage of messages to the server, and access the client thought login/password, or store private keys locally and have the ability to access network by oneself, without using any server. In this way it is possible to keep the convenience for regular users and give opportunity to more specialized users to create a more customized level of security. **Protected against blocking** The protocol should be stable against the attempts to be blocked, and be able to connects between different ports, transport protocols and obfuscate traffic in such a way, so that it could not be detected by DPI systems. In the worst case scenario, the application should use any of the available protocols, for example HTTPS. Even if all possible entry points would be fully closed on the routings of the provider, there should be an option to specify own address of the gateway, similar on how it is done in TOR. **Protected from eavesdropping** All communications between end -users should not be transferred and stored in unencrypted state anywhere, except for the users`s device. For convenience and synchronization between the devices, the history can be saved on the server, if the user wants to, but it has to encrypted. For example, with master password as it's done in ProtonMail. At the same time there should be convenient tools for key verification, that are used for end-to-end encryption, similar to how it is done in RedPhone. The software should in every case send notification about untrusted connection, interception attempts and any issues with encryption. **Be Interoperable** All clients should be compatible at the basic level, as outlined in the standard. So that the calls and chats should work among all existing software products. E.g. there should be an ability to call from Skype to Viber, and vice versa. Firm specific, unstandardized functionalities should be available for the users if they use the same vendor. **Conclusion** I am not calling everyone to opt out from using their favorite instant messenger. Unfortunately, there is no suitable replacements for current commercial products, and we have to use tools that meet our needs best. The goal of this article, was mostly to shed the light on the existing problem that awaits us in the future, if we do not take any measures to fix it today. In this article I also attempted to answer all those questions with regards to which messenger is the best, and why you should be more careful reading news with regards to any new super amazing messenger, with ""exceptional"" security, that has finally got it right.

19,vulnerability,technology,"Dell ships laptops with rogue root CA, exactly like what happened with Lenovo and Superfish",7048,3twmfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3twmfv/dell_ships_laptops_with_rogue_root_ca_exactly/,2015-11-23 16:14:14,"I got a shiny new XPS 15 laptop from Dell, and while attempting to troubleshoot a problem, I discovered that it came pre-loaded with a self-signed root CA (Certificate Authority) by the name of [eDellRoot](URL With it came its private key, marked as non-exportable. However, it is still possible to obtain a raw copy of the private key by using several tools available (I used NCC Group's Jailbreak tool). After briefly discussing this with someone else who had discovered this too, we determined that they are shipping every laptop they distribute with the *exact same root certificate and private key*, very similar to what Superfish did on Lenovo computers. For those that aren't familiar, **this is a major security vulnerability that endangers all recent Dell customers**. Surely Dell had to have seen what kind of bad press Lenovo got when people discovered what Superfish was up to. Yet, they decided to do the same thing but worse. This isn't even a third-party application that placed it there; it's from Dell's very own bloatware. To add insult to injury, it's not even apparent what purpose the certificate serves. At least with Superfish we knew that their rogue root CA was needed to inject ads into your web pages; the reason Dell's is there is unclear. If you have recently bought a Dell computer and want to see if you are affected by this, go to **Start -&gt; type ""certmgr.msc"" -&gt; (accept on UAC prompt) -&gt; Trusted Root Certification Authorities -&gt; Certificates** and check if you have an entry with the name ""eDellRoot"". If so, congratulations, you've been pwned by Dell, the very company you paid for your computer! Here is a [link to the certificate, private key, and PFX file](URL for the certificate I found on my machine. The password for the PFX file is ""dell"". (The certificate itself is in the eDellRoot.crt file. Do NOT import the PFX file unless you know what you're doing. I just included it for convenience.) If yours came with the eDellRoot certificate, its thumbprint will probably be: 98:A0:4E:41:63:35:77:90:C4:A7:9E:6D:71:3F:F0:AF:51:FE:69:27 And its serial number: 6b:c5:7b:95:18:93:aa:97:4b:62:4a:c0:88:fc:3b:b6 It's upsetting that Dell would do this despite the backlash Lenovo experienced from its customers and the [US Department of Homeland Security](URL and I really hope they quickly do something to correct this. The more people that know and speak up, the faster it will happen. --- **UPDATE:** I've been reading that a lot of people are skeptical in the sense that this CA can't actually do anything because the CA has no capabilities. I did some more research and found out that this CA *can indeed* sign server certificates. I've updated the list of files above to include a certificate issued by the CA with file name ""badgoogle.crt"", which you can also see in [this screenshot](URL For those that are unfamiliar with how this works, a network attacker could use this CA do sign his or her own fake certificates for use on real websites and an affected Dell user would be none the wiser unless they happened to check the website's certificate chain. This CA could also be used to sign code to run on people's machines, but I haven't tested this out yet. --- **UPDATE 2:** Dell has released [a statement](URL regarding this matter along with instructions for how to remove it ([download](URL"

24,vulnerability,technology,Lavasoft Admits Their Ad-Aware Web Companion Filter Is Using The Komodia SDK (Superfish Related) And Are Unable To Say With Certainty When It Will Be Removed,84,2wukvi,http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2wukvi/lavasoft_admits_their_adaware_web_companion/,2015-02-23 17:59:32,"The Facebook page of Lavasoft came out with the following announcement on Saturday, February 21: &gt;A great deal of attention has been given to recent event surrounding Superfish and Lenovo, and the resulting security vulnerability that has been exposed in a Komodia, a sub-component of Superfishs product. Lavasoft takes security issues very seriously, and would like to take a moment to explain to its users who are naturally concerned by the overlap between Lavasoft and Komodia. Background and Recent Events:  Komodia delivers a collection of utility SDKs for scanning and intercepting internet traffic on a users PC.  Applications using Komodia SDKs include ad injectors, parental control services, and security products such as Ad-Aware Web Companion.  One of the technologies used by Komodia to inspect HTTPS (SSL-encrypted) web traffic is a root certificate.  The private key of this certificate was compromised, creating a security risk that can be exploited by another program running on the same PC. Key Facts:  For the past year, Lavasoft was developing and testing a new security feature in Ad-Aware Web Companion to scan and eliminate malicious content/advertising in HTTPS traffic, including content injected by internet proxies installed on the PC.  This functionality was implemented with one of Komodias public SDKs (the SSL Digestor). At no point was any encrypted information collected or analyzed. All analysis of incoming traffic to eliminate security risks was performed on the end-users PC.  Several weeks ago, upon consultation with our partners and evaluation of the risks/benefits, prior to the public announcement of the security risk, Lavasoft took the decision to remove the functionality and eliminate the deployment of the root certificate to inspect the traffic.  Lavasofts most recent release of Ad-Aware Web Companion (released on February 18th 2015) does not include this capability, but we are not yet able to confirm with certainty that the compromised component of the Komodia SSL Digestor has been removed. If still present, a new release of Web Companion will be issued promptly on Monday morning. Lavasoft is in contact with its partners to ensure the message is properly communicated. We thank you for your patience and your understanding."

Not sure whether this is a good place to ask this. If anyone knows any other subreddit where I can ask this question I will be grateful One day out of curiousity I started inspecting illegal streaming site (putlocker, 123movies etc) using the Chrome inspector. Now, I found the Iframe player and I went to the source in the link and it links to.. another website. And after 5 or so hops, finally it links to the mp4 source itself. Then I got curious and listed down a bunch of questions: 1. Why would video streaming sites embed other websites than the source itself? 2. The video embedded would often have ads on them, is this part of the original website's (the one I am browsing right now) Javascript, or part of the embedded website. (the one that provided the content) 3. Some video streaming websites would also disable right clicking on browser, why would they do that? 4. Video streaming websites often have the ability to open a new tab after each click/keypress, is there a way to limit their JS functionality? 5. Is there any way for these websites to harm your computer maliciously? I know some websites may use exploit kits (the articles mostly mentioned Adobe Flash player) but are there any more ways it can harm your computer through the browser just by visiting/streaming their videos (stealing your passwords etc)? If anyone can point me to up-to-date cybersecurity research on this area it will be fine as well. I hope this questions piques your interest as it did mine. Thank you."

She said that it is a good trade off when the government is able to access every personal information for having a secure society and that it is a nice thought that everyone has his absolute privacy but we live in a society and without surveillance in any kind the state wouldnt be able to get any criminal. Another argument also was the classical if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear because the government cant harm you with information if you are completely innocent. I am so shocked tbh.

So-called deepfakes are images or videos that have been manipulated through the use of sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to make it almost impossible to differentiate between whats real and what isnt. While the technology has positive applications Walt Disney Co. has used algorithms to insert characters in some of its Star Wars moviesit also has been used to create more nefarious content. The tools to create the fake images are improving so rapidly that very soon it will be very hard to detect deepfakes with technology, said Dana Rao, executive vice president and general counsel for Adobe Inc., the San Francisco company best known for Photoshop image-editing software. The fight will be an arms race, he said. The number of deepfakes online nearly doubled from December to August, to 14,678, according to a study by cybersecurity startup Deeptrace. The rise has prompted action by tech giants. Alphabet Inc. s Google on Wednesday, in an update to its political advertisement policy, said it was prohibiting the use of deepfakes in those and other ads. Computer-generated videos are getting more realistic and even harder to detect thanks to deep learning and artificial intelligence. As WSJs Jason Bellini finds in this episode of Moving Upstream, these so-called deepfakes can be playful, but can also have real, damaging consequences for peoples lives. Twitter earlier this month said it was considering identifying manipulated photos, videos and audio shared on its platform. The risk is that these types of synthetic media and disinformation undermine the public trust and erode our ability to have productive conversations about critical issues, said Yoel Roth, Twitters head of site integrity. Facebook, Microsoft Corp. and [Amazon.com](URL Inc. are working with more than a half-dozen universities to run a Deepfake Detection Challenge starting next month. It is intended to accelerate research into new ways of detecting and preventing media manipulated to mislead others, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer wrote in a blog post in September. Interest in making deepfakes is growing fast, according to Deeptrace. Two years ago the first deepfakes appeared on Reddit, the popular chat forum. Now at least 20 websites and online forums are devoted to discussions about how to better produce them. Deeptrace found online services that can generate and sell custom deepfakes in as little as two days and for a cost as low as $2.99 a video, the researchers said. It doesnt take a lot of skill, said Matt Turek, a program manager overseeing deepfake-related research and development efforts at the Pentagons technology incubator, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The Pentagon is studying deepfakes out of concern that military planners could be fooled into bad decisions if altered images arent detected. Darpa has developed a prototype media forensics tool for use by government agencies to detect altered photos and video. It wants to develop additional technology to detect synthetic audio and fake text and identify the source and intent of any manipulated content. How companies deal with deepfakes is another point of conflict between tech companies and Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) denounced Facebook earlier this year for its refusal to take down a doctored video of her. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, following the incident, said the company was reviewing its policy on deepfakes. Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas has co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D., Nev.) to boost research to identify such content manipulation. On Wednesday, Mr. Moran called deepfakes a specific threat to U.S. voters and consumers by way of misinformation that is increasingly difficult to identify. Several startups have emerged to work on image verification, and now big tech companies, which have been criticized for not doing more to prevent disinformation, are getting more involved in the fight. For example, Facebook has amassed more than 100,000 videos featuring actorsnot images drawn from the social media sites actual usersthat researchers can use to help develop and test systems to spot deepfakes. Google has similarly built up a catalog to hone deepfake-detection research. This year the company assembled a trove of audio clips to help researchers develop ways to identify fake speech that can be spliced into a video. Google also is drawing on its work developing text-to-speech conversion tools and to devise new ones that can help authenticate a speaker. Adobe is taking a different approach. The company has developed a system that will allow authors and publishers to attach information to content, such as who created it and when and where. It is working with New York Times Co. and Twitter and will share the technology, which it says it will aim to make an industrywide system for authenticating content. Adobe said it would introduce the authentication tool on its Photoshop editing software as an opt-in feature in the next several months. Adobe expects most legitimate authors and creators to opt in, while bad actors wouldnt, Mr. Rao said. Elsewhere, the nonprofit arm of the AI Foundation, an advocacy group for the safe use of artificial intelligence, has created a website to help campaigns and journalists analyze photos and videos within minutes of receiving them. The portal, called Reality Defender 2020, uses complex algorithms to detect pixel changes and other anomalies, such as in a candidates mannerisms, mouth movements, face wrinkles and shadows, to detect alterations. It has drawn on research from dozens of academics. There is no one silver bullet, said the AI Foundations founder and chief technology officer, Rob Meadows. [URL"

Recent Iranian attacks on American banks, businesses and government agencies have been more extensive than previously reported. Dozens of corporations and multiple United States agencies have been hit, according to seven people briefed on the episodes who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. The attacks, attributed to Iran by analysts at the National Security Agency and the private security firm FireEye, prompted an emergency order by the Department of Homeland Security during the government shutdown last month. The Iranian attacks coincide with a renewed Chinese offensive geared toward stealing trade and military secrets from American military contractors and technology companies, according to nine intelligence officials, private security researchers and lawyers familiar with the attacks who discussed them on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. A summary of an intelligence briefing read to The New York Times said that Boeing, General Electric Aviation and T-Mobile were among the recent targets of Chinese industrial-espionage efforts. The companies all declined to discuss the threats, and it is not clear if any of the hacks were successful. Chinese cyberespionage cooled four years ago after President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China reached a landmark deal to stop hacks meant to steal trade secrets. But the 2015 agreement appears to have been unofficially canceled amid the continuing trade tension between the United States and China, the intelligence officials and private security researchers said. Chinese hacks have returned to earlier levels, although they are now stealthier and more sophisticated. Cyber is one of the ways adversaries can attack us and retaliate in effective and nasty ways that are well below the threshold of an armed attack or laws of war, said Joel Brenner, a former leader of United States counterintelligence under the director of national intelligence. Federal agencies and private companies are back to where they were five years ago: battling increasingly sophisticated, government-affiliated hackers from China and Iran  in addition to fighting constant efforts out of Russia  who hope to steal trade and military secrets and sow mayhem. And it appears the hackers substantially improved their skills during the lull. Russia is still considered Americas foremost hacking adversary. In addition to meddling widely and spreading disinformation during United States elections, Russian hackers are believed to have launched attacks on nuclear plants, the electrical grid and other targets. Threats from China and Iran never stopped entirely, but Iranian hackers became much less active after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015. And for about 18 months, intelligence officials concluded, Beijing backed off its 10-year online effort to steal trade secrets. But Chinese hackers have resumed carrying out commercially motivated attacks, security researchers and data-protection lawyers said. A priority for the hackers, researchers said, is supporting Beijings five-year economic plan, which is meant to make China a leader in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies. Some of the recent intelligence collection has been for military purposes or preparing for some future cyber conflict, but a lot of the recent theft is driven by the demands of the five-year plan and other technology strategies, said Adam Segal, the director of the cyberspace program at the Council on Foreign Relations. They always intended on coming back. Officials at the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Segal and other Chinese security experts said attacks that once would have been conducted by hackers in Chinas Peoples Liberation Army are now being run by Chinas Ministry of State Security. These hackers are better at covering their tracks. Rather than going at targets directly, they have used a side door of sorts by breaking into the networks of the targets suppliers. They have also avoided using malware commonly attributed to China, relying instead on encrypting traffic, erasing server logs and other obfuscation tactics. The fingerprint of Chinese operations today is much different, said Priscilla Moriuchi, who once ran the National Security Agencys East Asia and Pacific cyber threats division. Her duties there included determining whether Beijing was abiding by the 2015 agreements terms. These groups care about attribution. They dont want to get caught. It is difficult to quantify the number of industrial-espionage attacks, in part because they have been designed mostly to steal strategic trade secrets, not the kind of personal information about customers and employees that companies must disclose. Only Airbus has acknowledged in recent weeks that Chinese hackers had penetrated its databases. Many of the attacks by the Chinese Ministry of State Security have been against strategic targets like internet service providers with access to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of corporate and government networks. Last week, Ms. Moriuchi, who is now a threat director at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, released a report on a yearlong, stealth campaign by the ministry to hack internet service providers in Western Europe and the United States and their customers. The lone hacking target to publicly confront the ministry was Visma, a Norwegian internet service provider with 850,000 customers. The goal of the attack on Visma was to gain broad access to its customers intellectual property, strategic plans and emails, including those of an American law firm that handles intellectual property matters for clients in the automotive, biomedical, pharmaceutical and tech sectors, according to Recorded Future. The Visma attack was harder to trace than earlier incidents, which typically started with so-called spearphishing emails meant to steal personal credentials. This assault began with stolen credentials for a third-party software service, Citrix. And instead of using malware easily traced to China, the attackers used malware available on the so-called Dark Web that could have come from anywhere. They also used the online storage service Dropbox to move stolen emails and files. Federal agencies are also trying to fend off new Iranian espionage campaigns. After the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, testified before Congress that her agency was anticipating its a possibility that Iran would resort to hacking attacks. The Iranian attacks, which hit more than a half-dozen federal agencies last month, still caught the department off guard. Security researchers said the hacks, which exploited underlying weaknesses in the internets backbone, were continuing and were more damaging and widespread than agency officials had acknowledged. Iranian hackers began their latest wave of attacks in Persian Gulf states last year. Since then, they have expanded to 80 targets  including internet service providers, telecommunications companies and government agencies  in 12 European countries and the United States, according to researchers at FireEye, which first reported the attacks last month. The current hacks are harder to catch than previous Iranian attacks. Instead of hitting victims directly, FireEye researchers said, Iranian hackers have been going after the internets core routing system, intercepting traffic between so-called domain name registrars. Once they intercepted their targets customer web traffic, they used stolen login credentials to gain access to their victims emails. (Domain name registrars hold the keys to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of companies websites.) Theyre taking whole mailboxes of data, said Benjamin Read, a senior manager of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye. Mr. Read said Iranian hackers had targeted police forces, intelligence agencies and foreign ministries, indicating a classic, state-backed espionage campaign rather than a criminal, profit-seeking motive. There is a long history of Iranian attacks against the United States, and episodes from five years back or longer are just now being made public. On Wednesday, the Justice Department announced an indictment against a former Air Force intelligence specialist, Monica Witt, on charges of helping Iran with an online espionage campaign. Four members of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were also charged with computer intrusions and aggravated identity theft directed at members of the United States intelligence community. Also last week, the Treasury said it was putting sanctions on two Iranian companies, New Horizon Organization and Net Peygard Samavat Company, and several people linked to them. Treasury officials said New Horizon set up annual conferences where Iran could recruit and collect intelligence from foreign attendees. Ms. Witt attended one of the conferences, the indictment says. Net Peygard used information she provided to begin a campaign in 2014 to track the online activities of United States government and military personnel, Treasury officials said. Representatives for Irans Mission to the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment. The recent Iranian attacks have unnerved American officials. But after issuing the emergency order about the ones last month, the Department of Homeland Securitys Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has largely played them down. An official with the cybersecurity agency said there was a belief that no information had been stolen and that the attacks had not materially impacted operations. But Mr. Read of FireEye and others said there had been a noticeable escalation in Irans digital espionage. If you tell the Iranians youre going to walk out on the agreement and do everything you can to undermine their government, said Mr. Brenner, the former counterintelligence official, you cant be surprised if they attack our government networks. url: [ URL ]"

Sounds crazy! Even if you dont use your domain it can afflict damage to you and your business.** I would like to start this article with the world statistics provided by [IBM Security](URL The average data breach costs $3.9M for the company. The average time to identify a breach  196 days. The average time to contain a breach  69 days. Just think of these huge numbers. Some companies are living their comfortable lives with holes in the security system. Information becomes the most valuable treasure in the modern world. Companies all over the world spend millions of dollars to protect confidential records from the outsiders using the best practices of cybersecurity. But what if finding out all corporate secrets is simpler than you think. G Suite is a great and well-known tool used by businesses and organizations across the world. Mostly every my company processes are there. I think that setting up of the G Suite account is the second common step after purchasing a domain. Google, as a leading company, works hard to protect G Suite from data breaches and hacker attacks. They use encryption for data security, machine learning to detect phishing attacks algorithms, build features to spot previously unseen attacks, etc. Google security team does everything to protect your companys secrets. Yet even such structures as Google can have processual issues that cause data loss to the advantage of unauthorized users. ## A potshot Here is my real life story of how I managed to get **one companys G Suite account with all the private information** without any tension. In 2017 I wanted to buy the domain for my [corporate](URL needs. At that time the other company used the domain I needed. A few months later, I checked the domain again, and it appeared to be available for sale. I bought it for 50$. Everything seemed to be simple at that moment. Yet I faced the first issue when I tried to add this domain name to my existing G Suite. I received an error message that this domain name has already been used as an alias or domain. What the hell? I had my domain name, but I couldnt add it to my G Suite account. Aiming to fix this issue I had to reach out a support manager from Google. He was so kind and helped me to get the access to the admin account of the previous G Suite. He suggested me to take the following steps: &amp;#x200B; As you can see from the email Google cant delete the information: &gt;I understand that you also need to delete your G Suite account that was created by mistake. Unlikely as a G Suite support representative I am not allowed to delete your existing account due to privacy and security reasons. After I completed all the steps in the email I accessed the G Suite account. But I received a bonus: the access to all previous emails and accounts of the prior user. As an extra data, I got the administrative access to Twitter, PayPal, Apple developers account, and etc. This is crazy. I got full information about contacts, invoices, agreements, NDA, and negotiation emails. Google drive was full of data. For a few days, I was really shocked by the information I unexpectedly gained. Still, as far as I respect the privacy of the previous G Suite owner, I deleted the information which did not belong to me. ### The second try The second time I faced the same issue with the domain was a month ago. Again, the same scenario was applied: Buy the domain =&gt; Try to add to existing =&gt; Error =&gt; Contact support manager. This time I told the manager that Id just bought the domain, and he sent me a form so that they can contest the ownership of that domain. Then the Google team canceled the existing account and this way I could add it as a secondary domain. This second time I got an empty account with no data in it. ### The Experiment Potentially it seems like Google has closed the security bridge. But as a developer who gains advantage from the [sci-tech approach](URL I decided to find out how many G Suite accounts are in danger of being stolen. Ive performed the next steps: 1. **The first step**  Google API research. I needed to find API that can help me to check if the account has G Suite. The main issue is that Google does not require authorization to get this information. ([API](URL 2. **The second step**  Get the list of free domain names. This one is a piece of cake. There is a list of domain name generator services which use the thesaurus, synonyms, antonyms, related words collocation to create the options for the domain names. These services automatically check the availability of the domain. Hence it took 10 min to generate a list of 3K IT-related domains (the keywords were ios, android, web dev, mobile development, and IT development). 3. **The third step**  Write the Python script to check if free domains are connected to G Suite ([link to the script](URL 4. **The fourth step**  Run the script. The result was impressive  1.87% (56 domains out of 3,000) were connected G Suite. This research did not aim any target market, and I did not pick the domains which were definitely in use. **Just think of it, every 2 available domains out of 100 have confidential information at their G Suits that can be stolen and potentially used by anyone.** Looking back on this background I decided to put a few notes to share with you: 1. **Pay for your domains**in time, since you can lose it with all the data you have. 2. If you decide to stop your business, **clean up all your data from the G Suite**. 3. **Change the email**connected with your other applications and tools before you kill the email from your G Suite or close these accounts. Remember that you are responsible for the protection of your data assets. We wish your business information were safe and secure and all that data breaches were just bad dreams. Always challenge security standards of the services you use for your business, even they are enterprise-level monsters like Google. We can trust no one with the security of our information.

47,cybersecurity,technology,Autotalks Launches the Worlds First Global V2X Solution Unifying DSRC and C-V2X on its Deployment-Ready Chipset,1,9g9a1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/9g9a1j/autotalks_launches_the_worlds_first_global_v2x/,2018-09-16 19:12:34," *By adding C-V2X to its existing 2nd* *generation automotive qualified chipset, Autotalks is paving the way to road safety everywhere* *September 5th, Kfar Netter, Israel*  Autotalks, global leader in V2X, announced the launch of the first ever global V2X solution. Autotalks deployment-ready, 2nd generation V2X (Vehicle to Everything) chipset is the only available solution capable of supporting both DSRC and C-V2X direct communications (PC5 protocol) at the highest security level. The chipset supports DSRC based on 802.11p/ITS-G5 standards and C-V2X based on 3GPP specifications. V2X communication is heading to mass-market adoption as the worlds largest OEMs announced intentions to equip their new car models with the technology. In recent years, V2X diverged into two different technologies, DSRC and C-V2X, with fundamentally different architectures, making it difficult to harmonize a single global solution. Autotalks, a leader and innovator in V2X, addresses the need for a global solution by equipping its mass-market ready 2nd generation chipsets with C-V2X in addition to their native support of DSRC. Autotalks brings a decade of wireless expertise, which led to an industry leading radio performance. This solid foundation of modem and radio specifically built and optimized for V2X, coupled with the companys deep knowledge of 3GPP standards and implementation, will result in superior C-V2X direct communications performance. While DSRC-based V2X is deployed in the US, Europe and Japan, C-V2X is gaining momentum in other regions. Autotalks chipsets were designed from the ground up to meet V2X market requirements and standards, which gives its C-V2X offering a head start to meet security, environmental, quality, thermal and other requirements. Delivering dual-mode (DSRC and C-V2X) functionality on existing automotive qualified AEC-Q100 grade 2 chipsets while leveraging production grade software and maintaining the present API, enables the shortest time to market for a global dual-mode V2X platform. Autotalks solution minimizes development, testing and certification efforts for a V2X system to be deployed anywhere, via a software-defined toggle between V2X technologies. Autotalks PC5 solution utilizes the globally defined 5.9 GHz ITS spectrum for V2X and is cellular network agnostic (no cellular SIM or coverage required, works without or with any 3G/4G/5G cellular modem). Separating V2X from the cellular Network Access Device (NAD) improves the cost-effectiveness of Telematic Control Unit (TCU) deployments. The separation of V2X from in-vehicle infotainment ensures that the purpose of the V2X system, which is giving drivers alerts of on-road dangers, is not compromised. Furthermore, V2X isolation combined with Autotalks recognized cybersecurity leadership, leads to a truly secure platform; a fundamental V2X requirement and necessity.

Bitcoin, Etherum, Litecoin, Dash, and Ripple are few of the common digital currencies prevailing in the year 2018. Their popularity and acceptance will continue to grow resulting in a rise in their value. With the growing trend of Internet of Things (IoT) these digital currencies will aid the smooth running of the interconnected devices, therefore they will gain preference over the physical monetary instruments. **Indulgence of Robots** The term Robots has been heard since ages but the incorporation of automated procedures through robots has just been witnessed from a few years ago. The transformation in the robotics is remarkable. A decade ago, there were programmed robots, dedicated to specific tasks only, but now Artificial Intelligence (AI) has taken over the procedures. Artificially intelligent robots have been a trend of 2018 and will continue to get advanced in the upcoming years. Consumer robots, military robots, and industrial robots are examples of the transformed robotics. The emergence of robots has also been witnessed in the medical field, they are being trained to execute surgeries and operations through their machine intelligence. **Deep Learning (DL)** Deep learning or Machine learning is directly associated with the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Concerned with algorithms called Artificial Neural Networks, DL is inspired by the functions and structure of the brain aimed to make revolutionary progress in AI and to improve learning algorithms to make them easier to use. Deep learning is immensely helpful to elevate artificial intelligence to the next level, and eventually making the operations of IoT better than ever. Deep learning is widely incorporated by the datacenters  Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. **Cyber Security** With unceasing progress in the technology and the adaption to the cutting-edge procedures, the cyber abusers and data offenders are also getting smart. Cybersecurity has become an essential element for the businesses with the increase in cloud computing and IoT. Foolproof security and ultimate data protection cannot be attained by 100% reliance on artificial intelligence. Therefore, human involvement will continue to exist to take decisions for which machines cannot be relied upon.

While Huawei has yet to reveal the full numbers for the six-month period, it also reported 14 percent growth in its operating margin, saying it anticipates a strong full-year 2018 result. Across its carrier business, Huawei said it is focused on 5G along with 4G LTE Advanced solutions, along with its intent-driven networks, cloud, data centre, and the Internet of Things (IoT) offerings. ""Ultimately, the shared goal is to help carriers future-proof their businesses by enabling all-cloud networks, connecting more people and things, and building out network infrastructure,"" Huawei explained. In its enterprise segment, Huawei said it will continue delivering IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, cloud, and data centre services to government and enterprise customers across energy, transportation, finance, and manufacturing in particular. ""By building open ICT platforms, OpenLabs, and platforms for global marketing, training, and services, Huawei is attracting more and more partners, enabling joint innovation, and building an ecosystem around joint customer services,"" the company added. During 2018, Huawei said it has so far launched EI Intelligent Twins, which enables AI ""practical application"" across industrial businesses; announced a network cloud server labelled C3ne, which it said improves performance to the tune of tens of millions of packets each second; and received Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) certification for Huawei Cloud, as well as Level 4 Classified Cybersecurity Protection with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security regulations. // Lastly, its consumer business saw the company launch the Huawei P20 smartphone series, the Huawei MacBook X Pro, and new GPU technology during the half. IDC this week also revealed that Huawei surpassed Apple in global smartphone shipments during Q2, with the Chinese tech giant shipping 54.2 million smartphones during the quarter while Apple shipped 41.3 million units. Samsung retained the top global spot, however, shipping 75.1 million units. Huawei had in April announced a full-year net profit of 47.5 billion yuan for 2017, up 22.7 percent from the 37.1 billion yuan reported a year earlier, attributing the result to its smartphones, enterprise solutions, and the digital transformation across industries. The Chinese networking giant brought in 603.6 billion yuan ($92.5 billion) revenue during the year, up 15.7 percent from 521.6 billion yuan in 2016. The use of Huawei technology in telecommunications infrastructure has been facing national security concerns in both the United States and in Australia, however. In response, Huawei's Australia CEO George Huang told ZDNet last month that the company handles no personal data when asked about recent calls for the technology giant to be barred from taking part in 5G rollouts due to concerns over sharing data with the Chinese government. ""Huawei doesn't own, doesn't manage, doesn't operate any data,"" Huang told ZDNet. ""Huawei is just a network equipment vendor to the operators. Operators, they manage, they operate the network. The application of Huawei is to support our customers -- that means operators -- to build the system to manage those things. ""Huawei is just a vendor of the pipeline."" Last month, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) also found several low-priority security issues in its annual evaluation of Huawei's Cyber Security Evaluation Centre. // However, the NCSC overall found Huawei to be providing ""unique, world-class cybersecurity expertise"". ""Due to areas of concern exposed through the proper functioning of the mitigation strategy and associated oversight mechanisms, the oversight board can provide only limited assurance that all risks to UK national security from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks have been sufficiently mitigated.

It struck me as interesting, and not getting a lot of attention with all the other headlines dominating news coverage sat the moment. Explored some headlines I could find and skimmed through the bill. Would be interested in other perspectives on the technology side. --- [Congress Just Signed ""The Four-Wheeled Patriot Act""](URL Zerohedge 9/8/2017 Leading argument from the article is, ""Whenever Congress does something unanimously (or nearly so) *you can rest assured its in their interests, not ours.* ... This is the law that exempts *automated* cars from the safety requirements that apply to *autonomous* cars  that is, the cars which are independent of government control and controlled by us."" Article is in regard to the ""Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in Vehicle Evolution Act"", or '[SELF DRIVE Act](URL Went looking for additional coverage from Ars Technica, Techdirt, similar sources but could not locate anything. News articles I've been able to locate don't go into depth of analysis I'd hope for. Skimming through seeing if I can find source documents and better assess the sensationalism in the article. --- Edit: Actual bill (headed for Senate) is here, [SELF DRIVE Act, H.R. 3388](URL Skimming through commenting on things of note. * Takes away rights from States to pass regulations regarding design, construction, or performance of automated vehicles * Cybersecurity of automated driving systems restricts manufacturers from selling products unless meeting certain standards. Item 3) is ""A process for limiting access to the self driving system"". This strikes me as providing the backing of federal regulatory power to limit the ability of product owners to work on their purchases equipment (see farmers struggle with John Deere, using copyright and locking down system in a way to make farmers dependent on service agreements. At what point do you no longer 'own' but only allowed to 'rent'?). Other end is that locking down access only makes the products less secure by barring independent security researchers from being able to audit the code, rip it apart and find security flaws that must be fixed. This system must be open to scrutiny or critical failings will exist causing harm far longer than necessary. Look to groups frequently finding creative flaws in vehicle automation systems to unlock. If there's a flaw, it will be found. Speed up that process. * Requires rear seat occupant alert system. Anyone know the intent here? Is this an existing requirement in vehicles on the market? Assuming possibly related to air bags in the rear seats of the vehicle. * Requires manufacturer develop a privacy plan available to the customer. Looks like offloading the burden of thought onto the creativity of the manufacturer to load everything into Terms of Service, signing away every right in return to use the product. The standard Facebook model of Terms and Conditions. Posted actual language below for review. Obligatory recommended viewing for the documentary ""[Terms and Conditions May Apply](URL &gt; (1) A written privacy plan with respect to the collection, use, sharing, and storage of information about vehicle owners or occupants collected by a highly automated vehicle, vehicle that performs partial driving automation, or automated driving system. Such policy shall include the following: &gt; (A) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the way that information about vehicle owners or occupants is collected, used, shared, or stored. &gt; (B) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the choices offered to vehicle owners or occupants regarding the collection, use, sharing, and storage of such information. &gt; (C) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the data minimization, de-identification, and retention of information about vehicle owners or occupants. &gt; (D) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to extending its privacy plan to the entities it shares such information with. * ""(4) If information about an occupant is anonymized or encrypted the manufacturer is not required to include the process or practices regarding that information in the privacy policy."" - So if a company uses the weakest forms of encryption, or are lazy about anonymizing data ""there, I deleted the names column! anonymized!"", there is no requirement to inform the public how this process is taking place. That will lead to information collected neither anonymized or secure. * Federal Trade Commission to provid enforcement of violations of the privacy policies. --- Returning to the Zerohedge article, it builds out from the argument that automated vehicles are a means to limit a publics freedom of movement by a government. Imagine a revolutionary force trying to operate in a country without vehicles under independent control, if the means of transportation can be immediately turned off by the government in power that fight ends quickly. On the less radical considerations we have the ongoing domestic spying program that has wrapped itself around western societies. There is a discomfort with this idea in that once that control has been mandated, how does one erode it and return to independent freedoms? At the core here what stands out to me is the big issue not getting enough attention - who owns data? What rights do individuals have to the data generated by their works or activities? Many of the abuses and mind numbingly stupid headlines we see today (see Equifax) are simplified by observing a publics **Right-to-Data**. **1) The individual gets final say regarding how their data is used, and shared, requiring explicit sign-off for those uses. 2) The individual holds the right to retract authorization for use of that data generated by them at any time.** These are modern privacy rights that really need to be fought over and amended into the US Constitution to observe the inherent rights of man in a modern age. Without this many of those already enshrined have been undermined and weakened, contorted into pretzels no longer recognizable. So who do we trust? Zerohedge has a point in the current environment there is no shortage of examples of US government pushing bills saying ""no, just trust us. we left these parts vague and there are concerns but we'll shore that up and add detail later."" then lawyers are employed to maximize the size of the trailer that can by driven through those massive holes in the language. Automated driving is an incredible technology to bring to the world, but there needs to be careful thought and be wary of these systems becoming mandated. Now is the time to be wary and guard against autonomous driving becoming somehow ""illegal"" or infrastructure non-existent. --- **TL;DR - This is a complex issue with significant pitfalls, bill is silent on many of these. In a time when political parties pull no punches trying to tear one another to pieces it's downright weird to get a unanimous vote on an issue. Who's getting screwed?**"

S.J.Res. 34 does not impact the current privacy protections that Americans enjoy, but rather prevents burdensome federal regulations from taking effect that I believe undermine economic growth and job opportunities for Alaskans and Americans. "" Below is the full text. Dear (BLANKED) Thank you for contacting me regarding S.J. Res. 34, a congressional resolution of disapproval of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) privacy order for telecommunication services. I appreciate your thoughts on this issue and welcome the opportunity to respond. On March 7, 2017, Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) introduced S.J. Res. 34 to repeal the broadband regulations issued by the FCC in October 2016. This order was implemented to impose restrictions on Internet service providers who, as a result of the 2015 Open Internet Order, were reclassified as a utility service. In approving the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC granted itself the authority to impose new rules to regulate the Internet under Title II of the Communications Act. Prior to the 2015 Open Internet Order, Internet service providers (ISPs) were regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) along with edge providers and the rest of the Internet ecosystem. Once the ISPs were reclassified under the 2015 Open Internet Order, they were placed under the jurisdiction of the FCC. During the open comment period on these rules, the FTC, along with many comments from the industry, requested that the FCC mirror the framework of the rules used by the FTC to govern the rest of the Internet ecosystem. The final version of the FCCs rules were much more burdensome and imposed prescriptive data restrictions on ISPs. I believe in protecting Americans fundamental right to privacy. For example, in 2015, I voted in favor of the USA Freedom Act, which replaced the outdated method of bulk data collection with a more targeted approach that enhances our national security and maintains the privacy of American citizens. I believe that piece of legislation protected Americans within the parameter of the law while safeguarding their privacy. Additionally, I opposed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, which focused on facilitating cyber threat information sharing among private entities and encouraged sharing of information with the government, because I did not believe it had sufficient privacy protections in place, and had the potential to violate the civil liberties and personal privacy rights of Americans. S.J.Res. 34 does not change the privacy protections that Americans currently possess. This resolution prevents the onerous regulations promulgated by the FCC from going into effect. Thus, this resolution allows the FCC the opportunity to change privacy rules to mirror those that govern the rest of the Internet community so long as they are not substantially similar to the current rules. This is important to allow innovation, competition, and economic growth to continue. Privacy is a fundamental right of all Americans, and I evaluate every piece of legislation to ensure that Americans privacy is not infringed upon. S.J.Res. 34 does not impact the current privacy protections that Americans enjoy, but rather prevents burdensome federal regulations from taking effect that I believe undermine economic growth and job opportunities for Alaskans and Americans. This is why on March 23, 2017, I voted in favor of S.J.Res. 34, which passed the Senate by a vote of 50-48. S.J.Res. 34 has been sent to the House of Representatives, where it awaits consideration. Thank you again for reaching out to me. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me or my staff. My office can be reached at 202-224-3004, or online at URL Sincerely, Dan Sullivan United States Senator "

59,cybersecurity,technology,A rather bland and generic response I received from Senator Warner (D-Va) explaining why he voted in favor of CISA.,4,3xw13a,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3xw13a/a_rather_bland_and_generic_response_i_received/,2015-12-23 09:22:18,"Dear &lt;scumbag&gt;, Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue. This bill aims to improve cybersecurity by encouraging private companies and the government to voluntarily share information about threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties. On October 27, I voted for and the Senate passed this bill by a bipartisan vote of 74-21. In April, the House passed two similar cybersecurity measures: H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act, and H.R. 1731, National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015. The House and Senate versions will now head to conference to agree on the final legislative language. Cyber-attacks are among the most critical threats our nation faces, jeopardizing both our national and economic security. Estimates indicate that cyberattacks and cybercrime account for between $24 and as much as $120 billion in economic and intellectual property loss per year in the U.S. Furthermore, cyberattacks against the nation's critical infrastructure have the potential to cause significant disruptions, and even deaths. The recent cyber-attack at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that compromised the personal information of at least 22 million individuals demonstrated the impact of this threat on Americans. As we have seen with attacks on Target, Neiman Marcus, Home Depot, banks like JPMorgan, and others, this problem is not limited to the government. Encouraging increased coordination and information sharing between companies and government is critical to better identify and protect against threats and is a good first step towards protecting our nation. I was very pleased that this legislation included two provisions I championed to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) authorities to protect civilian networks and to conduct threat assessments of critical cyber infrastructure affecting public health, the economy, or national security. The Federal Information Security Management Reform (FISMA Reform) Act of 2015, which was included in CISA, will bolster DHS's ability to protect federal civilian (.gov) networks. The second provision requires DHS to assess whether the government receives adequate information from those critical infrastructure entities whose failure in the aftermath of a cyber-attack would cause severe damage to national security capabilities. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I will continue to monitor cybersecurity issues as they develop and to look for further opportunities to strengthen our cybersecurity capabilities, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.

Why did it pass? It's easy to say that it passed because senators are in the pocket of corporations. But then it feels like we're fighting against corporations, who have mountains of money! We can't win that fight. **We have to understand why this bill was proposed, and address those corporate motivations.** We know the motivation. [This article](URL puts it plainly: &gt; CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (S. 754), will allow private companies to share cyber-threat data with the federal government, including personal user data, *in an effort to prevent cyberattacks, such as those on the scale of Target, Home Depot, and Sony.* (emphasis mine) CISA passed because US companies are tired of being constantly attacked online.

61,cybersecurity,technology,The Senate lost hundreds of thousands of faxes from citizens against CISA (proof),6067,3pjmb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3pjmb7/the_senate_lost_hundreds_of_thousands_of_faxes/,2015-10-21 08:05:17,"This week, the Senate is expected to vote on CISA, a controversial cybersecurity bill, without having seen hundreds of faxes from concerned citizens urging them to vote against this legislation. The faxes were sent via the **URL campaign, which criticized CISA as a mass surveillance bill in disguise. Unfortunately, once received by the Senates fax system, the majority of these faxes were lost or deleted, without ever reaching the offices of the senators. This is not ok. We don't care why or how, but the Senate must hear from their constituents if they are trying to communicate with them. That's their job and they should admit they failed to do so. **Full disclosure:** Im Jeff Lyon, CTO at Fight for the Future and the architect of the faxing system we used to send these faxes. Ill explain how we built the system, and how, with the help of a couple of friendly senators, we proved that the faxes were lost from the Senates system. 1. **We built a server capable of blanketing the Senate with faxes ([pic](URL Powered by 12 US Robotics faxmodems, 12 dedicated phone lines, and running out of my attic, this allowed us to send 20,000 faxes every day to the U.S. Senate 2. **Over 6 million faxes were generated by concerned citizens on URL We didnt expect such a mind blowing number, but we were sending them as fast as we could. We delivered over 400,000 of these faxes in August, and the system _seemed_ to be working beautifully. 3. **In September, we heard from Senator Ron Wydens office that they werent receiving our faxes.** We took the fax system offline to do some testing. Wydens office confirmed receiving only 743 of the 6,220 faxes we sent to them. 4. **We reached out to the [Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA)](URL to get more information about the problem** The Sergeant at Arms is responsible for Senate operations, including the telecommunication systems the Senate uses for receiving faxes. We explained the problem via phone and email, in the hopes that they could locate the missing faxes. 5. **Weeks later, SAA replied that they werent getting our faxes and not blocking them ([screenshot of email](URL This is when we knew something had gone very wrong. We have database records confirming the faxes were sent. I had been monitoring the performance of the faxing system throughout its operation, keeping an eye as the faxes were sent in realtime. Its kind of hard to ignore the screeching of dialup faxmodems, and modems dont screech unless theres another modem on the other end receiving data. I decided to ask my phone company for a detailed statement of our phone call history. 6. **In early October, I finally received an 860 page phone bill showing all our calls in August ([pic](URL | [another pic](URL The phone company initially sent a bill without our full call history, and it took weeks to get them to send me the full record. This showed hundreds of thousands of calls placed from the same 612 area code phone lines that the SAA claimed to have never received. To clarify, 11 out of 12 of our phone lines were 612 area code. These call records would not exist if the Senate fax lines didnt pick up our calls and receive data. **So why did this happen?** Right now, it doesnt really matter _why_ this happened. Something went wrong in the Senates faxing system, and whether it was a glitch, or something done on purpose to try to stop our faxes from going through, the end result is the same. The Senate was unable to consider timely communications from thousands of constituents, urging them to vote against CISA, a bill theyre debating right now. And disappointingly, we may never know the truth. Since the Senate is exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests, well never be able to look through their records to see what really happened. If Congress proceeds to a vote on CISA without considering the wishes of their constituents, our democracy has failed. Please help spread the word and call on Congress to acknowledge this problem before its too late. "
