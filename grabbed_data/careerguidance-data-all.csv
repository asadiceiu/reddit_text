0,vulnerability,careerguidance,Should I tell my employer about my mental illness?,1,hq5d0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hq5d0r/should_i_tell_my_employer_about_my_mental_illness/,2020-07-13 10:29:24,"Greetings! Its unprecedented times all around the world, and I hope you are taking care of both your mental and physical health, amid this horrible pandemic! So, like all the companies, my company has been working remotely for a couple of months now. While it hasn't been all smooth sailing, but this remote work has been a blessing in disguise for me personally, since I suffer from social anxiety. While working from my home, I have felt my most comfortable ever since I started my job (this is the first job in my career btw). Currently, I have been here approx 2 yrs, and tbh the level of anxiety decreased significantly for me during this work from home time. Now, out of the blue, owing to the decreasing number of cases in our country (they're still in thousands/day btw), the company announced mandatory return to office for all the employees. Ever since that news came to me, I have not been able to properly calm myself down. I am feeling anxious and restless (I am writing this at 5 am in the morning, due to not being able to sleep). Thus, I think that this is not something that will be beneficial for my mental health. Now, I have currently tried convincing my employer to let me work from home, though the reasons I stated were completely unrelated to my mental state, but equally valid like transportation issues. Unfortunately, it didn't work, and they asked me to come work from office anyways. Thus, now I am thinking, should I inform them about the real reason I am asking to continue working from home? I have read about it, and most people are suggesting against it, though some sources are also suggesting that informing them may yield some benefits. Thus, I find myself in this conundrum! Note: I have already informed my reporting manager about this, but it was mostly through conversation and no written piece of document has been communicated from my side regarding my condition. But since the times are unprecedented, thus, if you think desperate times call for desperate measures, please let me know! Thank you so much for reading through my (long &amp; boring :P) post. I have been thinking how to gracefully navigate through this situation, so as to avoid myself unnecessary vulnerability, or loss. Thus let me know what y'all think about this and how to approach the situation further! Thanks once again!!"
1,vulnerability,careerguidance,How do I share about myself authentically? How do I respond to personal without constantly trying to look good? How to be authentic but professional?,1,gxx2yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gxx2yh/how_do_i_share_about_myself_authentically_how_do/,2020-06-07 05:13:46,"These communications happens during internal interviews. Also during interactions that are key to my professional success. The feedback I got is correct. I do hesitate to share because honestly its IS complicated ... I get overwhelmed with which aspect of my life I need to share or not. And I end up giving a vanilla answer thats OBVIOUSLY a failed attempt to look good. For example the other day my boss asked me  so whats new?  and I answered talking about a new book I read. Because I figured she can relate to THAT. Sharing, vulnerability, authentic communication is a huge part of my company s culture and I am not even sure where to start improving in this so that I can move up. Other questions are  tell me about yourself  and  whats your plan this week/month/ year? Any suggestions, advice or reading material? I have no experience in the corporate culture. Thank you."
2,vulnerability,careerguidance,Non Compete Agreement Vulnerability?,2,hd0hpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hd0hpf/non_compete_agreement_vulnerability/,2020-06-21 14:13:10,"Hey Everyone! I recently received a job offer which I'm very excited about, but I have one concern. I was forwarded some paperwork with a non-compete agreement. I know these are pretty normal but this one seems super broad. This non compete document states I can't work for a competitor for a year after voluntary or involuntary termination. What gets me is that it's not specific. It identifies a competitor as any entity working in any relevant part of this business (not just my area of work). It's not specific to a certain geographical area and defines the applicable area as any location where the company is located or competes (this company could compete all over the country). The non compete work content applies to the group I would work in as well as other areas of the company that I perform services too (I assume I could randomly perform services for several areas of the company). My concern is that if I end up leaving this company this document could be highly restrictive of getting a new job, if enforceable. It seems like it's left open enough that many other position could be argued to be a competitor. I brought this up and asked if the document was negotiable but was told no. Am I being paranoid, or is this normal for a non compete? I've also read that many non-competes are difficult to enforce anyhow, but I'd appreciate any opinions/general feedback."

So I work for a company of about 150 people in the biotech industry. I have a really good relationship with my boss: we have meetings biweekly and Im excelling in all of my projects and tasks. Now about the mental health: Im a very introverted person, so its hard for me to open up to my coworkers and I dont have a coworker best friend who I can vent to and be open with. In fact, no body at my company knows that I have anxiety and that Ive been diagnosed with depression in the past. I am currently on medication, but thats about the only therapy Im taking. The only people who I trust with my mental health is my family and boyfriend. I once was having a week where I was feeling down, and I mentioned to him about without going in much detail and he seemed to support me. However, these part few weeks my anxiety has flared up and I have been developing some depressive symptoms too. It hasnt interfered with my work too much, but I feel very off working 40 hours a week when my mood and self esteem is very low. I want to talk to my boss this week about how Ive been struggling personally, but without going into much detail. However, I dont know how mental health is viewed at my company and I worry about possibly being fired if I show my vulnerability and tell my boss that I have a mental health issue. Does anybody have any advice about how I approach this? How do I talk to my boss about my well being without being too personal? I also read some articles about how to deal with mental health at work, and I was thinking about possibly creating a confidential, mental health support group since there isnt any sort of wellness support at my work. How should I approach this? For those of you have spoken up about by your mental health, what was your experience? Thanks!!!"

I hated every minute of college and that reflected on my grades. I managed like mid 2.0s. While in school I got my first job doing research with professors in different departments, but eventually dropped out because I just couldn't take it anymore. I didn't want to waste time so couple of months later I started a program at a community college for information system security. After second year I started remote work with a local cyber security company doing pen-testing, vulnerability assessments, IAM architecture review, a lot of technical work. Fast forward 6 months I was nearing the end of my third year into my program. After completing my third year into my program I landed a full time job with another cyber security company. This time not in a technical role, but in sales. I'm now a SDR selling SaaS software and security related services to enterprise businesses. As days go by I'm losing interest in my job and in my field. I never really had a passion for cyber security. Everyday it gets harder to pick up my phone and start dialing. I thought maybe it's because of the stress that comes with sales, but I don't even want to go back to a technical role like my previous job. Every day I get on the subway in the same cart with the same people at the same time and gets me thinking, is this it? Is my life going to be like this going forward for the next 30-40 years? I've always had an interest in high finance and wanted to work as a trader one day, but I don't even know how to get there. I could go back to school, but I don't know if I want to do that when I just finished paying off my student loans of 40k. Any advice would be appreciated."
6,vulnerability,careerguidance,"With my Software Engineering/Management/IT experiences, how should leverage that to find another position?",2,cw8vtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cw8vtz/with_my_software_engineeringmanagementit/,2019-08-28 05:00:56,"TLDR at the bottom. I apologize for the length, but I needed to get it all out there. I took multiple CCND (Cisco Certified Networking Discovery) classes in high school, but I started my web development journey back in June of 2013 by freelancing. I had three clients and not much money coming in, but it familiarized me with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) and Joomla and WordPress. This went on for about nine months. I found my first official web development position working for a small (20-ish) marketing company that doubled as a lead generation company so I built and optimized custom WordPress client and leadgen sites using Genesis. While there, my direct supervisor/the current CTO left. In order to increase my experience and pay I took up whatever responsibilities I could which included managing a three dev team (two were outsourced and one in-house), handling ALL IT requests (network troubleshooting, O365 Exchange and other software provisioning, VoIP, and a bunch of other run-of-the-mill troubleshooting), interfacing with clients, planning projects, building new leadgen verticals using new lead distribution software, and providing technical guidance. All of that was on top of doing the web dev for marketing and leadgen. I built a small 4-seat call center while I was there, too, by myself with no training or guidance on how to properly subnet, set up a server for Active Directory, or work the five9 software. I learned a TON from that company, multiple AWS services like EC2 and Route53, OOP PHP, SASS, parallax web design, you name it. The straw the broke the camel's back though, was the C-level execs told me they wanted me on as a partner, their new CTO, but they didn't follow through and basically gaslighted me for a year. I was there for four years in total; I never made more than 48k and my official titles were Web Developer then Lead Web Developer. Moving on to the next company -- which was a local, but large, newspaper-- was wonderful! I started as a Web Developer. I interfaced with internal customers, built WP websites, integrated with APs voting API, and got some experience with Laravel as well. Overall it was a normal dev life until a position opened up for a DevOps Manager. I let my direct supervisor know (she was the VP or Marketing &amp; Technology) I was interested and she said she didn't think my peers would follow me. I talked to them one by one and asked them for permission to apply for the position and what their thoughts were on it. Since they were good with it, I applied and it surprised the VP (and me) that all the devs made me their recommendation. I was in that position for a couple months until a new publisher was hired and I found out his intentions were to reduce technology costs as much as possible by moving all of our in-house services to third-parties. Since I was new to the position, and the dev team was at least holding ground before I got the position, I knew I would be the first to go. The VP left as well for the exact same reason. I was there for a little over a year, started at 48k and moved up to 65k with the new position. So I ended up getting in contact with the VP of my previous company and found out she was the CTO of a new-ish media company (50-60 employees) and she wanted me on as a ""Senior Software Engineer"" contractor with the full intention to bring me on full time (they're in another state and she says they can't put me on full-time until next year). I contract at 56/hr which is about 116k/yr if you're working full-time hours, which I am. The problem though, is I'm barely doing any engineering work. I managed a team for a bit, helped set up their severely lacking IT infrastructure, some reverse engineering here and there for documentation, and just a tiny bit of engineering. Right now, I'm basically doing project management and executive assistance for the CTO. What I'm doing doesn't match the job description at all and I know I'm being taken advantage of. I want out. I have a baby girl due in October and I can't risk the CTO deciding she wants to leverage my vulnerability. I also don't want to commit career suicide by staying in a position that's so haphazard for too long. I want two things in a job: money, and stability. I study on my own, and have been for my entire career so I don't care about if a company provides training or growth via OTJ. My problem though, is I'm not the greatest software engineer, I'm not the greatest manager or project manager, I'm a badass jack of all trades. I need 75k **at least** to support my lifestyle, wife, and first baby, and honestly, I don't care *what* position it is as long as it has a well defined role I can settle into. What pieces of advice do you have for me? How should leverage my experiences to look for a new position? &amp;#x200B; TLDR: I've learned a ton of webdev, management, and IT stuff, but my learning hasn't been focused enough to get a specialized position at 75k/yr. How should I go about looking for a new position"

My counterpart is their ""lead"" and is pretty green as well. Help Desk covers 7am to 5:30pm/6:00pm. 2 out of the 3 Help Desk people arrive at 7/7:30am and are gone by 4:30pm. My counterpart arrives around 7:30/8:00am and leaves most days by 4:30pm. I'm here most days 8:30am to 5:30pm. My role is less involved with the day-to-day support and desk stuff, but moreso focusing on security, infrastructure, and development of it. My boss has set the expectation that he wants me to be around to ""help cover in case anything blows up."" In the event that he is gone, his right-hand person is gone, and my counterpart are gone. I've mostly been on projects during my time here. I feel like that if I get work done for the day and there is nothing more to do, or my brain is completely fried and I can't do anymore, I should have the freedom to leave for the day (within reason). Why should I have to sit here with the other Help Desk person until 5:30 pm monitoring a production environment in case it blows up? It hasn't in the past, why would it now? We have monitoring systems in place (which I built from the ground up), I'm given a cell phone and a laptop with secure remote access. But every time I want to dip out early for a change, or even work remotely my boss has to ""talk about it"" and gives me the expectations talk again. He has said in the past that ""As long as you get your work done I'm okay with that."" So why would this be an issue? What if I want to finish my work for the day and leave early on a whim and enjoy the rest of the day outside? I work in a basement by the way. No windows. It sucks. Not only am I expected to be here, not able to work remotely unless it's weekend/afterhours work that is outside of my normal 40 (more like 50-60) hour work week, I also am expected to keep an eye on my phone in case the Help Desk calls me after hours or an alert gets sent from our monitoring system. I am essentially on-call. I don't feel like I am compensated for this at all. I make about $64k/yr before taxes. I'm responsible for all of our switching, routing, server infrastructure, security reports, vulnerability management, web usage, virtual infrastructure, and our VoIP/UC environment. I feel like I should be making double what I do some days. 1) How can I be afforded more 'freedoms' as a salaried employee? 2) Is it wrong of me to feel well under-compensated for the amount of my responsibilities? Am I screwed? 3) Are my expectations too high? **TL;DR:** Tired of feeling like a grunt. Looking for more freedoms, more pay, growth into management."

When I was in college, cybersecurity used to be a hobby, but now that I'm working in it I just hate it (maybe because the job isn't really cybersecurity, but sales). I feel like I'm in a really privileged position because: a) I have a job during the pandemic; b) pay isn't that bad (not great either, but it's reasonable); c) I have great flexibility for work hours. But I feel completely empty inside (to the point I honestly think I'm depressed). There's nothing I look forward in my job. I don't like anything I do. I also don't know what else I would like to do. Is this it? Can a job be pleasurable or should I treat it just like a money-making thing?"

I also like circuitry and hands-on engineering. I have experience in all these things and biomedical robotics also interests me a LOT (I would need ECE or CE program probably for this since I don't want to apply to a major like BME or EE because they have very limited career opportunities) however that's the only thing I don't have experience in. In CS I'm not really interested in how programming languages work and the computational math behind it but in CE I'm not interested in building computers either. I'm scared that if I do CS I'll just be stuck coding which I can do but I don't think I would enjoy only that. In CE I'm scared I will get stuck in too much of the building hardware side and not get to explore my Machine Learning and AI interests. I have some schools I want to apply to rn like UMD, Georgia Tech, Cornell, some other ivies but I'm still looking for schools which is hard because I'm not fully sure about the major.

This of course depends on which bachelors degree you have but lets assume its akin to either Economics or Business. I ask because lately Ive been pondering going back to school part-time and getting an MBA or MS in Business Analytics, Statistics, Data Science or Operations Research. However, at least for the first 4 degrees, Im not sure the time spent (roughly 2-3 years going part-time) would allow for either a) a significant ROI or b) would greatly improve someones job security/job options. What do you think? I think perhaps the only possible attainable degree for someone without an engineering background that would significantly improve both salary expectations and job security is Cybersecurity or Finance. Even for Data Science or a 2-year MS involving computer programming of some sort may not make you more marketable than someone with a 4-year BS."

I changed my major 7 times in college, and have considered going back to school a thousand times since getting my BA.

I've considered getting my electrician's certificate, or making and selling art (I took a class for fun after graduating college, really enjoyed it, have sold a few small things). I currently work two jobs, (usually working every day of the week, often 12+ hr days) because I got bored with the first one (which I've been at for three years in November, a record for me!), and I am involved in various community and non-profit boards and interest groups.

I was also told I would be moved into a different position (Information Technology Management INFOSEC). I took and passed the exam last year, and am currently being told I don't actually need a Security clearance to perform the role, and my boss keeps telling me he is working on moving me over into the new position title. I have had multiple conversations with him talking about how not only is the security clearance needed, but the position title will help me in the future since it fits what I want to do. It has been almost a year and a half since I met the requirements they asked, and havent even started either process, while they just recently hired a recent graduate and started his process for a security clearance (computer engineer).

I keep coming back to criminology, seems interesting enough to deal with, but it seems like a jobless degree with no proper transferable skills or experience. I've considered law (but it's too competitive and if I already don't enjoy reading books nor writing, let alone for 4+ years).

I don't know if working in retail or as a waiter would interest me enough, or even lend me a proper and permanent job. I don't have the patience to be a teacher of any kind. I'm not a very hands-on person, so trades isn't the answer, unfortunately. * extras: the fact that I'd wish to immigrate further constricts my career prospects; and the critical skills/occupation shortages lists don't help either. I've done career/personality tests, but to no avail. hell, I've even considered photography, but I've never had any passion for it, and most probably it won't change.

I've been giving much thought as to what I want to pursue in college and what career path I want to go down upon. I've thought that IT would be the sector for me these last few years as I've been involved in it for a very long time and I am in a specialized cybersecurity program at my school. However when I look at the people on my team, I am the least qualified by far. Though I am better off that most others in my pathway at my school, I don't see myself creating side projects, working on coding away from school, etc etc. To start such things seems like such a chore. I have learned coding and done my own stuff outside of school, but I haven't done anything too major and I don't find myself waking up in the morning and saying ""Let's code today"". I simply don't see myself coding the rest of my life. I do enjoy it and computers, and cybersecurity and such but I want my work to be play. Since March I decided to take up the stock market and see if I can make any money there (I've made money in various entrepreneurial efforts and wanted to try something new). I've found the markets fascinating and economics just APPEAL to me. I've literally binged economics videos and am engrossed in the markets and business on a daily basis. Business has always been my thing since the beginning, and I guess that is why finance, markets, economics appeals to me so much. I began to delve into career paths in Finance and what a Finance degree can land you. I was disheartened to see many people actually say it's very very hard to get a nice high paying financial job, and some people with financial degrees end up car salesmen, or grocery store managers. My goal is to land a pretty good entry job and end up making six figures easily several years after college. The good jobs like Investment Banking required 60-90 hours a week all throughout your 20s, for the same salary a software engineer could get for half the hours. I want to get married in my 20s and live life to the fullest with financial freedom instead of slaving long hours. Investment Banking is also very very hard to get into, most people get in because they go to an Ivy or they have a good network. It's a pretty replaceable job as long as you put in hours. I'm sure with my entrepreneurial spirit I will start a business somewhere down the line, but obviously that easily could fail and I need a job in the first place for some sort of capital or experience. I began to wonder if I should go into software engineering/cybersecurity and start trading on the markets on the side, and maybe somewhere down the line I could start a financial consulting company or something of the likes. What are your guy's opinions, and could anyone with a finance degree let me know how the sector is like? (Good high paying jobs with good work/life, etc etc). &amp;#x200B; TLDR: I need ideas as to whether to pursue a career in finance/business or IT, and what careers I could potentially look at.

I should also mention my intentions of immigrating, by the way. considering this, do you have any insights to share? if you want to encourage/diss either one of those subjects, please do! as well as sharing experiences you've had regarding them. thanks!"
38,cybersecurity,careerguidance,Should I go into Game Development?,1,hviwus,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hviwus/should_i_go_into_game_development/,2020-07-22 09:54:57,"Hey everyone. I apologize in advance for the novel-length post. As the title indicates, I am interested in Video Game Development. I always have been, but it never really seemed realistic. Up until about two years ago, I didn't really know much about computers. Then I went to school for Web Development and learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then I switched degrees and learned Database Build and Implementation (SQL, Oracle, C#). Now I'm finishing my Bachelor in CyberSecurity. I like to think that I now have a very broad field of most things to do with computers and IT. I have a job as a Database Analyst, and I'm hoping to switch over into the Information Security sector of my company... at least I was until a few days ago. &amp;#x200B; My fiance was complaining about her job and I gave her the advice to pursue graphic design, something that I know isn't very lucrative, but it's something she loves. Then she turned the question around on me and told me to do something I love. I don't really love CyberSecurity or Databases, or honestly anything I've tried so far, but I am very good at it and I am a fast learner. I've taught myself \~6 programming languages and I learned several in school, and I am fully certain I could learn C++ and be damn good at it. When I thought about what I *wanted* to do, the only thing that came to mind was video game development. I love video games, and I have always wanted to make one. The only part of my job I like is the problems I solve and the challenges I can handle that others haven't been able to. I don't mind the programming part either. All of these I believe are the main things that will translate into the Video Game Dev field. &amp;#x200B; There are a few things holding me back and I hope you guys can help me with them. First, I don't know if its even possible for me to get a job without a degree in Game Dev. I will have a degree in CyberSecurity, and experience programming, and I will teach myself C++ and get any certifications I can.But is that enough? I know the field is a little oversaturated, but is it still realistic to find a job there? I don't mind starting in an entry-level job, I just want to get in. Second, do they make decent money? By decent I mean &gt;= $60k/year. Third, I've heard that the field is very intense and can lead to a lot of burnout. Does anyone know how bad it is? I don't mind working up to \~55 hours a week, but I know more than that will hurt my sanity. Do the companies have bad culture? I know a lot of bigger copmanies (CD Projekt Red is one example) are attempting to change the whole ""last few weeks of rushing the game"" insanity where devs work non-stop. Last but not least, does anyone have any advice? Anything anyone has to say will be appreciated. Thank you guys for reading, feel free to answer any of the questions or none. Hope everyone has a good day."

I'm currently an IT major and I am starting to despise all of my courses. However, I want to become a cybersecurity analyst and I feel as though this career would be the right fit for me. I also came across the data analyst / data scientist occupations. I'm still iffy on those two but cybersecurity has always had a special place in my heart since I love security and keeping users' information safe from nefarious people. Currently, I'm a rising junior so I feel like I have a little bit of leeway when it comes to switching my major; I just have to be strategic with my upcoming courses to graduate in a timely manner. I'm also at risk for getting kicked out of all tech majors at my school because of my unsuccessful attempts in my overall courses. If I fail or withdraw from another course, I'm done with being a tech major. So, this is where my question is really stemming from. I always loved math and always thought it was so beautiful how everything can be calculated and have one solution. It's so exact, but I also enjoy creativity and making something my own. The reason why I'm not a math major now is because of a difficult course called Computer Science 1 that I cannot pass for my life. The professors teach it horribly and its know at my school for being the weed out course for cs and it majors. Im currently taking it right now for the second time and my grade terrible. I tried YouTube, free courses online, my cousin that is in the tech industry, office hours, you name it. Plus, if I fail this course again, I'm kicked out of my major. With all that being said, a stat major would be the best fit for me. My main concern is if I gain a statistics degree, could I be able to become a cybersecurity analyst and climb the latter to become a cybersecurity architect or engineer? Thank you so much for your time! **Sorry for the long response, I wanted to lay everything out to receive the best type of answers possible."

I don't want this to be a sob story so one thing led to another and it ended up with me being placed in a college I did not fully choose. College did not go too well (got a 3.5 gpa though) as I had no life direction in life and I hated every minute of it. When I was forced to choose a major I choose history primarily because my school had so few majors and I was drawn to all the wars my father told me about when I was growing up. Because I had no motivation or plan I did not land a job. My father recommended that I get a cybersecurity degree from a community college (which I am currently enrolled in I start in August) however I am awful at programming. My mother thinks I should get a job in Market research or a related field before august or get another associate's degree however I don't know what kind of degree to get. I found a job listing for a real estate lead generator (pays hourly and commission) from a verified company but I'm worried it is too good to be true. To summarize I let depression from being lost after throwing away my military officer goals get in the way of me choosing a great college and having an amazing college experience and I don't know how to get my life back on track.

A buddy of mine has been working on an associates in IT (cybersecurity), so I chatted with him about it. It sounded interesting and the career prospects look promising after a cursory review online. I've even seen some all-online degree offerings that I could complete while teaching, and would have me finish in about 2 years. I'm a pretty cerebral, reflective person who can work alone or in groups. I am organized, have great ""customer service skills"" (a skill I learned from working as a teacher), and I consider myself to know more about technology than the average teacher (took a coding class in college and know a little JavaScript). I'm very analytical, I like solving problems, do best working ""behind the scenes"" and not out in front, and prefer to work normal ""working hours"" (M-F, 8-5ish). Sometimes I can be obsessive to a fault. I do not mind giving up my summers and other teacher benefits for this change if it means I'm happier day-to-day. I'm particularly excited to be potentially work for a large organization as an IT specialist. My wife is an ICU nurse at a large hospital, and tells me they are always hiring IT people. I would love to be one of them. I do have a child and another on the way, which certainly will add a challenge to online school. So my question really is: how is it working in IT? Based on what I described above, do you think I would be a good fit? Anyone with knowledge of IT or IT-related associates/bachelor's degrees is welcome to chime in. Nothing is set in stone at this point, but I do want to make sure whatever I decide is something I could do for the next 10-20 years and be happy. I'm not looking to make a major change after this.

I've already taught myself to code and feel fairly confident in my abilities. I can create apps, websites, etc without too much trouble. That being said, I'm having some serious difficulties passing my math classes. In my current class, which is relatively low-level, I have no understanding of the materials and am on the path to failing right now. I spend all the time studying I possibly can but I just *can't* comprehend the materials. It just eludes me. Even if I do pass this class, I have at least one more higher-level course that I'll also have to pass and I genuinely just don't know if I'll be able to grok it. So because of that, I've been considering switching my major to a less math-intensive one. I'm not sure if I should take a ""safer"" route and go with Marketing, Finance, Psychology, etc. Or if I should try to go ahead an pursue one of the slightly less reputable majors like Cyber Sec of Software Dev and Security. My primary concern is safety. My reasoning is that if I get a degree in, say, finance. Then I would have options open to me both in Finance *and* as software due to my self-taught skills. Whereas, if I do go with say, the Software Development degree, I'm restricting myself to software dev and will have a weaker degree than most of my peers with Comp Sci degrees. Below if a list of every major that has weaker math requirements than Computer Science, and therefore are a viable option for me to switch to.

We also have to wait 3 years at least between promotions and we only get about 3000 extra for each promotion. I've been looking at switching to a career in Information Technology, starting in help desk or system administration. I have 3 certs already. My dilemma is I'm debating whether to do IT in the army/air force, or just apply for whatever jobs I can find in different cities. I've found a few in the town I live, but they the pay around 14 an hour, I'm still thinking of taking it though what do you all think? That was one of the main reasons I was wanting to join the military was because of the lack of jobs/opportunity especially because I live in a smaller town. Even when I was looking at bigger cities the salaries didn't equal the cost of living. It was hard to find a job before and it got even harder with the coronavirus. A few people where telling me the military would give me the experience, you have better benefits/housing, and you're guaranteed a job and don't have to worry about getting fired. However, is it worth having less control over your life, and it does seem like the tech the military uses would be vastly different from the private sector. The military also seems like it could be like the fire department in same ways like waiting a long time for promotions, a lot of office politics, and bureaucracy that isn't as open to change as the private sector etc. t seems like the private sector is more focus on software development, vlans, servicenow, and salesforce; whereas, the military is focus on cybersecurity and a lot of dubious certifications that require years of experience just to know the info much less pass the test like Certified Ethical Hacker, GIAC, SANS, CISSP etc. What do you all think between these 3 options what is best considering my situation.

Yes, I know that there is another reddit post with the exact same topic but I havent gotten the satisfactory answer Ive been looking for. Even though Im not good at math or programming, I still love it and dont mind putting in the work. I have always dreamed of being an influential tech CEO like Steve Jobs or someone developing a really famous program or videogame. However, I worry about the job market. A lot of people tell me that there are so many people (some without even a college degree) going into Computer Science and theyve instilled this fear of being 40 and laid off. Another concern is the unavoidable lifestyle Im going to have for the rest of my life. Basically, sitting on the computer for hours on end and possibly dying early. The tech world sounds convincing , but will it be worth it in the long run? Is the idea of making 75k-100k right after college and the fun environment of software engineering, CyberSecurity, etc exaggerated? Its a deep passion but it seems like it will be tough for me considering how competitive it is and how I dont share the same traits as other tech people. I like debating , writing, and researching. Im also a great memorizer rather than an engineering mind, so I feel like being a lawyer is also a really good match because isnt there a heavy emphasis on things such as remembering precedents? The only downside is that I find reading a chore and Ill be spending more time and money into education than if I went into CS, but the job security and salary is much more rewarding than any tech field (take that with a grain of salt, I might be ignoring a bunch of factors). Just like tech, I see myself as someone changing the world and as someone all kinds of people look up to. Yes, I probably wont be in the Supreme Court, but the idea of someones fate on your hands, fighting for what is right, making connections, and influencing powerful people is just as convincing as going into CS. Being a lawyer seems to fit more with my strengths and interests, but Ive loved computers and programming ever since I was a kid. What do you guys think is the right path for me?"

I am eager to establish myself in one of the subsets in IT predominately Cyber security. I am currently looking for advice on 3 options for studying cyber security. One is an MS in Cybersecurity from NJIT which will take 2 years of full-time study. Before you comment I am ineligible for these M.S. programs please know that they have a bridge program! Another is a boot camp for 10 months at NJIT which cost \~13,000 dollars. Lastly, since I am unemployed Workforce development will allow me to take an online 330 hour course which usually runs slightly above $4,000 for free. I have attached links for all 3 programs. I would love it if someone gave me advice on which path would lead to a stable career in Cybersecurity.

I do have a potential opportunity to work in the Cybersecurity field at my company and could as more of training for my career. I never seem to think about it like a passion I have such as bowling and automobiles or even general technology. I REALLY enjoy driving but I'm not sure about a trucking career because it's more of a life than a career. I also enjoy mindless, repetitive, meticulous tasks also. I'm also really number or stat driven, I'm always interested in random numbers (but I'm terrible at math) whether it pertains to bowling stats, car stats, money, etc. I definitely plan to pursue as much of a career (side-career) in bowling as I can, and I'm not sure what kind of careers automobiles contain (definitely NOT mechanic).

I graduated high school back in 2018. In high school I participated in speech and debate, an activity that I enjoyed. I liked researching current events, accumulating evidence, and generating arguments. After hearing an alumni talk about his experience in the Intelligence Studies program at Mercyhurst, I thought that was what I wanted to do; intelligence gathering and counterterrorism. For a number of reasons, not the least of which were financial, I enrolled at the local community college. Full ride, everything paid for. I haven't spend a dime out of my own pocket for school these last two years which is pretty great. I will graduate in May, and I should end with an overall GPA of 3.9 and a major GPA of 4.0. I'm majoring in cybersecurity, as it was a brand new program for the school at the time and was the closest thing to what I wanted to do; credits would transfer and some of the skills and information I was learning would translate. I had just built my own computer and had a blast doing it. I love to repair electronics. I had no issue going into IT to start. As long as I wasn't stuck doing help desk and basic tech support in 10 years. The problem is I don't want to do IS anymore. I don't want to work in government. I don't want that kind of responsibility, and although it may be an irrational fear, I don't want to endanger my future family in any way and I feel like working in that area could place a target on my back. Whatever the case, IS no longer interests me. But it's not like I'm in love with cyber either. I'm not too great a programmer and I don't like doing it. I can tolerate it but I do not want to sit in a cubicle all day typing away at a keyboard. I gravitate more toward the physical side of the field; social engineering, hardware, policy, that kind of stuff. I've befriended a few professors and people working in the field. They're more on the business side of things, and one runs his own consulting firm (not a consistent enough position for my liking). He got his Master's degree from Western Governor's and gave it a good recommendation so that definitely put WGU on my radar. I'm working on lining up an internship this summer which will finally give me some field experience. I don't have any certs but I plan on starting some relatively soon; the entry-level ones shouldn't be too difficult to knock out. I still don't know exactly what I want to do in cyber. But that's the path I'm on and I don't see any other options for me. The only thing I've ever been passionate about is football and my dream job is to work in an NFL front office, but I obviously can't really go to school for that. I've been a sports writer for 4+ years now and worked for Pro Football Focus, an analytics firm, this past season so I am chasing my dream on the side. WGU was my plan heading into my last semester; it's online (I place very little value on the whole ""campus experience"" - the degree is what matters to me), very affordable, and has the potential to be extremely quick. It would allow me to earn a bachelor's - the degree is Cybersecurity and Information Assurance - while interning and gaining experience, earning certs, and continuing my football stuff on the side. But my parents don't love the idea. They seem to want me to to go to a university. They think I should be ""setting my sights higher"" than WGU. I don't necessarily disagree, but I also feel like WGU is the most efficient option for me. Not to mention it's actually affordable. I had a 33 ACT in high school along with a 3.92 GPA but that's pretty much worthless now, and as far as I'm aware scholarships for transfer students are basically nonexistent. So basically I don't really know what to do right now. You might say it's my life and I shouldn't let my parents make this choice for me, which is true, but I value their opinion highly and I would like this to be a collaborative decisions, especially since they're the ones that will be footing most of the bill. I'm also interesting in getting a bachelor's in data analytics - I don't like math but I know how useful that degree could potentially be, in many different fields including sports. I don't enjoy school at all, whether it's in person or online, but I do anticipate eventually getting my master's degree. I know I'm smart enough and I can handle the workload. I'm just in a tough spot right now and honestly I'm feeling pretty discouraged. I would really appreciate some guidance and I will do my best to answer any questions. Any university and/or program suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

I was involved in a horrific incident in which multiple children burned to death right in front of me. Been out of the game for a bit trying to keep myself together. Now I feel like I can finally get out of the house and move on. I'm looking for a new career that I can use my skills as a law enforcement officer. I was a cop for about 3 years in a very busy department (one of the most violent cities in the US). I was looking to get into cybersecurity but that seems to be a pretty hard field to get into. So now I'm just looking to see if anyone has any ideas of what I should do now. I'm not going back into local police work. I might do federal but not even sure where to start with that or if I could even stomach it. So I'm open to any suggestion that anyone has for what I could change into. Any suggestions would be great. Thank you."

I want to beef up my package a bit before applying, and I already have a plan of trying to get as much applicable training through my department as I can, but am thinking of going back to school to help show I am not in fact a dummy. Currently looking into certificates and associates degrees, as I cant take out more student loans for this for a Masters. So the real question is this: would it be better to get a certificate in something a little more specialized (Cybersecurity, Security Management, Forensic Investigation, etc) or a more generalized associates in something completely different than my currently held BS (IT, Finance, appropriate foreign language)??"

Something about them, specifically, I enjoy learning so much and the most fun Ive ever had was learning how to code Python on Linux while simultaneously messing around with a repository of live malwares. Cyber security just feels so intriguing and fun to me. However, I also enjoy economics and find the study to be captivating as well. My final path or interest Ive considered would be military/law enforcement service.

I'm currently working as a cybersecurity specialist at Intel. You know I deal with embedded low-level stuff. I see that I could grow and develop faster. Lastly, when I was at work and I was filling some excel stuff I've asked myself, what am I doing? I felt like I'm wasting my life there, because of the model of work, cooperation with my workmates and how specific it is. I think that if I stay there I'll have a problem to change my job later. Working there generally is not bad, sometimes (but not very often), I have very challenging and interesting tasks, but mainly I perform boring stuff which I don't understand as good as I want. So, I've been on an interview in Lufthansa, they accepted my application. Ok, probably you'll tell me I should be happy about that, but I'm really confused. If it comes to money salary is similar, Intel gives more benefits, but it doesn't matter at all. Nonetheless, the things which I'd deal with there have more demand in the market compared to the stuff which you can do at Intel (but if you are good at it you'll not have a problem with finding some job I think.) Funny thing is that I don't have a lot of experience in both embedded security and web application security, but I think that I know more about web applications security.

The Good: 1. I'm smart (I like to think so) 2. Work at a big name company (first job out of college 25 years ago) 3. nice guy, honorable (lol like that helps with a career) The Bad: 1. I've always done MY job only (I do the tasks assigned to me, I don't go seeking out more work, this is bad, very bad... I realize that now, 20 years too late though) 2. I am quiet/introverted/socially anxious (I'm polite when spoken to, but I'm not a very outgoing person so my network is nil) 3. Due to the fact I've been at my company for so long and never changed jobs my salary is not very high. I estimate it to be around the salary of someone who is a go getter who worked around 6 years and just jumped to a new company and got a bump. 4. I am in a technical field that is fast becoming obsolete and/or getting off shored. Think of me as a Windows 95 admin but now everyone is using windows 10 which is very tightly connected to the cloud while Win95 has limited internet technology. So I know the basics of windows, but I don't know the new stuff which is what everyone is looking for (the cloud integration). And the new stuff is completely foreign (win95 barely had dial up let alone gigabyte upload speeds that we do now). I'm in my mid 40s and I just realized (10 years too late) that I cannot continue here due to bad #4, bad #3 is tolerable. BUT I feel I cannot get a new job because of bad #4, I don't have the latest skills that is being sought in my field and because of bad #1 and #2, I don't have the management skills, ability to lead meetings, workshops, design things, etc because I've never been involved with that and was always just given tasks to do. (and never sought out more which was totally my fault) Think of my job as an off shore guy - just given tasks to do, not part of the design or analysis, just a DOer rather than a planner/innovator. It is true that industry related skills might not transfer over but it doesn't matter as much if you have the management/lead/planning skills, those are generic and can carry over. (and I don't have it) But I feel that I have to move ASAP because as I get even older it will just be harder and harder to get a new job because expectations of my skills will just get higher. (WTF! how did you work 25 years and not gain the ability to lead meetings or manage a timeline?) Due to bad #3 I don't mind going in as a experienced entry level (the next level above recent grads) since I feel the salary might be comparable but due to my age I think companies will think it is very strange that someone with 25 years experience will apply for a job that requires 6 years experience and will hold that against me. I am not quitting my job (I need the salary) but staying here will just dig me deeper in the hole as I am just getting older and falling behind more due to bad #4. What to do? What industry can I try to get into? (try to BS into at least) Project Management? I can say that due to my many years experience, I've led teams and been part of many projects so I know the process, I know how to plan timelines and budget (but I don't) Audit? anyone who has been in technology has been part of an audit, maybe I can say that due to being through many audits over 25 years I have picked up the basics and can learn more? Can't think of another field/industry - most other positions, even analyst requires a couple of years experience in the specific technology of that field. (and analyst is newbie entry level). For example I looked at some cybersecurity analyst postings and they all require 2-3 years of work with XYZ tools and ABC programs which are native to that industry. (although that is a hot field to get into)"

Throwaway account for obvious reasons... A quick summary of myself below: * 27 Y/O male; Married; No kids * Just transitioned from Active Duty Special Operations (O-3) to Reserves * Transitioned due to limited career trajectory, limited options for my wife's employment, homogeneous work environment/lack of diversity, less learning opportunities than expected, etc. * The main deal-breaker for Active Duty was the crazy work hours, time on the road, and deployments. I still enjoy some aspects of the work, but wanted a bit more flexibility in where I deployed and when. My wife and I gave the Active Duty a fair-shake, but decided it would be detrimental in the long-term. * Service Academy Grad; B.S. in Economics * Previous salary ranging from $85-95k, depending on Housing/Cost of Living/Hazard Pay that fluctuates depending on my location/specific job I've been interviewing with a few companies over the past month, and these two most immediate options that I'm interested in, but for completely different reasons: **Option 1: Company that works with various entities/commands at Ft. Meade, MD** *(this offer was found by a recruiter that's helping me in my job search)* **Option 2: Financial Advisor position for company that focuses around DMV area** *\*\*Both options also would be in an area where my wife would have great job opportunities that she's interested in as well, which is one reason I've narrowed my search down to these two options\*\** Main Reasons I'm interested in Option 1 (Specialist at Ft. Meade/Fed/DoD): 1. **Initial Interest** \- I'm very interested in INFOSEC/CyberSecurity as an industry due to the predicted job growth/security, greater purpose/mission, continuous learning opportunities and potential cross-over for future Reserves duties. 2. **Unique opportunity to change careers** \- The role I would be taking on would leverage my existing past experience and clearance (huge leverage point) and I would work on a team with clients that are primarily involved in the INFOSEC realm. This would allow me to gain exposure to the industry, meet people with the jobs I'm interested in and pick their brains, and opportunities to get certified for certain jobs in order to gain better understanding of future clients/develop another area of expertise. I would be very interested in eventually specializing in the ""Social Engineering"" aspect of INFOSEC on a Penetration Testing Team or being a trainer of sorts. 3. **Earning Potential** \- My potential salary for this job would actually be quite close if not better than the salary I just left, which I've found challenging to find for my rank/experience without doing basically the same stuff I did on Active Duty. Main Reasons I'm interested in Option 2 (Financial Advisor/Planner): 1. **Autonomy** \- The culture/work environment that I'm being ""sold on"" seems very appealing and seems rewarding for an entrepreneurial mindset, which I appreciate. I was interested in and interviewed for a few sales positions at different companies for this reason, but I have since made those a lesser priority after being told my crazy hours (12-15 hour days/constant travel/on call 24/7 &amp; 365). This sound even worse than some of the hours I experienced at times on Active Duty. 2. **Earning Potential** \- Again, what's being ""sold"" to me is quite a lucrative earning potential. My first year would be about on par with my previous salary, and following years could line up to double and even triple that amount by year 4 or 5 once I assume I've obtained High Net-worth clients. 3. **Initial Interest** \- I'm heavily interested in managing my own personal finances and like the idea of becoming a Subject Matter Expert on the subject, not only for my own benefit, but for the potential to help other people/businesses with their financial strategies At the moment, I'm torn between these two paths which I find hard to compare due to their inherent differences. **Potential downsides** I see are below *(these are based on my speculation and research, not experience since I am changing careers):* **Option 1:** 1. Bureaucracy of Fed/DoD (even though I'm used to it) 2. More of a regular 40-hour workweek due to the nature of Fed/DoD clients (pros and cons to this aspect alone) 3. Capped earning potential 4. Restricted to certain area due to company/unlikely to have options for remote work for security reasons 5. Less autonomy with working on a team **Option 2:** 1. Wariness of becoming a glorified Insurance Salesman (as opposed to helping people/companies with their finances/strategies) even if the pay is good 2. I hate the idea of being incentivized to sell a product I don't believe is the best option for a client, just for a higher commission. Ethically, this would screw with my head 3. With autonomy could potentially come more stress/longer hours as I seek to build a client-base, especially in the first few years 4. Potential to contract the ""Now what?"" disease, where I feel bored/unfulfilled after I've reached a certain point and don't see the point of sticking around longer if I'm not progressing/developing 5. Trusting their word on the ""lucrative earning potential"" I could achieve. I'm explicitly aware that most of these guys are salesmen and have a sales personality (more or less), and I could merely be seen as more $$$ for them if they're able to bring me onboard. **TL;DR -** Stuck between a career in **INFOSEC/Cybersecurity** or **Financial Planning/Advising/Strategy building** since they seem COMPLETELY different. Would love to hear different perspectives if anyone has a background or knows someone with a background in any of these paths. Any input our guidance would be much appreciated! I'm really trying to explore all options available at the moment and any/all perspectives help."

I spent a couple of months getting some industry certifications, and currently have 2 job offers that I am having trouble deciding between. **Job 1: IT Help Desk (Tier 2)** role at a MSP, $60k with $3k raise for each additional industry certification that I acquire. Pros: 1. IT Help Desk is pretty much the starting point for most careers in cybersecurity - after 1-2 years doing this job I could figure out exactly which path I want to pursue within the industry, while continuing to grow my skills. 2. Pays for additional certifications and training, with raises upon completion Cons: 1. Long commute (about 35 minutes in morning and 45-50 in the evening) 2. Crappy office building in a suburb of the major metro area I live in 3. Lower starting salary 4. Not very glamorous work, just doing it as a stepping stone to more interesting positions **Job 2: Customer Success Manager** for a SaaS company (product is communications-oriented), $75k with up to $7k end of year bonus Pros: 1. Really nice office building right downtown, close to my apartment 2. Good office environment, smart and friendly coworkers that are more in line with my demographic 3. Travel to assigned territory about 25% of the time (which I think is a very good balance) 4. Higher starting pay 5. Interesting work that would allow me to use my analytical and interpersonal skills Cons: 1. Not directly related to IT/cybersecurity 2. Less clear-cut path for upward mobility - whereas I would see myself spending 1-1.5 years in a help desk role before moving up, I think the path to move on from a CSM role would be slower Job 2 would clearly make my life more pleasant for the time being, but I am leaning towards sucking it up and doing Job 1 because it is more directly related to the career that I want to pursue. I DO know that when I get into cybersecurity I want to have a customer-facing role, and am wondering whether taking the Customer Success Manager position with this company would allow me to transition into a similar role with a cybersecurity company in a couple of years.

I am unsure whether to continue on in my career and education in healthcare. PA seems to be the best fit. I have 4+ years of PCE as a nurse. Someone on here told me it would be unwise to stop there instead of reaching for FNP or PA. I can do the schooling and ace it. The emotional drain, wanting to fix all suffering, is a struggle since one person can only do so much. The biggest factor in deciding right now whether to continue my education is the COST. PA school tuition is downright expensive for 27ish months not including living expenses. I'm not wild about taking out loans to finance the education, and I would have to go to school away from where I live (nearest PA school is 89k tuition). Even being able to pay them back a few years after employment is not a guarantee because life happens. &amp;#x200B; Second, I'm in nursing for the patients and improving their quality of life. I have not worked in a hospital, as LPNs are typically the medication administers in geriatric facilities (my nursing school taught this). I took the first step to get my prereqs for PA school out of the way (the Sciences), and it would be a step toward becoming an RN or an FNP as well. However, there is nothing wrong with staying an LPN and working despite the 12 hour shifts that can be super hectic. &amp;#x200B; I was thinking of moving into Cybersecurity but that is an unstable field despite the growing need. Where I live is very rural. I was looking at pictures and it rekindled my love for it. I do not know enough in that field though, and it is super detail oriented with cmd line abbreviations and minute details. I know I'm great at patient care and improving quality of life. I do too much and write too many physician communications. I don't know if I would be good at Cybersecurity, as I do not have any real world experience. In your opinion, what is the best and wisest option for me to focus on and pursue? Thank you."

I'm 22F, graduated from a state university back in May of this year, graduated with a BS in Computer Science and a BS in Cyber Criminology. I had intentions to gain experience in different IT fields, and eventually move to cyber forensics (going back to school if I found a job that would cover it). But to be honest, I don't really know why I chose to study computers in the first place. I hated every moment of university. Every class sucked, every teacher sucked, and I hated myself for it because I chose a school based on reputation rather than program / how I personally felt about it. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA but that's pretty bullshit considering GitHub and CourseHero were the only ones who actually taught me anything. There's no way I can genuinely say I deserved that high of a GPA with how bullshit these classes were - and I know all of that is my own fault. I was lucky enough to land an IT job a few months after graduating (back office of a local credit union), I've been here about 3 months now. I hate every second of it. I was thrown into this job on day one without any training and now I'm the sole member of the company's cybersecurity team and I have no idea what I'm doing. Terms are thrown at me that I have no idea what they are. I don't know shit about programming nor do I like doing it. My questions to my superiors are retorted with either ""Google it,"" ""Ask someone else, I'm busy,"" or just a strange look. I also feel like an idiot for asking questions that everyone thinks I already know the answers to. I'm starting to realize that I may have chose the wrong career field. I hate computers. I hate networking. I hate programming. I'd die if I kept this up just for cyber forensics, which I might end up hating as well. I was unhappy in university, but waking up every morning for this job is the *lowest* I've ever felt in my life. But at the same time, my first student loan payment is due at the end of this month, and the goddamn statement is looking at me like ""don't you dare start over, you did this to yourself, now live with it.""

She currently is a purchaser for a high end beer and wine store. She loves the beverage world. She sales wise has turned the store around and developed deep meaningful relationships with local breweries, and vendors, both large and small. She has even been offered some sales rep positions from distributers because of her ability in this, currently has not taken up any offers due to the potential move and her store giving her a raise. She wants to switch to Marketing, she generally thinks she will enjoy this field more, it keeps her happy, and has been good to her thus far. Whether she's stays in the beverage world or not is another thing itself. But in general there is some drive lost pursuing the CS degree. This is ok I only want her to be happy in her choices. We both know as a general rule there will be more money in the CS field whether its cybersecurity or not. Its not about the money for us so that's not an end all be all factor.

I enjoy working with technology and catch onto it fairly quickly, but I wouldn't say I have any specialized skillset at this time. 6. I need something stimulating; often changing and rarely the same scenery. I prefer something more unpredictable than routine. 7. I would love to have travel incorporated in my career, it is very important to me. 8. I don't work well on long, drawn-out projects. I love making quick decisions and quick actions, then moving onto the next objective. 9. I work very well with people; many say I am very persuasive, always trying to naturally sell them ideas. 10. I enjoy helping people/animals; I'm not a great active listener though due to my ADHD, but I can often interpret the needs of others. I know this is a very personal question, but I have no idea where to start. Some guidance, opinions, and recommendations would be fantastic! Thank you!"

I'm back at home, and the loneliness during the day has taken its toll on me mentally. I have applied for jobs and started taking a class on a new technology, but I keep putting it off because at my very core I feel I'm not good enough to be in this field and don't deserve it. I have about 2-3 interviews a week, but most of the time either they go with someone who's a better fit, or the position is no longer needed. I have had so many people give me advice on what I should be doing, some of it very good, but it feels like no one has actually SHOWED me what steps I need to take to pursue it. Cybersecurity, building my own app, becoming an entrepreneur, etc. Most people tell me about it, but rarely ever follow up with me about it. I just don't know what to do. I want to get help, but I feel like I would just be a burden to whoever tried to help me, and that it's something I have to do alone. But I'm tired of trying to do this by myself. I know I want to put my degree to good use and make the most of it, but I am just at a loss of direction. Any advice, even if it is tough love, would be good to hear right now."

136,cybersecurity,careerguidance,"Just started as Business Consultant Security, but expectations are not meeting reality by a mile. Nearing the end of my probation. What do I do?",2,dl3erl,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dl3erl/just_started_as_business_consultant_security_but/,2019-10-22 03:56:37,"I recently graduated with a Master Degree in Computer Science (specialization Cybersecurity) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I went looking for a job, and was offered a position of Business Consultant Security at a company that mainly focuses on testing. I looked elsewhere and had 3 or 4 other offers, but decided to take this one because I believe it allowed me to grow in the direction that I wanted, which is security testing, the fastest. To make it clear: They did mention that I might not immediately be assigned to a security testing job, and that the security testing within the company was not that mature yet, but said that I would be able to help to grow it. I was okay with this, since I really liked the place and the people, and wouldn't mind doing some other types of testing for a short while. In the first week, I was told that I could help with a security test, together with a couple of other colleagues, and so I did. I created a template for the report that would be sent to the customer, I found some vulnerabilities in the system and everything was awesome. Now I'm 1,5 months into the job, and I was told that I would be introduced to a company for an assignment. They told me I would do a combination of functional and technical testing, and that there might be some security involved. With this in mind, I had an intake meeting with a couple of people of this company. Long story short, the meeting went well, I was looking forward to have an assignment and was able to start the next working day. The first two days were mainly introduction, but on the third day, I was introduced to the actual job I would be doing: purely functional testing. The job would include copying and pasting descriptions of features, editing a couple of words to make them test cases, and then clicking through the application, taking screenshots and putting them in Excel. If any problems arise, I'd have to report it. With all respect to the people who do this for a living, I find it boring. The assignment completely mismatched my expectations, does not align with my ambitions and is taking a toll on me. If it was a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10, sure, I would have done it as an assignment, but this feels more like a -3. I called my supervisor from the consulting company, and he understood and said that it would be discussed internally, and that they would get back to me in two days. I think I slept for around 2 hours the night after. I just couldn't wrap my head around how I got there and what I was doing with my life. I dreaded getting out of bed that morning, something which I haven't done in years. I made my 8 hours that day, I delivered my work, but dreaded doing it. The next night I barely slept too. It was a little bit better, but I think 4 hours or something. I skipped my morning run as well, which I hadn't done in 6 weeks. I got the promised phone call. My supervisor from the consulting company said that I should confirm that the job would stay this way and to discuss the problems with the external company's supervisor. I did, and that supervisor confirmed there would be no change in what I would do for the duration of the assignment. I relayed this info back to my consulting company supervisor and they would come to the external company's office the next business day. This happened, and we discussed everything that was said previously. The consulting company's supervisor talked to the external company's supervisor and said that he would discuss it further with other people from the consulting company. That brings us to about an hour in the past. I got a phone call that the deal they are proposing me is to do the assignment for 32 hours instead of 40 and to spend 8 hours on my OSCP (security testing certificate) training. I have 10 days left in my probation and I'm considering all the options that I have. I'm at a point at which I'm not sure what to do. If I take this deal, I will dread going into work for 4 days a week, but I will make it through my probation and I will maybe get a better assignment in the future, with no guarantee. If I don't take the deal, I will most likely be fired. If I resign, I have to pay $800 back for the OSCP training and find another job. Could you please give me some advice on what to do here, Reddit?"

So, some peoples suggested me to do some research on industries. I am in Digital marketing &amp; Branding industry for 3 years and I helped some bunch of companies to build their business online. I've handled projects of industries include Fintech, Fashion, Home Cleaning, Home Products, Drone Products, Web services company, Solar Energy, Blockchain, Weight Loss Products and much more! In Addition, I did some research on Marketing related job pay scales and I calculated all the possible things. Chief Marketing Officer at MNC's can help me to achieve the million income goal. But, becoming a Chief Marketing office at a big corporation will require a minimum of 10 Years experience. So, I cut the job options.

So, somehow I know how the business model works and as I already experienced in Marketing &amp; Branding, I have a good idea of how business models work in some industries.

My photography business was successful in my city and I was having a good network of clients. When I started photography, I loved that and I thought that photography is my passion as I was working 15 hours a day at that time. But, after some time, I got bored with photography. After school, I joined digital marketing because the trend is going digital. I still love working in digital marketing. But, now it's time to build a successful carrier and achieve goals. So, I am unable to find my passion. I read some books on that but still, I am confused about this. In short, my confusion is in * Choosing the right industry to work in future. * If I choose one industry then what about passion? Can you help me with choosing the right decision?

I would really appreciate any responses. I'll start out with some backstory since I think it's important. I was homeschooled from pre-k all the way through high school. I scored a 33 on the ACT as a junior. My parents and I (mostly my fault) did not do a good enough job of preparing for college career-path wise, so I attended community college - I'm in my third semester now and getting ready to begin the process of transferring to a university. My ACT score will end up being more than two years old so it's basically worthless at this point which really sucks. Anyway, the only thing I've ever really been passionate about is football. And unfortunately, I don't have the genes to make a career out of it. Working in an NFL front office is still my dream job, but I can't exactly go to college for that. I'm in the cybersecurity program at community college, and will graduate (with an A.A.B.) after the spring semester. I chose this major because it was in the same general field as intelligence studies/security intelligence, which is what I ultimately wanted to do. I was in a speech and debate club in high school, and enjoyed researching and collecting information and arguing cases with it. One of my friends who is a few years older than me was also a part of that club, and attended Mercyhurst as an intelligence studies major, and one of the highlights of his time there was getting to work with the U.S. government to determine whether the U.S. was still in control of an intelligence satellite. That sounded awesome to me, and that's what I wanted to do. There were plenty of unis that had relevant programs, so I felt pretty good about it. I'm going to CC essentially for free which is a blessing, but that's almost certainly going to change. I should graduate with a 3.92 GPA, which is pretty good, but not the 4.0 my parents were expecting; they weren't very happy when I got B's in prob and stats and physical geography during my first semester. They're under the impression that had I gotten a 4.0, I would have been able to get a full ride to a university. Which is pretty ridiculouos since unis don't really do much financially for transfer students, but I can sort of see where they're coming from, since if it was going to happen, it would require a 4.0. Yes, finances are a big part of the equation here. They also really want me to go to a Christian college, but I honestly don't care. So that brings me to today. Applications to universities are going to open soon, so I need to make a decision quickly. And I have no idea what to do. Most of my major-related classes have been online, and I haven't particularly enjoyed them. I absolutely loath coding, and I don't have an affinity for it. I love computer hardware but as far as I know there isn't really a career that just involves building computers. And naturally, as I've gotten deeper and deeper into my classes, I've done more and more research on the field. And I've become really disillusioned with the whole intelligence thing. I don't want to have a target on my back; I don't want to be constantly paranoid and looking over my shoulder. And I never, ever want my future family to be in any sort of danger because of my job. I want to love what I do; I don't want to be miserable. I just want to make a good income, stay under the radar without publicity or recognition, and keep to myself. I'm an introvert who likes sports, movies, books, and video games. I'm not good socially and I don't like confrontation. I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining about things or I'm not a hard worker or anything like that. I put a very high amount of effort into my schoolwork, and I rarely have time to do fun things because of it. I'm burnt out, but that's just college life. I've always been of the opinion that you shouldn't go to college unless you know 100% what you're going to be doing. And now, I don't know what I want to do. A gap year isn't going to go well with my parents, and I don't really want to take one either. I'm just at a crossroads here, and I have no sense of direction on which path to take. I really need some help. I would love to answer any questions you may have that can help you help me."
146,cybersecurity,careerguidance,Can someone explain security clearance to me and if this is pointless?,10,d4duhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d4duhe/can_someone_explain_security_clearance_to_me_and/,2019-09-15 11:04:02,"Hi all, I'm not sure this is the sub for this but I could really use some advice for my boyfriend. If there is a better sub let me know. My boyfriend was recently awarded a scholarship in Cybersecurity. He was over the moon and worked his ass off to achieve it. They sent out an email about receiving security clearance as they felt it upped his chances of employment significantly and everything was okay until he reached a page on drugs. It said something about ""you must list all drugs done in the past 7 years."" I want to preface this and say my boyfriend is not a drug addict. He rarely drinks. He's just tried a few things here and there. I think the last thing he did was like 6 months ago where he took mushrooms with a few friends. His drug use is not regular and he's only tried a hand full of things. He wants to back out of applying because he says they will turn him away. I keep telling him to try anyway. There is literally nothing on his record, nothing he has done, not one arrest. He has a 4.0 and a great academic record. I spoke to a friend who has clearance that I know has done things before. She told me she just told them ""I smoked weed x amount of times"" and because she didn't lie they were okay with it. She said he should do it and that he's making too big deal of it. He must undergo a polygraph test and he's freaking out. He feels it's pointless and told me if he doesn't get this clearance it could go on his record. I'm not familiar enough with it to know how true that is. If he is truthful and explains, does that scar him for life if he doesn't get it? I don't want him to lie at all and am not suggesting that, but I think he should try and explain when they ask him that he tried a few things here and there. He was thinking of going to drug classes and get some sort of written notice? I don't know. He was saying what if they want proof he doesn't do drugs and maybe that would help. I've never seen him this scared and I'm not sure if he's making too big a deal of it. I told him I'm sure they would understand he tried a few things in his past, but is not an active drug user. He's telling me they will polygraph him and ask him ""have you done x in the past 7 years"". Should he even try for the clearance or is this just pointless? Do they look at you trying pot or something every now and then as an automatic dismissal? I don't want him to lose faith so I'm trying to find anyone who has been through this to give me advice."

The manager at this job is also very unprofessional and doesn't seem to know what he is doing and claims that the business is running in loss and only pays $15 per hour and makes me work 45 hours a week.

I am a part time QA tester in a company I interned for which really nice since Im learning a lot and am grateful for the opportunity. I dont think Ill stop learning new things anytime soon from this company so for now Im satisfied. However, my problem is that though I am successful in being hired by this company, I have this fear of doing other jobs since I am unsure of myself and have doubts with my skills (though I definitely can do things and am willing to learn and I work hard, I feel incompetent and a fraud even with no basis to it). To make up for it I try to take some certifications before but Ive heard that certifications arent really worth much. Still I am trying to better myself and learn something new each day. My questions are the following: 1. How do you deal with the feeling of being incompetent despite there not being anything to show you are incompetent? Kind of like an impostor in the field despite being capable and knowledgeable in enough areas? 2. Are certifications worth getting? I kind of plan to study more during my free time and take online courses so I can become a better person. I am not sure if it will be needed or enough when I apply for other jobs in the future? Ive been told by some it is important, while others said those arent important. Sure you need the skills to back it up but I am mainly curious. 3. In the IT/Programming field, what is possibly a good path to take? I like programming and an doing scripting at the moment, its fun. I plan on looking into developing android applications and training myself. However, cybersecurity related jobs also seems really interesting. What is your work in the IT/Programming/Cybersecurity field and how is your experience so far? What are the pros? The cons? What do I have to really study and hone in that field? 4. I am interested in taking masters a year after I grad. Ill be 22 then, is this the right pacing? Or should I wait a bit more? 5.

I am getting promoted this year and will be making \~15% more. As it is a large company, there is a lot of bureaucracy so upward mobility will continue to be a challenge. I have been offered a new position with a small security firm (under 10 people). They have large clients (billion-dollar companies) and a promising future. I can tell from our conversation that it is going to be a lot of work. However, that means I will take on more responsibilities. They have offered me $130k + 15% (bonus) a year. There is no equity included. They have told me that if I want to have a team under me, I can do so if I have proven myself and the growth of the company justifies it. My compensation will increase annually depending on performance as well. My question is: Should I leave my current job? My other route is to negotiate with my current company to match/get close to the offer. I am really thinking about it, but not sure. It seems a bit risky because it is a small company.

Looking for some help making some decisions, but first a backstory. I have been working selling cell phone service and failing television technologies for the past four years, and I absolutely hate it. There's no future for me in retail sales, that's not the type of person I want to be and I wouldn't be able to tell anyone with pride that I'm a retail sales worker forcing extra phone lines and television service on people who don't want it. That being said, two years ago I decided I hated how my life was headed and decided to go back to school at age 30. I enrolled at first for a I.T Management degree but then switched to cybersecurity since blue team work seems really interesting to me. Red Team seems like a blast but I'm no secret agent. On top of that, I also started studying for my A+, Net+, and casually have been learning Python and SQL on the side. I've been doing all this while working a full time job so I can feed myself and afford rent. Now, what I have been doing some thinking. By the time I graduate in 2022, I'll have seven years experience in retail sales and zero experience in anything involving I.T work or even data entry. I've also learned that re-wording my resume to make my work seem more hard skill based involving wireless technologies rather that soft skill sales still doesn't make up for zero years in experience. I was debating if while going to school, I should quit my current job for temp work where I can gain experience through entry level jobs to help me gain experience on top of school and side studies. Does anyone have any advice on gaining experience while in school later in life? edit: I've already looked into other positions in my current company and apparently learned that they don't hire for I.T positions out of retail, or if they do it's actually harder to do than say a new hire with experience. This is a rumor, but I can understand people blocking career change if it means one less salesman on the floor."

It's been a week and they don't return his phone calls and they don't return emails. What gives? He's in cybersecurity, if that makes any difference."
165,cybersecurity,careerguidance,I'm 24 and I still don't have a passion for anything. Is I.T and CS really meant for me?,47,cfdz4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cfdz4p/im_24_and_i_still_dont_have_a_passion_for/,2019-07-20 08:10:27,"I'm 24 years old, haven't achieved much since high school, and I'm the definition of the kid who never found motivation to do anything. I have 40 credits towards an Associate's in general studies which means fuck all, or about 28 towards an Associate's in I.T. I think the biggest reason for my lack of motivation is the negativity surrounding two year degrees, why am I grinding for this if it's worthless? I'm not really a university/4-year college type of person, and at 24 it's probably too late for that anyway. As a kid, I loved computers. Gaming, video editing, technology, I always always into all of that. But other than a few hobbies, I don't really have a passion for anything anymore. After taking a few of my major-courses, I really don't find computer science interesting, or at least what I've taken so far. Networking, programming, and intro to database, I really dislike all of it. Some of the courses I have left are network admin, intro to cybersecurity, intro to linux, etc. Does it get better? I do like the idea of physically working with a computer (think building and repairing them), and maybe even setting up networks? I just don't like the idea of being stuck behind a desk typing in Excel all day if that makes sense. Personality-wise, I was always the shy kid that played on his computer every day after school, so I thought this was the path for me. Now that I think about it, I don't really know if I want to work in a cubicle for the rest of my life, but I also dislike anything in the trades or blue-collar fields. I don't know what to do, or if I should even bother with an Associates anymore. If for some reason I do finish this Associate's in I.T, would the 2-year IT degree and maybe a Comptia A+ certificate be enough to get my foot in the door somewhere? Or do I talk to a counselor about my transfer options to a university? I'm really against the idea of going into thousands of dollars in debt for something that won't guarantee me a job, but if it's the only option so be it. I realize this is probably all over the place, but I am desperate for some help and I really appreciate it. Thank you"

I have a 3.97 GPA and will be graduating with degrees in Information Systems (concentration Data Analytics) and Information Security and risk management.

On my own, I did a lot of studying and learning to be at par with my fellow CS undergrads and get placed in a good company as them (and I guess I did?). But on paper, I do not have enough creds to be considered for a job in security. My aim (I don't know how far fetched it is, honestly that's why I am asking for help) is to advance in the industry in this field, maybe as far as CISO? :P My gameplan is to get a masters in CS (after gaining 1-2 yrs experience as an SDE) and then MBA. Also maybe taking up security administration as a job. But even then there's too much confusion here. Should I get a masters in Computer Science or something more specialised for cybersecurity?

Recommendation on a position that I should aim for?,2,bwtoh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bwtoh2/37year_old_at_a_career_forkintheroad/,2019-06-05 06:32:36,"I am at a bit of a fork-in-the-road in my career, and I could use some advice from others that have been there before... sorry for the wall of text, but if anyone has any advice on next steps it would be appreciated. Where I'm at right now: I'm a 37 year old who is unemployed (intentionally) for the first time in my career. I recently moved to a new state and purchased a home with my wife and 2-year old, and wanted to spend a while working on the house and figuring out what my next steps should be career-wise. How I got here: I graduated from a good university with a B.S. in Physics / Mathematics. I didn't do anything with that degree, and bounced around a bit before finding a passion in web development, where I taught myself to make web apps. I started out at a startup doing web dev, but left after a year for a really cool (I thought at the time) digital advertising company where I could make much more money. At this new gig, I busted my ass and got recognition every annual review, being promoted to Sr. front-end developer, technical lead, then front-end solutions architect, then a technical director, then a senior technology director. Throughout this time I was never the best programmer, and spewed out a fair share of spaghetti code but always had good results and delivered projects on time/budget. This company did give me a lot of experience doing a broad range of projects, from websites to mobile apps to retail installations, but I have never become an expert at anything, and dabbled in DevOps, frontend web dev (JS, CSS), backend-development (PHP/Python), DevOps (shell, Jenkins, linux admin), Cloud (AWS certification, hosting with Lambda, EC2, Cloudfront, S3, etc). I would certainly consider myself a jack-of-some-trades, master of none. By the time I got to the sr. director level, it was becoming clear that in-house technology dept was going downhill in favor of lower cost global satellite offices, and I was dreadfully ready to get out of the advertising industry. At that point, I started applying around for VP, Engineering roles, to stop having ""clients"" and start working ""in-house"". I ended up taking a VP, Product role at a company that was going through a restructure. I negotiated a higher salary / lower bonus, because the company was going through a lot of changes and I generally don't like discretionary salary, but the end result was a comfortable salary for NYC standards. In this new role I was responsible for a lot of different things, cutting across design, technology, marketing, finances, sales, etc. but I feel like my skillset is more suited on the technology side - and as I found learned over the years, I'm incredibly disinterested in anything having to do with marketing or advertising and prefer the making of things. In the VP Role, I never really got into a comfort zone  everything felt like a huge learning curve and the constant impostor syndrome dread definitely wore on me. But all-in-all, I learned a boatload about getting a product off the ground, enough to know that I want to focus more on technology than across all disciplines. Some of the things I've enjoyed the most in the past were white-boarding solutions to problems, architecting, and prototyping. I've never felt like I was particularly GOOD at these things, but I would find myself lost in a state of ""flow"" when doing them. I enjoy brainstorming with others, and am never (to a fault) without something to add to the conversation. I don't particularly enjoy presenting in front of large groups, but I have done a lot of it  When it is something I'm passionate about, I don't have a lot of trouble. When it is about something I don't believe in it can make me quite anxious to the point of stage fright. My highest education is a B.S. in Physics / Mathematics, I also picked up a Certified Solutions Architect, Associate from AWS in 2016 which has since lapsed. What's next? I have never been a great networker, but generally speaking I always get along well with coworkers and others have told me that I make a good manager and leader. I value work-life balance for myself and those that report to me. In the past, I have put in 80 hour weeks which really turned me off to that lifestyle and the work people produce under those conditions is generally awful. Don't want to live like that ever again, but I do want to have a high-paying job where I can make a difference and be challenged. I've always felt more comfortable as a second-in-command than being the one bearing the brunt of responsibility, as stress gets to me and aggravates my anxiety. But, I am no stranger to living outside of my comfort zone, and others have told me that I can inspire others (even when I sometimes myself am interally second-guessing my decisions). Fields I've considered digging deeper into: cybersecurity, blockchain, data analysis/visualization, cloud architecture. At this point in my career, should I consider going back to school to get an M.S. or MBA? Does any of the word soup above scream out a good fit for any particular role? Anyone been in a similar position? Where did you land, what would you have done differently? Thanks for any and all advice. EDIT: x-post from /r/itcareerquestions where it was recommended I post here."

I got involved with youth projects, started a social enterprise and got more work experience and internships in marketing during 2018. I secured a paid role in marketing in September 2018 and have now moved to a higher paid role, as of March 2019, working in digital marketing for a tech company. &amp;#x200B; But my ultimate ambition is to get into technology. In the UK we have degree apprenticeships at quite a few large tech companies - think IBM, Capgemini, BT, etc. As you can understand, they're very competitive. I'm determined to get one, and have done some part time coding courses, as well as teaching myself coding. &amp;#x200B; The problem: I'm not naturally gifted at maths. I prefer coding in Python, hard as it is for me as a beginner, because I understand the purpose of the functions, and I struggle to understand the purpose of maths sometimes - pointless questions about train journey fares etc fail to peak my interest. I think my lack of maths ability is also due to various environmental and situational challenges - always being told I was crap, etc. To get into these companies, it's required to pass online numerical, verbal and situational judgement tests. This is the case for a lot of graduate roles. &amp;#x200B; I want to apply for degree apprenticeships starting this year but am thinking of waiting until applications reopen next year to give myself enough time to revise - maybe even get a maths tutor, as well as to work on my tech skills and finish building my Python project. &amp;#x200B; There are some problems. I still live with my parents and don't get on with them at all. I wish I could move out, and there's a chance I could, but rent is highly expensive in London and I want to save and invest my money. I dislike my parents - they're lazy, unambitious and bad with money, and I'm also afraid of being blackmailed by them and having to donate money to the house. Family does tend to take things for granted. &amp;#x200B; I'm working in a challenging role which I like, but it's not where my heart is. It's okay for now, but as I said, I think I'm talented enough to get into tech despite not being from a STEM background. I care about how technology will impact all industries, about automation, tech for good, cybersecurity and changes to health and social care through technological innovation - probably more than those who have studied STEM degrees without any idea of what they wanted to do. I also go to loads of tech meetups. &amp;#x200B; I guess I'm here for support. I'm great at networking and also kind of want to be back in the uni I was at, as I am now, with skills, work experience and a large network of ambitious and talented friends. The one thing holding me back is my financial background, and the high COL in London. Living in the town I grew up is depressing, and makes me feel unsuccessful when I know I'm not. &amp;#x200B; Any responses - encouragement, links to maths tuition sites, and tips on living with family and saving money would be greatly appreciated!"

A little background about me: I'm a Computer Networking Major with minors in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. It's my senior year in Wisconsin right outside the Cities, and my goal is to move near the cities after I graduate this next December to be closer to my SO. I currently am employed at an internship with company A I've held since last summer, which was extended after good performance; essentially, I have a part time position as a full stack development intern. It is approximately an hour and a half away from my apartment, but half an hour away from my parents house whom I could move back in with this summer (but really don't desire to). They have offered me to stick around and stay for another summer with a pay raise to 23 an hour. I love the work I do, but I am not enthralled with the company or it's policies and don't plan to stay unless I have no other job prospects, but they have continually suggested they will be offering me a full time position. I work with C# mostly developing APIs, but lately have been working on automated patching with servers and Azure stuff. The work is constantly fresh and new, and the company is the best-in-class for their market, so I deal with apps that impact millions of users. Unfortunately, the downsides to this internship are that remote work is non-existent (making work while I'm in school very hard; 4 hours of unpaid commute every work day, gas is expensive and wear on my vehicle) and I have no peers that are within my age group, so it can be sort of lonely. They also have one location for IT work and it is here, and I do not want to stay here past graduation whatsoever, as it is very far from both my SO and my family. As well, even if I work here this summer and live with my parents, I would still need to pay for my college apartment while getting no use out of it. I was, however, recently offered a new internship at a company B that is 25 minutes from my apartment. I am enthralled by the work this new company does, and working there after I graduate is something I deeply desire. They have an office in the cities which they say I could move to once I graduate, and have a reputation for giving interns who work there full time jobs that pay well above market average. However, the internship is in product support, and only pays 12 an hour. I'm confident in my people skills and motivation to move up in company B, but I fear this experience for the internship will be less useful as a resum builder than the work I do with company A. As well, the lower pay would be difficult to deal with, but not impossible. However, I would desire a job with company B after I graduate infinitely more than with company A. Seeing as I am reaching the end of my studies, I am motivated to work for the company B that I would rather work for after I graduate, but although both companies can nearly guarantee me a job, only one of them is in development/project work, and that is the company A I would rather not stay on with. Development jobs are plenty at company B, but I would probably need to knock it out of the park impressions wise and study outside of work to land one. I also greatly enjoy the area around my college apartment and have many friends there, and not many anymore back home near my parents.

186,cybersecurity,careerguidance,I have a very sought-after skillset with a lot of strong experience but can't seem to attract attention from overseas employers. How to convince an international employer I'm worth the visa process?,51,bm66lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bm66lv/i_have_a_very_soughtafter_skillset_with_a_lot_of/,2019-05-09 00:50:30,"First off - I appreciate any help or advice you can give. This is a great subreddit. I'll try to be as objective as possible about my situation, forgive me if it comes off slightly conceited, I just want to be clear about why I'm a bit frustrated/down on the process. &amp;#x200B; My Situation: &amp;#x200B; I'm a senior cybersecurity engineer at a major bank in the United States. I've led engineering teams in 5 different Fortune 100 companies, most of whom are in financial services or telecommunications. I generally specialize in applied cryptography/encryption and data protection (data loss prevention, data classification, DRM, etc); but I've essentially touched every aspect of cybersecurity, including building out one of the larger and more advanced Threat Intelligence and Malware Analysis platforms in the world (to my knowledge, anyway). I helped design the encryption/tokenization scheme for a major cashless payment app that everyone in the world has heard of. I could go on, but my point is - I have some incredibly strong qualifications in Cybersecurity. &amp;#x200B; My partner and I have been wanting to leave the US and try the 'expat thing.' I want more international experience (while working for the Big Four as a senior cybersec consultant I traveled pretty extensively to Asia and Europe but I've never lived outside the US) and exposure to business cultures other than my own, among other reasons. &amp;#x200B; I've not had much luck. In the US if I submit a resume (to an open req I'm qualified for) it's rare that I don't at least get an interview. However I've submitted dozens of applications to roles in the UK and Western Europe that I'm either qualified or totally OVERQUALIFIED to hold, but I'll usually get a reply within 12-24 hours saying I ""don't have the skills they require."" Which to be totally frank... I just don't buy - at all. And I don't mean to say there's no job I'm not qualified for - but I've literally applied to roles which I've ALREADY HELD AT THE SAME COMPANY (but the US branch/firm) and was an extremely high performer, which would've been in their HR records if they bothered to look (I let them know on the application I'd already worked for the company, as this was a question on the app). &amp;#x200B; I have a few possibilities on the table because I have a decently strong network, even in Europe. But even with a foot in the door it's been difficult to get a company to consider me at all. I imagine a lot of this could be due to issues in the EU and UK (i.e. Brexit) that are making immigration difficult. &amp;#x200B; I've mainly focused on Western Europe because my language skills are lacking - I can speak some very basic Mandarin and elementary Spanish, but not enough to function well in a business environment. That said, I'm open to most places, I've also found some interesting roles in Singapore and Dubai, for instance. &amp;#x200B; The Question: &amp;#x200B; What gives? Am I being unrealistic about my skillset? I know cybersecurity is a hot industry and at least in the US we don't have even close to the number of skilled employees we need to fill the roles we have. I'm guessing Europe is likely in a similar, or worse, boat. How do I appear more attractive to employers overseas? Or will I always get a rejection in 24 hours regardless of my skills, simply because I checked ""I do not currently have the right to work in the UK and would need sponsorship?"" Do I need to wait out Brexit first (at least in regard to the UK)? &amp;#x200B; I'd really appreciate any advice you have on anything from: resources I may not be aware of to find jobs outside the US, any insight into the hiring process you may have, advice on companies or industries that tend to be more likely to hire foreigners, etc. Feel free to message me directly if you don't feel comfortable replying to the post, for whatever reason. &amp;#x200B; Thanks again!"

To give a bit of context, I just ended an 8-month internship with a small startup who didn't extend my contract due to a shift in business goals, and a realization that they couldn't physically keep me. I'm assuming that I left on a good note, as I was told that I could ask for a letter of recommendation anytime, and that if they had a Software Engineering position in the future, that they would contact me. 3 weeks later after that internship had ended , I was offered another unpaid software engineering position at a different company. As much as I feel confident in my skills to be qualified for an entry-level position (I also had former research experience, became a cofounder and vice-president of my university's cybersecurity club, organized an official Hackathon at my school, and worked on some personal projects), I don't want to miss an opportunity to gain more experience, and I figure that i'll be able to add something else on my Resume, until I find a paid internship or full-time position. I'll also be graduating this semester, so my parents are pushing me to find a paid full-time position. I'm not sure if it's worth it for me to pursue another unpaid internship opportunity, given my circumstances. On one hand I graduate this May and truly feel that I need to focus on my interviewing skills, apply for a bunch of jobs and finish up any leftover projects that i'm currently working on, so I could show those off in my Resume as well. On the other hand, this internship may make me more marketable, and I could learn more about my field through the challenges faced from a different company. This job could also potentially lead to a paid position on its own? I know of former classmates who have been looking for a job since last spring, so i'm trying to avoid being in their position."

First the facts without any bullsh\*t: * I'm 22 * i think I'm really lazy * still living with my parents * currently no job * i have something like a college degree (i live in Germany, apprenticeship?) Okay, so here is the story: I always had problems going to school, maybe had a depression, but i graduated something similar to high school with the lowest possible degree, then i was in therapy. People always tell me I am really smart, which I'm tired of, but it got me into something similar to college without having the requirements, which got me something like a small computer science &amp; marketing degree (learnt basic webdev, networking, programming, graphic design and accounting/marketing/HR stuff). During that time i felt so empowered, i made the plan to be self-employed, work hard and make a lot of money. But i had absolutely no idea with what, so i talked to someone at the employment agency which went like this: she asked me what i want to do - i had no idea - she asked me what i don't want to do - i made a list of some jobs i would hate - still don't know what to do. I was there 4 or 5 times, always the same, result: i just don't know what to do with my life. Some time passed, i wrote applications for some dev jobs, only 2 rejected, rest was not answered. Then i made a deal with my parents: 1 free year go get my self-employment started, if i fail after that year i'll go get a proper job. So again, time passed, i read some books, got interested in dropshipping, did a lot of research about it, prepared a shop, became interested and learned more about cybersecurity and using linux. I also researched all the legal things about eCommerce and all of that here in Germany. I really love the idea of having this freedom and flexibility I'd get when i would work from home, for myself. And now we are in the here and now, the shop was never online, i never started a business, i got bad at programming, i get nothing done because i feel like i have nothing to do, i have some money left and there are almost 5 months left from ""the year"" but if i want to apply for another ""college degree"" (apprenticeship?) i have to do it now. Problem: i still have no idea what i want to do. I start to get angry at myself sometimes for being such a lazy, time-wasting human being. My parents also put pressure on me: once i have a job, they'll give/gift me the house we live in + the debts (long story...), so i can't just switch jobs that easily once i have one. I can do some programming (python, basics of c, c# but not anymore), webdev &amp; hosting (but don't really like it), know a lot about computer hardware, basic cybersecurity and pentesting, basic electronics (design simple pcb's, arduino/rpi, repairing things, the usual DIY-stuff), 3D modeling and printing, I'm somehow very good at breaking games and programs (like QA?). Now i don't *really* know what I'm expecting here, so i'll just click on ""post"" and see what happens. Thanks. "

My questions are: Is it reasonable to take a certificate program in Cybersecurity with no prior knowledge on the subject besides a year of being a media center tech? As far as ensuring employment possibilities in areas that are military dominant, would cybersecurity be the best option? Lastly, would I be able to find employment with a certificate or are these programs geared towards people who are continuing their education or on a career advancement path? I've attached my LinkedIn profile for more career background info. &amp;#x200B; Much appreciated! "

I had hoped that I'll be getting a lot to learn. But the work is terrible, and leaves me with no time to upskill myself outside of it. And by terrible, I mean not only the quality of work, but the way my boss works as well. While normally it wouldn't have been complicated to get out of it, but now he has printed visiting cards for me(I know, too much, but I have to visit client locations, so to not look underexperienced...) and with the reference of relative involved, it is very complicated. I had a mild depression and was undergoing therapy before starting this. Now, I don't have time or money for therapy, I'm stuck at this place and missing my goals leading me to think that I'm going further down the hole and this is becoming a chronic problem."

For my current job, I have worked on this help desk for 5 years. I started at an associate level making 33k a year, I was promoted in 2016 to regular TSR which bumped my pay to 41k per year. I asked for a promotion in November since I was taking on more responsibility. My manager said I deserved it. I received the promotion I asked for and was bumped up to 50k per year. I routinely check job postings within my company to see what is available and I found a security analyst position recently posted. If I apply for this position and receive the position, it would be a great career move for me and most likely have a pay increase as well. I feel like I would be hired for this position since I know a couple of people within that group and my IT skills far exceed what is needed for my current position. However, I'm hesitant to apply for it since I asked for my promotion and received it within the 2 last months. If I hated my job, I would not hesitate to apply for this position, but I love my job and my manager is awesome. I feel like I would be screwing my manager over. So, the question is, since I asked to be promoted and received said promotion, would it be a dick move to my manager to apply for this position?"

I just received a job offer from a small private company that I may want to work for. However, I'm torn between the new opportunity and my current job. Right now, I work for a large public company that I just joined 3 months ago. I'm not really happy with the role I'm currently in (I was bait and switched), but the manager that hired me just announced that he will be leaving the company in two weeks. So, anything could happen with where I'm at now. What would you do if you were in my situation? &amp;#x200B; Pros to staying: * Opportunity to mentor and lead a team of Engineers (mixed skill levels) to build cool things * Many future opportunities to move around internally without changing companies if I want to later on * Hiring manager leaving may mean some positive changes coming to the direction/vision of the team I'm on * Get to keep RSUs I was granted when I started, and will very likely get RSU refresher grants every year * Overall total compensation with my current position is pretty much guaranteed to be higher by \~40k/year (after taxes) * Great opportunities to learn and apply new technologies that are cutting edge * Opportunity to go fully remote after 1 year * Benefits package (excluding PTO) is \*slightly\* better than the new company (lower copays/OOP maxes on insurance, MUCH better STD/LTD coverage if anything ever happened to me and I couldn't work, 401k contribution, tuition reimbursement, and ESPP -- all 3 are benefits that the new company doesn't offer) * I've been there three months, so for the most part, I know what I can expect from staying * Opportunities to publish some of the projects I've worked on to benefits our customers (i.e. blog posts, speaking at conferences, contributing to open source projects, etc.) which could also lead to a larger network and more opportunities in the future &amp;#x200B; Cons to staying: * Work life balance hasn't been great (but it is slowly getting better with additional hires and improvements to the environment) * Lots of politics, process, and meetings which is unlikely to ever change * Uncertainty that comes with new upper management doing restructuring and my team getting a new manager * Not particularly enjoying life in the bay area - super expensive, lots of traffic, have had a hard time making friends * Stress at work has caused me to gain 10 lbs in the last 3 months and systolic BP to go up almost 20 points * Manager has not been giving me much feedback, doesn't seem to care about WLB, hasn't really been involved with he team, etc. (although now that I know he's leaving, I guess this doesn't matter as much) * Work is always likely to be fairly stressful as the job my team performs is in extremely high demand within the company * Work feels like a grind a lot of the time, often day to day gets tedious as many tasks I've already done before * Have to work late hours (additional 4 hours usually, but has been an additional 8-9 hours a couple times) for maintenance activities almost weekly * Have to participate in a weekly on-call rotation * Priorities get switched a lot, sometimes to the point of feeling like we're not making progress on anything (may change with changes to management) * Not really enjoying the majority of the type of work that I'm currently doing, but again, I have no idea if that can be changed with new management coming in, along with new hires on our team * If the manager is leaving, maybe he knows something that I don't about the future of my team? * I have doubts that I would get another similar opportunity with the new company again, or a comparable situation where I could rapidly accelerate my career (I think) in a short amount of time &amp;#x200B; Pros of new company: * Director title could very easily open future opportunities more quickly for me (Sr Director, VP, SVP, maybe even CTO in a few years) * I could directly impact the revenue of the company by steering their product roadmap and development efforts * I would get to build relationships with other companies in the industry that we would want to partner with for integrations, would be a great opportunity to build my network * Pivoting to Product Management means I would get to learn a whole new skill set, would be coached and mentored on it by a very experienced manager who has reasonable expectations of me * I interviewed with 10 people at the new company and they all said the work-life balance there is great, they claim it's a 9-4 job, plus the company offers unlimited PTO which they say people use all the time * They only employ \~80 people currently so it's still got a nice startup vibe - plus I'd get to know everyone there * They are self-funded and profitable, so they aren't going through a hyper-growth phase or anything crazy right now to try and get more rounds of funding from VCs, etc. * They are well-known in cybersecurity and the field is growing rapidly, so I'm confident they will continue to do well as a business * They are willing to re-pay relocation assistance to my current company along with the starting bonus I received from them * Located in Seattle, which is a city I think I might really enjoy living in the downtown area of * Opportunities to move-up or around the company in the long-term as the company grows -- I would still be getting in pretty early * They've stretched themselves pretty far on what they can offer me, and although it's not exactly a lateral move in terms of compensation, they REALLY want to hire me &amp;#x200B; Cons of new company: * Uncertain as to whether or not I'll miss the engineering/problem solving aspects of the job I currently have if I move to Products * They are a private company and not willing to offer me any equity (ie stock/pre-IPO) compensation, only something called, ""phantom equity shares"" which is basically a one-time cash bonus I would get paid in the event they area acquired, have a change in ownership (both events seem pretty unlikely in at least the next 5 years) * Overall compensation will be least 40k less/year (after taxes) (and after promotions/equity refreshers at my current company, likely even more than that after another 2-3 years) * They require me to relocate but aren't offering any relocation assistance, so I'd have to pay that out of pocket * Company valuation is &lt;$100M and as they are self-funded, they aren't currently looking to go through a hyper-growth phase, which means the likelihood of the phantom compensation payout occurring is pretty low * They have a standard flat-rated bonus right now, and it's half of my current bonus &amp;#x200B; TLDR: Stay at my current company as an Engineer and keep the higher guaranteed compensation, accepting the risks that come along with changes in management, and the hope that I'll be able to go remote in a year (and/or transfer to another team where I might enjoy the type of work I'm doing more) OR Accept an offer as a Director of Product Management at a new company making less money, in a better location, with a better work/life balance, not be able to go remote, and hope that I won't miss Engineering and/or be kicking myself in 3-4 years for not keeping stock in a growing public company whose share price keeps going up, but be able to do something new &amp;#x200B;"

They're essentially in the process of building out a security program which could definitely be engaging. GRC implementation, etc. I went back to my current employer and leveraged my offer for a 50k raise which brings me to 130k/yr (in Tampa, FL). They've lost some seniors recently and couldn't really afford to lose me. I also leveraged for them to give me a clear roadmap to ""manager"", which they targeted for me to reach in mid-2019. I'm not 100% sure what to do at this point. On one hand, the Uber offer would probably be a great experience in terms of learning the industry side of things. However, I'm afraid of it being a ""waste"" of time in terms of career progression; I can't see myself getting into a management role. My current employer gives me the opportunity to get the managerial experience (i.e., managing people, budgets, etc.) and I get to stay in Tampa, but the work is repetitive.

Is this a bad idea given the job market and work-life balance? I'm currently a sophomore in college (CS/IT double major). I've always liked both software and law (at least what I know of them) but figured I'd go into software since I have experience there and am capable enough in it. I had a programming internship over the summer and found that what I really liked and was focused on was less the programming itself than the ""business"" part of the work. Basically, I like figuring things out, putting them together, and the general surrounding interactions more than I like day-to-day programming itself. Right now, I figure I could be happy enough doing software, but I think I would enjoy law much more. My question is, given the current job market and working hours (9 or 9:30 - 7 most days in law from what I understand) in software vs. law is it foolish to consider switching careers? Some background: I'm 19, located in South Florida and would like to stay here, although I would consider moving to New York. I have a 4.0 GPA and am optimistic about keeping that up over the next few years, I'm hoping that could get me a scholarship in law school. Although this isn't really a concrete indication of an aptitude, I've always done better with reading and writing than math. I've been programming since I was 11 and have built a fairly successful app as well as done some work in the family business. I've always liked the work, but, as I mentioned above, I think I like the business aspect more than programming itself. I'm seeing if it's possible to switch to computer science and accounting (from CS/IT) which would allow me to possibly get my CPA and/or switch to accounting if I can't go to law school in the end, but that would involve a heavy course load and my school might not allow it. If law school works out, I'm looking at becoming a tax attorney, although I'm being told that IP/patent law is better and has less competition if you have a STEM background. That probably sounds like I'm just looking for the money, which I kind of am since I'm considering a switch from a fairly lucrative career path, but I think I would like the more business-related aspect of tax law and have somewhat more of a head for that than I might for, let's say, criminal defense. I'm also OK with the tedious aspects of many things that most people find boring. My main concerns with law are the hours big law generally involves and the job market. I don't think the big law lifestyle is one I want, although I'm not sure if the hours just look worse on paper and are practically the same as a management position I might end up in with software otherwise. Ideally, I'd work big law for the ""required"" 4 or 5 years before either starting my own practice or switching to some other arrangement (in-house, small firm, etc.). I'm OK with the amount of work, but don't like the family life that comes with staying in the office until later at night. Working until 5:30 and then 7-9 from home is much better than working straight until 7, which is what I think a private practice might involve. In software, I've done largely web related backend work (Node.js and Java) and would likely try to work my way up the ladder from there if I stuck with it. From what I understand, if you advance well in software you end up in management in about 10 - 15 years so a software career is really management longer-term. I've also considered cybersecurity, although I don't have experience there. TIA!"
216,cybersecurity,careerguidance,Concerning a Career in Cryptography...?,1,9kil3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9kil3u/concerning_a_career_in_cryptography/,2018-10-02 03:48:45,"A little bit about me... I started pursuing my education in pure mathematics at a junior college, doing well in those early classes (calculus, differential equations, college algebra) partly because they were ""easier"" than theoretical math and partly because I had less responsibilities then. I finished with mostly A's and a very high GPA. After transferring to a very good university, my grades in my math classes have slipped to a mostly B average partly due to the increased difficulty of the courses (theoretical linear algebra, abstract algebra, intro. complex analysis) and partly due to more responsibilities (I hold a mandatory, almost full-time job absolutely unrelated to my career/ education for the sake of sustenance). The burden of holding a job saps a lot from me and I feel it's kept me from being the best math student that I could be. I realize things get tougher as you go along and that more B's in some cases is normal for many STEM students. I'm just concerned because I always perceived cryptography as a career path that required some graduate school. I don't see how a student with mostly B's in their math classes could get into graduate school, or that they even deserve to. I'm not angry or bitter about this. I'm just trying to be realistic. I should mention I am currently coming at this from the 'mathematical cryptography' perspective, with little to no experience in the computer science facet of the field. My math skills are all I have. So here's my question: if my math skills/ grades don't get me a leg up in the cryptography graduate school/ career market, would supplementing my resume with a degree in something computer-related help me? The aforementioned junior college, and many others, offer varying degrees in I.T., programming, cybersecurity, etc. That is, degrees ranging from certificates to technical degrees to even bachelors degrees. The way I look at it, the time and money I would've spent on graduate school could also buy me a different degree entirely, and in the case of I.T., programming, cybersecurity, a seemingly very fruitful one. So bottom line/ tldr; would a guy possessing a B.S. in pure mathematics (focusing on discrete mathematics such as combinatorics and number theory) from a good university and a lesser, computer-related (non-graduate) degree from a not-so-well-known college hold a candle in the job market to the graduate-school educated cryptologist? Bear in mind several more years spent pursuing a non-mathematics degree after earning my original degree would probably make the math I did learn grow somewhat hazy. Also, any other cryptography, mathematics, and/ or career advice is welcome. Thanks in advance, and sorry for the length!"

(22/UK) I'm currently doing an apprenticeship with a company known worldwide in construction management. However, there will be a gap in between completing my Level 3 (January 2019) and starting my Level 4 (October 2019). I only began this apprenticeship due to having a criminal record and dropping out of university. However, I do enjoy the job and love the people I work with; I also get significant benefits such as private healthcare and expenses. Back to the criminal record thing since its relevant, I was convicted of a crime back when I was abit younger which was cyber-related and was classed as organised crime (specialist unit). Part of the police after care is to help push people into something they are talented at if they fall under a particular age bracket, due to this I was contacted by them to be pushed into something cyber-related such as coding or just general cybersecurity. I'm now in the dilemma where I'm not sure what path to take since I would love an IT job but I was put off with the whole idea since I had a criminal record (police have told me it won't affect my career) and no official IT qualification since I hated school and never went. I'm just entirely unsure if I should pursue construction management or switch into IT - Any advice would be appreciated."

I'm currently working as a CyberSecurity Researcher at a major corporation, with multiple job offerings from other companies. I got this role due to past experience that's absolutely one of a kind and invaluable. I don't yet have a degree yet, but I'm starting a Computer Science degree in the coming semester. The problem is, I've always wanted to be a physicist. A theoretical physicist preferably. Whenever there's something related to physics anywhere I light up and I've known that's what I wanted to be since I was at least 8. But then after school I was given the choice of either: 1. getting a first degree in physics and electronic engineering 2. getting a half-year super-intense course in cybersecurity with 3 years of experience you can't get anywhere else. I wanted to go get the degrees but I was talked into going the cybersecurity path by my parents, my homeroom+physics teacher and friends. But the feeling that I'm just not doing what I love kept nagging me ever since. The main thing stopping me from getting a degree in physics is that there's literally no jobs for people with a first degree in physics here (I live in Israel, by the way). There's this famous joke around here that goes: ""What do you do with a Bachelor in physics? A Masters."" ""What do you do with a Masters in physics? A doctorate."" ""What do you do with a doctorate in physics? R&amp;D in some engineering company where you'll be a glorified engineer"" Plus, working in the high-tech industry is really the only way to sustain yourself financially with dignity. Living costs here are insane and the kind of salary you get doing physics just isn't enough. This brings me to the question: I have a great job with wonderful pay and it's interesting. I'm good at it and I enjoy doing it. **But**, Physics has been my passion in life since I was a kid. I really have no idea what to do."

Always lived paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet for the little one. Now, my little one is grown and getting more and more self sufficient every day. I'm still paycheck to paycheck but I'm in a very stable living situation with a stable pleasant M-F job. I bartend part time as well. I am still relatively young and I have many years ahead of me. I want a career for myself. So badly. I want to have a career, be a professional, pour myself into it entirely, and really devote these next decades to this career. I keep getting tripped up on how to get from this point to that point. I cannot figure out WHAT to pour my energy into. I keep seeing a solid roadblock at every turn. I think I may be overthinking? A few issues with financials: * I have a lot of debt and bad credit. Working on that but that some of it just simply takes time to correct. I can only do so much to speed that up * I have maxed out student loans from previous attempts to complete school. I'm still paying them off and they're in good standing * I have used up all the available Pell grant * Once my son is completely on his own, I can really pare down my life to the bare minimums and get rid of all my debt and fix my finances - but I can't wait to start my career change until then. I'm already pretty ""old"" in terms of careers and new jobs. A few good points: * I live near a solid state university * My state has a solid online only university, fully accredited, but limited programs * Both schools are relatively inexpensive, but still, obviously a few thousand a semester depending on course load * I have a stable job with good hours (out by 4) * The day job is EASY - I have a lot of free time, mostly unsupervised, and unmonitored internet access (obvs they'll take a look if it seems like I'm torrenting or something extra data heavy) and full admin rights to my computer * I have no commute - home is 5 mins away from work * Bartending job is very flexible, even based Problem with local school: * Not much flexibility in terms of scheduling - most classes are during the day * My current boss won't be so kind to being accommodating classes. He really wants me to sit at this dead end job and retire here and will take it personally if I go back to school. I am not really sure if he'll be supportive of me or not. Hard to say. Otherwise, he is crazy accommodating of anything that happens in my life. Problem with online school: * Limited programs and there's mainly a ""general studies"" degree (there's also a business admin and public admin both of which I find interesting) Interests: * Physical fitness - I weight lift and have been curious about strength training for women and young girls - however, I don't know that I'd like to be doing that every single day. I don't know that I have the personality for that career. * Computers/Technology - I really enjoy tinkering with code. I'm doing free code camp right now at work every day. I've taught myself Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier, inDesign, HTML, CSS (all basic stuff, but I love learning it). I played with Python a bit and some Javascript. I enjoy playing with websites for fun. I've done a few websites for clients and, while fun, working with clients was tough. The online school has a ""cybersecurity"" program but I worry that will look like a silly degree (even though I know that field itself is growing.) I enjoy tech security and find it fascinating. I find human computer interaction programs fascinating too and am interested in them. I believe there are several viable online masters program options for this program too. However, I'm worried I'll be too ""old"" to transition into this field now. This is very much a young person's field. I would love to go back for Computer Science but I spoke to the school and most of those classes are during the day, when I am at work. * Technical writing - this appeals to me as a career and I know someone who does this for the science field and they live a great lifestyle and work from home. The physical school has a program for this. I'm worried about going to school for this and not being able to find a job. * Librarian - IDK I have a fantasy about becoming a librarian in either a public or private collection for a bunch of reasons. MLIS programs are online, so, in theory, I could complete one. I love the idea of being in charge of technology programs at a library or at a school library. Again, afraid of not finding a job. * Teaching - this seems like a really nice industry to work in (at least in my area), is definitely friendly to older applicants. I like the idea of being part of the community (also as a librarian) and contributing to the community. I think that maybe it'll be nice as I age to have all those kids around me and be part of the community. In summary, I feel like I am in a mostly great place to make this transition in my life. I am terrified of the wide open that is me health in my 40s, kid is grown, and I have nothing but free time and a bit extra cash. Always living in such tight constraints, having all that freedom is overwhelming. But, I don't want to sit in this dead end job . I want to make some damn money already! I want to feel part of a profession and be proud of being 100% engrossed by it. I want to feel like I am part of the community that I live in. I want to feel proud of what I do already. I am so afraid of starting down a path and realizing it was the wrong path when I have limited time and money to spend. If you've read all of this . . . feedback? Thoughts? Questions? What am I not seeing? Anyone been in a similar situation? what would you do if you were me?"

I was thinking about whether it would make sense to apply and then aim for a trajectory toward becoming an in internal auditor? Questions: Does that path make sense? I know GRC isnt audit but I have no experience in audit and I was thinking this would give me opportunity to get some risk certifications as a start. Would that be useful for going into audit. How much schooling should I expect to have to do? I dont have any IT certs so I know Id have to at least start there. Would it be possible through just certifications or will I have to get another degree? (I read a Masters in IT is preferred but Id rather not go through a whole Bachelors again. And I dont want to quit my job to go back to school if avoidable). What would a typical day of work look like for an auditor? Before I ditch my career to go back to school I want to figure out if its actually something Id really want to do. I like process and I actually like documenting processes. Right now my job involves writing reports about Security metrics and part of that is having other people collect data for me while I ensure the data is correct and the process they use is sound. Im actually documenting the report for audit right now (which is why Ive started thinking about if its something Id want to do). I know its more than just that but Im not sure all of what the role entails. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

I lived in Chicago until last month while working with an employer in a Technology Audit role. I have a non MBA masters degree in Information Systems from a reputed business school in the US. Also have audit experience with one of the Big 4 public accounting firms in the US. Now coming to the situation I find myself in: - option 1: a Cybersecurity Consulting role with another Big 4 in Chicago. Pay is good, I know the role will let me learn a lot which very important to me at this point. Since the role involves heavy travel to client locations, theres visa requirements for each project (given the political climate with respect to immigration and new rules/policies being thrown around by the current administration). If theres delays in the visa processing then my billable hours/utilization will get impacted. Current status: I have this offer right now and the company is processing my visa application for me to be able to return to the US. - option 2: a Technology Audit role with a solid technology company in Amsterdam. Budgeted pay for the position is less than what I had quoted initially, still good nevertheless. Quality of life is fantastic obviously. Role would involve travel as well, so I wouldnt miss that. Time to permanent residence is lower as compared to the US. Current status: I dont have the offer yet. The company is flying me out to Amsterdam for the final round of interviews. What do I do? For the life of me, I am unable to figure out which one I should go ahead with (if I get the AMS offer) because Ive been trying to break into consulting since graduation 4 years ago (overall experience is a little over six years with software engineering experience prior to obtaining extensive tech audit experience) I love living in Chicago and have visited Amsterdam and can see myself living there as well. Although I have audit experience (and not a big fan of auditing to begin with), I have not been involved in audits for tech companies (I have heard from my interviews so far that it will be very dynamic and not the traditional checklist based auditing). At this immediate point the dealbreaker seems to be the pay, and long term the visa situation will evolve the way it unpredictably does in the US. Before people start piling on as to why Im still interviewing after accepting the consulting offer, its basically to have an option if my H1B visa is rejected by the US immigration department. TLDR: non Dutch/US citizen has a consulting offer in Chicago and potential to get an offer in auditing in Amsterdam with heavy audit experience from the US. What should I do if I get the offer in Amsterdam? "

The MIS department just announced a Master's in Business Cybersecurity Management. It's a three semester program and is almost entirely online. I'd love to do the program if not for two things: 1. Money. I'll have roughly $15,000 in loans when I graduate. The M.S. normally costs about $8,600 per semester, but my manager has said that he could hire me as a Grad Assistant, which would allow me to get a tuition waiver, which would bring the cost down to about $5,000 per semester.

When I applied to this job i was unaware that classes had opened up and didnt find out til after I was rehired. The dilemma is that classes run into training. And to make matters worse, it is in the middle of training class. Meaning there isnt a way incan leave training early or arrive late. However I badly want to keep this job. And the advisor doesnt know when the next class starts. So my plan was to go to the site director and talk to him to see what can be done. As someone who doesnt usually talk to people and not very skilled in persuasion, I dont know what I can say to convince him to work with me.

At the moment, I am in my early twenties, have completed my undergraduate degree with multiple majors &amp; minors (business related), employed at 50k/yr, and minimal debt. I have only been working in this position for a few months, and feel that I am becoming stagnant already. This jobs role, and its prospective career path arent exactly a thrilling prospect for me. I have been looking into potential higher education options and am drawn to the following fields: Law or Cyber Security. There are a few obstacles with both options that I will layout here. Challenges of Pursuing Law: Most of the time when I read about work - life balance, overall happiness, and career movement Law has a poor reputation; unless of course you ...are amongst the top of your class, you have family connections, you get lucky, etc.. This is intimidating and frankly nerve racking, because the subject matter and the work itself interest me. The field as a whole has such a large amount of baggage that it leaves me second guessing even pursuing the LSAT, let alone taking the full plunge. Some of the specializations that I am interested in, Health Care, Intellectual Property, and Cybersecurity, are not offered all institutions, and the ones that do offer it are very prestigious schools which Im unsure if I would be able to gain admittance to. My undergraduate GPA was a 3.28. This is not stellar, and leads me to believe that I would be required to score at least a 165 on the LSAT to have a chance. Challenges of Pursuing Cyber Security: The programs that I was able to find typically required some prerequisite courses in advanced mathematics and programming. I would need to take these courses independently at a local community college or online. This is not only a financial cost but a time and opportunity cost because all of the courses would have to be completed before I even began to prepare for the subject of interest: Cyber Security. A significant amount of the Masters programs in Cyber Security are online, and I worry about the credibility of those programs, as well as the benefits they offer. Here is why; while attending college at my undergraduate institution I was able to use numerous facilities on campus, such as a Tutoring center, Career Advice Center, Academic Advisors, etc. I feel that with the lose of this face-to-face interaction will hinder my ability to network and learn about opportunities through the prospective school.One thing that I want to be assured of is that I can successfuly utilize the schools network to find employment after the program is complete. I do not want an advanced degree just to hang it on my wall. Challenges of Pursuing Either: As I stated earlier, I have currently minimal debt (less than 10k). Both programs would cause me to taken on a terrifying amount of debt for completion. By the numbers though, Law School would cost at least double, if not triple, what a Cyber Security degree would cost. Letters of Recommendation - I have only been with my current employer for a few months and dont believe that I could ask anyone here for a Letter yet. Unfortunately, I did not have a teacher or mentor back in my undergraduate program that I feel I could ask for a letter of recommendation either. It has also been a year since I graduated from my University. Both Law School and Cyber Security programs typically call for at least two letters of Recommendation. Professional / Personal Goals: I would want to be fully mentally engaged and challenged in my day to day work. Eventually I would like to be a homeowner. I want Financial Stability. Professional Life and Personal Life - I would like to have both. I do not wish to Live to Work and Work to Live. I may want a family one day - hell - even a dog would be awesome, and I do not want to sacrifice any precious time I have with my significant other - on a consistent basis- just to bump the bottom line of a company a point or two. If there are occasional long days, or even a week, so be it, but I want to be home for dinner more often that not. This is the best I could do on outlining my present concerns about my career and I would greatly appreciate all feedback. Thank you for your time!"
