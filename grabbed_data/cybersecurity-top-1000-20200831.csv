I see a lot of posts coming through here as of late asking some variant of the question: How do I get into cyber security? So I figured I would make this post and hopefully a few people find this information helpful. 


**My background:**


I've been in the IT industry for almost 6 years now. Two in the cybersecurity sector. I have a B.S in Information Technology as well as a handful of certifications. I'm lead Cybersecurity Analyst at a MSP. I perform duties such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, research and development, SOC/SIEM analysis, incident response, digital forensics, I also work closely with other departments in my organization providing various bits of consulting. In addition to my daily duties, I'm an technical escalation point for the systems engineers, create SOPs and training references, assist in onboarding assessments of new customers and more. 


**How to get into cybersecurity:**


Cybersecurity usually requires a vast amount of knowledge which is typically obtainable after a handful of years of experience. When entering cybersecurity, one should have a firm understanding of the following concepts: Networking (tcp/ip stack, protocols, vlans, subnetting, various vpn technologies, ip tables and access control lists, wireless technologies, DHCP, DNS, DNSSEC, routing, packet analysis), networking equipment(firewalls, layer 2 and layer 3 switches, repeaters, bridges, intrusion detection/prevention systems), programming (c, c++, python, java script, SQL, rust), scripting (powershell, bash), servers (domain controllers, DNS servers, application servers, file servers, proxy servers, web servers, email servers, virtualization, load balancing), become familiar with various operating systems (linux, mac, windows (domain vs workgroup setups), how anti virus applications function, Common Attack vectors and how to prevent them, fuzzing applications, incident response (and local laws and regulations regarding incident response), Network scanning, shells/ reverse shells, buffer overflow basics, passive and active information gathering techniques, email header analysis, cryptography and hash functions, cloud environments (Citrix, Azure, O365) and the ability to troubleshoot anything that goes wrong with the above mentioned technologies and finally.... soft skills. 

Soft skills are just as important as the technical ones. You need to be able to convince an irrational organization to upgrade their 200 windows xp machines when ""they work just fine"", or accurately and clearly explain to the customer how they essentially have been paying a hacker to enter their pc once a month to steal their data or bring calm to an organization after an actual data breach and speak with the confidence necessary that the customer believes you when you tell them that you have removed all threats and they are currently secure. You need to be able to explain all of your ideas, concerns and findings to not only the CEO of an organization who's never touched a computer in their life as well as your superior who has more technical knowledge then you could ever hope to attain.


**Getting into cybersecurity:**


The most common way to get into cybersecurity is to start off in an entry level IT position such as help desk, desktop support or some other related role. Having any type of technical bachelor's degree will be very useful here. Take advantage of these jobs as there are a lot of skills to master (see the above list). Always take the initiative, always try to work on issues that are just a little beyond your knowledge. You will work your way up ladder, obtain raises and promotions. Continue to educate yourself beyond what you learn only at work. Complete certifications (hopefully your organization will pay for these), perform home labs, and read. Strive to be the person in the room that everyone looks to for answers. Eventually you will have obtained the level of knowledge required to be successful in cybersecurity (you will also realize how much more you have to learn to be great).

Please note, for all of the skills listed above. You dont necessarily have to have every single skill fully mastered. But you need to be well versed. I would say if your fully competent in about 75 percent ish of the items listed, you could probably start looking for an entry level cyber security position.

With that said, help desk is obviously not the only method for getting into cybersecurity. It's just the most common for most people. The other method would be obtaining proficiency in these areas prior to getting any type of IT job, but the amount of resources and time needed to obtain this level of knowledge before you have to start living on your own (and earn a living) is not feasible for most people. 

Although true entry level (not requiring the above listed skill sets) cybersecurity positions do exist, not only are they very difficult to come by, but the job duties will likely be similar to a generic entry level analyst position where you scan hundreds of logs a day looking for one or two specific anomalies. Further, a position like this will be on the lower wage scale - 30k to 40k a year. There is an inherent level of liability that comes with an organization attempting to approach cybersecurity the right way. And unfortunately that does not typically favor hiring people with little to no experience or knowledge. Hiring an individual who cant recognize the significance (or the lack thereof depending) of a malformed kerberos ticket during an investigation could be the difference in determining if there is a malicious actor on a network (I know that's bit of an extreme example, but hopefully you get my point).


**Exceptions:**


I am well aware that there are exceptions to every rule. And I'm sure there are plenty of people who managed to get into the technical realm of cybersecurity that broke every principle outlined above. That's awesome and you should share your stories. But again, this post covers the most common method for most people attempting to enter this industry. 

Please feel free to follow up with any questions.

During the drive, my brother and I started talking about podcasts. Then my brother mentioned NordVPN, a popular ad on podcasts nowadays. He had no idea what VPN's did, so I explained it to him. That led into me teaching him about secure tunneling, encryption protocols, port security, mitm attacks, and other related topics. As someone who constantly deals with impostor syndrome, easily explaining these topics made me feel great about myself. Cybersecurity is ginormous and nobody knows everything, but compared to the average Joe, I'm sure you all know a lot more than they do. Keep studying and stay on the journey.",2020-07-31 14:35:41

They have essentially no protocol in place. No one was doing this before. I'm keen on trying to hang on to this responsibility, but I have no formal training, no certifications, no real experience in this field.

This company is fortunately not under a lot of scrutiny, but expects to appear on more radars soon and is trying to prepare. We'll be hiring a security consultant at some point but hope to not get laughed at when we bring in someone who knows what they're doing, and it's now my job to get us ready for that moment.

195,Have a SOC interview coming up? Here‚Äôs some common questions.,423,hq7pis,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/hq7pis/have_a_soc_interview_coming_up_heres_some_common/,99,1594638616.0,"1.) How can you detect/prevent SQL injection?

2.) what is the most common SQL injection tool?

3.) Name atleast 3 vulnerability scanners and patterns to identify them

4.) whats the difference between XSS and XSRF

5.) XSS and why it‚Äôs bad, how would you rank it‚Äôs severity

6.) what is a TCP handshake, what‚Äôs the difference between TCP and UDP, how does SSL work?

7.) describe how heartbleed or a Poodle attack works

8.) can you write snort rules?

9.) can you configure Ip tables

10.) what are the OWASP top 10?

11.) difference between IDS and IPS

12.) OSI model and how it pertains to this job.

‚Äî edit ‚Äî

Another one I was asked that‚Äôs kinda important is how to check services running (netstat)

Also experience is the most important as people said in this thread even if it‚Äôs just setting up a Splunk server in a VM and attack the machine and see if you can catch it in the logs. I had a 3 month summer internship in a SOC and it‚Äôs by far what most interviews ask about (tools used, how I went about security incident investigations (mainly phishing since that was my main duty) and I‚Äôve made it to the final round in 3 interviews. But hard to beat out people with years of experience especially with cloud based security experience

Most places have done the following that I‚Äôve applied to

1.) first interview is a 15-30 min phone call with HR with basic questions to see if you‚Äôd fit

2.) Some sort of skills assessment / personality test

3.) interview with Hiring manager / team lead and CISO / director of information security

4.) I‚Äôve had to interview with the CISO after the hiring manager once when he wasn‚Äôt available for the interview with the team lead",2020-07-13 21:10:16

They integrate into your iPhone/Android directly. You will have to commit to it but once your integrated it‚Äôll make life easy to just trust bitwarden or whatever one you choose.

You can also have it generate unique passwords that you will never remember.  But if it‚Äôs hacked they suddenly can‚Äôt log into 5 other sites.

Bitwarden is what I use. It‚Äôs Open source and free. There is a paid option that gives you some storage and additional password checking.

Update how you deal with passwords!

Also chrome and Firefox have upped their game and their password managers now recommend unique passwords as well.

I‚Äôll update this thread with a better list of options when I have some time, sorry for rant but tired of seeing ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been hacked‚Äô

Edit: nothing in life is safe, could these be hacked... or your password for the password manager be hacked/guessed, or a Trojan on your computer? yes but use 2fa for that as well as an extra layer of security.

319,Social Engineering Attacks from China on Tinder (and Bumble) ?,295,hyuod5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/hyuod5/social_engineering_attacks_from_china_on_tinder/,76,1595893485.0,"For quite a while now I get a very disproportionately high number of matches with chinese girls (about 1-2 a day compared to maybe 1 non-chinese match a day, despite chinese profiles only making up for max 5% of the profiles I see and swipe on). Almost all of these matches behave in a similar, suspicious manner:

\- They are not bots. I can't tell of course if their profile pictures are real, but it's a real person communicating  
\- They usually state that they are on some business trip or so and they ask about my job fairly early into the conversation (usually they initiate the conversation, then the second message is some form of asking where I am from and then quite soon follows some question related to my job. It's never the same text though and I'm confident it's not copy pasted messages)  
\- They usually want to exchange phone numbers or other social media fairly quickly and when I tell them that I don't want to give out private data before I get to know someone better, they unmatch me

The most suspicious thing about it is the distance though: The profiles are either shown to be about 9'200 km far away (which is about the distance of the city I live in to Hongkong) or the profiles show as 1km far away (there are only very few that are some normal distance, like something between 5-50km).

When I ask them why their profile shows them to be in close proximity despite them saying that they are in mainland china (or in hongkong or singapore on a business trip or so) they say they are using Tinder passport to set their location to switzerland and find matches there. When I then point out that Tinder passport is not actually changing the distance reported on the profile, I usually get unmatched.

I also noticed that when I drive with my car after having matched, the distance increases from 1km, so they must have specifically spoofed the gps location to be as close to me as possible, meaning they likely triangulated my exact location.

Especially the last part I find pretty unsettling and was wondering whether anyone else on Tinder noticed a similar increase of matches with chinese girls (especially those that claim they are in China/HongKong or that they just were on a business trip in the country you reside or will travel there soon).

Is this some new type of scam?",2020-07-28 09:44:45

I have no IT experience, just basic technology knowledge, and passed on my first go around. Only studied for 3-4 weeks using Professor Messer‚Äôs videos and the GCGA book.

Now, how can I *actually* get into the field lol? What roles should I look to obtain to simply get my foot in the door?",2020-08-29 18:27:55

There's a lot of methods out there and some work for some people, but everyone works/learns differently. I spent some time putting together some diagrams that I thought kind of helped make it click from a visual perspective. I posted one on subnetting a week or so ago and folks seemed to really like it. I received a lot of comments after asking how you add larger subnets together (i.e. supernetting). This videos shows how easy it is to add networks together and walks you through a process that is easy to understand and remember! Please ask questions (I'm happy to answer) or give comments (I'm happy to correct anything).

I wanted to ask for some advice on how to make it in the Cyber Security field. I've done some research, but a lot of sites are not giving the nitty-gritty in terms of:

&#x200B;

* What Cyber Security software to start looking at/brushing upon?
* What coding languages are important to understand?
* What kind of questions should I prepare for during an interview?
* What is honestly the day-to-day responsibilities of a Cyber Security Analyst?
* Do I need any GitHub projects or any type of project at all to showcase my work? If so, where do I start? What do I do?

Some facts about myself to give a better idea:

* I have about 5 years of general IT experience
* I'm currently studying for the Sec+
* I plan to earn an AA in CompSci then transfer to a university for a BS in CompSci with a focus on Cyber Security.

I'm not looking for a ""fast track"" way how to get there, I really want to learn the know-how of certain tools, and get into a better mindset so I can comprehend what is actually needed as a Cyber Security professional. I've coasted by for a few years now, and I've felt aimless- now I want to specialize in something, and Cyber Security always clicked with me.

I keep meeting ""security professionals"" who'd struggle to match the technical expertise of a help desk admin.

Cases:

**1:** My company just brought on someone with a Master's in Cybersecurity from an online school, and had 10 years of experience working risk compliance for a prestigious government contractor. I got to talking with him and he didn't know what a VM was. No, I am not joking. There is plenty more to say about this person, but let's move on.

**2:** I keep hearing security professionals bring up absurd concerns during meetings with management meant to determine how our budget is spent. Concerns like ""if we allow speakers, they can be turned into microphones and steal keystrokes from our air-gapped devices."" Yes, we've all read that article talking about that theoretical attack, but when actual pressing issues like {insert pretty serious vulns here} exist. They can't prioritize hypothetically NAC or MFA over expensive countermeasures for the latest scary Wired article.

**3:** I meet otherwise highly credentialed people who struggle with basic IT concepts. What I will list here is more forgivable than the previous two, but still worth mentioning. Issues like not knowing theoretically how a DMZ is set up, not knowing the difference between a subnet and a VLAN, failing to understand the difference between giving someone limited admin rights vs giving every sysadmin domain admin, etc etc.

Let me make this clear: I am NOT talking about folks with less than 5 years experience. We should embrace our up and coming security professionals. But I feel like I am surrounded by people who have no business being in security who are there simply because organizations can't fill those roles with anyone else.

453,So i'm pretty sure I caught a Bitcoin Miner.,211,gn3af3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/gn3af3/so_im_pretty_sure_i_caught_a_bitcoin_miner/,76,1589972006.0,"So the past couple of weeks I've noticed that my computer refuses to go into sleep mode. Instead it turn off my monitors but wouldn't fully sleep as I could hear the fans still running loudly and when I return to my PC it would wake up straight to the desktop without prompting the Password. So I was sure it wasn't actually going into sleep mode. I put I kept pushing back the diagnosing and fixing this issue every day.

Then earlier today I opened up a program called ""Fiddler"" which is used to monitor HTTP/HTTPS connections on the machine for a completely unrelated reason. However I notice a connection to a web address that was very unusual. It linked to a config file which contained a Cryptocurrency address, some options such as stopping and starting the Miner as well as the mining pool. It even has the title ""\[Miner\]"".

I noticed a option that was toggled on called ""keepalive"" which I can now only assume is the reason why my PC wouldn't go into sleep mode. I tried to recreate this connection by opening different applications while monitoring the connections but I couldn't recreate it. So I decided to leave my PC unattended with Fiddler running for a little while. And when I came back, sure enough my PC didn't sleep and was still awake with the same connection showing up on Fiddler again.

As crazy as this sounds, this got me excited as I'm really into cyber security but I can't find the source of the issue and It started to get frustrating. Soon I'll be reinstalling windows and accepting defeat.

The url of the config is [http://jonathanhardwick.me/config.txt](http://jonathanhardwick.me/config.txt) . I believe this address is only used to tell what the Miner should do. So I don't believe it's dangerous at all. Posting the url is only to educate people and to make people aware of this method and to watch out in the future if anyone believes they might have a Miner running, or their PC refusing to sleep then the same might have happened to you and you can prevent it from doing anymore harm.

EDIT: Fixed the link (I miss typed it.)

The individual posts tend to get lost in the shuffle, so people may not get the advice they need- especially given the time zone differences. So, new rule. Every Monday, we'll be opening up a ""Mentorship Monday"" thread, which will be stickied for the duration of that week. It's a free space for asking anything about cybersecurity as a career, from what certs are recommended to advice on handling common issues. 

If you're new to the field, or if you're established and need some advice, post your questions there! If you're an experienced cybersecurity professional, please check it out and share your wisdom. 

All other career-related posts will be removed and referred to the weekly thread.",2019-07-01 09:32:18

Certifications are great, but certifications without any practical experience are not going to get you in the door, or if they do you won't be there long when you can't actually do the job

certifications are not a substitute for actual experience, you need to treat them as professional development and you get the on the way while you're actually working in different roles

just taking several SANs courses and cert exams, won't actually make you a pen-tester",2019-11-20 09:53:16

568,How I got an entry-level cybersecurity role.,162,b725bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/b725bg/how_i_got_an_entrylevel_cybersecurity_role/,38,1553919466.0,"So I spent a lot of time on /r/Cybersecurity /r/ITcareerquestions and /r/HomeLab for the past year and a half as I‚Äôve tried to break into security and I just landed an entry level role as a Security Analyst. I thought I‚Äôd share my story here as I was in the same boat as a lot of you two years ago (no relevant degree/certs, no real IT experience, vague idea of security, lots of discouragement from negative people on forums, etc.) .   





I had a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in philosophy and about 3 years of job experience doing technical writing, operations management, and other roles but I knew that I wanted to go into IT. I decided to apply for a Master‚Äôs in Information Systems Operations Management to get that technical skillset/street cred. Towards the end of my degree I pretty much had my sights set on security. I loved the classes and it just seemed like a badass field (hacking, secrets, cryptography, etc.) so I decided to dedicate the next year and a half to making myself the ideal candidate for a security position.  



As my first step, I applied for a desktop support role at the university I was studying at and got the job. Here‚Äôs what factored into that:    




-the nature of my degree  

-even though my most recent role was not officially IT related, I helped on a ton of IT projects and pushed that as much as I could in the interview  

-tried to push the fact that even though I did not have an extremely intensive IT background, I had a lot of customer service/people skills which is invaluable in a desktop support environment when dealing with difficult situations/people  

-researched desktop support interview questions and just general good interview preparation  
  




(the fact that I was a student in the university which the job was held did not factor into me getting the job so don‚Äôt be discouraged about that. The hiring manager didn‚Äôt know I attended school until my first day of work).   
  



From my literal first day, after meeting anybody with a vaguely IT related role I would ask ‚Äúdo you do anything security related?‚Äù. From there, I got bits and pieces from everybody as time went on and learned about security from an actual IT environment. I cannot overestimate how much this helped my understanding of security. This extra step is what will make the most of your desktop support role.  

  


After a few months on the job, I delved into a bunch of security projects at home. I started watching Security+ cert training videos and built a home lab. I made my own pentesting kit with a small pi kit and made my own personal VPN using Amazon Web Services / Google Cloud platform.  

  


At this point, I just start applying like crazy. DevOps, IT Architect, SysAdmin, Security Analyst etc. I used Linkedin, monster, indeed, my own university, etc. I made sure to have my linkedin profile looking as best as I could, making sure my settings were open to recruiters, adding my skills and hounding my friends to endorse my skills if they had seen me use them in class or on personal projects.  
  



A few months into applying a recruiter contacted me about a Security Analyst role. I learned as much as I possibly could about the company, researched their employees on linkedin, and read every kind of relevant security interview preparation that I could find online. I made it through the rounds and got the offer.   
  



They loved the fact that I had a homelab (you should check out that subreddit by the way, /r/homelab its awesome) and they actually outright asked ‚Äúdo you have a homelab‚Äù which I thought was crazy. It gave me something tangible to talk about and showed that I was clearly interested in security. The homelab was also a great way to learn about basic networking concepts which is ESSENTIAL to security.   
  


Also, all the probing I did at worked helped me talk about my desktop support experience like it was a security job. I‚Äôve found the title doesn‚Äôt matter as much as the experiences you can talk about from that position.  The security+ videos helped a lot too. Even though I never went and got the certification, watching the videos helped me understand basic security and totally helped me get through the interview process. (The best youtube channel to practice for security+ is ‚ÄúProfessor Messer‚Äù. His guides for all IT certs are free, quick, informative, and just all around awesome.)
  
  


So yeah, all of the above took a long time, but definitely worth it. I am by no means an expert in cybersecurity, but I literally just made small progress every week which really accumulated over a year and a half. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions and honestly, I‚Äôm just here to say that you can do it too!",2019-03-30 15:17:46

This is just my suggestion after 13 years in industry. You Do You.

&#x200B;

So many people on here ask these questions. 

* Where should I Start?
* Should I go into Cybersecurity?
* Should I major in Cybersecurity?
* I want to be a hacker, how can I do that?
* And, others

I feel like when I see people saying ""I want to be in cybersecurity,"" what they are really saying is ""I want to be a hacker.""

That's fine and all, but cybersecurity is WAY more than being a hacker, and that's the point of this post.

**My Background**

I am not ""in cybersecurity"" by education. I am an electrical engineer with over 10 years experience in avionics embedded systems engineering including software, firmware, and unit->system level testing, to include flight testing. I've enjoyed so much the engineering side of my career, and honestly I miss it sometimes.  At one point, it became apparent that ""we"" weren't ""doing cybersecurity"", and that it was a a big problem. (Note: I'm keeping details extremely vague on purpose) The most common thought with most of the engineers around me was ""cybersecurity isn't that big of a deal in our industry,"" and quite frankly I agreed. So when my leadership saw an eager engineer who is always looking for a challenge and willing to self-improve to meet any challenge head on, they volun-told me to get ""cyber smart.""  About a week later I was told I was registered for a Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) bootcamp, and about 2 months later I was certified (Praise the Lord!!! That test was HARD!)

&#x200B;

Anywho, so here I am, a certified Cyber professional with less than 6 months experience ACTUALLY focusing on cybersecurity. Since then, I went on to get my CISSP (really easy after taking the CSSLP) and being assigned a primary technical cybersecurity SME position for billions of dollars in assets) yay!

&#x200B;

**My Philosophy on Professional Education**

A little over 25 years ago, the most sought after degrees and profession was Internet Technology (IT). People flocked to this. Yes, that includes programmers, but I'm specifically pointing out those that went into traditional IT (firewalls, AD, etc). While those jobs still exist they have in many ways waned over the years due to increased automation, decreased expenses on personnel, and simple supply/demand. Why pay an IT person with a degree X dollars when I can pay someone with a Security + or A+ Y dollars less?  Right wrong or indifferent that IS the current job market landscape.  

We are poised for this to happen again. Cybersecurity ""degrees"" and ""certifications"" are the new IT degrees and 10-20 years from now, you'll be either searching for a job or pigeon-holed into a career that you cannot advance from. Many of the tools that are being built are automating a lot of the ""Secure,"" ""Detect,"" and eventually ""Protect"" and ""Respond."" And, clearly with the huge national (and international) push for cybersecurity professionals there will be a LOT of supply.  So, what does that mean? Does that mean a ""cybersecurity degree"" is useless?  Not at all. Like everything it has its purpose.  I think it is very important to ask yourself ""where do I want to be after 10 years in my career"" not ""what do i want to do for a starting job.""  Understand that programming and ""hacking"" are entry level positions in many ways. If you want to stay there, then you'll want to expect to stay at that wage-level. It isn't all bad news of course, because you can be a SME or an ""lead,"" and if that is what you love, why would you want to do anything else? However, the importance of asking ""where do I want to be after 10 years"" is because a pigeon-holed technical degree may not get you there (though it might).  

&#x200B;

**So what are you really saying?**

While there are a LOT of job openings looking for ""cybersecurity professionals"" there are many more jobs looking for ""Scientists and Engineers."" And, many more jobs looking for ""MBAs,"" and ""Accountants,"" etc.  ""Wait a minute, this is a cybersecurity channel!?""  Yes, and the very best cybersecurity professionals that I've run into in the last 5 years have been those that have vectored from another career path and APPRECIATE the mission, business, technical challenges of implementing cybersecurity measures.  You see, many IT people whoa re cybersecurity people understand how to lock down a firewall, but they don't understand how to lock down a CNC laser mill that is used for titanium manufacturing. However, an industrial engineer turned cybersecurity professional does!  Or, how to apply Security Policies to the (ANCIENT) Windows XP machine running that MRI machine at the hospital, but a medical technical with a Security+ does!

You see, it is the professional education PLUS cybersecurity philosophies that is needed in the ""REAL"" world, especially in the world of cyber-physical systems.

What about those MBAs or Accountants I mentioned? And MBA or Accountants with cybersecurity knowledge is going to be able to understand that Incident Response Plan, Continuity Plan, etc and understand why it is important and how it can actually SAVE the company many. Wow...can you imagine a situation where you have a Senior manager, President, or CEO that has a CISSP?! They would have a MUCH better understand of their cybersecurity group's challenges than one without.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

**Please remember that this is just my opinion.** We are still early in the development of the ""cybersecurity professional"" degrees and course-wares, and potentially they will get very good. If you don't mind being pigeon-holes in your career, then that might be the perfect solution for you. However, if I am a manager at a company, and what I really need is another engineer, but I have GOT to get this cybersecurity thing figured out, and I see an EE with a CISSP/CSSLP/Secure+/ETC, then that person just hit the top of my list.  If I'm a MBA with a CISSP, I have a very good chance of getting promoted because I have a better understand of the cyber challenges to the company.

In my line of work, we have a statement ""Cybersecurity is everyone's job"".  Well if you believe that, then no matter what career path you are in, I recommend investing in a Security+ and eventually a CISSP, because you will DRAMATICALLY increase your value to your company.

I apologize if this subject matter has been brought up a million times, but I'm having issues landing my first level 1 type Infosec Analyst role.

Very short career synopsis, have around 8 years helpdesk, management, and sysadmin experience. Some experience also learning things like C and programming simple firmware for a startup I worked at. One of my natural abilities is being able to understand what's going on quickly, solve tricky technical challenges, and even come up with some custom solutions.

Fell in love with Information Security a few years ago, strangely didn't discover it was its own field until 2016 or so. Sent out resumes immediately and was landing interviews, but passed none of them. Was told I was close, two hiring managers even contacted me after and said there was an internal debate between hiring me or someone else, and if I would have just had a cert or something like Security+ that would have been a tipping point. I took that advice to heart.

Last 3 years take current ""everyman"" IT job and spent all free time self-learning and credentialing up, got Security+ and 3 other certs, sat for my Associate of ISC2 some months ago, in reality just to test where I was in the spectrum. Felt like I was failing the whole time, but surprisingly passed, turned in my work history highlighting the areas where I touched security and they made me full CISSP.

I'm enrolled in PWK for OSCP now to round out more technical knowledge and keep my terminal skills sharp. I also practice on HackTheBox when I can (working through retired boxes).

Here's the issue, I've been now trying to interview for my first level 1 Information Security Analyst type position, and I'm getting rejection after rejection after the interviews - 7 rejections in the past 6 months (2 of which said they'd make an offer, but switched at the last minute).

I guess this is the reason I'm posting this now - I had one yesterday that was so brutal that I'm still kinda rattled from it. I basically walked into a firing zone of 6 vs 1, for over an hour and a half, very complex scenarios involving memory forensic analysis, specific artifacts, shellcode/malware/debugging/assembly analysis, legal implications, surrounded by a ton of ""gotcha"" and ""IT bingo"" type questions (""name all the Regional Internet Registries"" being one that stood out). I was able to wiggle through quite a few of the scenarios with deductive reasoning, but one of the interviewers even said ""I think you'd have a tough time in this field."" As I was walking out, I was questioning everything.

And this is for only a level 1 position.

I almost felt like apologizing for wasting these people's time.

Prior to trying to push into this industry, my callback rate for regular IT / sysadmin was typically around 90% - very rarely did I not get the position I interviewed for.

Has this been typical for anyone else?",2020-01-05 15:59:02

I was making $35K in my previous job with no room for advancement. I have a BA in Music. I decided to completely flip the script and pursue an IT degree in Information Assurance/Cybersecurity. I was able to get into the program by completing my A+ certification in August. Here I am, now with basic certs (ITIL Foundation, A+, Net+, CIW Site Development Assoc., CIW Web Security Assoc., and working on Sec+).

I am still struggling to find a Help Desk job. All postings that I see require 2-3 years experience on Help Desk...for Help Desk. I know that the pandemic has made it difficult to get an interview, but my understanding is that even without a BS degree in IT, you pretty much just need to be able to breathe for Help Desk. I could be wrong. My university program mentor says I need to be shooting higher than Help Desk, but I can't even grab an interview for that. I know it's hard to get into the industry initially, and the only tangible experience I have is my own pentest lab (Kali, Ubuntu, mostly dabbling in Wireshark and Zenmap) and school experience. I am US-based, but I am really scratching my head as to what I need to do to stand out to potential employers. Do they need to see the BS degree? Any pointers will be much appreciated!

In addition to the years of experience, they often require degrees and/or certifications. In comparison, nursing entry level jobs are exactly that, entry level, meaning they require nothing more than being licensed. In other words, they don't ask for years of experience.

Brief background on myself: I originally transitioned into this field from an IT role, and have extensive experience in both Information Security and Cybersecurity. Over the years, I have worked across the industry spectrum (Banking and Finance, Industrial, Education, Healthcare, Automobiles, Tech and Social Media). My certifications include: [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#), [MCITP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcitp-certification.aspx), [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-routing-switching.html).

I enjoy teaching and giving back to the community - I volunteer for at-risk youth organizations teaching CISSP certifications, and contribute regularly to industry newsletters like [SANS](https://www.sans.org/newsletters/).

Currently I'm helping develop the curriculum for Springboard's [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/cybersecurity) course - which is geared towards professionals who are looking to transition into the field and get certified.

If you are exploring a career in this field, here is a list that will help you get started:

1) Familiarize yourself with web application security resources like [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page): this will give you a good understanding of the top software security risks to internet applications.

2) Start exploring tools that are utilized in app security: like this vendor - https://www.qualys.com/.

3) Participate in online application security projects and forums: [Github](https://github.com/) has a collection of code and project collaboration you could get involved in now. Type ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù in the search box and a list of projects will appear.


Happy to answer any questions you have!

Edit: Thanks for the love y'all - these are all great questions! I'm in Germany currently, and will hit the sack right now. Keep the questions coming, I'll check back first thing in the morning and answer all the open queries.",2018-04-26 11:27:01

Everybody at this residency was asleep and we didn‚Äôt know what was even going on. They said that the call was from my family members number and was under their name, but nobody called. My family remember received at call shortly before the cops came from a  random looking local number, but didn‚Äôt answer. My family member tried calling back but the phone was out of service. The phone number that the call was from was a number that was a home phone number that is now a fax number that goes directly to the fax machine and it gets forwarded to my family members phone. How could anything like this occur? I know spoofing numbers exist but calling the cops is another thing. Please help. I am very scared.

737,Sub Update,114,hyjn7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/hyjn7b/sub_update/,10,1595844647.0,"Hi all,

We're taking this opportunity to publish a quick Subreddit update.

/u/HeyGuyGuyGuy has done outstanding work these last few months keeping the education resources thread up to date. We've invited him to join us as a Moderator, and also created a new space for the work he's been putting together. There is a new Wiki Page to maintain a full list of resources that are available, as well as we will be adding a Calendar to the sidebar so you can see what events are coming up. Alongside the 'Upcoming CyberSecurity Events' wiki page we're hoping to add two others, 'How do I get into CyberSecurity' and a general FAQ. We're asking for submissions from the community for both of these pages.

The new education page of the wiki can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/wiki/education

Additionally if you're using the 'new' Reddit, there should be a link at the top of the page.

There is also going to be some changes to allowed content. Firstly, we will be removing the ability to post images. Memes/Funny Images/Screenshots of bad recruitment requirements/etc don't have a place here. We are unsure on how to proceed with the 'Have I been Hacked/Do I have Malware' type posts, and would like your feedback. Should we allow these posts in this subreddit? Finally, we will be taking action against newsbots that spam the subreddit. Anyone who regularly posts link content to external news sites / youtube / etc will be requested to restrict their posting to one post every two days. Sometimes some of these articles are interesting, and over time some of them have been significantly upvoted, however we don't want the sub to just devolve into a news aggregation service. Additionally, any post by a organisation where there is some kind of ad to the organisations services within (even if it's a mostly educational blog) will be required to flair their post with ""CORPORATE BLOG"" as a disclaimer.

Whenever there is a significant security incident or event (Windows DNS Vuln or Twitter Hack) there is always a rash of threads that pop up with news articles about it. It's sort of an unwritten policy, here and in other subreddits, that generally it's best to only have one thread active about a significant event at a time. After some messages that have come through, I'm now writing it down. Whenever there is a significant security event, please look through the sub and if there is already a thread post whatever you were going to post to the comments of that thread. Rather than having five or six different threads about the same event, it's best to only have the one thread in order to collect discussion all in one place. Any posts on the same news topic in the same 24 hour period will be removed and redirected to the existing thread. Whenever there is a serious incident or vulnerability we will either create a megathread or a relevant flair to collect all discussion under one heading.

For a moment there were regular 'Mentorship' threads. Unfortunately AutoMod is causing problems across Reddit with it's scheduler. I'm going to manually be adding these threads semi-regularly until we can sort it out. I hope that the Reddit chatroom that we will be opening can assist here - new or old to CyberSecurty, please check out the Security Career Development Group under chatrooms in the sidebar.

Summary of Rule Changes: 
* 1 [UPDATED] - No Low Effort / Poor Quality Posts. Memes / Screenshots of 'security fails' / etc are covered under this rule. 
* 6 [UPDATED] - NO ADVERTISING. Accounts that regularly post only links to external content are requested to limit their posting to once every two days, at risk of ban. Additionally, educational articles or blogs which contain advertisement for a service within are to flair their posts with ""CORPORATE BLOG"" 
* 8 [NEW] - Threads about ongoing security incidents may be removed and redirected to a main thread to collect discussion in one place.

Summary of what we need from you:

* Any submission for 'How do I get into CyberSecurity' or 'FAQ'.

I am set to begin a masters in Cyber Security within the next month. Unfortunately I have never worked a tech job yet so I'm lacking experience. I have applied to numerous job listings and have not even received a call back. I'm beginning to feel a little discouraged. Would gaining at least a couple of certifications such as the A+ or Security+ make a huge difference? Since this has happened I have also began to question whether I should even pursue a graduate degree in Cyber Security as it seems like the bachelor's degree can't even land me a job on it's own. Has anyone else been through this before? I apologize for all of the questions, I've just began to accumulate more stress than I would have imagined. I would greatly appreciate any reccommendations or advice. Thank you",2019-08-03 19:26:51

I have a computer science degree and I am currently a support engineer, support applications with python/java scripting as well as some shell scripting. However I am looking to eventually get into cyber security, hence me studying/passing the certification test. 

The issue is now...I have zero hands on experience with networking, which I had learned in my study is a huge part of cyber security lol. And I have learned that there really isnt an ""entry level"" cyber security role, because theres so much to learn in order to get caught to speed. I have been trying to watch videos and do some labs with Wireshark, Snort, BurpSuite, however I feel I am not *learning* the material. 

Are there any roles prior that are recommended, people have spoken to me about help desk IT roles. I am no way bashing help desk IT positions, ever since working professionally I have a huge respect for the role, the diverse knowledge needed as well as pressure. However I am not sure that would be the best route considering I spent a large amount of money for a degree and the degree isnt always necessary for those roles. Are there any sites/courses I should take a look at that can help me ease into things?

I just need someone to point into a direction and I will go full speed down that path. Because when i take a step back, if I were to ever get an interview for a Cyber Security position, besides programming, I dont think I would have much to speak about.",2020-01-20 12:13:14

Yesterday I received an angry phone call from one of our customers asking why I was demanding payment on one of our invoices that was A: not even due yet and B: paid last week.  After going back and forth with her for a while she finally forwarded me the email she received.  So at first glance the email appeared to be legit. It had my first and last name, my email signature, it was referencing a real invoice and job site.  When I looked closer at the sender I noticed the changed an i to an L in our email domain.  So for example they made John Smith <john.smith@rockpipe.com> to John Smith <john.smith@rockplpe.com>.  So unless you are actually looking for it it's very convincing.  They were basically asking our customer to remit payment right away and providing our ""new"" ACH information.  Luckily the customer called me on the phone and we were able to resolve it, but we could have lost $18k if they followed the email without question.  Not only that, but the same thing happened to one of our subcontractors with us.  A fake email followed up asking us to remit payment for an invoice and providing new banking information.  We also caught that before anything was sent out.  I called our I.T. company and they couldn't detect any 

My questions are:


1. How do these people get access to legitimate information to follow up on? They referenced a real invoice and the corresponding job site.

2.  Is there any way to prevent this from happening in the future?

3.  Is there any way to stop it from going out to any of our future customers.

Over the years I've helped them try to be secure online (simple things - making sure their wifi has a password, teaching them how to identify scams, etc). However as they get older I'm finding they remember less about what I taught them, are less able to learn how to protect themselves, and as a result are becoming more susceptible to scams (phishing and phone scams), which is only getting worse as the level of sophistication for scammers increases. Recently my father answered the phone and said ""Oh it's Microsoft, they need something from my computer.."" this classic scam was something he would have hung up on just a few years ago, but now it seems he's beginning to take it at face-value.

I live across the country from them, so I'm not around to help them on a day-to-day basis. Given that I basically cannot trust them to be aware of what is happening, what are some things I can do to help ensure they're staying safe?

Some ideas I have so far:

* Install remote admin tools on their computer so I can make sure everything is up to date and provide support
* Ensure good AV is installed on their PC's
* Set up their Windows accounts as non-admin accounts
* Install a pi-hole on their home network an subscribe to several malware lists

I'm not sure how to:

* Protect their email better from phishing and scams
* Protect their phone to prevent phone scams

Thank you for any advice or suggestions, this isn't an easy topic.

Being in the industry for 20 years I know behind the scenes how things really work, the decisions that are made and not made and the reasons why. I also know how most breaches occur from internal failures from negligence, Na√Øvety , or pure ignorance. Now, I am looking for yours.

The stories I am looking for are ones that I can spin into an educational message but also reveal reality.

Here are some examples of stories -

\- Arguing with the Chief Architecture Officer that internally across 3,000+ databases, active directory and hundreds of internal web applications in a Fortune 100 company has zero SSL deployed. The reason, the CAO said it caused too much overhead on performance and they were behind the firewall.

\- Arguing with a Director on a project who came up with an idea, that almost went forward, to send all the internal Active Directory passwords to a 3rd party company in case the Siteminder Federation authentication broke, the users could login directly at the 3rd party with their internal credentials. Nightly feed to the client, all internal accounts, clear passwords. (this one actually made it to a project decision step)

\- Simply discovering a breach, covering it up internally and telling no one during the fix.

Those are the reality shocks I'd like to hear. Fully, 100% anonymous. No names, no companies or descriptions that would identify the company. Any names of people submitted I'll change anyway.

Send them to [bblogger@protonmail.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ac6sk6/i_am_looking_for_your_cybersecurity_horror_stories/mailto:bblogger%40protonmail.com) and maybe if they are legit sounding enough I'll get enough to do an episode series on them.

The truth hurts sometimes and the real behind the scenes stories need to be heard.

It just feels like most of the people have so much more advantages over me in this field, they are switching from being developers or so and my knowledge of languages ends with english and russian.",2019-04-22 11:31:05

I am wondering, if I were to narrow down my skill set to a specific field, what role, or job title pays the most in the cyber security space. Or should I ask the more important question, which skill will always be needed by any organization in order to be that valuable member they cannot just simply remove?

I am currently skilled in this order, top being best,

1- Digital Forensics ->  Malware analysis and reverse engineering.

2- Pentesting, both networks and websites -> Hacking in general

3- Coding, some basic to intermediate python coding, still have no real life examples of work as of now.

What should I focus on, what do companies need nowadays?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",2019-09-15 13:04:17
