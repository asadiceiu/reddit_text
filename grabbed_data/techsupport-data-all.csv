0,vulnerability,techsupport,How much of a risk is it to use old computer hardware that still has updated software?,1,i6v2vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/i6v2vk/how_much_of_a_risk_is_it_to_use_old_computer/,2020-08-10 10:59:58,"Sorry that isn't a tech issue that has already happened, I'm looking for ways to prevent one from happening. **For context:** I have a 10 year old laptop that I was thinking of re-purposing to be my ""secure"" computer. What I mean is I won't use it for anything else except for online banking, online purchases, checking my coinbase account, those sort of uses. I think it would improve my security if I kept all this stuff on a separate machine than the computer I use for everything else. The only things that will be installed is Windows 10, Firefox with uBlock origin, and Malwarebytes free for manual scans. **To elaborate on my question:** Even with all the software and OS up to date, will using dated hardware expose me to malware attack vectors? For example maybe the bios or firmware of the integrated ethernet adapter could have some kind of vulnerability exposed after 10 years? Is this a likely possibility my computer could get infected this way, or am I just being overly paranoid?"

You can read the posts in my profile for more information. If I have reason to suspect my phone was hacked, or my SIM being compromised, what can I do to verify? And how vulnerable is FREEDOM MOBILE? Do they filter OTA SMS? Does their SIM have the vulnerability for S@T commands? if I had iMessage on to what extent would my carrier know what happened?

Is the disk utility / factory reset process as [recommended by Apple](URL the most you can really do? I've read of [some viruses surviving this process](URL The equivalent for iPhone would be the ""Erase all settings and contents"" (often recommended) vs. a proper DFU restore (more thorough). Thanks!

I searched for him on linkedin and found him, no connections nothing. At this point i decided to check when did i first received an email. 8 months ago. It was a confirmation number for LinkedIn account creation, which to my surprise, was ""read"". I was simply just too curious and i thought, well if the account was created with my email i can for sure click on the mail link and it'll l redirect me to his profile, well.. It did redirect me to ""my"" profile somehow. I have no idea how but, a protonmail account which is not linked to my linkedin profile re-directed me straight to my profile (loggued in) .

I'm not talking about a server having open vulnerabilities like Bluekeep etc. Say for example my machine has a dormant worm. I connect to a server using Administrator credentials. Could the dormant worm on my client hop through mstsc &amp; infect that server using the same Administrator credentials? A user can copy and paste an executable across RDP then execute it manually, so then in theory a virus should be able to do the same? This would probably be deemed a vulnerability of mstsc, but also a grey area because it's a feature? Are there any known implementations of such in the wild that anyone's ever experienced or heard of before? Cheers!"

This all started a few weeks ago when someone got into our google accounts despite having 2fa and difficult passwords. They were accessing it via the network Im pretty sure because it never showed anyone else logged in etc... Then it turned into someone controlling smart lights and devices in my house. The hacker even has been trying to communicate with us because they can hear everything we say in my own house. They will set up google accounts and make the names of the accounts something in response to what was said. They originally said WiFi direct is the vulnerability and were accessing via Nvidia shield controllers. Then it was my childs school issues chromebook which they could turn on and listen even when it was turned all the way off. They also can and have been remotely rebooting my modem and router so thats why we have now kept it unplugged. We now have next to nothing even plugged in in the house and dont even have our modem or router turned on yet they are still doing this. Is there something I can do to stop this?

It's a windows 10 computer that generally stays up to date with windows updates, and is also near constantly running The Sims 4. Yesterday it was stuttering some after running for a long time, so I'm inclined to think the game has a memory leak somewhere. Sims 4 was also running when this crashed, though neither of us were around to see it happen. It's otherwise a strong computer with no issues running more intensive titles. I'm not _too_ concerned about the crash itself, but instead want to make sure it's not a sign of malware or an exploited vulnerability. I've never seen a computer crash and load the BIOS without user interaction. There's a built in UEFI boot manager that's in second priority, and it always throws an error and hangs indefinitely. If something messed up with windows boot manager, I'd expect it to fall back to that screen instead of the BIOS. Do any causes come to mind? Anything to check for in particular? Thanks,"

A cmd terminal was open along with a run prompt and an error. Someone tried to connect through ftp, download a file from a specific ip, and run it on my pc. The error message said the file was not found, so it appears their attempt was unsuccessful, but I'm not entirely convinced this isnt a trick and my computer is not compromised. Some background info: Images of what i found: URL One image shows the open command terminal and error, the other shows what i found in the run app. The first is what was in it when i found it, and the second what i found after closing and reopening the app. I'm on Windows 10, I had a tightVNC server running with a password (9 characters, upper and lower letters and numbers), and a port forward enabled on my router to access the vnc from work. I have a pihole on my network blocking ads and trackers acting as the dhcp server. First i disconnected my pc from the internet and uninstalled all vnc servers and unused software on my computer with CCleaner. I scanned with windows and malwarebytes free edition and they each found nothing. I used windows explorer to search for the executable files they tried to download cawk.exe and 4950606004.exe but found nothing. I disconnected the router broadband, accessed the admin page and disabled the port forwarding. Then i turned wifi off on my pc and reconnected the router so other devices on my network can continue to use the internet. Im currently copying all my files to an external drive and plan to reimage the pc. I have a host of questions. How did they find me? Is this because of the port forwarding on my router and the vnc server? Are my actions sufficient to say im safe now? I use Lastpass for all my passwords. Is there any chance these passwords have been compromised? What did i do wrong and how can i protect myself moving forward. I work on alot of 3d models for inventions and ideas and I would be devastated if these files were compromised or stolen. This whole situation has opened my eyes to my vulnerability and carelessness. I want to become serious about my security and avoid this situation moving forward. Thanks for your time effort and attention."

I had come back from a two day trip. I went to my room and switched on my Wi-Fi on my Note 10+ (running OneUi 2) and also my Sony WH 1000 XM3. Strangely, my Sony headphones connected to some random bluetooth and started playing some beats. And even more strangely my phone started transferring data from Wi-Fi direct. I was hoping that it was connected to my smartwatch but I had just shut it down. My Bluetooth was on but my headphones were not connected to my phone. I got suspicious of that Wi-Fi direct connection and turned off my Wi-Fi. Then I ran an antivirus sweep on my phone and found out that somehow I had Google Allo on my phone and it contained a malware. I have a boat load of apps on my phone, all from Google Play and only Pokemon TV was an APK downloaded from Firefox, but it was scanned for threats and that was almost a week ago. I am sure Allo was not there before. I had done an antivirus sweep on my phone around 6-7 hours ago and there was no malware. But somehow after connecting to the Wi-Fi direct I had malware on my phone. I am not that well-versed with hacking but I know that if I can install an app on someone else's phone then I can get any information I want, and even control the camera. I know this is very noobish but does anyone know if anything is wrong? I have checked all the installed apps and deleted around 30GB of files that I do not need. I have not downloaded any pornographic content. I have not tried to open deep web either. I checked my phone with 2 different antiviruses and there was nothing after deleting Allo. I wanted to check my phone by connecting it to my PC but my power supply unit has gone for replacement. Is it possible that this is an exploit in OneUi 2 where someone can you connect to my Wi-Fi direct without me opening Wifi Direct and install an app on my phone?"

I was trading war stories with another tech provider I work with and I couldn't find any proof online for this. Basically where I worked we built and were installing Windows 2000 server and we were seeing unusual memory and network activity spikes. So we did another fresh install with new firmwares, drivers, etc and it still was happening. Well we dug our heels in and found out that there was a patch that if unapplied before connected online it'd infect the PC's ECC memory and write itself to the memory. If we would take the server offline and reinstall everything it'd reinfect if that pair of ECC memory was in the server. It was one of the oddest things I've seen. Later on antivirus and patches killed off any threat but we had to order in some new ECC memory get the install and patch to avoid reinfection. Does anyone remember this vulnerability or the name of it or ran across this? It makes no sense that anything could be written to the ECC portion of memory but that's the oddball thing we ran into. Maybe my memory is playing tricks on me. This would have been sometime from 2002-2005ish. Searching for it via Google is tough since it tends to search a lot of newer info or pages that would have detailed it have been retired.

However, even with these advantages, technological advancement is accompanied by many disadvantages. Chief among them is the ability to access the online accounts of people without their consent. Characterized by malice intent, it's growing more rampant by the day, thereby creating a need to find a 'more secure' way for individuals to protect their accounts from online thieves. While the greatest advantage of the SMS 2FA format is convenience and ease of use, most people have access to a phone capable of receiving SMS messages. Linking a phone to an account is simple too. With that however, most SMS 2FA options come with some issues. There is reason to be wary of putting anyone's phone number out there: having the phone number associated with someones account can give attackers powerful ammunition. These are reason enough for users to look for a better means of 2FA, and many have found this in the form of 2FA apps for their mobile devices. Most of the well-known cryptocurrency exchange like KuCoin support the use of the popular 2FA apps and services (as mentioned [here](URL and a majority of email providers and social media accounts support these specific authenticators as well. In practice, the 2FA method is a great security measure that anyone can use for free to protect their online data by adding an additional layer of security. With the continual threat posed by any malicious sites, strong passwords are simply not enough to ensure the security of those accounts. While SMS messages were sufficient in the past, there's a inherent vulnerability in the method and so nowadays many have made more secure protocols as necessary to level things up. These days, with spiteful actors trying to take everyone's data and steal their funds on a regular basis, 2FA has cemented itself as vital online tool to create a safer digital experience."

I run some home servers behind a second router in a subnet. Used a PPTP VPN to access the subnet and configure it, and had forwarding for the server to connect to it from Wan. Day after I set the vpn up, my ISP blocks us for ""spam"". After many days of them not doing or telling us shit, they finally gave us the host name of the device sending the spam (WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8). Didn't really tell us much else, except that maybe it was mail spam but I dunno if that was just a departmental error in communication or what. Googling this host name shows that is has hinted it might be part of a botnet, though I don't know much for sure. My ISP has done fuck all, and said that they won't unblock us until we identify the issue and submit a report about it. They haven't offered any help besides the host name and time of detection on their end. All the houses devices are now disconnected, so I guess the hunt begins. A bit more details about the setup: Due to how quickly the block came after turning on the vpn, I have a feeling that is how it got in. Vpn was PPTP on port 1723, and I have heard there is a vulnerability in that protocol. Only other port forward was a minecraft Server on 25565. VPN was running off the second router, which is a Mikrotik with routeros. Branched via ethernet to router modem. It had a subnet, and within that was the game server with win 10 and the Namecheap dyndns software going. Working theory is they got in through the vpn and managed to either infect the router or the game server pc. The game server pc has mysteriously decided to stop posting, although that is a known issue with the motherboard (x79a-gd65) and might just be a RAM thing. Pretty odd timing though. I have taken its drives out and am gonna put it back together and run some virus scans.

I have come to you with a very strange issue that I cannot figure out and have never seen before. My place of work was getting rid of this old computer from one of our clients. I decided to take it home and attempt to repair it as it is still a great piece of hardware despite being from 2013. It is a Sony Vaio SVL24127CXB. BIOS Version: R0230T9 Here are the specs: CPU: Intel Core i7 (3rd Gen) 3630QM / 2.4 GHz GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GT 620M Memory: 2 x 4 GB SO-DIMM DDR3 SDRAM 1600 MHz Storage (Included): SATA 3Gb/s 5400 rpm 2 TB HDD Optical Drive: BD-ROM Display: LED - Multi-Touch 24 in 1920 x 1080 (Full HD) OS: Windows 8 64-bit Edition (Currently Installed on the HDD) (It has a slot for m2 storage but it comes empty, so they clearly intended the user to be able to upgrade) Now on to the issue and the steps I have taken so far. I picked up a 240 gb SSD and it was easy enough to open the back panel, take out the HDD and put in the solid state. I made a boot disk for Windows 10 Pro, I have a legit key I purchased online from Microsoft. It was a simple task of booting from the USB and installing windows on the SSD everything is going normally. However when I boot from the SSD, as soon as windows starts to load the computer shuts off completely. I pulled out the SSD and put it into my test computer, it booted windows 10 with no issues. I got past the initial set up, then put it back into the Sony. Same issue, it will start to boot windows then shut off power. So I put in the HDD it came with. Windows 8 booted with no issues. I can navigate the interface and browse the internet etc. So next step is I downloaded the official Sony Bios updater and flashed the bios. I went into the bios, disabled secure boot, set it to Legacy instead of UEFI and reinstalled Windows 10 onto the SSD. Same issue, as soon as it starts to boot windows it cuts power. Alright then so next step is I dug online for a windows 8 (Not 8.1) ISO and installed that onto the SSD, same result. Then I tried to upgrade the currently installed 8 on the HDD to 8.1, same result, it died then when I powered it back on it reverted back to 8 and said 8.1 is incompatible, no reason why. I also tried upgrading to 10 again it said it's incompatible. I tried Windows 7 as well, same result it cuts power. So then I made a Linux boot drive (Ubuntu) and tried to boot from the USB instead of installing to the SSD, same result, it cuts power just as Linux is about to boot up. I have also removed the CMOS and put it back in hours later hoping to completely reset all the settings in the bios. The only thing I can think of is there is some partition in the HDD that Sony is reading and validating some security key and allowing it to boot. Now I have also considered imaging the HDD and installing it on the SSD but ultimately I need to get Windows 8 off of it as there is no support for it, it is a vulnerability and it won't allow upgrading. I also tried installing windows 10 on another HDD not a SSD and it still cuts power when it boots. &amp;#x200B; I have scoured Sony and other forums, watched a ton of videos about secure boot and upgrading and have not found anything even close to a solution or cause. My last resort after asking Reddit would be to contact Sony official support however they charge 100 dollars per issue and there is no guarantee they will be able to fix it either. Thank you so much for reading, any advice or idea you have would be so great. I thought this would be a great thing to use for edutainment software for my son."

So I have several questions regarding smartphone, home network and laptop/pc devices hacking: 1. Can my smartphone be hacked remotely by a near device (laptop in the case) when my bluetooth is on, as well as my mobile data (mobile internet)? And can it be hacked even if I have not given permission to any file to be transferred via bluetooth? 2. Let's say someone's hacked my smartphone and gained unlimited access to it (pictures, documents, search history, passwords etc). Can they somehow hack my home network as the moment I've connected to my wi-fi? Which consequently raises the next question: if my home network is compromised (hacked), can the hacker gain access to the other devices connected to it either wirelessly or by LAN cable? 3. If my smartphone has been hacked, will a factory reset delete the supposed corrupted file/files and thus restore everything back to normal without no longer being a hacker victim (the same goes and for pcs/laptops after reinstalling)?

The IT consulting company that manages it is telling me that I cannot use ""and"" in the name of work streams. I named one, ""W and T"" and it crashed, and now the project is stalled.

Could someone inadvertently delete data by calling some function and overwriting something?

I want a password manager that can inform me when another account signs into it. i want to know if theres a router that gives you a notification whenever theres a new device signed into a network. As of about a year ago, ive been pretty naive to home networks. Ignorance truly is bliss. I only had an ISP provided modem, a netgear AC1900 router, a laptop, a phone and a PS4. I kept the same password on my router and, same password on all my accounts, and never had an issue happen to me. Once I moved to a new location and started making a bit more money, I started to get into smart products. Smart TVs. Alexa. Home Automation products. Security cameras. I got a new router for my room and *THOUGHT* that you could just use two routers in series. Upon having issues with my PS4s NAT type, I started researching networking terminology. Found out that my router configuration was actually very insecure. So I fixed it, put one router as an actual router and the rest in bridge mode so as not to have a double NAT. A week later, my UBER account got hacked. Im not saying this was caused by my security flaw, but this was the first time ive ever been hacked and this went on to completely devolve my sense of security. I changed my password. Decided to change my password for all my other online accounts, or as many as I though I could. Changed my wifi passwords. Had to reconfigure all my smart devices. Forgot certain passwords because I was so used to only having one or two passwords for everything. I feel like at some point, I was compromised. Weird things have happened. At one point my smart TV notified me that another device was trying to connect to the TV. People have been parking outside my house (and this is where my true paranoia shows) and I think that theyve sensed vulnerability in my network and are trying to attack me. I feel like I want to completely reset. I want to disconnect my internet, factory reset everything, but that would be such a big task because of how many devices I have and that is just daunting. And if I forget something and its infected with some malware or something, reinstating into my network would just compromise me all over again. I want to have a different and new password for everything but I cant keep up. I cant remember that many. People have suggested a password manager but what if someone gets a hold of that? Then im completely screwed. Is there a password manager that requires two factor authentication? Please. If anyone can provide a step by step process to redo your own security from the inside out and get it to a point where I can not worry about it, I would appreciate it. I know thats asking for a lot."

66,vulnerability,techsupport,A way to be sure I've been spoofed???,1,a46075,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/a46075/a_way_to_be_sure_ive_been_spoofed/,2018-12-08 11:43:37," Today I was unassumingly checking my school Outlook e-mail and was taken aback by the following, ""Hello, I am a spyware software developer. Your account has been hacked by me in the summer of 2018. I understand that it is hard to believe, but here is my evidence (I sent you this email from your account). The hacking was carried out using a hardware vulnerability through which you went online (Cisco router, vulnerability CVE-2018-0296). I went around the security system in the router, installed an exploit there. When you went online, my exploit downloaded my malicious code (rootkit) to your device. This is driver software, I constantly updated it, so your antivirus is silent all time. Since then I have been following you (I can connect to your device via the VNC protocol). That is, I can see absolutely everything that you do, view and download your files and any data to yourself. I also have access to the camera on your device, and I periodically take photos and videos with you. At the moment, I have harvested a solid dirt... on you... I saved all your email and chats from your messangers. I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit. I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times. I know what you like hard funs (adult sites). Oh, yes .. I'm know your secret life, which you are hiding from everyone. Oh my God, what are your like... I saw THIS ... Oh, you dirty naughty person ... :) I took photos and videos of your most passionate funs with adult content, and synchronized them in real time with the image of your camera. Believe it turned out very high quality! So, to the business! I'm sure you don't want to show these files and visiting history to all your contacts. Transfer $971 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1Q35Tr3ccKWVJjt3yXDuFFD7FRnqCx2UxU Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring. If you do not know how to do this - ask Google. My system automatically recognizes the translation. As soon as the specified amount is received, all your data will be destroyed from my server, and the rootkit will be automatically removed from your system. Do not worry, I really will delete everything, since I am 'working' with many people who have fallen into your position. You will only have to inform your provider about the vulnerabilities in the router so that other hackers will not use it. Since opening this letter you have 48 hours. If funds not will be received, after the specified time has elapsed, the disk of your device will be formatted, and from my server will automatically send email and sms to all your contacts with compromising material. I advise you to remain prudent and not engage in nonsense (all files on my server). Good luck!"" Some other info: as you may ascertain from the subject, the sending address was to my own. Whenever I check my sent box, nothing shows up. No only that, but my school requires MFA with every login, and I haven't got any texts or anything that hint at someone trying to log on to my account. I'm not terribly worried about the ""hard funs,"" or whatever that is. In fact, if I'm worried about any surveillance being distributed, I find the prospect of people seeing me stuff my face with Cheetos while crying to Netflix's holiday rom-com attempt (God, it's terrible) far more concerning. My general grossness being exposed is also more disturbing than whatever this e-mail is referring to. But since this portion seems to be a scam, and I'm super broke, I'm not cracking open the ol' piggy bank. However, what of the ""hacked"" e-mail? Is there anything in the message details that would reveal this to be spoof? I noticed this ""Authentication-Results: spf=softfail (sender IP is 35.174.145.124) smtp.mailfrom=yahoo.jp;"" and this ""Received-SPF: SoftFail (protection.outlook.com: domain of transitioning yahoo.jp discourages use of 35.174.145.124 as permitted sender)"" Does this mean anything? Is there really no way to detect a rootkit or RAT such as this? I have ran the standard MalwareBytes and their anti-rootkit beta. Nothing was found. Oh, and finally, what the heck is with this cisco router thing? My home router is netgear. But I may have used a cisco on campus or somewhere else. Should I be concerned?"
67,vulnerability,techsupport,Android phone started scrolling through Facebook randomly. Camera opened. Drop menu opened.

Right as I was leaving, I unlock my device and check Facebook. Out of no where, WITHOUT me touching it, Facebook starts scrolling up and down. I closed the app. Then, the top notification menu drops down, my pages start scrolling, then the camera app opens. I shut off the phone... I'm keeping it off for now. I think this could be a personal attack, as something similar happened last year. (ALL of my accounts were hacked, they had access to my computer. I luckily was able to get all of my accounts back.) I unluckily made friends with someone online who is a VERY skilled hacker. She was on the news for RATing computers, almost got prison time. She hacked my friend last year (She admitted it to me) My friend thought I had done it. Then, they both started talking. Anyways, this friend recently blocked me on Facebook due to a fallout. He had unblocked me on Facebook and tried to call me last night, I didn't answer it. I have a feeling it is them. As it is very coincidental that the girl (I am friends with her on Facebook) starts liking all of my photos for the past week or two, commenting on my stuff, messaging me, etc. Then, a fallout happens, and a couple days later this happens. If anything else fishy happens I will update this. (IF my account passwords are not changed, etc) There must be a vulnerability exploit with Samsung, as it happened last year, the same thing, with my Samsung phone. I have since gotten the Galaxy S9+ - It looks fishy that an app on my Google allowed apps list was a local host (There were suspicious apps last year where this happened to. What REALLY kicks this off is, it happened around this time last year ""About October"" when I was going through some VERY bad things in life. Everyone told me I was just paranoid when I had posted it last year. So, either this is VERY coincidental and I am just having another mental/psychotic break. Or there is someone behind doing this. Can anyone help me out? I took screenshots of some IP's etc. I am fairly computer tech savvy... Thanks!"

Also, I do not have any phone numbers of people stored on my desktop as like the email below suggests. So how worried should I be? To me it does seem like this person is claiming to have done a lot of shit, but possibly hasn't actually done much of it. &amp;#x200B; Below is the text of the email \---- I greet you! I have bad news for you. 07/08/2018 - on this day I hacked your operating system and got full access to your account \[my email\] On that day your account (\[my email\]) password was: \[password of stuff, NOT my email's password\] It is useless to change the password, my malware intercepts it every time. How it was: In the software of the router to which you were connected that day, there was a vulnerability. I first hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you entered in the Internet, my trojan was installed on the operating system of your device. After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts). A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a small amount of money to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and came to the big delight of your favorite resources. I'm talking about sites for adults. I want to say - you are a big pervert. You have unbridled fantasy! After that, an idea came to my mind. I made a screenshot of the intimate website where you have fun (you know what it is about, right?). After that, I took off your joys (using the camera of your device). It turned out beautifully, do not hesitate. I am strongly belive that you would not like to show these pictures to your relatives, friends or colleagues. I think $953 is a very small amount for my silence. Besides, I spent a lot of time on you! I accept money only in Bitcoins. My BTC wallet: \[BTC wallet code\] You do not know how to replenish a Bitcoin wallet? In any search engine write ""how to send money to btc wallet"". It's easier than send money to a credit card! For payment you have a little more than two days (exactly 50 hours). Do not worry, the timer will start at the moment when you open this letter. Yes, yes .. it has already started! After payment, my virus and dirty photos with you self-destruct automatically. Narrative, if I do not receive the specified amount from you, then your device will be blocked, and all your contacts will receive a photos with your ""joys"". I want you to be prudent. \- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server) \- Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account) \- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server. P.S. I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment, as you are not my single victim. This is a hacker code of honor. From now on, I advise you to use good antiviruses and update them regularly (several times a day)! Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work. Farewell. "

(""When I was 14 years old, my mother opened the door for me to answer honestly about the rumors she had heard about Gary Goddard??who was my mentor, teacher and friend??being a pedophile. I denied it through tears of complete panic. To face that truth was not an option as my sense of self was completely enmeshed in my gang of five friends who were all led by this sick father figure. I met Goddard when I was 12, and he quickly became a dominant force in my life. He taught me about the value of acting, respect for friendship, and the importance of studying. Pedophiles prey on the weak. My father, who suffered from undiagnosed PTSD from WWII, was not emotionally available. Everyone has the need to bond, and I was no exception. My vulnerability was exploited. I was molested by Goddard, my best friend was raped by him??and this went on for years. The group of us, the gang, stayed quiet. Why? One of the most tragic effects of sexual abuse in children is that the victims often feel deeply responsible??as if it is somehow their fault. With their sick form of control, abusers exploit a childs natural desire to bond. The victims are required to play by the abusers rules, or else they are out??banished from the only world they know. Abusers are successful when they keep control of that little world??a world that is based on fear. The use of fear to control and manipulate can be both obvious and subtle. Abusers will often use the word love to define their horrific actions, which constitutes a total betrayal of trust. The resulting damage to the emotional development of a child is deep and unforgivable. Only after I was able to separate my experience, process it, and put it in its place could I accept this truth: My abuse may always be with me, but it does not own me. For far too many years, I held onto the idea that love was conditional??and so I would look for someone or something other than my higher self to define those conditions and requirements for me."")

They are in norwegian, but I hope you can still figure out what the various numbers are for anyway. The top picture is from the performance tab, the middle is my specs, and the bottom is the users tab. I'll also note that the collective ram used in the processes tab and the ram used by my sole user from the users tab is seemingly the exact same thing, making me feel adding an image of the processes tab to be redundant. Now, as you can see, I clearly have 8GB ram, yet my computer is using 93% of my ram just from 3.5GB ram. I doubt this is a simple numbers error on task manager's side as I did not have very many programs active (meaning the 3.5GB ram usage number is probably right) and I noticed a significant performance drop when the ram use % went too high, meaning that one is probably right too. Two days after these pictures were taking i'm still having this same problem. Also, here's a picture I took from rammap [URL I don't know enough about rammap to properly get what this means, but it looks a little peculiar to me. Every other tab in rammap seemed quite normal to me, with no numbers that stood out in particular, but as said, I don't know very much about rammap, so I may have just missed it somehow. I don't know whether this is related, but recently i've also been experiencing some problems with google search: An abnormal amount of ads, as in 4-6 of them for each search, seemingly normal links giving me popup ads, and the underline that usually appears while hovering over google links no longer appear. Besides exactly google search though I haven't been noticing any particular issues. I've also had ram-related problems multiple times in the past. I haven't downloaded anything i'd consider unsafe (video games and onedrive files is pretty much all) recently nor been on any particularly unsafe websites recently as far as I can remember. I've used GeForce Experience to update my drivers. I've done a quick scan, a system scan and a vulnerability scan via the antivirus program BITDEFENDER, and the only problem that came up was some windows update, but after updating it nothing has changed. I've entered safe mode and ran eset online scanner, but it found absolutely nothing. I ran CCleaner, no change. I ran rKill, it found nothing in particular. I'd prefer not to download malwarebytes as it's a massive pain in the ass to remove and it'll be severely slowed down due to already having an antivirus program. Sorry for the wall of text, but I really don't have any clue what to do at this point. "

How possible is it that I was hacked and does my hypothese make any sense. Firstly I dont have large knowleadge about computers but Iven been trying to study to make more sense about this case. So my neighbour is studying some computer releated sciences in university and would have reasons to harm me. Basicly I had router on basic security etc settings which I used to share wifi with my other deviceses and cable running to my computer from there. Ive found my router uses WPS with SSDI things (security settings are set on default wpa2). URL ""WPS attacker within the range of acess point may be able to bruteforce the pin and retrieve the passworld for the wireless network"" I found by some research from other site. So after while I got very suspicious that my router might be compromised I started learn about things, restarted router and set it to good security settings. After that router logs showed these kind of login tries in 3 different days (after that I took whole router off) There is like 4-5 log in attemps with three different devices which arent for sure mine: [WLAN access rejected: incorrect security] from MAC address ac:bc:32:99:a3:75, Tuesday, August 14, 2018 15:55:03 [WLAN access rejected: incorrect security] from MAC address d0:33:11:2f:1d:50, Tuesday, August 14, 2018 15:54:37 [WLAN access rejected: incorrect security] from MAC address ac:bc:32:99:a3:75, Tuesday, August 14, 2018 15:52:08 [WLAN access rejected: incorrect security] from MAC address d0:33:11:2f:1d:50, Tuesday, August 14, 2018 15:49:06 Could it be that he bruteforced thought my WPS (as far I understand it wouldnt be really hard even to do) and had acess to my wifi. After I restarted router and set better security he tried do it again but I suppose he failed. My router disables by default remote acess to router settings but only with wifi password I could use my phone to acess the basic router settings panel (not advanced settings) and change dns adresses, change router mac adress and set security settings from wpa2 to none and put quest network to on. As far as I understood he could atleast spy my internet traffic from there but wouldnt have full information from sites which uses encryption if he did that. Im not sure how hard it would be to him to send some viruses to my computer to acess it even more. This is the message what was directed to me. It was written on poor language possible because he run it though google translate or something. Here is version in english what I got by running it though google translate. I tried to do on standard x86 computers this is a general security breach. The OS kernel is usually a demonstration of a response to treatment, which is usually the error of transferring a process signal sent from the violation. Prakparamanu hoparamanu recovery results in some cases recovery may lead to horiyaharu itself to be able to generate a signal signal processor [1], but otherwise use the OS as default handler, which is usually uncommon in abortion procedure (program crashes), and sometimes nuclear power recovery Just by googlin terms I figured out this might be something to do with Intel security fault (please tell me if this might have to do with something else): URL I run application which told me I have exactly that exploid. So what Im concerned is could he been hacking my router -&gt; put malware to my computer which might use that exploid -&gt; spy basicly everything I do on computer. This might sound really paranoid etc but my mental state is for sure okey and thats not the case. There is slightly change this is more or less coincidence and he had some informations otherway but it really feels much more unlikely than hacking me. So does what I told you make even any sense? Could he possible compromised my whole computer and got full acess to it. I would be very thankfull if someone who has better knowleadge than me could give me some of hes time and look this and tell me could this been possible done by one man. "

Before I begin, let me say that I have researched Black Screen issues pretty extensively and none really fit the bill on what I am experiencing. That being said, I would greatly appreciate any thoughts on the issue I am experiencing. I leave my laptop on almost all the time, mostly so that I can remote in from my phone whenever I need to (couple times per week). Now, I have set all of my power profiles and sleep settings to be disabled to enable this. About 2 months ago, the computer started experiencing what can only be described as a Black Screen of no OS at all. **Symptoms**: The computer is on, fans running, and the screen is off. Additionally, windows is not even running. At least, as far as I can tell. My router does not show it as connected. Teamviewer shows it as offline. A light shined on the screen shows nothing (checking for a malfunctioning LCD back-light). Keyboard unresponsive (pressing keys as if to wake from sleep or hibernate). Forced to hold power button until shutdown, then I can turn back on, but oddly enough no ""windows did not shut down properly"" options or messaging. Not even a disk integrity check. SOMETIMES, the computer is insanely hot especially in the gpu area. This heat only happens like 5% of the time though. The first time it happened I thought a rootkit was using my computer to mine alt coins or something. I ran all the malware software I know of including malware bytes , super anti spyware, and anti virus. **How it occurs**: It only happens when I leave the computer alone for a while AND I am logged in. For whatever reason it does not happen if I sign out of the user account and leave it running that way. This made me think it is program related or something, but I dont see any related error logs in windows event viewer. It occurs at randomized intervals. I could leave the computer alone for 5 minutes once and it happens and 30 minutes before it happens other times. One thing that definitely seemed to lower the frequency of the occurrence was to uninstall Intel Management Engine Interface. I did this last night and it stayed on for a whole 24 hours. This made me think the vulnerability they found in IME was my issue. Then, it just happened to me again. I am now out of ideas. I think a fresh install of windows could help but I really really hope to avoid that at this time. I still think it could be software related or maybe even driver related since it does not occur if I am not logged into windows. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Let me apologize in forward for this being a long post, but since this never happened to me before I just want to make sure I give you all the details to find out how this happened and help secure my account even more. URL Recently I've received this message informing me that my account had a sign-in attempt blocked. Of course, this wasn't me since I've gotten this message both on my phone and my Gmail at 05:00 AM while I was sleeping so it leads me to believe that there was some hacking attempt and not some auto-login mistake some website or device I use made. I live in Europe and the sign-in attempt was from the United States as seen in the picture below: URL Now I have gone through all the Security Checkup steps from the link provided by Google in the first picture (assuming &lt;no-reply@accounts.google.com&gt; was from Google and not some phishing attempt) , and I have also scanned my computer for any malware using both Microsoft Security Essentials and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (separately, not at the same time) and nothing was found, so I assume I'm safe. I never give my passwords of any account to anyone and I'm extremely careful about what sites I use and where I log in with my Gmail account, so I honestly don't know how this happened. Any files I download I either download from a trustworthy source (Java, Microsoft, Google, etc...) or scan immediately with my antivirus programs to make sure it's safe to open. I only have one suspicion as to what might cause this, and that is the recent Meltdown/Spectre vulnerability. I have an Intel i5 2500K (2nd-Gen, Sandy Bridge) and a Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with the vulnerability patches/updates disabled. Now I know that I shouldn't have done that and that I'm exposing my PC to the vulnerability, the reason I did that is because those updates cause severe performance issues in video games, which is what majority of my time I'm doing on my PC. Last question before closing: When someone tries to access your account like this, do they actually get blocked and unable to change to change the password and use the account for any means? I'm asking this because my account is connected to my bank account and Paypal and other contact emails, so I'm wondering if those accounts as well are in jeopardy. I've also removed any account access from unnecessary apps and websites in Manage Apps This will be all, I hope someone will be able to help me figure this out.

These two days i have been trying to do its maintenance but when i tried installing discord or another program, my computer kept sending me errors that the KERNELL32.dll and SHELL32.dll didnt have an entrance to the procedure. Example: Shell_notifyIconGetRect when i tried running discord it said an error about SHELL32.dll PowerCreateRequest for KERNELL32.dll when i tried installing Brave It kept saying that there was an error with the library of dinamic links for both. (Excuse me if its not a perfect translation as this computer's language is in spanish.) I tried everything, so my first assumption was that because it's been such a long time that i need to run windows update, the problem is that it's stuck when it searches for updates, i left it for a good two days and it was still stuck in there, tried looking for solutions online and updated individual patches to aid for windows updates. These are the ones i installed.

Now the issue is that it didnt help windows update, so i tried looking for other solutions of the KERNELL and SHELL, and i used the sfc /scannow procedure, it finished and it said that it repaired some damaged files, but still nothing.. i still get the same errors after unninstalling, re-installing and i've been looking arround and it says about replacing the dll files manually, but when i tried it didnt allow me even when i have administrator. The computer is a HP Pavilion dv5 Notebook PC Windows Vista Home Premium (It says service pack 2) On an operating system of 64 Note: i was browsing through my computer and there seems to be another folder with the x86 program files even when the system itself says that it runs on 64.

94,vulnerability,techsupport,Accessing large groups of many small files is extremely slow and is causing the system to become partially unresponsive. Is this because of meltdown?,1,7sgih3,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/7sgih3/accessing_large_groups_of_many_small_files_is/,2018-01-24 05:31:27,"OS: win 10, up to date but not on an insider build. Performed a clean install ~1.5 weeks ago CPU: ivy bridge i7 (i7-3610qm) disk where files are located: 5 TB external HDD Other: 16 gb ram / gtx 660m **Clarification**: By ""many"" files, Im talking about 100's of thousands to a few million files spread over a few hundred GB. In particular this is the ""file history"" database, which (thanks to multiple backups of multiple versions of the instal directories of Matlab, MSYS2, minGW, Visual studio, (On WSL) gcc, gpp, gfortran, cmake, etc.) had a grand total of nearly 10 million files taking up ~1.3 TB of data (though, a decent percent of the individual files made up a pretty small part of this data). Also, im not referring to the bug itself but the patch to close the vulnerability. **My understanding of meltdown**: This isnt my area of expertise, but as I understand it, it goes something like this. When a program asks the system for sme memory or file, the system needs to d 2 things: 1) check if the program has access to what it requested, and 2) (if approved) actually fetch the desired information and give it to the program. In the old days where CPU's were single core this happened one after another: the system kernal checked for permission, and this only if the check was approved did it go fetch the requested info. Multi-core CPU's changed this - instead of checking permissions and then fetching the file, it did these two things at the same time and then stored then temporairly in a local cache. If the program had permission then it took less time to deliver it, and if not then it got removed from the local cache. The problem is that: 1) You could request access of some info based on a partial name (im guessing some sort of wildcard expansion got used), and 2) the system began accepting new requests for access while the first request was still in the local cache. #2 means that a program can make 2 requests for the same info, and based on the speed of how quickly the 2nd request s fulfilled the program will know whether or not requested info actually exists (since if it does it will be sent to local cache where the 2nd access is much faster, but if it doesnt the situation is the same as the 1st check and the response time will be similar). #1 means that the program doesnt need to know the name of the info it wants to access, it can ""build"" up the name one ""word"" at a time by repeating the double access request described above for different words until a match is found. By doing this again and again and again it turns out that a program can read anything it wants from the kernals protective memory including another users private info (think passwords, credit card and bank account numbers, etc.). **The fix** seemed to effectively make things like the old single core days - the permission check is always performed before the information is fetched, meaning that if you dont have access the info never gets sent to a local cache and you cant implement the above scheme. On the other hand, if you do have access, it means this process takes twice as long (assuming the permission check and the fetching of the data take the same amount of time). **Several small files**: it would seem the effect would be largest when this type of ""permissions check"" needs to happen many times and when it makes up a relatively large percent of the computer time of the requested operation. The difference for a few large files is negligible but for a bunch of really small files (each which require the check and each of which requires very little time to finish after the aforementioned permission check) the difference could be rather large. **Relation to my issue:**Assuming im understanding meltdown more-or-less correctly, it makes sense why things would get worse after the patch (I've noticed occasional system related ""weird errors"" for months, but it got much worse after the path. I also ran chkdsk and sfc to ensure there was any corruption, and there wasnt). The part that this desnt seem to explain is how many system related tasks (opening the start menu and right click menu's for example) became literally nonresponsive. I have a theory for this though: When things get locally cached, there is probably a small amount of wait time where the kernal is waiting for the permission check to finish (at lease of some files this probably takes longer than fetching the info). Im guessing that in this time the kernal might have been able to fulfill a few ""quick and easy"" requests that were permanently locally cached due to being frequently used (like, say, start menu and right click menu access) even if these were not the immediately next scheduled task. Im imagining this being kind of analagous to how a party of 2 can get a table as a restaurant almost immediately since they can get squeezed in somewhere while the party of 10 has been waiting for some time and still hasnt been seated. However, going back to executing permissions checking and file checking back to back means there is no ""down time"" - it is single threaded but is 100% active, rather than multithreaded and (im guessing) 90-95% active. This would mean that tasks are executed in the exact order they were queued, with no chance (or at the lease a much smaller chance) of things to execute out of order. This would explain why certain things because totally unresponsive whenever trying to deal with a few hundred thousand individual small files (or more) - there would be a split where processes that didnt need any kernal intervention would work normally, and any tasks that did require kernal intervention would get effectively frozen at the part where kernal intervention was needed, which seems to rather well describe what I was experiencing. **Question:** So does this seem reasonable? I think it does, but as I mentioned above this isnt my rea of expertise. And, if this is completely wrong, what else might explain this, as I would like to avoid this problem in the future..."

I'm curious because I can see in my logs that three account names (including one that only I know) receive a lot of unsuccessful logins. There is no evidence of brute forcing these usernames. Someone got the usernames and they've been distributed to a network of machines trying to brute force the passwords (I lock out IPs after 3 attempts but I can see these user names being attempted from multiple IPs in several IP ranges).

I looked at task manager (currently only 4 chrome pages, discord, twitch, task manager and process explorer up) and according to the task manager my only user is using a total of 1.3GB. When I look at the processes tab (including ""details""), I estimate it to be about that much.

If so, how do I solve it? -I have used BITDEFENDER antivirus ""vulnerability scan"" to see for important updates such as driver updates, and there was apparently a windows update to be done, which I did, but nothing was fixed. -I have also used BITDEFENDER antivirus ""system scan"", in addition to using eset online scanner one-time scan to look for malware. -I see no abnormal process in the task manager. -I downloaded ""process explorer"" and found nothing abnormal there either. The highest numbers I saw was bitdefender at 400 private bytes and 300 working bytes. It may simply be because I don't entirely understand the program though, so if there is any obvious rookie mistake I could have done when searching for abnormalities then knowing about that would be nice. -I have turned on and off my computer many times.

We are currently using software that requires us to be PCI Compliant since we handle CC data. The scanning company assigned to us is Trustwave Trustkeeper. We keep failing due to the following vulnerability on TCP Port 23 which is Telnet: The service running on this port appears to make use of a plaintext (unencrypted) communication channel. The PCI DSS forbids the use of such insecure services/protocols. Unencrypted communication channels are vulnerable to the disclosure and/or modification of any data transiting through them (including usernames and passwords), and as such the confidentially and integrity of the data in transit cannot be ensured with any level of certainty. Transition to using more secure alternatives such as SSH instead of Telnet and SFTP in favor of FTP, or consider wrapping less secure services within more secure technologies by utilizing the benefits offered by VPN, SSL/TLS, or IPSec for example. Also, limit access to management protocols/services to specific IP addresses (usually accomplished via a ""whitelist"") whenever possible. Troubleshooting done so far: Telnet is NOT installed on our Windows Server 2012 From the Netgear Prosafe Firewall Router, I have blocked SSH (UDP and TCP), Telnet, SFTP, and FTP.

118,vulnerability,techsupport,Entire household has had bank accounts (mainly debit cards) hacked. Things aren't adding up so I'm not sure how to prevent future hacks.,5,61zy7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/61zy7z/entire_household_has_had_bank_accounts_mainly/,2017-03-29 02:17:18,"Some background, I'm fairly knowledgeable about most things when it comes to technology, but essentially I need some questions answered and some advice to figure out how our information got leaked and how to prevent future hacks. First, our home uses a Verizon Fios Router, but we have Frontier Fios as our ISP (there was a company switch over about a year ago). Connected to the router is my computer (via ethernet), uncle's computer (via ethernet), brother's laptop (via wifi), 1 tablet, 3 smartphones, and a coax for the cable TV. My aunt and uncle's bank accounts have been hacked (the payments were used with their debit cards for camsites via epoch.com) multiple times within the past few weeks, but recently a lot more in the past week. Yesterday, my mother's, my brother's and mine debit cards were hacked as well (and this morning my uncle's again for another bank). Yesterday I followed the /r/Techsupport malware removal for all 3 computers. Only my brother's laptop (unsurprisingly because he has done this in the past before) was infected with lots of malware. 1st question (that I can't really seem to find a straight answer using google), can an infected computer infect the router and/or still be able to intercept data from other devices and computers on the same network? All computers also don't have network discovery on so I'm not sure if that matters. I have NOT changed passwords yet because I want to make sure every thing is clean but I HIGHLY suspect the information leaks might have something to do with the router. However, things are also not adding up with these hacks. 1) How can someone get your debit card info when all sites do not show your full debit card number (I mainly used Amazon, Steam, and Blizzard where my card information was saved), especially when there was no malware/keyloggers on said computer? I can understand if I typed them in again at one point when there was a vulnerability in the network I wasn't aware of. 2) One of the replacement cards that was being sent to my aunt got hacked before it even arrived in the mail, how is that possible? (does someone have access to her bank information somewhere?) 3) Is there a IT security professional I can talk to/hire to help us figure out what is the cause of these hacks? I would really appreciate all the advice and information you guys can provide because it seems that there is someone who has maliciously found out how to get our information and I'm out of ideas of how else I can prevent these attacks in the future. If you need more information please let me know. **Update** TL;DR There is evidence to suggest my brother has been source for some of these frauds. However, I do not have hard enough evidence that definitely proves it is him. I went through my brother's laptop and through 2 of his email accounts as well as many of his webcam accounts that I could find from his emails (not only does he use the same password for everything, but he saves them on his chrome browser, smh). All of the accounts I tried to log into have been banned or suspended due to disputes/charge backs from the cards (best evidence I got that points toward him being the culprit). There are also instances where I found him using my name and my uncle's name instead of his for accounts or when PMing cam girls... I even called some of sites to get more info on the cards he used but they couldn't not reveal that information (I tried once posing as my brother, and another I was honest. Both were unsuccessful at getting solid evidence of finding out which card he used as the receipts sent to his email did not reveal any information about the cards either). Also there were no receipts/emails of the recent cards that he was using (the ones I found were from last year), so again it is hard to say if it was him for the cause of this past week's hacks. I agree with most of you, and it seems that my brother is most likely the culprit. However, if anyone could answer some of the questions I have to help me isolate the problem and to make sure it is not due to malware, such as: 1) Could the malware on a device intercept data from other devices on the same network/ using the same router? 2) Can malware spread from one device to other on the same network/ using the same router? Thanks again for all the advice! "

I have for a while been getting weird entries in the Rootkit/Malware tab in Gmer. I have also noticed some strange executables running among processes all described as Windows services but you could easily see that those executables didn't belong to a clean Windows 7 install or Windows 8.1 install. Windows update is acting strange. I get noticed about updates and can download and install them but when installation is done and I have to reboot it reverts all the updates. Some times I feel stuttering in the mouse and keyboard but my PC is freshly installed and the hardware is quite good. I have tried flashing the BIOS via USB with that said I have also been working on making a bootable DOS-CD with a new BIOS version and a DOS Flash Utility with no success either. It's like the DOS can't read the files from the CD, even though I meddle a little with CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. It's like the DOS can't find any cd drivers. I have been using DBAN(Darik's Boot and Nuke) to wipe all disks, formatted them and reinstalled but I keep getting infected. All above mentioned returns. At the time I used Windows 7 I didn't get any suspicious results in Gmer, but I could feel that the PC wasn't running as it should. Then I installed Windows 8.1 as UEFI and turned SecureBoot on and then Gmer actually showed something. I also noticed that at the moment if I update Windows it will install some ""fake"" Windows updates only a few around 41 updates and if I install those updates Gmer can't find any suspicious, it is like Windows is getting patched so the malware is becoming more hidden. I got an original DVD with Windows 8.1 Pro N x64 build 9600 so it is strange that the Windows update only can find 41 updates and I'm 100% certain that there are a lot more updates for that build. I ended up buying a new motherboard where I used the same RAM, SSD, HDD and GFX from the previous build and were clean until I made a mistake with the USB-drives and all was running fine with that said you could assume the infection must be on the motherboard. I actually ended up sticking a wrong USB-drive into the new machine and it got infected too. Stupid me but immediately when I putted the USB in my MalwareBytes Anti Malware and Bitdefender ended as not responding the screen turned also black for a while so I ended up rebooting. The USB-drive was a new one which only had been used in a Asus EEE laptop 10"" running Ubuntu server x64 and the USB-drive infected my machine that was running Windows. I have been investigating further for the rootkit source using Chipsec. The BIOS chips have been removed, reflashed by an SPI programmer who has reattached them once more afterwards. I have wiped and reinstalled Windows once more, where GMER now finds less but not everything is gone yet, so it would seem that some of it is removed. There are still some problems with the system, so it would seem there are still an infection present, a very strong proof on this would be that I am only limited to 40 windows updates even though it an genuine windows build and key I have; before the infection there were no problems with this exact windows build. My machine is running with i7-4790K and Gigabyte Z97X Gaming 3 motherboard. If I set the clockspeed to something, could be stock 4GHz, 4,2, 4,4 or 4,6GHz it will run that specific clockspeed in BIOS and in Windows but if I go play CSGO and enter cpu_frequency_monitoring 2 in the console, it will prompt how the CPU usage is. I'm always ""allowed"" to use a little less than normal; if I run stock speed 4GHz CSGO can only use 3.8 GHz. If I run 4.4GHz CSGO can only use 4.2GHz. If I go to BIOS and disable Hyper-Threading and VT-x and set the clockspeed to 4GHz or anything then I can utilize the full clockspeed in CSGO too. Before I got infected I used default settings in BIOS, had enabled Hyper-Threading and VT-x and ran 4.4GHz in BIOS, Windows and CSGO. If I used cpu_frequency_monitoring 2 I would get the 4.400MHz in CSGO also. Could this be some Intel VT-x based rootkit or? After some searching around on the net, a clue has been found towards where it could reside; A lower level of the motherboard firmware. I have a suspicion that the rootkit is running and present in the SMM(Software Management Mode), which is before the OS. With the following links I have a few hints and guidelines towards how the SMM infection could be done: URL URL URL URL URL I have used Chipsec following the guidelines within this video, to actually detect a vulnerability and bad SMI handler within the SMM, but I do not know how to fix it.

Most of what I've read suggest OpenVPN as a strong alternative and I could use Remote Desktop. The problem being I'm having a heck of a time wrapping my head around it. What I want is: Have my home PC be able to remote connect to others (like my parents) and the ability that I can connect to. Would I need a server and client .ovpn file for this machine? My macbook and Android phone to be able to connect to others? Just clients? Finally all the clients I would need to connect to, do they need to run clients or servers?

My problem is this: I purchased a Gigabyte GTX 980 TI video card a few months back to replace my (working fine, but a good bit out of date) old graphics card. For a few months it was working fine, but over the last week or so, I have been having problems when playing a few games. A few online games keep crashing on startup, with the message ""error configuring game files"" and such, and a number of games have been crashing while playing with the message ""Stack Kernel Overflow"" or errors in the driver. Sometimes the systems says that it is closing the program to prevent vulnerability to the system, or sometimes it closes due to a driver failure, oftentimes with the message ""failed then recovered"" or something similar, though the games always need to close or crash anyways. The recovery will sometimes happen when streaming videos, but those never need to crash or close when it recovers- only games. For a couple of games, I can't really reliably open them due to that failure to compile message, and most of what turned up when I searched those error codes is that it might be a firewall problem, or that I might have a virus. However, I've spent the last several days scouring my system to make sure that I don't have a virus or any malware. The other option that has been brought up is that it could be the GPU overheating, but... I'm not sure how to track that. The video card hasn't seemed to be running hot, and its built in fans kick on when I run more intensive games, but GPU-Z and (if it has that function) Nvidia's control panel don't seem to tell me the temp anywhere. Maybe it is temperature and my sensors are messed up? I had a similar problem about a year ago, but replaced the motherboard entirely and haven't had a problem since. Could it be my CPU fan? I'm running a large traditional style heat sink, but was planning on going back to liquid cooling anyways since my last one's pump died a long while ago.

Then one morning we come in and find out that each the big xerox copiers printed out thousands of configuration pages. This is a massive waste of resources and administration is furious. The weird thing is that the ""printed on"" date is different for each copier. Best I can figure is that's the day each one was installed. The print server's spooler had thousands of junk jobs clogging it up, and it took several resets to clean it all up. After that day, the network printers would print out the GET request after completing any job, including just making a copy, a network print job, a fax, whatever. It's largely stopped, except for the printers occasionally losing connectivity and needing to be reset. What's happening here?

I've recently been having a flustrating time the past year on my work computer. I've been afflicted with some stubborn ad injection software on Chrome and Firefox (the only browsers I use). I remove the software/add-ons from my computer and my browsers but it eventually comes back in a different form (a different name). Things like ""tictacoupon"", ""supersavings"", etc. They display pop-over ads and injected ads on webpages. I'm running on a Windows 7 x64 system and have local administrative privileges and joined to a work domain. I've tried reinstalling both browsers. I have Microsoft Security Essentials always running. I've used malwarebytes and adwcleaner to remove what they could find. I have my browsers set to warn me when any site tries to install add-ons. I have UAC control turned on. However, just recently (within the last month) I've been getting messages I need to restart my computer to apply changes to UAC. Something is trying to disable my UAC, but I can't find out what. I suspect it's been passed down from a GPO. I ran an RSOP and found the policy User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode set to Disabled. I did some research and found that if this is disabled it turns off UAC. I've inquired with IT about it. They said they would look into it but haven't heard anything back. I setup a task to run every morning to re-able the registry setting that controls UAC just in case. And I never restart my computer unless I need to. But this may not be related to my issues since I notice whenever I uninstall the software it doesnt give a UAC prompt. So I suspect it doesnt need permission to install either? Any software I download I of course always check if it's trying to bundle software, but of course there's always the chance I missed something. I've gone through my programs list to make sure there's nothing suspicious there. I prefer not to reformat my computer because I have a lot of custom work software with settings I would prefer not to have to install. It would be days worth of work to get everything set back up again. Like I said, I'm able to remove the stuff but eventually it keeps coming back. I would really like to try to prevent this from happening altogether. How does this happen with all this protection I have? Actually, a good example for you is last night I had remoted into my work computer through TeamViewer from home and the browser was still open. I come in this morning and find Firefox was closed (I don't remember closing it). It then said it was having trouble reloading my tabs. Next thing I noticed was some ads popping up on webpages. Sure enough, I noticed two new add-ons installed in the browser and their Windows counterparts listed in my Windows programs list. What the hell? Is this a vulnerability in Firefox they are using? I imagine so, since Firefox had completely closed. So then it couldn't warn me about add-ons. I just installed extension defender today, too, by the way. Any support or suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance! Edit: [Adwcleaner log](URL Seems it may have inserted itself through Javascript?"
146,vulnerability,techsupport,Windows 8.1 &gt;70% RAM logged me out without a care in the world.,1,3a9wyx,http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3a9wyx/windows_81_70_ram_logged_me_out_without_a_care_in/,2015-06-18 21:41:03,"I have an MSI laptop, fairly decent hardware with 8GB of RAM. When I bought it I swapped out the hard drive for a Samsung SSD, reinstalled windows 8.1, used the license that was stored on the previous hdd, installed all drivers, performed updates, etc. Have run a MalwareBytes scan and nothing has turned up, I don't believe it's a virus or system vulnerability. I've been ignoring these issues for the many months I've had the laptop. On login about 2GB of ram is in use without any activity from me, task manager doesn't show anything significant hogging ram, resource monitor states windows is using about 2gb ram anyway, this appears to be normal? When the ram usage gets up to 60-70% I'll get a popup warning that memory is low and windows will close programs should it get too high(usually anything exceeding 80%. I've got paging support on so that it has permission to write to the SSD if needed. Why I can't use the additional 20% ram is beyond me, I feel a bit crippled with just 4gb ram for the browser and development tooling/IDE. The other day I had laptop out to demonstrate some work to a client and the screen was flashing black a few times. Today I went over the limit and Git and Chrome(with many tabs) was killed, I wanted to do some work so ignored attempting to restore my tabs(which failed later as they couldn't be recovered..) and opened IE11 where I used 10 tabs, ram usage grew to about 1gb just for IE. I have vagrant and virtualbox installed, ram was about 40-50% at the time, spun up a VM(512mb ram) and had that running in the background. I can't recall exactly what I was doing, but at some point the screen went black and I was logged off, losing anything that doesn't retain state. Just while typing this out I had IE11 and Chrome up, IE11 was using 1gb of ram again, I went into windows explorer to check the vagrantfile in notepad by right clicking the file 'open with..' list of programs is prompted to select from, moment I try to interact with this screen goes black and instead of being logged out Windows changed the screen resolution to 1024x768 a 4:3 aspect ratio for a 16:9 1920x1080p monitor..Chrome also crashed, presumably being closed by Windows. What could possibly be going on? I'm thinking IE11 might be the culprit. I was getting some popup messages about breakpoints to do with memory I think...so maybe the ram is faulty. Other issue is shutting laptop lid then waking it up later the laptop can find wireless networks but not connect until I put it to sleep again and wake it back up, not as troubling though."

I have scoured the internet for the past 2 hours and tried every solution to no avail. when I got home yesterday I unlocked my desktop and I noticed that my VPN had disconnected but it had not reset my internet connection, which is weird because I have it set to reset the network adapter on disconnect. I do this because I also have it set to run a script upon connection to the VPN server that deletes the 0.0.0.0 entry on my routing table, that way the webrtc vulnerability in chrome (which allows STUN server requests to reveal your true IP address, or something) doesn't apply to me because there is no 'real' IP to be revealed as it is deleted from the routing table every time I connect. So I thought hmm that's weird but no biggie, I'll just reset my adapter manually. Ever since then I have been unable to get internet access on my PC at all. I am connected to the router but I have no internet access. I've tried resetting the router, resetting my PC, I've checked my DNS settings, I've tried various commands (ipconfig release, renew, flushdns) and nothing has worked. I know it's an issue with my PC in particular because my phone and laptop can connect fine. I can ping my router fine but get no response from Google or any other site. Help? Also I tried looking in the routing table and there is no 0.0.0.0 entry which is strange because the WiFi usually adds that entry automatically every time I connect to it. Tried adding it in myself using route add and I get the response 'the route addition failed: element not found.'"

Steam suddenly said my credentials had expired and I had to relogin. I thought this was odd but thought nothing of it, just relogin. But my password wasn't working. This is when I began to get worried, and checked my YMail. I saw that one email had been read, a sure sign someone was in, but I wonder why they didn't change my password? I quickly do this. Then I notice Steam says my contact email was changed...but get this, it was ***my*** IP. I know I didn't change it, I was playing Civ5 all night. No one else could have, and my router has a password on it. (I know this isn't foolproof, could there be a vulnerability with my router? Could they get my account info from that?) I checked the recent IP addresses that accessed my YMail account and again my IP address accessing my account not when I accessed it. So someone is proxying through my connection? Then GMail messaged me saying they stopped access to my account (thank god), but this IP was from California. It doesn't seem like this ""hacker"" knows what he's doing. Probably some skiddy. But any idea what's going on and how I can stop it? They always say, what have you done recently, right? But I haven't downloaded anything for a few weeks. I've been playing Worms Armageddon, an old 1999 game that still have a great multiplayer community, but could have vulnerabilities. Some guy was saying he hacked into another guy, saw his camera, looking at his porn, etc. Of course, people do this all the time, so I figured he was trolling, but now I don't know. Now that I think of it, the I was torrenting anime on my rooted Kindle (by not downloading anything I meant no programs). I used an app I haven't used much to stream torrents: URL I opened it before and nothing happened though. About 3 days ago KeepVid asked me to update Java, but I made sure every download was legit, etc. That's about all I can think of. I'm thinking it was something to do with my Kindle, as I do have both of my email accounts on there. I figured Android was like iOS and viruses were pretty non-existant on it. I knew there were viruses, but not ""mainstream"" ones, you know? Should I download an AV for my Kindle? What do you recommend? Thankfully right now it is disconnected from the internet thanks to (recently) installing a battery saver app that does that when it's closed. I'll download the app on my computer, sideload it, disconnect my router, run the app, and hopefully erase the little bugger???? Let me know what else you recommend, thank you a bunch!"

Adding a firewall rule to block outside access to this host, or the netw= ork overall, on port 1900.=20 2. Disabling UPnP entirely (SSDP is a component of the overall UPnP subsyst= em and can't usually be disabled separately). 3.

I'm not a sysadmin or anything so I don't yet know if it is server-related. I'm just their PC technician. This happened middle of the day, no settings have changed on any of the workstation's end or the server end that I can see. Send/Receive *immediately* comes up with the error: Receiving reported error (0x800CCC0F): 'The connection to the server was interrupted. If this problem continues, contact your server admin or ISP' I did some research on the error and kept hitting dead ends. Here is what i have tried so far: * Re-creating the PST file with the same info. * Checking all incoming and outgoing port settings. Testing SSL ports. Again, their POP server uses standard 110/25 ports and this just happened mid-day. * They can send email, but it doesn't even try to send. Immediately receives the error. * This is only happening in their one office, their other offices can connect to the email no problem. I can as well from home. * Checked firewall and antivirus settings. Disabled both without luck. * Ran Outlook in safe mode. * Rebooted both client workstation and R2008 server. None of the above worked and I am kind of at a loss. Has anyone else come across this and know a fix? **EDIT**: Additionally, I checked their webmail side for any suspicious emails that might have embedded scripts that could cause an issue and I haven't seen anything. **EDIT 2:** Also checked server anti-virus and firewall settings. All good there from what I can see. Disabled anti-virus and firewall temporarily on the server with no luck. **Final Edit - Solved:** So I was able to capture SMTP traffic and when looking through it noticed a MASSIVE amount of email originating from the Server. Traced it to a module that the company uses as their industry software. This software can send emails through standard SMTP and it seems that there must be some vulnerability because the server was sending out email at a rate of about 1000 message an hour. Their email provider blocked their external IP. Why they only blocked the POP access and not SMTP is beyond me; but that is what made this all the more confusing. IP was unblocked and emails flowed in. Now it is just damage control time. "

Any advice or help would be really appreciated!"

I submitted this question to /r/AndroidQuestions to no avail but got some really good suggestions and advice which led me to this subreddit. So, I switched to Android about 4 months ago and I've never looked back, it's been an absolute pleasent experience. However, one day I was browsing through this website through mobile network and it suddenly redirected me to a porn advertisement, I backed out and turned off mobile data yet immediately after, I recieved a text labelled 'reciept' and it said thanks for purchasing a video for 4 and if there was something wrong I could call the helpline number. I was baffled but found no irregularities and so I just deleted it. But since then I keep getting spammed with text messages with no numbers, just names as if it were people in my contacts like 'Jack' with spam such as 'freemsg, sex tape' etc etc. I've been using the Clean Master app ever since I got my phone and since the recent update, it kept saying I had a vulnerability called broad.anywhere. Then it would tell me to download this app and resolve it but I'd still get these spams. Not sure if this part would be relevant - but it just lead me further into the conclusion that it was some sort of malware. In addition, I'm wondering how a website could have got my number to be able to actually send me all this spam.

So, first of all I'm embarrassed to have succumbed to something like this and my question is, what is this and what can i do to stop and resolve this issue.

I have an iPhone and there has been some strange things happening. I believe my ex has possibly installed spyware of some kind and has been keeping tabs on me. I have done some googling and searched for the basics like apps and going through my settings to make sure things aren't out of place and to disable any kind of remote access. The really creepy part is I stopped talking to my ex about 3 years ago. Not too long ago, there was someone that I had a crush on. I decided to message this person on Tumblr - for those of you who don't know what Tumblr is, it's a blogging website where people can post just about anything. A person can choose to anonymously talk to people, or talk to people with their names revealed. I decided to start anonymously messaging the person I like. When a person chooses to respond to these anonymous messages, they have to repost it to their blog in order to answer it, so the anonymous message is posted for all to see, and the response to the anonymous message is also posted. The next day or so, a person chooses to message the person that I like with their username showing. I checked out the profile and the person was from another country. That SAME DAY I GET A PHONE CALL FROM THAT COUNTRY. (I do not know anyone nor have I ever talked to anyone from that country) Not only that, but after THREE YEARS OF NOT COMMUNICATING WITH MY EX, I GET AN EMAIL FROM HER ASKING ME HOW I WAS DOING AND JUST CHECKING UP ON ME. It was super weird but I decided to ignore it. A few days go by and I'm still messaging my crush on Tumblr ON ANONYMOUS. I'd say four days have passed from the strange incident and the person messages my crush again with the username visible. AND AGAIN I GET ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM MY EX WHO I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO IN THREE YEARS ON A DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, SAYING HOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO AMMEND THINGS WITH ME. Creepily enough she references some things that I had said about her when I was talking to someone. Ever since then weird things have been happening on my phone. One of my accounts have been hacked - I received an email about this. I called the help desk and had them change my password, and whatnot. I then logged in to see if everything was okay. When I went to go check my email, THE EMAIL THAT NOTIFIED ME OF MY ACCOUNT BEING HACKED HAD BEEN DELETED. Now when you delete an email on iPhone, it goes into to trash bin so it's not permanently deleted. When I went to go check my trash bin IT WAS NOT THERE. IT HAD BEEN DELTED THERE TOO, however, the emails that shows that I had logged into the account after the incident were there. Thankfully, the account that was hacked logs the IP address of the user, so even though the email was deleted, I still have evidence of someone with a different IP address then my own logged in. Another thing, my crush was harassed off of the blog site, and even stated that after SIX YEARS OF BEING ON THERE SHE WAS FINALLY LEAVING WTF????? I think it had something to do with my ex. Please help, I'm not sure what's going on, or what to look for! ~UPDATE~ I took your guys advice, upgraded my iPhone, updated my software to current software/changed passwords/factory reset iPhone several times before using it and etc. Everything was fine until one of my accounts was hacked. I say account because I dont even remember creating the account that was hacked. Yet I received an email saying to changed my password because I logged in in an unrecognizable device. I looked at the IP Address and the country of origin was in a different country. Not just any country, but my ethnic country (which Ive never been to in 20+ years nor have had any connection to that country in forever. No google searches or anything. I work on cars as a trade and mainly watch DIY videos/repair house stuff/mechanic videos) - Im a US citizen though. Now that Im bringing up the videos I want to add that Ive been getting a lot strange ads too. Ads in foreign languages, ads about cybersecurity/coding/mental illnesses, ads about makeup/birth control pills WTF???, ads about a lot of stuff that I don't ever search for. I dont even have any apps related to these things. All my apps are diy/repair/mechanic apps, but Im getting these advertisements??? How does that even work?? Ive noticed some of my emails being deleted too. Additionally, Ive been trying to hook up with some ladies since Im single and almost every time I try too (its online forums so Im pretty sure Im anonymous to others) the person that I talk to almost always turns out to have the same religious background as my ex. Another thing to add, my ex is religious. Im not at all. Im not sure whats going on but if anyone can give some advice as to how to better protect myself or whats going on or how to fix this that would be extremely helpful."

Now that I've calmed down: I have an ASUS P8P67 Deluxe motherboard. The computer runs Windows 10. My computer's UEFI splash changed apparently on its own. I don't know when this happened. This might sound dumb, but I usually keep this computer running in sleep mode. I use it every once in a while in the living room to browse the Internet on the TV, to play Spotify, or games on Steam. While asleep the computer's USB ports are still powered. I use one of them to power a custom-made Raspberry Pi Zero LCD Clock that sits next to the TV. Sometimes the computer wakes up because I forgot to turn off the mouse, or a cat walks across the keyboard, or something. Sometimes the computer crashes when it wakes up. Two days ago the computer must have crashed when waking up, because pressing the power button shut the computer off (and the RPi0) instead of going back to sleep. I did not see what was on the screen. This must have been a heck of a crash this time because the UEFI appears to have been reset altogether. The machine was overclocked, and perhaps the age of this computer got to it. This turned the boot splash back on. It used to be the default one that ships with the latest UEFI update from late 2012. Imagine my surprise, when I'm greeted by the DGSE logo instead. I did not know what this logo was and had to look it up. [URL I realize that something had to have overwritten the startup splash screen. But what? The computer appears to run fine otherwise. Is this malware of some kind? Google leads me to results that suggest that this is very unlikely. Since the boot splash was shut off, I don't even know how long this has been going on. Nothing on the computer appears to be out of order from what I can tell. I can certainly reflash the UEFI from a disk/whatever if needed, however, I want to find (or not find, hopefully) some kind of evidence on the computer that could lead to that logo being set as my startup screen. Anyone have any ideas to track this down?"

Now, a month ago my Mcafee expired so I deleted it as Mcafee doesn't run with a free subscription. I did some research on Windows Defender and noticed it blocks most common/basic viruses, so I figured i'd be fine. Boy was I wrong. Yesterday, I noticed that when I'd be randomly browsing the web. A new google chrome tab would pop up containing suspicious websites and adverts. I quickly CTRL + W'd them though. So, it happened on reddit and at that point I knew something was up. I immediately thought it was adware, so I ran a quick scan with windows defender and nothing poped up. I was skeptical because I had that feeling that something was up. So I did a full scan, halfway through windows defender gave me a notification saying that ""There might be threats found in your computer, you may take action once the scan is finished."". And what do you know, at the end of the scan it said I had something called adware:js/injectorad.a. I quickly removed that with windows defender. Though, I was taken back on how windows defender hadn't blocked the thing in the first place. I figured that I couldn't rely on windows defender and had to get myself a 3rd party anti-virus. I went with avast. So, using avast I ran a full scan of my PC just to make sure that the thing was actually gone. Avast gave me false positives and all the threats it found were related to the XBOX gamebar. So I figured I was fine. But I took it another step and turned on periodic scanning with windows defender and also chose to run a windows defender offline scan. All of which indicated that I was safe. Though the doubt I had wouldn't let me rest. I snooped around in WD and Avast settings and changed them to my liking. I ran one last smart scan just to be FOR SURE. That also came back with nothing. So I went to sleep. Queue today, I had been anxious about my PC for the whole time I was at school. And so, once I make it home, I boot up my PC and as soon as I log in Avast scans my PC.

I would like to ask you guys what you think. Are your recommendations apply only to those who have a higher understanding of cybersecurity and don't need that much security anymore?

179,cybersecurity,techsupport,"Could a company-issued laptop push software to personal devices on the same home network? If not, is it possible for the work laptop to monitor network activity/user behavior while connected only to the the local network?",1,exkun4,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/exkun4/could_a_companyissued_laptop_push_software_to/,2020-02-02 18:20:26,"The company I work for has recently upgraded its suite of cybersecurity tools significantly. Basically overnight, I noticed a host of new apps running in my tray. Among these are ZScaler, Tanium client, various anti-malware solutions, and something called Kollective (believe this is a content distribution system). I should note that I am not in any way a networking expert - I'm barely literate in the field. However, after a few episodes of my laptop fans spinning up at totally random times, I decided to dig a bit and check out Event Viewer as well as running apps and services. Quite a few services seemed to have ambiguous descriptions which many times explicitly mentioned remote management, monitoring, and other such spooky activities. Additionally, logs in Event Viewer revealed some software behaving - in my view - suspiciously. By this, I mean a couple things: first, all sorts of activity logged during the middle of the night, when I believed my laptop to be turned off. Next, there appeared to be multiple attempts at probing my home network (is it normal for endpoint protection software to 'screen' a home network that it is connected to, effectively mapping all connected devices?). In some logs, successful connections even appear to have been made with personal devices, though I admit to lacking sufficient know-how to say this with absolute certainty. One of the more troubling logs mentioned my phone, its current OS, and SMS capture. But I don't want to get ahead of myself - I know pouring through log files without technical expertise is not recommended for the faint of heart. I have been reading up on endpoint protection, and I feel some companies offering enterprise solutions are a little ambiguous in their wording when it comes to IoT and other devices connected to a home network alongside the protected/managed device. There is very explicit mention of configurations, upgrades, packages, and even the software itself propagating autonomously and silently self-installing on other compatible machines in the subnet. My hope is that I have misunderstood, and they are referring to machines on the company's subnet - basically, a way to get the software installed on all company machines using a peer-to-peer approach with minimal disruption to end users. Anyway, I've probably hit the cap on misused technical terms per post, so just laid out very simply - can my work computer push software to personal devices connected to the same home WiFi? If not, can it monitor traffic on the network (perhaps even circumventing encryption by setting itself up as a MITM). I know I'm likely being paranoid, but it doesn't seem outrageous to imagine command &amp; control software making the small leap from the work laptop to another device in the LAN. Please feel free to roast me if my understanding is completely off-base - I know I'm a noob. Separately: what the heck is the deal with virtualization (hopefully correct word)? Unless I'm totally misunderstanding, it seems each company laptop is in fact running an inescapable (Matrix anyone?) virtual instance of Windows that is layered on top of and running in the actual operating system. What are the benefits here - how is that different from installing the Windows image directly onto the machine? Is this very common? Sorry for the wall of text and random add-on question - just genuinely curious! Thanks guys!"

My organization follows DFARS/NIST regulations and we like to control our own information instead of using the cloud. I understand the cloud ""can"" be secure, but its also just someone else's computer and where possible, we like knowing our own vulnerabilities vs the unknown of the cloud. Its just how we work and i'm not looking to argue semantics there. To date we've been pretty successful in doing so. We house our own email server and map it through various applications, Outlook where possible. Well that takes us to the phones. We recently upgraded our email server and further locked down controls, only allowing traffic from a VPN and specific IPs. Everything was working except the phones. We originally thought this was tied to encryption issues based on a forum seen here: [URL But after investigation we discovered that the outlook mobile app sends your email/password to their servers in northeast USA (forget exact location at the moment), to then pass to your server. They basically Man In The Middle (MITM) on purpose. We even had the phones on the full duplex VPN, and it would still go to their server. Since we were being specific with IPs allowed, their servers were being blocked. We didn't like that and decided it was time to move away from outlook mobile and migrated to the Gmail app as a temporary solution. Well recently a fellow employee dropped their phone, messing it up so bad we couldn't wipe it from the phone GUI. I verified that phones indeed store and cache emails locally by trying both airplane mode and pulling a SIM card, in which emails remained. Meaning we had to do a remote wipe. We tried various methods before deciding not to recreate the wheel and worked with Google to get those instructions before returning the phone as part of the phone insurance trade. We explained to Google the situation and why we needed to wipe it before sending it back. They sent the directions (which worked) but also added this piece which caused me to investigate more: ""Also, I would like to inform you that the emails from the Gmail app will not be downloaded to the phone. They will be stored only in the cloud."" This would make sense to me if it was a Gmail account, but the user that submitted the ticket stated that she specified it was for our non gmail accounts. &amp;#x200B; **THE QUESTION** So this got me wondering, how does Gmail app store email for external (non-Gmail) accounts? I can't seem to find a confirmation either way and all I keep finding are directions for setting it up. Even the EULA doesn't touch this and just specifies things like ""Google Accounts"" (which this isn't): [URL . &amp;#x200B; **What I know:** \- Emails are at least cached on the phone in local storage -- already proving the tech support is wrong at least there. \- If Gmail downloaded and stored email to their servers and then synced to phones, this would basically be another intentional MITM it should in theory be blocked by the firewalls just like Outlook Mobile was. &amp;#x200B; **What I think:** \- The tech support is low level and didn't/doesn't fully understand the picture; answered based on Gmail accounts &amp;#x200B; **The only other possible theory I can think of to make the tech support right:** \- the phone downloads the email into its memory and then Google grab and store from the phone instead of directly from the server. i.e. maybe long term storage or something to reduce memory on the phone? &amp;#x200B; Any Ideas or knowledge? &amp;#x200B; (xpost from Cybersecurity -- thought it might fit here too)"

I've not done that kind of work in years now, but remain loosely familiar with the core concepts. I also haven't worked with a lot of Windows-based tools in a few years, having started working almost exclusively on Unix servers and databases. So I'm using Windows 10 and [Outlook.com](URL at a pretty basic level of expertise. **Tl;dr of my problem:** Someone I don't trust claims they sent me an email, I don't believe them and cannot find any evidence of the email in my inbox. Whoever turns out to be wrong will have to pay a big bill. How to determine/prove that they forged the email without making accusations before I have evidence? **My problem:** I have a situation in my personal life where I highly suspect that a property management agency that I rent my apartment from (who have already developed a history of incompetence in my personal dealings with them, and have a myriad of bad reviews online for unprofessional conduct) is trying to create a fake email claiming that they informed me of a situation that I am dead certain they told me nothing about. The resulting miscommunication has led to some problems, and there are are some pretty hefty financial costs involved in rectifying those problems. We're now debating liability; I think they're liable to cover those costs on the basis that they failed to tell me about the situation, but it seems I'll be forced to pay for it anyway if I can't prove that they didn't notify me. Even if I refuse to pay a bill, they could just withhold it from my deposit at the end of my lease. I'm already suspicious of their claims because as soon as I mentioned wanting to investigate the miscommunication and asked them to provide proof that they told me about the situation, they immediately claimed that they only told me verbally on the phone, then later changed their story later and claimed to have sent it to me in an email, and then within 2 minutes of forwarding me their ""proof"" email (which is very brief and concise, only making short explicit statements of exactly what they need it to say to put all the liability on me), they offered to pay the costs 50/50 anyway provided that I stop looking into it, right after they had supposedly just proven that all of the blame lies with me. The forwarded message they claim to have sent me is from mid-December 2018, and the message display header that you see when you forward a message with the basic ""From:"", ""Sent:"", ""To:"", and ""Subject:"" fields looks weird to me. The content and formatting is a little inconsistent with other messages that they've forwarded to me in the past (small differences in the display of names vs addresses, the presence of \[mailto:...\] links, also date/time format differences, plus there's no 'FW:' or 'RE:' prefixing the subject line even though they supposedly forwarded it to me) and a small part of me worries that they just copy/pasted the display header from a past message that fits their 'alternative' narrative, then doctored the addresses, subject, and message body to pass it off as a get-out-of-jail-free card. I make this claim with a healthy degree of self-doubt though, as I'm pretty sure that forging an email to avoid an unwanted bill is committing fraud and would be a serious legal risk for them to take. But I still want to explore the events surrounding this email and try to work out why I never saw it. If it turns out they really did what I'm thinking, I'll lawyer up and take it down a legal path from there. I have absolutely no record in my [hotmail.co.uk](URL account of having received any message from their domain on the date in question, nor any message from any domain ever with the subject line in question. So I guess my questions here are surrounding the identification and proof of a forged mail, as well as validation of having never received it (if it was an authentic message that they *tried* to send): 1. Am I right in thinking/remembering that even if I ask them to send me their original sent item as a .msg file attachment (if one exists), the SMTP headers will be from before it was actually delivered, so tools like mxtoolbox header analyzer won't help me to trace if there was a delivery error at any point? 2. Is there anything else I can ask for, to help me determine whether or not they forged the email without necessarily straight up accusing them (perhaps wrongly) of committing fraud and demanding concrete evidence from their IT department? (If I'm wrong about the potentially fraudulent email, I'd rather not piss them off and see them retract their 50/50 offer!) 3. Is there any more detailed way for me to interrogate my Hotmail account to find out if a specific message was ever received, even if I made a user error and accidentally deleted it or lost it in a folder somewhere that a standard [outlook.com](URL search won't check? I am absolutely 100% certain that I've not seen the message in question and didn't accidentally delete/move it, but I think I really need to consider the possibility and cover all bases.

About a month ago I had purchased the new ASUS ROG PG27UQ (4k, 144hz) monitor, and within the first week it started experiencing loss of communication with my PC. &amp;#x200B; Here's how the issue presents itself: I'll be playing a game (on medium/high settings) (ie. Black Ops 4, League of Legends, anything really) or watching a video on Chrome (ie. Hulu, Netflix, Youtube) and the display will seemingly lose connection to my PC. The screen goes black for atleast 5-10 seconds, and will display the monitors ""ROG"" logo and pick back up. It normally happens in repetition as well, several times in a row, before becoming more stable for a while. It will happen randomly throughout games, and almost immediately upon full-screening a video. On my graphics card, I'm using two monitors: The PG27UQ and a 51inch 1080p TV. To start ruling things out, I had moved from using my Displayport on my graphics card (Displayport offering 120hz) to using my HDMI port instead (offering 60hz). Issue is apparent with both setups. I tried dropping the monitor from its native 4k display down to basic 1080p. Same issue. I tried using just this single monitor, without my TV hooked up. Same issue. Thinking it may somehow be an issue with lack of power to the monitor (it's pretty high-end, expecting it to require more input than other monitors), I tried using power from several different circuits in my house, as well as using a UPS and without. Same issue. &amp;#x200B; I ran a few utilities to help pinpoint the source of the issue: Resource Monitor through Task Manager, and CPUID's HWMonitor. I'm coming up pretty short. My CPU, RAM, GPU and VRAM aren't being maxed. The power intake from my GPU, CPU, etc. don't appear to be maxing out my PSU or anything. &amp;#x200B; Tried a few other obvious things: Looking for driver / firmware updates for my monitor (only 1 single driver update, since it's a relatively new monitor), disabling HDR (arguably the most intensive feature these monitors provide), locking down background tasks/processes to just the required ones. Also resulted in no help. &amp;#x200B; All of that being said, this is definitely one of the most annoying experiences I've had with PC hardware. The biggest pain point is that this kind of issue could be coming from ANYWHERE with my setup, and I'm trying to be thorough and not be ignorant of that fact. So I don't expect an easy answer, or any answer at all really. Just some extra eyes to see if there's somewhere else I could be looking for issues at. Maybe recommendations for software that can help track this down. I'm a cybersecurity specialist and I don't work much with hardware directly anymore, so my troubleshooting methods may be missing something obvious. Haven't even added any new components to my PC in the last few years besides my graphics card, so the whole ""home-rig"" thing is still something I'm re-learning. &amp;#x200B; Last note: I plan on trying a few more steps when I'm able to... Hook the monitor up to a different rig (with similar specs) to see if the same issues occur. Contact the vendor to see if there's any reports of similar issues (early iterations of a new product are most likely to see odd flaws). &amp;#x200B; Some of my specs (think I listed everything relevant, can provide more if needed): Display settings: 4kx2k, 3840 x 2160 @ 60hz (HDMI) or 120hz (Displayport) i7 4770k GTX 1080Ti (8gb VRAM) 32GB DDR4 RAM CX750 PSU"

I am pursuing CompTIA's core certs: IT Fundamentals, A+, Network+, Security+, and perhaps Linux+. I will also be getting certificates from my college in Cybersecurity (probably including Advanced Ethical Hacking) and Linux Administration. I am not going for anything vendor specific. I know I'll need to be using Packet Tracer and Wireshark but beyond that I don't know which other programs I may need. I want to be able to run both Linux and Windows (because much of the curriculum is based on Windows). I know I need at least 8GB and quad-core processor and I would like it to be a hybrid if possible, I'm hoping that there's a good app to do Calculus on that will take my writing and make it into computer text. I don't care AT ALL about graphics, gaming, speaker quality, or any other media/entertainment/home user stuff. Speed would definitely be a plus though if anyone thinks I'll see a significant difference based on what I'm doing. I'm thinking below $500 should be more than enough for a machine like this, but I'd like to hear about more expensive options if necessary. Thank you!! I hope this question is up to par. If it's not, I'd greatly appreciate a message telling me what I need to research and add to get it there."

Uber responded this morning. Also this morning, I received an email from Uber saying that my account password was changed. This was not me, as it happened at a time when I was driving. I went ahead and froze my cards, reached out to Uber again, and my account ""has been marked for deletion."" is there anything else I should do to avoid more of my information being compromised?

Which is weird because I built my own computer and the hardware is pretty good, I really shouldnt have issues with like opening chrome, alt-tabbing out of things, etc. And so I checked task manager to see what was going on and discovered ""Antimalware Service Executable"" was plaguing my pc. Something like 30-40% CPU usage and like 40-50% disk usage from this one fucking program. So I was cool, other people probably have this issue so I googled it. Of the solutions I found, which btw were from about 6-7 months ago, none seemed to help me out. They recommended changing the times for scans to like a weekly basis, but as I discovered later the scheduled scans were not the issue, it's the real time protection. So I turned off Windows Defender. Because I already have malware-bytes and have quite a lot of knowledge related to cybersecurity so I could probably notice if some stuff was acting weird. And a week went by and everything was fine. And then it started again. I turned off real time protection, cloud service stuff, and scans, but Windows didnt care. It turned it back on. So i turned it off again. And next reboot it turned it on again. Anyway, I'd really love some help here. If anyone can tell me either how to force the process of ""Antiservice Malware Executable"" to cancel through cmd, or allow me to actually turn off the stupid real time protection, or just fix this issue in general much would be appreciated"

She wasn't aware of these scams and went along with it. She said while the person was working on her computer, she could see her password on the screen (I'm guessing he talked her into remote access and tried to pull passwords). More unsettling though, is that he turned on her webcam and proceeded to tell her she was pretty. You can imagine how violated she feels having a stranger hack her webcam and then give out unwanted compliments. Luckily, she didn't give out any credit card info. I'm not very knowledgeable on cybersecurity so I was hoping I could get some advice on how to help her remove any traces of what happened, and be more secure moving forward. This was on her personal and not work issued computer so I don't know if going higher up in the IT dept would work, but I still want to help. I already advised that she change her passwords, make sure there's no unusual activity on her credit cards, and from what I've read on this sub, I'd probably want to either run anti\-virus, anti\-malwares to get rid of everything, or wipe the hard drive and re\-install OS all together. Is there anything else that should be done? Could the webcam access incident lead to anything else or was that just him being a creep? Thank you "

They used my yahoo to take control of the old Facebook, changed the name, language, and I assume they're spamming old friends of mine but I honestly don't know because I'm not friends with the old account. I went into Facebook and recovered the account, then changed my yahoo password and set up 2-factor. I thought I was fine. Well... Turns out, **if someone adds a recovery email to your yahoo account, it doesn't matter if you delete it - it can still be used to log in for 90 days.** You also don't need a password, you only need to tell yahoo to email you an access key.
