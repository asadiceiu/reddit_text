0,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,I can see why ICB is saying our essays suck and here's my 2 cents on essay advice,1,i646tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i646tu/i_can_see_why_icb_is_saying_our_essays_suck_and/,2020-08-09 04:33:34,"Rising senior here on an alt account (don't kill me) but has devoured pretty much every essay advice there is on the internet. I've also helped edit some essays on this sub (which I thank because genuinely enjoy editing essays like this post I read another day). Note that I've only commented on a few but the theme has already stuck out to me and I understand how actual editors reading hundreds/thousands must feel. Obviously what I'm gonna say is stated already by many of the admissions counselors here, but I don't know I think maybe some just joined or missed them so here they are again, with the interpretation of a fellow senior. **The Problem: As the Yale admissions podcast calls it, essays are either bad, missed opportunities, or a good use of the opportunity.** # Bad * **Mental health** (mentioned a lot by AOs) * **Shock factor** with toooo much details (you will stand out but not in a good way) *Source: Yale podcast* * **Too much self-deprecation**: a little vulnerability is nice but **they need to like you** so maybe not too much negativity # Missed opportunities * **English paper**: I had no idea this was a thing (and I'm not saying all of you do this) but some really do write essays like an English paper. Formal intro with definitions and sweeping generalizations, transitions that looked like it followed a rubric, and surface-level facts about your life in an organized structure. There's nothing wrong with this approach but it's simply not personal (and cliche and not creative) * **Redundancy:** This is such a huge thing and the easiest to avoid. Rethink your wording, rethink your main message, rethink if this chunk of flowery descriptive is necessary (**this is where we tell and not show)**, and edit like crazy. Go line by line and cut words as if the word limit is just 300. I think *The Kath Path* explains it pretty well. * **Resume**: obviously a huge thing we do. They know the what, but you're telling them the what again, just with context. They want to know the why, the how, your feelings dealing with it, your unique thought process. Your discoveries and excitement, your ""ah-ha"" moments, your ""oh-no"" moments, your ""what-if"" moments. Things that make what you do make sense. Things that separate you from a robot. * **Cliche phrases:** you all know what I'm talking about. But to solve this, turn a general phrase into a specific one (**THIS IS PRECISELY WHEN WE SHOW INSTEAD OF TELL**). If you want to say that you ""learned how to embrace failure and see it as success"", say it specific to the story in your essay, throw in details. ""It took some disgusting salted cake to encourage my experimenting spirit-- nothing can go worse than that."" I dunno yall this example sucks, but when we used cliched phrases, it robbing us of authenticity and genuine reflection. It's a missed opportunity to show your thoughts. Good * True, authentic, genuine. Explores the ""inner you"" (u/admissionsmom) * As stated above in the resume section. They want to see how you think and feel. What do you value or what it is you're scared of (approach with caution though). The moments when your face light up and your pulse accelerate, the moments and relationships that define your identity. * Honestly, there are no bad topics. It's how you write them and how personal and creative you execute them (*source: itscholetan*). Despite the service trip no-no rule, my essay is about a volunteer experience. But I added my personal twist to it with half ideas (u/CollegeWithMattie) and made it so true to my identity that people who read it didn't think it sucked. # How though? I'm stuck. Rant. Write a list of what you want colleges to know, what shaped your values and identities, quirky facts, even, everything. Rant like you're texting a friend: ""you know what, I'm smart, I don't care if other people are smart too, but I'm special because I love math, and like ppl say math is the hardest and I can do math so I'm awesome. oh, also, there was this time when I got totally embarrassed tho, like I was helping a kid with math and he was like go away i know this. man that hurts i guess that taught me to be humble because you never know if ppl are smarter than me. ew this is college essay cliche, but who cares man. oh yea lemme tell you about this time when I fell on my face in a dance rehersal. literally thousands were staring at me and it sucked what am I supposed to learn from this? that accidents happen and- ew this is cliche too bruh what has our system done to poison us. but hey I remember this one time when I saw this huge sail and i begin thinking about this physics idea because yea ima physics nerd too but anyway it got me thinking, is this that or is this this, but if this is this, what if that is that? omg i had a brilliant idea then and i ran back to my room and grabbed my crayon because why not and scribbled on my wall about this idea and did a bunch of research afterward cuz I'm curious and I'm smart and here I am I've completely changed my mind about the world I knew and its worth the price of being grounded for writing on the wall. it took me three days to wash it off."" Write everything, the good, the bad, the ugly, the truth. Then see if you have a potential story there. If not repeat, if yes, edit like crazy. You got this. **Resources:** * Obviously the essay wiki on this sub * hackthecollegeessay (also in the wiki but soooooo important and just pure gold imo) * youtube: * itscholetan * thecollegeessayguy * thekathpath * comment if you guys know more resources &amp;#x200B; Thanks for bearing with my run-on sentences and poor use of bullet points. My essay is nowhere near perfect because even though I have a good idea of what is ""good"", I can't, for some reason help myself lol. Again, this is what experts are saying over and over again on this sub, so check them out if you guys haven't. Hope this helped :) \* sorry about errors though, it's late where I'm at."
1,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,"You DO have an amazing essay inside you. Yes, YOU! Here are the steps you can take take to drag it out of yourself (The Personal Essay: AdmissionsMom's Step by Step Guide)",1,i6kidu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i6kidu/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_yes_you/,2020-08-10 00:46:49,"Happy Sunday Everyone! I rarely post about the Personal Essay because there are so many others here sharing their valuable resources, and I usually prefer to just respond one-on-one to kids asking about the essay. But here's the deal: after reading thousands of essays over the last couple of years, I know you have it in you to write a strong, heartfelt, personal, personal essay. Today, I decided to share with you the exact steps I use with my own students to get them to dig down and find their amazing essay inside -- and its there. I promise. Some quick background: I was a writing teacher for thirty years before I became a college admissions consultant, and for the last fifteen of those I taught freshman writing at Houston Community College. Much of that time was spent covering and teaching my personal favorite, the Personal Essay. For the last 4.5 years, Ive been a private consultant, and when Im not answering questions here or with my students, Im reading posts on college admissions counselor pages, following tons of admissions offices and deans on twitter, and going to conferences (and now nearly daily webinars). **Heres what I know:** Your ***idea*** about some kind of story you tell just isnt that important. Often, the best essays I read come from the most mundane ideas. So many of you are focused on finding the magical idea that youre letting the point of the essay escape you. There is no magic formula. There is no perfect idea. Because you have the focus of the essay right there. With you. Its inside you because thats what it is: inside you. I mean, we the readers, want to get to know the narrator version of your life, not the pretty scenery version where we only see what the character is doing. We need to know whats happening inside your head, and most important, we need your values. We need your beliefs. **And, really, whats the frickin point of the personal essay?** Heres how I see it and what Ive learned over many years and lots of time investigating and sleuthing on multiple college admissions websites, years of conference attending, and lots of twitter, instagram, and facebook following. Despite what you think and what youve been told, Ive come to believe (strongly!) that the point of the personal essay is not to STAND OUT, but to STICK WITH. You want the reader to fight for you in committee, and they will want to fight for you in committee if you build a connection with them. **How do you build that connection?** You build a connection with your reader by building bridges instead of walls. Walls can be an extended metaphor that has gone too far, an essay that feels like its trying too hard, stilted formal language, thesaurus words (please dont sound like youve swallowed a thesaurus -- choking isnt a good look), paragraphs that arent about inside you at all, but that are about another person, your ECs, or too much description. When I feel like someone is writing an essay that has been specifically written with the intent of impressing me, that builds a wall. Bridges let me in. Bridges are the human connections. Bridges show vulnerability and problem solving. Bridges arent afraid to show failure and learning from that failure. Think about the bridges and walls you have with your friends. What connects you with your friends who you have deeper relationships with? What puts up a wall with your more shallow and surface friends? **How do you build the bridges?** Lets get to it! These are the exact steps I use with my students. It works. Time tested. Student tested. **STEP ONE: STOP READING ANY AND ALL ACCEPTED ESSAYS** (this is important!) **STEP TWO: WRITE FOR FUN** Put aside the pressure of the essays for a day or two and just write and then keep writing. Jot down a daily journal. Jot down your thoughts about the pandemic. Jot down your gratitudes. Dont worry about grammar or trying to write in any certain way about any certain topic. Just get comfortable putting words on a piece of paper -- or screen. Hell, write to us here on A2C every day for a week so you can get comfortable with your voice. You can do this while writing your personal essay. **STEP THREE: WWW.THISIBELIEVE.ORG** Go to [URL and read essays. There are thousands of real deal personal essays there. Read at least three of them and absorb them. You can also listen to them, which can be fun because you can take the essays with you on a walk! **STEP FOUR: I LOVE I VALUE I BELIEVE... ONE MINUTE EXERCISE** Set a one minute timer on your phone and list out loud things you love, then list things you value, then list things you believe. Do it with a friend or do it on your own. It doesnt matter. Its a good warm up. You can do this on different days or all one day. You can tell me some in the comments below if you like! (Idea from College Essay Guy) **STEP FIVE: GO WITHIN** Heres the deal about the personal essay. It has to be just that  super, incredibly, deeply personal. The essay needs to be about inner you  **the you they cant get to know anywhere else in your application**. So, you have to peel off your onion layers, find your inner Shrek, dig in super deep, and get to know yourself like youve never done before. What is the essence of you-ness you want the readers to know about you? Its not easy. Ask yourself (and write down these answers) some really personal questions like: What do I believe? What do I think? What do I value? What keeps me up at night? What do I get excited about? What comforts me? What worries me? Whats important to me? Who are my superheroes? Whats my superpower? What would my superpower be if I could have any superpower? Whats my secret sauce? What reminds me of home? Just play with these. And learn a lot. Become the expert on you because you are really the only person who can be the expert on you. [Here ](URL some more questions to ask yourself as youre going through this process. After youve answered them, **look for themes that tell you about yourself.** Then, youll be ready to teach the lesson about who you are and what you believe and value to the application readers. The vehicle (or idea) you use to get your message across really isnt as important as what youre saying about yourself. This doesnt have to be (and, in my opinion) shouldnt be a complete narrative. I think the essays need to be more, reflection, and analysis than story. Those are the essays that stick with me after reading a few thousand of them. Im not saying dont use a story. Use one if thats what feels right for you. Just remember the story is only the vehicle for getting the message of who you are across the page. I like to see more commentary and less narrative, so for me the Show, not Tell isnt really that effective. I prefer show *and* tell  like kindergarten. I dont want a rundown of your activities  if something is discussed elsewhere in your application, to me, you dont want to waste the valuable space of the personal essay. In essence you can think of it like this: More expressing, Less Impressing. **STEP SIX: TAKE A WALK OR LONG SHOWER** Let these thoughts simmer. Youve asked some tough questions; now you have to give your brain some time to just let the thoughts soak. Live with these thoughts and questions for a few days and just hang out with them. Maybe jot down a note or two as you think of them, but its important to spend some time doing nothing at all to let your brain deal with your thoughts and questions. For many of you, this is the first time in your lives youve grappled with some of these big questions about life. **STEP SEVEN: FUN WITH WRITING AND QUESTIONS** This is fun: Pick three or four of the questions above [URL I like the super hero one, the what do I believe, and special sauce, but you pick the ones you like most. Give yourself five minutes only to write as much as you can. The cool thing about the most dangerous writing app is that if you stop, you lose what you write, so be careful. Ive had many many students end up using what they wrote in those five minutes as the catalyst or largest part of their essay. Copy and paste those paragraphs to a google doc so you can use them. **STEP EIGHT: WRITE YOUR ESSAY** Take what you've written on [tmdwa](URL and use that to get yourself going. Write your essay. Focus on who you are  not what you do. Like I said earlier, your job is to build a connection with your reader. You build a connection by allowing someone in and being vulnerable. So take what you learned about yourself and share that knowledge. Essay readers in admissions offices will read your essays quickly, so with limited time to get the essence of who you are across a sheet of paper (or computer screen), clarity and focus on INNER you are essential from the get go. Lack of clarity, too many details about anything other than you, and language that is more complicated than necessary all build barriers between you and the reader, something you really dont want. While its certainly not the only way to write a personal essay, and I dont suggest that you have to do it this way, the easiest way to move forward might be to use a This I Believe type format like those essays you read in URL So if youre looking for an easy way to move forward, focus on one belief that you thought of and then write about it. If you can include the words I believe, I think, I value, I wonder, I know, and they fit well in your essay then you know that its personal. (Helpful Hints: 1. Remember to use your voice. This essay should sound like you and be more conversational. Its not an English 5 paragraph essay. More like talking to an older cousin, you really like and respect. 2. I also like to suggest throwing in an I mean and a you know -- if those can flow in your essay, then you know its conversational and relaxed.) Suggestion: If staring at a blank screen stresses you out, record your thoughts by talking into your recorder on your phone. Thats a great idea for those of you who like to write while you walk (like me). Then just write it all down and give it some structure if you ramble! **STEP NINE: THE THUMB TEST** If someone covered up your name with a thumb or they found your essay on the floor in the middle of your high school hallway with no name on it, would your mom or your best friend know it was yours? If not, keep working. That essay needs to sound like you with your voice and your experiences. **STEP TEN: EDIT** Edit the shit out of your essay. Make sure you read it on your computer screen, read it on paper, and read it out loud, and have at least one other person you trust look it over. Here's one[ of my Medium posts](URL that goes over how to edit essays with lots more detail -- you should read it when its edit time. Editing is far more than working on grammar, although grammar is important. Editing can be about totally restructuring the essay -- and that can be good. When Im reviewing essays, I look for bumps. Places where when Im reading I just dont feel the flow. Its usually from too much flower language or long drawn out metaphors or funky word choices, so read out loud and look for those bumps! Just make sure you are in charge of all edits. If you get someone to review your essay, dont let them just randomly edit. Make sure they suggest edits -- and YOU ok them. **STEP ELEVEN: BREATHE** Pat yourself on the back, sit back, and smile. (and then go back and edit it again!!) **LOOK, ITS HARD** You CAN do this. Its hard, but so important for your future, your college admissions, for sure, ***but its also important*** just for future you to take the time to learn to write clearly and dig in and figure out whats important about the essence of who you are. **MORE RESOURCES:** * Check out [URL for lots more info on the personal essay. * Be sure to read what [u/ScholarGrade](URL has to say in his many wonderful posts. * Heres a[ great blog post filled with great blog posts about the essay from Rick Clark, Director of Admissions at Georgia Tech](URL * Heres a link to the [essay chapter ](URL my book, *Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit:* In it, you'll find lots of advice from me and others from Reddit from 2016-2018. I have a few more resources I'll be happy to share with you if you email me at admissionsmoma2c@gmail.com. Tl;dr: The personal essay is about INNER YOU. Find your Inner Shrek. Build bridges, not walls. You do have an amazing essay inside you. I promise. Im sure theres more I want to say. It will come to me...when Im on my walk! :)"
2,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,Who should I ask to read my essay? Are any admission consultants editing essays this year?,1,ijz1ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ijz1ke/who_should_i_ask_to_read_my_essay_are_any/,2020-09-01 00:31:48,"I don't want someone that I know super well to read it (because it could be embarrassing), but I also don't want to ask another senior to read it. I only want to show it to my family once I'm fully done with it and all the way happy with it. I can't show it to my friends (I doubt they would steal it from me, but it still might influence them subconsciously). I have one junior friend I could ask. I could ask a teacher (I don't have any teacher friends though). I could ask my college counselors, but I don't know. Like I'm proud of my essay, but I have some vulnerability in it. Whenever I write something, I hate to have it criticized even though I really need it. I rather turn it in and just let the grader/teacher handle it and just read the notes instead of them talking to me. I know I definitely can't do this for such an important essay though."
3,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,Applying to Ivy League with a serious misdemeanor,1,hm4bw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hm4bw4/applying_to_ivy_league_with_a_serious_misdemeanor/,2020-07-06 19:13:46,"I am an Asian international currently in a high school equivalent. I am planning to major in a computer science related field at an Ivy League university or equivalent, like MIT, Stanford and CMU. I started learning and subsequently fell in love with computer programming when I was in Grade 7. My interest in programming can be said to be quite all-encompassing (ranging from software engineering to hacking - penetration testing). However, let's just say I wasn't exactly the most mature middle school student (like the majority of us). I don't wish to elaborate too much but in a nutshell, by hook or by crook, I discovered a web security exploit on my school Learning Management System (LMS). Being the dumb 9-10th grade student, instead of reporting the vulnerability responsibly to relevant authorities, I went ahead and exploited the vulnerability and with much determination, I managed to gain access to the administrator account and did some nasty stuff with it. Eventually, the dev team checked the logs and I was caught and handed over to the national police department. I was reprimanded harshly by the Investigation Officer, got charged and blah blah. However, over the course of high school, I have matured significantly (my recommendation letters are likely to be decent) and have used my programming knowledge in socially beneficial ways, such as creating various software microservices for my school (that has received school-wide adoption) or teaching people how to code online. I even used my cyber security knowledge nowadays to test and report potential vulnerabilities on various government or government-endorsed online applications, as part of the varsity/professional-level national bug bounty program. Would this suffice to compensate for my misdemeanor during middle school? Or would my chances of getting into such prestigious schools only be lowered even further?"
4,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,Hot take: its actually better not to help other students,0,hx6pob,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hx6pob/hot_take_its_actually_better_not_to_help_other/,2020-07-25 04:04:33,"When youre applying to college, every other student is a potential threat to you. Its a harsh truth that in order for you to succeed, 95% of other top students have to fail. For example: Im in the top 10 students and have been keeping tabs on the other top students for the past three years. Im friends with them and know pretty much everything about them at this point  their quirks, insecurities, strengths, and weaknesses. When they express their insecurities to me or confide in me, Im always there to listen and make a mental note about what they say. When they tell me about an accomplishment, I take note of that as well. In my room, Ive compiled a chart with the names of the top 10 students and everything Ive learned from getting close to them in the past three years, as well as where theyre applying. At this point, I know almost all their application strategies, so I can provide helpful advice to them on how to make their application better. On the other hand, they know next to nothing about me. I keep all my plans close to my chest. My point is, its important to keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. If other kids feel they can turn to you in a moment of vulnerability, you will have more opportunities to learn about them and get ahead in the game by knowing the competition."
5,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,Yale Admissions Podcast: Essays - What Works (and Summary),1,hafahq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hafahq/yale_admissions_podcast_essays_what_works_and/,2020-06-17 09:22:20,"[Link To the Podcast Episode](URL *Essays: What Works* [Link To the Podcast Episodes Playlist](URL *Inside the Yale Admissions Office* For those who don't know, Yale University has created a podcast to explain how the college application process works from inside the admissions departments. As part of the podcast, they explore different topics such as an explanation of a process from their end as well as explaining what works in parts of the podcast. They just uploaded a new episode today about what they like to see in essays. Hopefully, the podcast can help people who are writing their essays right now. They are mostly talking about what they like to see out of the personal statements they read. **The following are some of the things that I took away:** * Your personal statement should be **personal**. They really look at if the personal statement is coming from you and not some professional. * Usually the essays are on of the first things readers will go through when considering your application. ""It often sets the table..."". Really this is your **first impression** so you want to make it good and make it YOU. * You don't need to be a good reader to write a good essay! They want **thoughtful students**. * **Having a bad essay doesn't throw out your application**. The process is still holistic. But if your essay can be published in "" The New Yorker"" it can really make your application compelling. * **Show don't tell**. Use vivid language to give a sense of place and give them a glimpse of what you were feeling. * If you talk about someone else in your essay, make sure the essay is still about you. Don't have them admit your friend, **have them admit YOU.** * Be careful of sharing the essay with too many people **because it should be your voice**. Don't let other people write your essay. Your voice should be you, whether its funny or serious. * **Don't show off your English skills** with crazy grammar. Keep thing simple and keep things you! * ***Favorite Essay Topics***: * **Changing their mind about something:** Don't make it just because you grew up and be generous to your previous idea), * **Talking about your relationship with someone:** But make it about you not them) * **Passion** not for everyone, but should be about something that really, really impressive, *pick something that really makes you exciting* * **Conveying a sense of place:** (Good starter idea) talk about the environment around you has shaped you. Everyone can talk about things making it really good for everyone. * **Talk about experience that humbles you:** People are scared to talk about this essay because it admits their wrong or they have a regret, making them look like a bad person. Having a negative experience and being able to reflect on it makes you more human. ""Showing vulnerability and highlighting your experience can open up a new dimension of you humanity"". Takes guts to write this. * Ultimately, you want to send something you feel proud about, it doesn't have to be perfect. * This is the one thing you have full control of right now, so put your everything into it. This is the last step! Take in mind this about the Yale admissions process but I think a lot of the things they looking at also apply to other prestigious colleges as well as every college in general. If everyone has any other takeaways from the podcast, feel free to leave it in the comments so this can be more of a resource for students. Thank You!"
6,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,How to confidently make new friends at college,1,hbc3bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hbc3bw/how_to_confidently_make_new_friends_at_college/,2020-06-18 20:28:27," We all want those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. This is how to confidently make those friends at college: **1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you. **2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's [Instagram](URL stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way. **3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [meetup](URL but better for post lockdown! **4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message. **5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message. **6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile. Have fun guys! Please comment below if you have other suggestions :)"

This is called the gene-environment interaction. You are born with a genetic predisposition, and your environment can help pull the trigger. So why are people saying that its entirely genetic? GeneEnvironment Interaction in Major Depression: Focus on Experience-Dependent Biological Systems URL Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multifactorial and polygenic disorder, where multiple and partially overlapping sets of susceptibility genes interact each other and with the environment, predisposing individuals to the development of the illness. Thus, MDD results from a complex interplay of vulnerability genes and environmental factors that act cumulatively throughout individuals lifetime."
8,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,He wrote his college essays on pandemics,1,gns7cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gns7cy/he_wrote_his_college_essays_on_pandemics/,2020-05-21 17:17:11,"[Source](URL Admittedly, I spent hours of my childhood playing computer games like Pandemic 2 with the goal of engineering a pandemic that could annihilate humanity. My strategy was to lie dormant until my extremely contagious virus had infected nearly everyone (including the elusive dwellers of Greenland and New Zealand) before introducing nasty symptoms like encephalitis, cysts, and various organ failures. While the occasional vaccine breakthrough would sabotage my design, the world's vulnerability to such a cataclysm horrified my 9-year-old self. Since then, however, my fear of pandemics morphed into a fascination. Due to the international nature of pandemics, my passion mutated to include not just the biological aspect, but the geopolitical as well. How do epidemics affect peace-building in the Global South? Would alliances strengthen in response to a worldwide outbreak, or would the anarchic nature of the international arena prevail? These questions supplanted my childhood nightmares in keeping me up at night; eventually, I strive to find the answers. My initial encounter with pandemics spawned out of fear, but it quickly ignited my desire to learn about global health frameworks and foment a sense of empathy and collaboration across borders. While my ability to actualize my passions is currently limited, I've taken opportunities like volunteering with the Dominican Republic Medical Partnership to assist Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic with combating mosquito-borne illnesses and promoting sanitation and safe breastfeeding practices. This expanded my horizons beyond pandemics to global health more broadly, giving me an insatiable itch (different from the kind in my simulations) to become more informed about a political sphere inextricably connected with tangible outcomes. While future pandemics are inevitable in an increasingly interconnected and urbanizing world, I want to be part of the effort to defeat them when they come. "

Here's a kind of long-ish article about the underlying demographics of higher education. It ends with a question about how the changing demographics (shrinking!) actually shift some of the balance of power back to students. I would love to hear folks' thoughts about this. ARTICLE ([link](URL for those who want to see the pictures): So what really happened to all that money? You know: the hundreds of billions of dollars awarded to large corporations in the [bailouts of the 2008 recession](URL and the hundreds more earned throughout the 12-year rebound? As a coterie of massive firms have announced mounting difficulties amid the COVID shutdown, many people have asked pointed questions about their finances. Did these firms save *anything*? Where did all those profits disappear to? How could some of the [wealthiest corporations](URL in the world be brought to their hands and knees over such a relatively short period of time? Pause. Hold that thought for three paragraphs. For higher ed, the COVID crisis is only a dramatic evolution of a structural problem that has been unfolding for more than two decades. For many schools, particularly those in the North East and Midwest, the problem isnt economic  at least not per se. Since the 1960s, the birth rate for American households has been on a steady decline. In 1950, the birth rate was at an all-time high  25.26 per 1,000. Today, that rate has dropped by more than half to an historical low of 11.92. [**GRAPH - CHANGE IN DEMOGRAPHICS**](URL The time-frame displayed in the data coincides with the most rapid period of expansion ever undergone by higher education. In the last sixty years, more institutions have emerged than at any other time in history, and the total population of college-going Americans has similarly exploded. Back to the question about private finances. Im more likely than anyone to point my finger at greed and poor fiduciary stewardship to explain the sudden whiplash expressed by firms that should, by all rights, have prepared for the eventuality of a crash. But there is another part of me (perhaps the part that has built two businesses) that understands why these firms are failing. They arent, really  at least not fundamentally. Successful businesses under duress from Corona are failing *only relative* to the conditions of success that they, their shareholders, and the American and global economy have come to expect. In most cases, a failing corporation is not in danger of collapsing outright. It is simply squaring up to the fact that growing, or even maintaining its current position, may no longer be possible given the material conditions of the economy, the world. A market can go from bull to bear overnight. When that happens, growth-oriented firms go on their asses, cash-flows collapse, and layoffs ensue. In a sense, higher ed is grappling with an identical dynamic, only protracted over a much longer period. Historical conditions of demographic surplus (the baby boom in the 20th century) underwrote the growth of higher education to its current teeming scale. More institutions emerged, those that already existed expanded enrollments. To deal with the growth, new faculty, administrators, and consultants were hired. Revenues grew alongside expenses. But as the birth rate dipped toward the end of the century, the tides of fortune began to wash out to sea. *(Demographic changes were only one of the factors that influenced the current position of higher ed. Ill be talking about others in upcoming posts.)* Like most sectors of the economy, higher education has actively negotiated the slow collapse of demographic &amp; economic supports for decades. By the time the 2008 recession hit, the industry had developed a toolbox of compensatory adjustments to rival those in the corporate world. These included increasing reliance on non-tenure academic labor, optimized resource allocations (STEM, anyone?), and across-the-board budget cuts. These tools were mercilessly applied to cut the bloat that had accumulated in higher ed across many years of growth and prosperity. Yesterdays success had collapsed into a full-blown labor crisis. The prophecy was complete. On the student side of the equation, schools started to raise tuition costs out of pace with inflation. With an ever-shrinking pool of students to draw from, it became critical for schools to extract as much revenue as possible from those who remained. [**GRAPH - CHANGE IN TUITION V. INFLATION**](URL Since 2008 (and before, really), schools across the country have been on an accelerated track of downsizing, outsourcing, and specializing. Previously, a high tide of tuition-paying bodies produced revenues that allowed schools to maintain solvency without focusing on certifications, specialized programs, or on STEM at the [expense of all other disciplines](URL But today, nearly all schools are having to make a hard choice  between maintaining (and, moreover, funding) their foundational pedagogical and mission commitments and pivoting to accommodate educational consumers who demand more employable forms of skill training. The most elite schools in the country, sustained by a growing roster of dreamy-eyed student-applicants, may likely never have to choose. For everyone else, however, the culling is nigh. When the culling begins in earnest, it will likely drive from east to west. It is an unfortunate fact that the regions facing the greatest demographic cliffs are also those with the highest concentration of higher ed institutions. High school graduates in Michigan are down 16% from peak, with an estimated 15% reduction still to come. Connecticut: 11% down with 18% more loss expected. Vermont: 27% down since a pre-recession peak with a forecasted decline of 8%. For students, there are a few reasons why it may be important to understand the factors behind the vulnerability of higher ed. For one, coming to grips with the demographic forces that prop up (or not) the market is necessary to making a minimally-informed decision about what it means to enter into school at this admittedly unstable time in history. There is also a potential strategic insight for those who are determined to matriculate. Understanding the detailed trends unfolding on a regional level (what kind of students are in short supply) may provide students with a framework for leveraging their own value as a potential source of revenue for a school. That may seem crude, but these kind of calculations are top of mind for schools seeking to maximize their own market value and remain competitive. You know that admissions cliche about asking why the institution deserves to have *you* as a student? Well, presumptuous though it may be, its not a bad piece of advice. In the dirty market of higher education (because, yes, it is a market), the single most valuable resource is you: an educational consumer  a precious, precious tuition-paying body. As someone who spends about two hours a day talking to presidential cabinets at schools all around the country, take my word on this. Is this reality good for the project of education in America? No, almost certainly not. Does it create real leverage for students? Time will tell."
10,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,I found one of my old essays yesterday and thought I would share and analyze it with you,46,g1ktqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g1ktqk/i_found_one_of_my_old_essays_yesterday_and/,2020-04-15 14:17:55,"#Caveats 1. This essay is not as old as you are, but almost. Don't copy from it, plagiarize it, model your essay after it, or anything else. I make no guarantees or warrants about how good I was at this when I was ~~young and stupid~~ 17 like you guys. Seriously. 2. There are good and bad things in here, and I'll try to clarify what I think worked or didn't below. I'll try to pretend I'm reviewing an essay for a student today. Hopefully you will learn from this and get better at writing. If you have questions, ask in the comments. #The Essay &gt;She was completely different from anyone I had ever met before. Mara Louisa was a middle aged Bolivian woman with a welcoming smile and warm personality. But I was terrified of her. She immediately pinched my cheeks and gave me a big hug and kiss. She wasnt my mother; she wasnt even related to me. Why was she doing this? Markie, this is Mara. She will be our maid, my father explained. I blushed and shied away. I already felt a certain contempt and dislike for her. I secretly hoped we wouldnt have much contact. It was nice to have a maid. She cleaned, cooked, and served our family in a variety of ways, but she didnt speak English very well, and the food she prepared was different from the food my mom made. I saw her as an intrusion into my life, and I felt very uncomfortable with her. &gt;In 1992, my family moved to La Paz, Bolivia, the bustling capital city of one of the poorest countries in the Third World. It was a city of contrast and struggle. Many citizens fought daily for survival while the affluent lived in luxury. Our neighbor was a diplomat who rode in a bulletproof limousine and had twenty-four hour guard service. Just down the street, the poverty stricken lived in corrugated tin houses on a filthy river that served as a source for water, bathing, and sewage. The struggling economy was further imperiled by political upheaval and social unrest. But in the midst of all this, my dad got a job as the pastor of a community church. The job didnt pay well by American standards, but it included many benefits such as housing in a parsonage, a company car, and maid service. &gt;Perhaps part of my struggle to accept Mara was the culture shock she exposed me to upon arriving. She had a completely different perspective on life. Gaining weight was a good thing, hard work and kind service (even to strangers) were part of daily life, and, as I discovered at our first meeting, personal space didnt exist. She behaved as though she was part of our family. I tried to avoid her or make her miserable so she would leave me alone, but she persisted in being part of my life. As she sacrificially served my family, I gradually realized that she was trying her best to relate to us. I began to tolerate her, and as I grew to understand her culture, I grew to love her as a member of my family. Mara sometimes insisted on speaking in English so she could improve, all the while making me use Spanish so I could learn. I was also able to observe many of her customs and values, which were often different from my own. &gt;But more than language or culture, Mara taught me about life. Mara had a special respect for others, regardless of social standing. She showed me how to be confident, respectful, tolerant, and friendly at the same time. I learned to value diversity, to overcome adversity, and to invest in developing interpersonal relationships in spite of the difficulties I might face. In a sense, she has shaped many of my social skills from the way I interact with friends to the fun-loving and outgoing qualities that define my personality. #Analysis: 1. The introduction is a little too slow. It doesn't have pace or intrigue and spends too much time saying too little. There's some honesty here, but also some entitlement, immaturity, and overly simple writing. Overall there just isn't enough to draw the reader in. So early in a review cycle or for reviewers who are principled about investing their mental energy into every essay equally, this might work fine. But late in a cycle or given to the wrong reviewer, the rest of the essay will end up getting glossed over a bit. Lastly, some of the phrasing feels a little contrived and that makes the whole message feel a little contrived as well. 2. The background paragraph is well written, but it doesn't really share enough about the author (me). A reviewer just won't get much out of this second paragraph when trying to assess who I am and what matters to me. There's a little bit about income inequality and an explanation that helps tone down the entitlement (i.e. it keeps this from being interpreted as ""I had a maid and it was so uncomfortable!""), but nothing really meaningful. So this paragraph needs to be about half as long and much more personal. How did living in Bolivia impact me? What things stood out to me and stuck with me (and why!)? The general idea of the essay is that I'm writing about how my maid impacted me, so this paragraph should set that up better or amplify/support that theme rather than merely setting the stage and filling in some background. If my whole application was trying to present a particular theme, arc, or narrative (which it wasn't, but should have been), then this would have been a good place to insert some allusion or hint to it. 3. Including the year was a bad idea because it showed that this was a long time ago and probably not as relevant as I was trying to make it sound. I'm giving myself a pass on using the phrase ""Third World"" because that wasn't considered as derogatory then - still a bad idea though. There's also hints of trying to piggyback on those hardships or trying to flex wisdom/enlightenment that I simply didn't have. 4. Starting off the third paragraph with ""Perhaps"" is nonsense. Essays like this don't need hedging language - if you have something to say, just say it. You're writing about yourself, so you're the expert here. 5. The paragraph about culture shock feels contrived as well or at least overstated. The part about connecting with her, learning to love her, etc needs to be way more specific and personal. Right now it feels vague and that ""weatherman wave"" makes it feel insincere or manufactured. There's a bit of the ""redemption trope"" in here too - presenting myself as out-of-touch, ignorant, or foolish in the beginning, then redeeming myself to explain how much better I am now. This is not always bad because it can show growth, introspection, honesty, and vulnerability in winsome ways. But it can also be predictable or feel contrived as this does. 6. The final paragraph is too saccharine and too direct. Since the earlier examples/story weren't specific enough, these sweeping generalities end up looking like pontification. There's not enough to support or give meaning to them. It's good that I finally said something meaningful about myself, but that should have been happening from the first paragraph, not just crammed in here at the end. This ""happily ever after"" ending makes the rest of the story seem even less compelling than it already was. This ending is really predictable and that makes it boring. 7. There are a few good phrases, some unique perspectives, and relatively few cliches. There are also no grammar/syntax errors. The story and insights are mostly ""good enough"" even though they certainly aren't outstanding. The essay mostly avoids falling prey to the [classic blunders](URL There probably aren't a ton of essays like this one in the stack. #Review Framework: **1. Content, topic, and theme** - How good is the actual content? Is it unique? Does it say a lot about you? Does the essay show depth of thought, intellectual vitality, initiative, originality, etc? Does it fit the prompt well enough, or does it feel like it was written for something else and shoehorned in? The content here is merely ok. The specific story was unique, if lacking a bit in craft. While the self-expression was better than average, it still fell a little flat. There was too much detail included for inconsequential things and not enough for the main points. I don't remember the prompt, but as I recall it was solid on that. **2. Style and Structure** - Is the essay easy to read, authentic, creative, compelling, and engaging? Is the style consistent throughout the essay and is it consistent with the rest of the application? Is the essay organized well? Does it communicate clearly? Does it flow smoothly? The essay is easy enough to read, though at times the diction was a little too simple. Parts feel honest and parts feel insincere or forced. It isn't especially gripping or engaging and its predictability makes this worse. It does feel generally well-organized, consistent, clear, and smooth. **3. Impression** - What does the essay say about you? What will a reviewer likely think of you after reading it? Is it compelling and gripping? As mentioned above, there is some good expression in this essay, but not as much as I would like. The essay tries to say more than it actually succeeds in saying. It's mostly just ok. This may depend on the particular reviewer. **4. Diction, grammar, and syntax** - Are there errors or omissions, poor or clunky word choices, issues with word count, etc. I don't recall the word limit, but I do remember being quite meticulous about getting under it. This essay is solid on these factors, though as mentioned, it could benefit from slightly more advanced diction (but please don't read this as license to go overboard!). #Results This essay (and everything else in my application) got me into all six schools I applied to: WashU, UNC, Clemson, Pittsburgh, Indiana, and Tulsa. I was admitted to the Olin BS/MBA program at WashU, directly to Kelley at IU, and got a full merit scholarship at Clemson. Let's face it, I was probably admitted for my outstanding ECs, awards, and stats more so than essays."

I just wanted to post my personal statement to be read. I'm a gap year student who had gotten a full ride to college but turned it down. ghiowgbwoigbow I'M JUST SO EXCITED SO THANKS TO WHOEVER READS IT! (: thank you for holding space for my vulnerability. **Personal statement:** The summer going into my senior year was meant to be self-healing. Although a suicide attempt months prior left me shaky, I was determined to make my last year of high school my best. . . . Then the phone rang. Clarissa, the police just found your mother. Shes been dead for three days. It was the drugs. Im so sorry. I always longed to be the girl who beat the odds despite her adversity. The girl who still fought despite the violence in her home, despite her brother being murdered, and despite being raised by parents who didnt know how to help her. Before my brother Mario was killed, he wished that Id be the one in our family with a brighter future. Pouring countless hours into my different passions, joining the full IB diploma program - I did everything I thought would break me out of the cycle; but, being the hope in a family full of shattered dreams began to kill me. A bitterness for the world overcame me when my mom died. I filled my void by skipping class, drinking,and using drugs. I didnt care to fight for myself anymore. My plan wasnt to live past graduation. Then I met Cherrial. Cherrial understood adversity like I did, but she still illuminated strength and peace. Perhaps she could give me the answers I desperately longed for. I vulnerably poured out my pain to her. In return, she taught me how to meditate and gave me the opportunity to move to Las Vegas with her for a year to commit to changing my life. In my darkest hour a hand was extended, but now it was up to me on whether Id take it. I am a first generation student. I had already committed to college on a full scholarship. Leaving meant risking the brighter future Mario wanted for me. It meant abandoning a father who left his home country and sacrificed everything for this chance. It felt like a betrayal, but to not take the opportunity to save myself would be an even deeper one. Flying past my fears, I packed my bags and never looked back. While running towards drugs and drinking seemed worse than running towards being an overachiever, in the end, it was all running. In these past four months, Im finally stopping to look at my pain and sorrow without needing to escape. The healing Ive done is inexplicable and surreal. Temporarily losing hope in myself was the hardest thing Ive endured, but now I realize that I was never lost. Who I truly am always existed inside of me. I overcame the worst years of my life and Im alive. Im here. And no matter where life takes me, if its to this university or elsewhere, I know Ill be okay. I no longer have to think about the future or the past. All Ill ever have is the present moment where Ill continuously carry my pain, my healing, and my hope, sacredly."

17,vulnerability,ApplyingToCollege,a college essay that I probably would never use but hope to use anyways,23,d4de9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d4de9k/a_college_essay_that_i_probably_would_never_use/,2019-09-15 10:22:00,"So I know it is generally accepted wisdom to never post my own essays. But I don't think there is a meaningfully significant number of people applying to the college I am applying (and this is the only college I am applying to, also defo not common app) around pretty much anywhere. I thought I would get feedback on my writing, so feel free to bite it off, chew it, swallow it, spit it out, etc. here it goes. Prompt: How have you grown over the last few years? &amp;#x200B; I wish that there were other ways for me to answer this. But I cannot write a story of success, neither will I write a story of regrets. I will instead attempt to plainly, clearly, write the truth, and about the growth that was needed to do so. But to write the truth, I must first write of secrets. There is a secret I keep from my family and even some of my closest friends. I wish I could say I bravely spoke the truth to my loved ones. I spill out instead here, on text, what they cannot read. Before it happened, I could keep my integrity effortlessly. Then several things happened, and I no longer could. I was in a relationship with a man who later assaulted me, on November 2017. He did so because he knew I could not talk about it. I was, and still am, deeply in the closet especially to my parents. In September 2018, I tried to end my own life, not because life seemed futile, but because I could not bear the thought of living as myself. I could not, however, elaborate it to my doctors. Two weeks later, I walked out with my secret. That September, I met and loved a beautiful boy who also wanted to solve the problem of consciousness. Quickly we bonded through sleepless discussions on topics from dreams to semiotics. During December 2018, she transitioned into a girl. Then, on March 2019, the demon that almost got me got her, because she hung herself as I was on the phone with her. I wished so much I had stopped her, but if you love someone so much, you never find the courage to give them the lie that you give yourself. She asked me a question and I could not answer back; something broke in both of us that night. And I confronted my raw, distraught self for the first time. Throughout the last two years, I suffered from a loss of words, and it took me every moment of those silence and more to regain my voice. It was not pathological in nature; rather, it was a loss of a sense of self. To find myself back, I had to force myself to write. I had to write when I was empty. I had to write when I felt I couldnt say anything true. Honest silence and loud lies alternated; I would erase as much as I write, until, one day, the truth started seeping out on paper. To verbalize was to illuminate, and illuminated fears are fearful no more. Without fears I was free. When I write, I am free. This honesty you see here is what was left after distilling this past. Today, I desire so badly to live, to live with a bold love of life, and to do so with integrity. Today, I still struggle to overcome the awkwardness, the strange revulsion, from confessing these painful, unwelcomed, but essential histories of my life. In time, I certainly will grow to never even having to overcome them. I find that being oneself is a moment, not a continued state of being. But such moments, although sporadic, are consistently necessary for one to be alive, and they come precisely at these two times; when one speaks of ones mind, and when one lives faithfully to what one has said. We must keep speaking our minds out loud to not run out of things to do. Speaking out is an existential task. Wearing a mask did not allow myself to be exposed. But only with openness and vulnerability I found the freedom to take ownership of my life, freedom not in the infantile sense of a lack of limits, but the strength from knowing one's belonging in this world and solidarity with all who could hear my voice; pushing myself, slowly but inevitably, to grow."

I made the decision to not tell people about my decisions (well, actually lie to them that I withdrew my applications so that everyone would stop bothering me).

I posted in the recent acceptance record megathread because I thought it would help to share my stats, as this community seems to enjoy fretting over them.

People felt betrayed that I lied to them and have said some really awful things as a result. (you are under no obligation to tell people your decisions. period.) Also on this account, I had a bunch of stupid teenage girl ramblings about someone I had a crush on. That was incredibly stupid on my part. I dont have any friends I can talk to about how I feel without something going around that its a weakness or vulnerability, and it was cathartic to essentially scream into the void. Yet this came as more ammunition against me once it was found out. I ruined my image with them as even just a friend. I know this community has been incredibly helpful in reassurance and advice, but be mindful that not everyone wants to see you succeed either. Every post that you got in somewhere will be misconstrued by someone who got rejected as you bragging and making them feel bad. Its so much easier to gain sympathy and solidarity from the reject gang than enviously congratulate others in your own time of failure, I know. Ive had an absolutely terrible day as a result and lost a few of the remaining people I held close. It sucks. These three months will suck. Lots of people think that torturing me in school is a justified way of releasing their own decisions anger. Just dont be an asshole. Please. Im holding on but its not like I can change things for you."

I qualify for some good universities over here, so I only applied to T5s. This basically means the chances of me ever entering the scenario of receiving financial aid are slim. Nevertheless, I am still concerned. The root of my financial concerns is the UKs withdrawal process from the EU. It has the potential to cause some slight economic turbulence. On paper, my family make quite a lot of money - \~$175-200k. However, due to differences in taxes and costs of livings, my familys actual disposable income is much lower than that of the average Americans. Brexit will really things up though- taxes will probably get much higher, the exchange rate is set to plummet, and costs of livings are expected to surge. Due to my parents specific job roles and sources of funding for said roles, the stability of this income is questionable. There is a distinct chance that one of my parents might lose their job, and the other receive a pay cut. I am aware of the endowment of the universities I have applied to, and that if I can justify my need, they have the resources to cover it. However, due to the timeline of things, the details of my financial aid may need to be sorted before Brexit takes place. Therefore, my need at time of calculation will appear to be significantly less than what if may be by the end of the summer, or ever the end of this year. My family have started to make financial cuts so that we can save some money to form a safety net that could cover some of this loss in income. Therefore, any and all excess income, and most of our general savings have been used to form this financial buffer. It is my opinion that every penny not used to create that buffer increases the risk and financial vulnerability of my family. I am therefore scared that because the Brexit dust may not have settled by the time where my need is calculated, my family will be expected to pay a large sum, which is a genuine risk to my parents, and by extension my younger siblings, livelihood. Id really appreciate anyone with some background in this kind of financial aid or has faced similar situations or has any thoughts or ideas regarding my situation to share them with me. Thank you. \[TL;DR\] Brexit might screw my finances, but only after I receive my Financial Aid, putting me in a sticky situation."

I co-founded a club for mental health awareness at my school, and its growing at an insane rate.  Im speaking to my school about the struggles of mental illness, and how I rose above it. Its amazing how much can change and how much better you can become if you reach out for help. I went from a 3.2 -&gt; 3.0 -&gt; 3.8 -&gt; 4.1. Thats an insane increase. And its mostly because of the support Ive gotten from my family, friends, my doctor,and the social worker (sometimes). If youre struggling with symptoms of any sort of mental illness or learning disability, please, please reach out. I know some of you are afraid to expose vulnerability like that - but a social worker at your school or your parents most likely can lead you in the right direction. You are not alone.

Around half of the essay is me talking about my memories of it, and the latter half is me sort of projecting onto the tree my own feelings of vulnerability and my desire to be a reliable person.

I understand that no matter what I do, I have a very low chance of getting in, but I'd like to think I'm a really good writer. Like, pretty damn good. Like, I'm kinda bragging about how good I am right now and I feel a little bad about that. Like, no matter what this post leads you to believe, I actually know English. So essays are a big thing for me. Right now, I've written two potential common app main pieces. One is about a publication I had in a national paper (which I've talked about on this subreddit probably two or three times and I'm sure most people are tired of hearing about) and activism in general, and the other is about my favorite book. The former, I think, paints me as an extremely impressive, qualified applicant and person in general. The latter depicts me as determined, yes, but also with quite a bit of vulnerability and paints me more like an emotional teenager. It's like me as a person instead of me as a figure. Now, I know the personal statement is supposed to be, well, just that. And while I feel both essays could work as that, it's quite obvious that the book one works as more of a *personal* statement. So I should go with that one right? In normal circumstances, I would. Problem is that I know I have very little chance of getting into Brown unless I do something a little risky. Plus, it's easy to forget what someone's favorite book is. But being published is something that gets remembered. Or at least, that's what my dad says, who's an admissions officer at a very prestigious medical school. Ultimately, I'm asking reddit. Which essay should I use? tl;dr--For a school I probably shouldn't get into, should my writing focus why I'm super impressive person or should it focus on why I'm an interesting person?"

After reflecting a bit, I've realized that my reluctance to share this fact with others wasn't because I was scared that the people close to me wouldn't accept me, but rather because I was afraid to display myself as vulnerable to the world. Basically, I feel like I have, in many aspects, always tried to achieve things in life that are universally associated with being ""strong"" and successful,"" such as getting good grades, having a lot of friends, and being masculine, so I thought I'd write my essay on how accepting my sexuality and the vulnerability that comes with it has helped me let loose and recognize that, despite my big ambitions, the happiness that I seek is not necessarily the same as that of other people. I know this is long, but I just wanted to provide some background so that you guys could tell me what you think; obviously I wouldn't write it in such a convoluted way on the actual essay.

I would prefer input from admissions officers or anyone who can give outlook from someone on the inside of college admissions, but anyone is welcome to share! Im trying to shape my essay around how I developed an understanding, love, and acceptance for all people, knowing that everyone has their own story and background that you cant necessarily know about (including people that have done horrible things or differ widely from you in their beliefs). A lot of it has to do with things Ive done and witnessed in my extracurriculars (volunteering, at work, etc.). Ive see that focusing on extracurriculars is one of the cliche topics that bore admissions officers, however, and Id like to stand out and catch attention. I was thinking I could write about how being promiscuous at a certain point in my life has opened me up to experiences with intimacy and vulnerability from complete strangers. Ive gotten to understand the origins behind peoples beliefs, behaviors, and personality. I dont want to discuss too much of it in this post, but I could definitely describe more of what Id want to include in a PM if an admission officer is willing to read. I would definitely not write about any detail of acts or anything of the like, rather focusing on what its taught me. So my questions are; would this be an acceptable topic, and what should I avoid if using it? Also, should I include everything else that also contributed to my belief and developing as a person such as the extracurriculars, family, etc. but focusing less on those experiences?

In this post I cover topics from the basic (What is the Common App?) to the microscopic (What topics are on and off the table? How do I avoid clichs?) and everything in between. So come one, come all, to this big ol' on the college essay. It is my sincerest hope that you come with questions and leave with answers. (But if for any reason this gigantic guide failed to address your particular question, please send me a note. I'd be happy to answer you personally!) SO, without further ado... ## Part One: The Very Basics - What is a College Essay? For the uninitiated, the college essay is an essential component of most (but not all) college applications. Generally, college essays fall into one of three categories - (1) the common application general essay, (2) the supplemental essay, and (3) various scholarship essays. (More on these different types in a moment.) No matter which type you're writing, though, college application essays tend to place you, the writer, in the spotlight. They're designed to help admissions committees gain an insight into what makes you tick. Thus, college essay prompts are often (if not always) of a directly personal nature. They're written in a way so as to challenge the writer to dig deeply and to share personal information about such topics as one's family background, passions, intellectual predilections, or extracurricular occupations. In sum, the college essay is designed to triangulate **who you are** for an admissions committee. In very short, then, a good college essay is one in which the writer goes **deep**, exposing him- or herself on the page, while a bad essay is one that stays on the surface and never moves beyond (or, rather, beneath) the level of the superficial. If that all sounds abstract, don't worry - we'll go into detail on what this all means soon. For now, though, let's talk about the two primary types of college essay. I refer, of course, to the common app essay and to the dreaded supplemental essay. ## 1. What is The Common Application Essay? To answer this question, you first need to know what the Common Application (App) is. The Common App is a non-profit organization that provides the infrastructure beneath the process of applying to colleges in the United States. Practically speaking, the Common App is a giant portal that you, the applicant, will use to upload your essays, input your personal information, and select the schools to which you want to submit. Helpfully, the Common App aggregates most if not all of the information you need in order to make a successful application to a given school. The Common App is the place to go to figure out what prompts you'll need to respond to in order to satisfy the essay submissions requirements for a given school, and they're also in charge of determining which ""common app essay"" prompts students will be answering in a given year. Now, let's get back to the question at hand. The Common App Essay is a general essay that almost every school requires prospective students to submit. While some schools ask for additional supplementary essays (I won't get ahead of myself yet), the Common App Essay is **required** by almost every school. **Completing the Common App Essay is the minimum you will need to be a viable applicant**. # The Common App Essay Is... * An essay of no more than 650 and no fewer than 250 words in length * Written in response to one of seven prompts, which I'll list below * The main piece of writing that a given school will examine when determine whether you're a good fit As I mentioned above, the essay is designed to help applicants share their personality with admissions panels. Here are the prompts for the current application cycle. These prompts, released in 2017, have remained unchanged since and, collectively, offer a wide variety of footholds for an applicant to tell his or her story. There's somethin' in here for everyone. # Common App Prompts for 2018 1. ""Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story."" 2. ""The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?"" 3. ""Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome?"" 4. ""Describe a problem you've solved or a problem you'd like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma - anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution."" 5. ""Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others."" 6. ""Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?"" 7. ""Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design."" As you can see, these seven prompts are designed to provide a near-infinite number of possible responses. And if the first six don't do it for you, there's always prompt number 7, which is explicitly designed for anyone else. So, in sum, the Common App Essay is a universally required essay of between 250 and 650 words that, drawn from seven possible prompts, is the primary way that a university gauges your writing. The Common App Essay is designed to help highlight a student's individuality, and is an opportunity to ""go deep"" and share oneself with the admissions panel. Now, on to the supplementary essay. # 2. What is a Supplemental College Essay? Unlike the Common App Essay, which is near-universally required by colleges, supplemental essays are provided on a case-by-case basis by the colleges themselves. Their parameters vary widely. Some are on the shorter side, clocking in at 100 words or fewer, while some rival the length of the Common App Essay at 500 words or more. The supplementary essay is generally intended as an opportunity for students to show why a specific school is the one for them. While the Common App Essay is designed by the Common App organization, supplemental essays are written by colleges and universities, so their prompts (and the kinds of responses they solicit) align more explicitly with the recruitment goals and priorities of a college. That is, the supplementary essay is a college's tool for screening applicants, sometimes (but not always) by providing challenging or confusing prompts. For example, the below prompt is real, and really challenging. It's both an opportunity to be creative and is potentially impossible to answer. &gt;**Supplemental Essay Prompt Example #1: The University of Chicago:** &gt; &gt;**Prompt**: ""*Youre on a voyage in the thirteenth century, sailing across the tempestuous seas. What if, suddenly, you fell off the edge of the Earth?""* Some prompts, however, are far less adventurous than this, and ask you something simple such as, ""Why x school?"" These essays are designed to give students an opportunity to talk about the specific features of a school or program that makes them want to attend. Whereas the Common App Essay is general - universal to all schools to which one applies - the supplementary essays are much more particularized. That being the case, supplementary essays award creativity and specificity in a way that the Common App Essay generally does not. (Not to say you can't be creative on your Common App.) Above all else, the supplementary essay is critical for letting your favorite schools know why you'd like to attend them. Even in the most creative approach to the supplementary essay, it's good advice to keep one eye on the prize: that is, of giving a clear reason why you belong at X school - regardless of whether that school is the University of Oregon or Johns Hopkins. Now that we've clarified the two main types of essay, it's time to move onto a closer consideration of the actual essay topics themselves, and the possible responses we might imagine to some of them. ## 3. Possible Topics for the College Essay Ok, so: we now know the difference between the Common App Essay and the supplemental essay. We also know the range of possibilities for the Common App Essay prompts. But what are some possible ways to successfully respond to the those prompts? Right up front, it's important to understand the breakdown of which prompts students choose to answer the most frequently. Why? Because, by understanding which prompts are more or less frequently chosen, you can get a sense of where you fit in the cavalcade of applications that admissions committees see every year. So, here's a breakdown of the three most common Common App prompts. # The Three Most Common Prompts on the Common App - SOURCE: [COMMON APP](URL 1. According to the Common App, the most popular prompt in the 2017-2018 cycle was number (5), ""Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others."" A whopping **23.6%** of students chose to answer this prompt. 2. Second-most popular was prompt (7), a topic of personal choice, with **22.5%** of students choosing to answer. 3. The third most popular was prompt (1), ""Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story."" **21.4%** of students chose to answer this prompt. That means that, although there are seven (7) prompts to choose from, the majority of students (\~70%) choose from among **only three**. One could draw several conclusions from this - that these prompts are the most compelling,; or else, that students find the other prompts more challenging, and thus avoid them because they're afraid of failing to answer the prompt in a satisfactory manner. Some students may see this as an opportunity to choose the less commonly answered prompt, and thus to stand out in the eyes of an admissions committee. Let's examine the question of essay topics more closely, and look at several topics and approaches to the college essay that are compelling. We'll also look at several others that, from our perspective, you should avoid. # 4. Good College Essay Topics The only truly essential starting point for your common app essay is that it be about something important to you. It doesnt need to be about curing cancer, immigrating from Venus to the US or winning three varsity championships in a single morning. It just has to be something significant to you. Consider this quote from Christopher Burkmar, Princeton Universitys Associate Dean of Admissions: &gt;*Consider a mundane topic. Sometimes its the simple things in life that make the best essays. Some of my favorites have included essays that reflect on the daily subway ride to school, or what the family goldfish observed from the fishbowl perched on the family kitchen table. It doesnt have to be a life-changing event to be interesting and informative.* A good college essay can potentially be about anything. Often times, however, the impulse is to write it about everything: to write an essay about one's philosophy about life, say, or about something equally grandiose. In fact, the better essay strategy may be to start small, by examining the little details in life that nevertheless contain deep meaning. To come up with good topics for your college essay, you'll probably need to do some brainstorming. Keep in mind that the best essays don't spring out of the ground spontaneously, but are the process of a long, typically rigorous process of brainstorming, drafting, and redrafting. But how does one start brainstorming a topic? # 5. Brainstorming for the College Essay A good brainstorming session can be the difference between creating a strong and unique essay or a mediocre and predictable one. Remember, a unique topic **does not** have to be out-of-this-world zany, but simply something that has personal resonance to you. To hone in on those topics, break up your brainstorming into rounds. In **round 1**, your goal should be identify the important experiences, people, or periods of time in your life. For specific brainstorming exercises to help you do this, read our blog on brainstorming exercises for the college essay. But for this phase, simply look around and ask yourself, Who or what is most important to me? In **round 2,** it's time to take your initial list and delve into the sensory and concrete details that surround the characters, times, and experiences that formed your initial list. If you're writing a college essay about your mother, the second phase of your college essay brainstorming should include a list of feelings (love, admiration, respect), settings (her office, the kitchen), etcetera. These will help give you a basic sense of the emotional texture of your essay. Finally, in **round 3**, it's time to draft. Your objective here is to put the pieces you gathered during rounds 1 &amp; 2 together in a writing process. Start to assemble the pieces of your essay into a narrative that moves beyond the realm of the brainstorm and into the territory of an essay. This can seem a bit abstract or difficult at first. In the next section, we provide an example of a stellar essay, and show you how this process of brainstorming led to its creation. ### College Essay Ideas that Worked - Brainstorming in Action Below, we've included a copy of a college essay that really worked. Read it and try to pick up on the essential themes covered in the essay. Look for what the essay does well, and for where it fails (although, we admit, this essay was pretty great). The section that follows will be dedicated to examining how brainstorming made this essay possible. Theme: Identity Prompt: ""Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence."" &gt;*Her dark brow is often furrowed; the freckles on her tanned nose crinkled as they too scrunch in concentration; the long, spidery lashes of her bright eyes are flickering constantly as she focuses. This is the way my mother calculates, the way she thinks, analyzes, and decides. This is the look I have been raised under, the look to which I can attribute every quirk in my being. It is the look that defines my mother, and the look that has created me. This lookthose narrowed eyes, the pursed lips, the sharp tonguehas taught me courage, taught me independence, taught me strength, and sacrifice. They have showed me vulnerabilitya flaw in the facadeand isolation. Those features, the way the muscles contract and flex, have instilled in me everything that my mother is and have taught me everything I can be.* &gt; &gt;*My mothers eyebrows taught me independence and determination, a mark left over from her adolescence. Although omitted from my knowledge of her until midway through my seventeenth year, my mother grew up surrounded by temptation and destruction. Alcohol, marijuana, heroin. Tested and abused by her mother, father, sister, and brothers. Jail and violence. Damage and disrepair. My mother was forced to be her own person before she was eighteen; she was forced to be her familys person, their protector. No matter how shes suppressed the haunting memories, the twinge in her brow remains the souvenir. It tells me, she tells me, that I dont need to rely on anyone but myself. She teaches me the importance of taking care of others, but never forgetting to take care of yourself. She taught me courage. Its not easy to take the first step without a supporting hand. But it is possible.* &gt; &gt;*I learned strength from her mouth: her tight lips and the slight smirk. It was the mouth that held in the tears, held back the bitter words, and held up her chin. It was the mouth that kissed me as a child and smiled at my curiosity, despite the divorce, despite the cheating, and the lies. She raised me on her own. She was strong and stubborn. To this day, I dont understand how she managed to care for infant, maintain a career, pay bills, and never miss Sunday nights dinner. But the strength that she possessed, that she still possesses despite the heartbreak, the abandonment, and the responsibility. Strength in the face of challenge, strength when theres nothing to support youis invaluable.* &gt; &gt;*Independence is convenient, and strength endures, but sacrifice is the most powerful of all. And thats what I see every time I look into my mothers eyes. The moment she laid eyes on me, the moment she knew she was going to do it alone, she gave me her life. I was the first priority, always. She ensured my safety, she ensured my happiness, my growth, my knowledge, everything. I can never repay her, nor begin to thank for every opportunity she gave me. But Ill never forget it because I can see it every time she looks at me. The pride or the love or perhaps the occasional eye-rolling.* &gt; &gt;*What can have I learned from my mother? How to be myself and how to be better than I am. And Im always learning, always discovering something new about my mother. And all I have to do is look at her. Its written there in her features. All I have to do is look.* # Essay Analysis: All I have to do is look This is a great essay for a number of reasons. The writing is *par excellence,* and the topic is clearly important and personal. This college essay provides a perfect example of what we mean when we say that an essay doesn't need to be about the time you went to Venus, but can (and should) be about something more ordinary and yet more meaningful. Here, that topic is the writer's mother. But how did brainstorming lead to this essay? Take a look. * In Round 1, we can see the initial ideas coming together: Her mother's gaze, her mother's impact on her developing and strengths, and her deep respect for a distinguished individual. These elements form the fundamental *idea*, if not the actual contents, of the essay. * In Round 2, these ideas are deepened through a process of association-building. Specific features attached to sensory details are brought in to deepen the characters in the essay. Finally, a supplementary group of experiences, all mediated through the relationship to the central character, the mother, are introduced. * In Round 3 of the brainstorming process, the author introduces concrete details to bring the character and the essay to life. The tone also begins to take shape. While much of the brilliance of the example essay comes in the particular writing ability of the author, the fundamental components have everything to do with a structured and replicable process of brainstorming. All this goes to show that you CAN brainstorm your way into a remarkable college essay. It's just a matter of being deliberate, taking your time, and working carefully to establish the details, characters, and tone that ultimately breathe life into the essay. # 6. College Essay Topics to Avoid Although almost any topic can potentially be the basis of a great college essay, there are some we recommend against, for two primary reasons. 1. The essay topic is dangerous because it runs the risk of offending a reader 2. The topic is overplayed, clichd, or boring for other reasons. In this section, we list eight types of essay that, for one reason or the other, we advise you to avoid in the process of drafting your college essay. The first variety, the most heinous, is what we've termed ""Red Flag Topics."" These are essay topics we advise against at all costs, as they have a high chance of either boring or simply alienating admissions committees. Stories that fit into the ""Red Flag Topic"" section are often so played out that you run the risk of being written off immediately. Here are the three types of essays that we advise againt. ### Red Flag Essay Topics 1. **Community Service Trips**: Applicants tend to draft elaborate essays about short-lived service experiences. These essays may seem condescending or superficial. And besides, who hasn't taken a service trip? We're sure you can think of something else that speaks more eloquently to who you are. 2. **The Admissions Process:** You wont win points with admissions by writing about the drudgery of application itself. Your essay is an opportunity to reflect. Believe it or not, you might actually enjoy the process. 3. **Unnecessary Quirkiness**: Dont have the reader hold your essay up to a mirror or read in a spiral. Focus on content, not gimmicks. 4. **Sports**: The advice from admissions officers is simple: dont write about sports. Theyre tired of it. Alternative topics will show additional dimensions of who you are. Leave sports discussion to your short-answer responses or to your list of extracurriculars. There, that was easy, wasn't it? Tempting as those topics may be, do your best to ignore them. Remember, the best essays are written about a seemingly innocuous yet transcendent feature of your life - something that occasions true, deep reflection. That's why service trips aren't a good topic for the college essay: at most, they take place over a week or two, and they rarely get at an experience truly essential to *you* and your caracter development. ### Yellow Flag Essay Topics Before we proceed to the next section, let's go over a few yellow-flag topics. These are ones that you might want to consider avoiding, but which are not categorically bad. These include, in no particular order... * Childhood Anecdotes * Political Essays or Topics * Travel Stories * The ""Influential Grandparent"" Essay While these topic are not necessarily off-limits, one should be aware that many admissions officers advise writers to steer away. This for a variety of reasons: some topics, like essays about grandparents, travel, or childhood anecdote, are frequently occurring and tend to sound very similar across hundreds and thousands of samples. Others, like essays about political beliefs, run the risk of alienating the writer from the reader. Of course, that doesnt mean these essay topics cant be executed successfully. One should simply be judicious in choosing whether and how to approach these topics # 7. College Essay Clichs In addition to selecting the best prompt for your essay, it's important to rid your writing of these classic college essay clichs. These pesky phrases, openings, and tendencies are repeated over and over by unknowing students from across the country. These clichs are some of the biggest turn-offs on a college essay, according to college admissions experts. If you identify a cliche in your essay, it just takes some effort and creative thinking to re-design your ideas. ### Clichd Essay Openings 1. **THE DICTIONARY OPENING**: ""Webster's Dictionary defines determination as..."" 2. **THE FAMOUS PERSON QUOTE**: ""Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."" \~Confucius 3. **THE VAGUE GOAL**: ""I've always known, from the time I was old enough to play Operation, that I wanted to be a doctor."" 4. **GOING META**: Was your childhood home destroyed by a landspout tornado? Yeah, neither was mine. I know that intro might have given the impression that this college essay will be about withstanding disasters, but the truth is that it isn't about that at all. 5. **JUST PLAIN UNCREATIVE**: Ever since I was young.. I still remember the day that... ### Other College Essay Clichs 1. **BROAD CONCLUSIONS:** So, in the end, its clear that we should settle our differences with our opponents and listen with open hearts. 2. **REVELATION MOMENTS:** I realized in that moment that just as the shabbiest objects can become the most exquisite paintings, true insight can come from the most unexpected of places. Avoid all these clichs and you should be off to a good start. Of course, this list isn't exhaustive; to look for your own cliches, just read your essay with an eye for banalities, common phrases, and ideas that seem superficial or common-hand. A good rule of thumb is that ""If you've heard it before, take a second look."" (For more advice about how to avoid clich in [your college essays, take a look here](URL # Conclusion As you begin to write your college, essay, whether you're starting off brainstorming or you already have a draft in the works, remember: a good college essay is vulnerable and comes from the heart. That advice can be a dime-a-dozen - what does it really mean to write an essay that ""comes from the heart"" and is ""vulnerable""? In this post, I hope that I've provided some answers to that question. To me, the best college essays are those which begin from a place close to the applicant's daily life, and which illuminate something special yet simple. Remember, you don't need to come across as a superstar, a profound mind, or a saint in order to impress an admissions committee. All you need to do is be honest - both with them and with yourself - in the portrait you construct of your life. Sometimes, clichs are clichs for a reason: because they're true. The clich ""everyone has a story to tell"" just happens to be one of these. /end post I hope this extremely long (yet inevitably inexhaustive) guide was useful. A lot of this information is drawn from the free guide I linked above. If you have any questions for me about this stuff, feel free to let me know! In the near future I'm planning posts on school selection, how to gauge fit, and other topics related to the college essay. In the meantime, though, happy writing! :D"
28,cybersecurity,ApplyingToCollege,Should I include being a Roblox game developer as an EC on my apps?,1,i1x3o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i1x3o8/should_i_include_being_a_roblox_game_developer_as/,2020-08-02 04:34:14,"(this is a throwaway account if you couldn't tell by the username) The title is pretty self-explanatory. I started with 0 programming/game development experience in November 2018 and since then have grown to be moderately popular with an ever-growing fanbase and discord server. Being the sole developer of my games, I've poured countless hours into my work and taught myself how to script and build. My builds are well-esteemed and I have an established and respected position in the community. A few months ago I also joined a group and became an important developer and supervisor there. Currently I work on my games alone, manage my server, and work as a developer and admin in the group I joined. As far as my actual games, I obviously can't include too many details as to not expose myself. Unlike the kid-friendly image people generally associate with Roblox, my games fall into the psychological horror, thriller, and mystery genre and include various heavy topics. A very complex and intricate story is told over the course of 3 full games with several hours of gameplay. As somebody planning on going into Computer Science/Cybersecurity, should I include this in my applications? While being a developer has given me valuable experience and skills very important in the field such as coding and social networking, I'm afraid I will be laughed at because it's Roblox. Would it be possible for me to simply mention being a 'game developer' without mentioning Roblox or will they ask me to reveal my name and show them my games? Having been a developer for over a year and a half, I would like to include my experiences and games in an essay. Is this also a good idea? Thank you for any response! TD;LR: I develop roblox games, should I include that in my apps?"

I live in Boise, Idaho and I've figured that I would either like to attend CWI or BSU. I'm currently enrolled in the cyber security program at CWI here is a link to the program [CWI Program](URL but I cannot transfer to further my degree to a bachelors unless I do western governors which I don't really want to do since it's online. I want the social interaction of being physically at college and around others. The other option is that I could do computer science with an emphasis in cyber security at BSU here is a link to that program and the classes required [BSU Program](URL I just don't know what the best route is. Most of the security jobs i've seen say they require a bachelor's in computer science. Is it better to go for the computer science degree or the degree in security? To me it seems like computer science might make me more marketable and diverse in the industry. I'm pretty bad at math and I know computer science requires lots of math. I just don't really see the point in getting the cyber security degree first, as it might narrow me down to just security related jobs which is my interest but I don't know if being confined to one particular area sounds too appealing in the grand scheme of things. I don't know, any advice would be greatly appreciated as trying to figure out what program and route for me to take is pretty stressful. Thank you."

I really like bioinformatics, machine learning, AI, I've done some cybersecurity which is kind of interesting and I think I'm okay at coding in general. I also like circuitry and hands-on engineering. I have experience in all these things and biomedical robotics also interests me a LOT (I would need ECE or CE program probably for this since I don't want to apply to a major like BME or EE because they have very limited career opportunities) however that's the only thing I don't have experience in. In CS I'm not really interested in how programming languages work and the computational math behind it but in CE I'm not interested in building computers either. I'm scared that if I do CS I'll just be stuck coding which I can do but I don't think I would enjoy only that. In CE I'm scared I will get stuck in too much of the building hardware side and not get to explore my Machine Learning and AI interests. I have some schools I want to apply to rn like UMD, Georgia Tech, Cornell, some other ivies but I'm still looking for schools which is hard because I'm not fully sure about the major. If someone could help me decide if CS or CE seems like a better fit (maybe even recommend some schools :D) that would be so helpful."

I go to an academy, so I was forced to take all honors and AP classes since my freshman year and it took a toll on me. Ive taken AP Biology, AP Chem, AP History I and AP History II so far since freshman year. All my other classes that are not AP classes are honors (so like honors american lit, french I&amp;II, math). Every student has a major and im an information systems major so Information essentials honors (freshman year) and networking honors (sophmore year) are classes I also take. I plan to take AP Comp Sci, AP world, and AP environmental next year. I will take dual lang, java honors, french III honors and alg 2 honors as well. My EC'S have been chorus for 4 years, leadership role in environmental club (ended up in the newspaper for leading a climate change strike) ModelUn, Heroes n Cool Kids, colorguard, Girls Cybersecurity club and book club. Leadership in Diversity Day performances too. I plan on doing more junior year if covid allows it. I also do volunteer work and make flyers/handle media for a student organizarion which knits for covid patients and childrens patients.

However, I have taken 5 community courses (7 by the end of summer) relating to computer science, and I have 0-1 more to take after fall as well as other requirements (math, english, etc) before I can get an AS degree for transfer (if regular admission does not work out). I have somewhat average stats (4.24 w, 3.83 uw, 1520 SAT) for my school in my opinion. I was wondering how colleges would consider my CC courses when looking at my class load holistically as an indication for my desire to pursue Computer Science. Other students that I know that will be applying this fall have taken POE like I have, but have taken AP CSA and CSP instead of Cybersecurity and IED and have done no Community college CS courses."

Open to high school students!,1,h8vwaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/h8vwaf/cybersecurity_club_open_to_high_school_students/,2020-06-15 01:32:03,"Hello! I'm starting an online cybersecurity club called CyberCyborg. This club is on google classroom and the code is: nnfunlo. Here is the post I made recently about the club: ""First, I want to mention the goal of this club, which is to encourage students to pursue the growing field of cybersecurity. To achieve this goal, I don't intend for this to be like a class. I am a firm believer in the idea of ownership: you get out what you put in. That said, I won't be putting any deadlines on any of the assignments. Moreover, the meetings are only for those who want wholeheartedly want to participate. I will NOT be holding anyone accountable for handing in work late or not handing in work at all. This club is for you, not me. Second, this club is COMPLETELY virtual. We will online be contacting each other via this classroom page, email, and possibly Reddit. Our meetings will consist of coursework that you can work on and discussing cybersecurity topics. I also want to complete a collaborative project (that will also be virtual and optional) by the end of next year. Third, I want to talk more about what we'll be doing in this club. I will be making and assigning strict coursework EVERY week (on Mondays). The coursework will consist of videos, articles, independent activities, etc. that either I or someone else has made. Completing the weekly assignment will only take a few hours (three hours max). There will also be occasional virtual hackathons that you may participate in. These hackathons will be cybersecurity-related games that I have found online. I did have to pay for some of the material that I am assigning so please do not take any of this lightly. Lastly, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I truly believe that if you have read this message in full, you are on your way to becoming a great student not just in cybersecurity but in general. I can't wait to get started and I hope you feel the same way. I've always loved the concept behind cybersecurity. It's an interesting and incredibly fulfilling field. That said, let's have some fun! If you have any questions please shoot me an email. I would love to hear from you!"" Please message me if you have questions!"

45,cybersecurity,ApplyingToCollege,I'm not very POINTY.,1,gpqgak,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gpqgak/im_not_very_pointy/,2020-05-25 00:22:49,"**Hello!** I've been hearing from a lot of college services that you need to be a so-called **""pointy""** student. Looking at my EC's and what I'm passionate about, I'm not that ""pointy."" I have 3 EC's with medicine (medical club president, medical program, other science club), 3 EC's with cybersecurity (which is what I want to do as a job), 3 EC's relating to books (book blog, bookish business, bookish job), and some other things here and there. I hope you can see my problem here. I started the medical club when I was a sophomore and I really loved medicine at the time. Soon I found out that I was extremely scared of blood (don't ask me how I found this out). I still continued doing medical club because I loved leading the club but the stuff I was teaching wasn't exciting to me at all. I do care about the healthcare industry (specifically the injustices of it) and helping people was always something I wanted to do in the future. Then I took a cybersecurity course and completely fell in love. Cybersecurity was a way for me to learn the intricacies of a network and it seems super rewarding to help people, especially because the world is becoming more technology-focused. All the while I was always reading. I love reading and could literally sit on my couch with a hot cup of tea and read for the rest of my life. Now here's the thing: my parents want me to do something in the healthcare industry and so do I for the most part. I want to combine my passion with healthcare with my passion for cybersecurity. I watched Mr. Robot for a while when I was starting with cybersecurity (it's a t.v series about this depressed hacker) and in one episode the main character was taken to the hospital. In the hospital he hacked the entire system and he did it super easily too. I did further research because I was super interested and I found out that hospitals have one of the worst anti hacking infrastructures ever! Not only this but since hospitals are now shifting to more robots and less humans (well sort of, we're getting there) so there is more of a need for I.T and security professionals. EUREKA! THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO! Okay so I'm really interested in this whole cybersecurity + hospital thing but it's very weird for someone to have such a big role in medicine in their application when what they really want to do is cybersecurity. In other words, you don't have to know about healthcare and medicine if you want to work as a security analyst in a hospital. You just need to know about cybersecurity. So here is my problem again. It just doesn't make sense. As for the book nerd portion of my application, I don't know what to do about that either. I LOVE BOOKS WITH ALL MY HEART but how is that going to make me ""pointy"". Anyways, I don't want to exclude any EC's because I LOVE THEM ALL . That said, how can I use my EC's to my advantage on the college application? Sorry if this was super long... I am desperately in the need for advice. THANK YOU! P.S I just wanted to say that the college application process sucks and throughout high school I didn't really care about how all these EC's would look on my application. I just did what I loved."

Two years later, I'm a college graduate, and I've figured out what I can and can't tolerate in IT. Computer engineering interests me because I'm a hardware person and it's a good blend of physical and software. Anyway, because I was in a cyber curriculum, I'm having a lot of trouble finding a 4-year school that will transfer a good amount of my 64 credits.The vast majority of classes that I took just aren't applicable to CE curriculum at universities. So I'm really struggling right now; obviously my 33 ACT score from 2017 is useless now, and although I have a 3.9 GPA, significant merit scholarships are really hard to come by for transfer students. Any advice for me? I'm in Ohio so I'd like to stay in-state to keep the tuition costs down."

IK it's long. This is an email I sent my HS guidance counselor about my future plans. Not shitpost wednesday material, but I wanted to put it on the sub when its still on my mind. I didn't write it with the intention of putting it on reddit, but I've been on r/A2C for more than a year now, and I wanted to give back to what I got out of the college process. If she reads this though, 1) hello :D didnt know you used reddit! I guess you know my username now. and 2.) I really did write this without reddit in mind. I hope you'll forgive me. Now without further adieu, &amp;#x200B; Next year... &amp;#x200B; I will be attending WPI! When I got deferred initially, I understood why they did it. I didnt think I would have gotten deferred nevermind accepted at the end of it. I put down the $500 deposit to enroll, and have started to receive some things in the mail that informs about dates, and the future and whatnot. Assuming the world will get back to normal in the next few months, Actually attending will be amazing. Their average starting salary for Computer science majors is $88,000! Average! That's more than $20,000 a year more than what my mom makes. Some people don't even make $20,000 in an entire year. It's crazy. I can barely imagine it. I feel so lucky to have gotten into the school, and even more lucky to have a family that might be able to pay for (at least some of) it. While money is not 100% why I applied, It is at least 30% of why I am attending. It is 118% a major plus. My long term goal is, when I get out of college, to save like crazy and (try) to save at least a third of what I make (or even more). I've been putting some money in the stock market for the last few months and (while it was possibly the worst time to invest on my part), taught me leagues and bounds about investing, retirement, and compound interest. My brother hates when I talk about what money could be at 4% interest in the future. :D. I plan to Major in computer science, and minor in business, to get some exposure to that side of education. I am still undecided on whether or not I want to go and get a graduate-level master's education, in comp sci, business, or anything else. I Would love to have that on my resume, and let me stay in school for another year or so. It would mean paying another year in tuition, though. It is definitely a decision I can defer for a couple years. After college, my plan is to work in the cybersecurity sector at a big bank. (because big banks always can get bailed out by the government lol). But yeah cybersecurity is my planned work sector to work in. Pays well, Im interested in the subject, and i can be the hackerman I always dreamed of being. lol. Though for me it's kind of underwhelming. Maybe it might be because of the coronavirus and i'm just around my family and no one else, but to me it feels awesome to have a plan and going to college and all that. Is this underwhelming outlook weird? Like I am extremely excited to go to somewhere like this and make my education how I want it, and not how the state wants it. FYI in the future for other students like me, I would 118% reccommend applying. I didnt think I would be able to get in, but I showed them how much I am commited to the topics that they specialize in, and apparently that was barely enough. I even changed my Instagram bio to \[insert high school initials\] 2020, WPI 2024. It's surreal. It really is. I just wanted to thank you for being a great guidance counselor for the college process. Me struggling through the BS of the collegeboard's ""Not-for-profit"" outlook was really the only stressor in this entire process. lol Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. Honestly though I can't wait to go to college next year and be the person I always dreamed of being. Thanks, u/galaxypig &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; TL;DR - College is something to look forward to. Life is going to be awesome. Thank you so much."

Boston is IMO the best location out of any of these. I love the high energy environment, and I would definitely take advantage of the cross-registration at Harvard. MIT also has lots of classes in security studies, a topic I think I would enjoy. I love Stanford's interdisciplinary vibe. I could get the technical education I want and the political science debates and environment. The internships in non-quant roles for poli sci are much better than at MIT. It still has amazing technical majors. It also has great security studies classes. I like that i would be able to take classes at the law school. Though it seems to fit my academics really well, the biggest roadblock is that it is in CA. I have lived in Cali all my life and I am no excited by spending another 4 years here. I love international vibes and energy. Yale: It is East Coast with great poli sci ofc. It does not have as easy of a way to take technical classes. For example, there is not really a cybersecurity class. There are amazing political internships and networking opportunities, but I feel a general lack of substantive research opportunities.

I want to enroll in WGU, and here are their IT programs: * Information Technology * Information Technology Management (B.A.) * Computer Science * Software Development * Data Management/Data Analytics * Cloud and Systems Administration * Cybersecurity and Information Assurance * Network Operations and Security * Health Information Management I originally was going for Data Analytics so I could break into a business analytics job. But now that I'm considering product management, I don't know which degree is the most relevant. Will the Data program give me enough flexibility? Is the straight ""Information Technology"" degree too generalized to make me competitive at entry level? Is the IT Management too ""soft"" (since it's actually a B.A.)?"

Which is SO UNFAIR, like u let these guys in nd u give me a ""sorry sweetie gotta wait a little longer to get rejected"". I get it it's more competitive now, and I shouldn't be comparing myself to my brothers, but it's hard not to. But I'm even more angry that I wasted all that time when I could've been looking for housing at college I'm most prbly going to now (UNC Charlotte).However my mom is thinking of sending me to the other in State college, I got in which is an all women's college (Meredith) . Look I got nothing against those, but I just don't wanna go there. And she's also worried about housing at Charlotte to the point she insisted to my dad that they rent an apartment there so I can live off campus instead. My dad and I were like seriously??? Tbh my heart was always set on Charlotte, but I just said I wanted to go to State just to make my parents happy. I toured both colleges last summer, and I had the ""I don't want to leave here"" feeling with Charlotte that I didn't have for other colleges I toured including State and Meredith. I know Charlotte's not as good of a school as State, but their comp sci program still appeals to me more. It's not as highly reputable as States, but it's still ranked pretty well. Also states CS program is under the engineering program, so you have to take all these extra engineering classes. Whereas with Charlotte the CS has its own college and you can have concentrations like cybersecurity, data science, etc. I just think I'll be happier in Charlotte, and hopefully that's the case (if not I can always transfer). Plus I'm trying to get away from where i live now cuz I've been living here for my whole life and I feel cooped up, so I'm ready for something new u know?"

My question is, if I am looking to be another CS applicant for T20s, does it make more sense to lighten my load and focus more on ECs and awards? Here are my current ECs and awards summarized: (Am from small rural town so nothing Bay Area tier) \- Data Science and Coding Club Leadership \- University research with a professor in cybersecurity, not just grunt work but actual researching of my own proposal (we will likely be published together in a decently reputable peer-reviewed journal) \- USACO Silver \- Academic Decathlon CT States: 7 Medals and winning state team (not going to nationals sadly) \- Patented Invention and went to National Invention Convention and Entrepreneurship Expo after being a finalist in my state \- Good all-round volunteering and ECs otherwise mentioned As a junior I will mainly be pursuing the following ECs: \- Continuing my Uni Research \- Continuing my clubs and basic ECs/volunteering \- USACO Gold \- Congressional Award Gold Medal &amp;#x200B; My senior schedule will also be just as hard.

I got in at URI as well for CS, but their program is a LOT worse, the connections I would make with employers would not be even close to the same, and I just havent found anything special about the school other than the fact that my only debt would be my FAFSA loan because of what my parents are willing to offer. URI would cost me about 21-23k a year to attend, meaning I would save about 30k in debt by staying in state.

I'm Asian, average SAT, slightly above average GPA, not stellar ECs, 9 total APs etc. Thankfully I'm one of the lucky few who has an overwhelmingly supportive parent. I only applied to Drexel and Penn State, got accepted into both. But they're on a top ten list of schools for my major, Cybersecurity.

But I honestly don't care that much, and that might just be me, because I'm leaving this hellhole in 6 months and won't ever see these people again! Anyways, I'm trying to say that you have your own way to go. Go to the school that is the right fit for you. Go to the school that you can call home. Talk to alumni, visit if you can, network and look at their social media pages! You're going to be at this place for possibly 2+ years. Please, make sure you're happy there.

Here's some advice that I wished I got when I had started my application process. Obviously this is all based on personal experiences so please take it all with a grain of salt. * Take BOTH the SAT and ACT as soon as possible - I dedicated myself to College Board on Day 1. I did everything imaginable on Khan Academy for the SAT and got a 1420 on the **fourth** try (first time was 1370). I decided to take the ACT in december with no prep just to get an idea and got a 34. Had I been open to trying a practice test from both tests prior to focusing on one, I could have had more time to improve an already good score. * Start your essays NOW - Almost every college has their supplements/questions posted. The key thing here is to pace yourself. Just dedicate a few concentrated minutes every weekend to bullet point ideas or phrases that you might want to include. That way, even if you decide to wait till the last minute, you're not starting your essay with a blank screen. I encourage recycling essays when you can. * Get someone you *trust* to read your essay - Seems like a given, but I was hesitant giving my essays to others to read as I was scared of having to rewrite everything. Don't be hesitant like I was. I had a middle school english teacher that I have stayed in touch with who ended up reading my essays. We were able to have a conversation about my essays and my high school career as a whole which really helped me word things better and come up with entirely new ideas. * Stay organized - You're going to get a ton mail/email sent to you, especially if you have used College Board. I have a bin that I dump any college mail I get into. I had a folder in my email that collects all the stuff from colleges. Feel free to unsubscribe to them if you are genuinely annoyed by any of them but some may have fee waivers so keep an eye out. I also created a spreadsheet for myself that had the colleges I was applying to, what their policies are on score sends and superscoring, their deadlines for everything, subject test requirements, majors and minors selected, and more. * Talk to your high school counselor (if you have one) - They are one of the most valuable people in this journey. If they don't have the answer, they know someone who does. Thank them and give them updates on your progress even if you do not have any questions. * Ask for recommendations early - I asked all my recommenders if they were willing to write a letter for me mid-Summer. Did any of them get back to me immediately? No. Was I the first person in their line of other students who waited until after school started to ask? Yes. I also sent them a brag sheet/resume. Don't forget to thank them. * Take up a passion or interest that you have always found an excuse for not doing - Advice speaks for itself. Sure you already have a gazillion ECs, but how many did you actually enjoy? Take advantage of your school breaks and the summer to do something truly unique. Interested in cybersecurity? Why join a hackathon when you can start your own? It's daunting but if it's what you love, you shouldn't stop yourself from doing it. * File the FAFSA ASAP - Just do it as soon as it opens. It is easier and less intimidating than it really is. * Enjoy the ride - As cheesy as it may sound, you're running a marathon. So feel free to stop once in awhile and appreciate how far you have come. I wish I did more of that often. Again, these are all things *I* wish *I* knew when I started the process. Class of 2020, let's help 2021+ out. Feel free to share any advice you wish you would have gotten when you started!"

I'm trying to decide my courses for spring semester at my community college (this will be my third semester). I'm planning to major in Computer Science and have applied/am applying to eight different schools. UMD and Emory are my ideal schools, but Emory is a reach; I know my current credits apply to both of these schools. I know it makes sense to get a bunch of gen ed courses out of the way while I can, but I'd love to just take computer science and cybersecurity classes. I've already taken Intro to Psych, Intro to Comp Sci, and Comp Sci 1 along with AP Lit and AP Stat. I can handle two college classes with my current schedule at my high school, but I've heard the senior year gets easier in semester 2 so I may be able to take three classes (which would be nice). I'd love any recommendations for classes that would be useful to get out of the way or simply enjoy now. Happy to provide any additional info."

So I wrote several sentences about that and even about specific classes they offer. Now today while I was preparing for my UMich interview, over three weeks after I submitted, I noticed my mistake. I went back to that website that talks about the major and I noticed it said UMich Dearborn, not Ann Arbor. Same logo but with the word Dearborn under it. Ann Arbor, a completely different school, does not have a CIA major, just a regular CS major. So there goes my chances of getting in.

Out of 60 people in the two Google CSSI groups I met, 4 of us are at ASU (which means yes, you dont have to go to an Ivy to get into a competitive program like CSSI). I even met someone there that was from Cal State Sacramento which I feel like some people on here would be extremely surprised to hear.

Though I was always juggling a couple of APs and Dual Enrollment classes, I've come to terms with the fact that there isn't any excuse for the horrible GPA I have. I'm currently in a decent amount of clubs and have a less than average amount of community service hours. I'll do a reverse chanceme post soon, since I do have a couple of ECs and prestigious achievements in stuff like Debate, amongst other clubs. However, with the stats I have right now, there's no chance in hell I get into a T100 school. However, I believe with the classes I've decided to take senior year, as well as all the extracurriculars and volunteer programs I plan to join, waiting for the regular decision deadline would be the best option for me. Now that I have medication for my ADHD, I'll be able to focus on my classes and get a 4.0 for the fall semester, which I believe would be a tremendous help for college applications who see my utterly shit GPA. So, I'm honestly really confused at what I should do at this point in time. Should I start applying for early decision/priority deadlines, or should I wait to get a 4.0 during the fall of my senior, and join a couple more ECs and volunteer programs in order to show colleges that I've improved ever since I got myself medicated for ADHD, and then apply right before the regular decisions deadline? Stats: 3.0 UW / 4.0-4.2 W SAT: 1210 first time, but will retake ASAP and predicted to get 1400-1500 Took 1 AP, and 3 honors freshman year, 2 APs, 2 Honors sophomore year, and 3 APs, 2 Honors, and 1 Dual Enrollment Class Junior year, and gradually increased in GPA with each year. Senior year / Fall Semester is going to be the blowout year with 6 AP classes, 3 Dual Enrollment classes (At the same time), a shit ton of volunteer work, and a shit ton of ECs. I have some extracurriculars to put on the application, like multicultural club, vice president of hip hop club, President of the Speech and Debate/Forensics team (this is a big one since we've done extraordinary well as a ""ghetto"" school, and I'm the first person in the history of the school to do a certain type of debate, and got no coaching from the team coach), BETA club, and NHS. I also have a shit ton of hobbies (probably due to my ADHD), and that's probably one of the reasons for my ship GPA. Hobbies include cybersecurity (participate in lots of online penetration testing events), programming/coding, cooking (Had to come home from school and cook lunch for me and my sister every day, and cook dinner for the entire family everyday once the parents got home. This has improved my cooking skills quite a bit, and it's something I enjoy a lot), chemistry (have a decent lab in my garage that got quickly shut down by my dad because he thought it looked suspicious to people peeping into our garage), FOREX/Stock trading (Invested over 6k dollars in stocks for my mother and currently have a 24% increase from where we started from), Online Debate and Political Discussion (Debate President already so this shouldn't matter), Bodybuilding/Weightlifting (Go to Gym everyday for 2 hours), Botany (Tended to about 20 giant ass plants since 5 grade, and I continued all throughout middle school and high school, and spent hundreds of hours of hard labor making sure they grew properly and had the adequate space they needed. Parents gave me the backyard to do whatever I wanted so I grew a shit ton of plants and a mini-garden with Papayas, Tomatoes, chilis, etc.), and I play the piano (Only took 1 year of a piano class, and I played pretty well so I took a different elective next year and continued to play piano as a hobby at home). Theres a few more, but I'll save those for the reverse chanceme. I'm an Indian (Asian) male that comes from a low income family, and I'll be the second person in my family to go to college. (Parents didn't, sister did). I have quite a bit of achievements and involvement (Especially Debate) in each of these extracurriculars, I'll go into specifics for my future reverse chanceme post. TLDR; Aggressively shit GPA, took quite a bit of a heavy courseload, taking an even heavier courseload senior year, and I want to prove to colleges that I can do well, since my ADHD is now medicated. Some decent extracurriculars and leadership experience, a shit ton of hobbies due to my ADHD, and I want to get into ANY college in the US that can give me a full ride. Honestly, when it comes down to the bare bones, I don't care which college it is, as long as I can get a full ride, I'll be fine. Should I start applying ASAP for early decision, or should I wait for senior grades to kick in, join some ECs, get some more volunteer hours, and then apply right before regular decision deadline? Current schools I would like to go to (with hopes of a full ride): UCF UF Baylor Binghamtom Tulane Wake Forest (far far far reach) University of Kentucky University of Alabama (only because I heard they have good merit aid, idk how they treat Indians down there) And a couple more which are reaches but I'll still apply."

I dont want colleges to see me as a 4-digit number &amp; a scantron paper. The thing is: Im scared of failure &amp; I hate this because my family, friends, neighbors, and mentors know that I am a good person who has this impeccable future  the truth this: Im not a good person I may have to go to community college, which is free from where I live, and thats that.

In about a years time I'm going to be getting out and try to go to school using my GI Bill. Ill be honest in high school I was a dummy who didn't care about going to any post-secondary education and didn't pay attention when they were going over how to find a college or anything like that. I want to go to school for Computer Networking or Cybersecurity because I have been doing networking for the past 3 yrs and quite like it. Ive read over the admissions resources in the sidebar but Im still lost. I dont really care about the price of the school as the GI Bill covers full cost of any public school in the US and up to $23,671.94 for private schools but I have also found that most private schools have the yellow ribbon program which will cover the rest of expenses. The only thing that I really care about in a school is how good that program is for Networking or Cyber security, school spirit, and If I can get in. I only scored a 24 on the act and was only in the top 1/3rd of my high school rankings. I just bought an ACT study book to try and retest since last time I did it I was 16yrs old and didnt prepare for it. Also location is not a factor as Im willing to move anywhere to get a good education. Thank you for any and all advice"

As of right now I really like UT Austin and Rice! They're both close to home, in a city, highly ranked, and have an amazing environment. Stats/ECs: SAT 1360 (pretty low but I've only taken it once without studying to see where I was at) APs  took one last year (5), three this coming year, and will take six both junior &amp; senior year Rank  top 2% of class. Classes  advanced in both math &amp; science. I play the cello in a local symphony; take outside classes on coding &amp; electronics; &amp; am in Model UN. This coming year I'm starting a cultural club that I'm really excited for; am applying for officer in a different cultural club (I'm mixed); will be in both NEHS and Music Honor Society; and will join Interact &amp; UIL math. I'm also interested in Speech &amp; Debate, DECA, YG, &amp; UIL science but will have to consider those later because I don't want to overload myself. This year I will also apply for NHS &amp; NSHS, as well as an officer position in a local girls' organization. Junior year I plan to open a tutoring/education club that has not only tutoring services but regular workshops/lessons open to all, I've planned most everything for it but really want to spend this coming year focusing on the other club I'm starting so this will have to wait. Preferences: Urban environment! I was raised in the city and want to go back lol Non-religious  I really really liked Georgetown but had to cross it off my list bc of this :/ Fairly selective  I want to learn with others who also want to learn. &amp; I want to have access to opportunities &amp; resources that are available at more elite schools Diverse Major: unsure here, but here's what I'm interested in  engineering, energy (!!! especially microgrids, conversion efficiency, &amp; innovative batteries), physics, cybersecurity. I also am interested in journalism &amp; civics/politics but I'm pretty sure I'll enter college as a STEM major I'd like there to be an exchange/study abroad program, especially in latin america or south asia Financial aid: we're in that gray zone where we won't get much aid but can't really afford full price. Scholarships would be nice if the schools offers some good ones Location: US, but unless it's really good I'd like to stay away from the south (like Mississippi &amp; Alabama) Let me know if you need any more info!

Sorry for the long post which will follow, but I need advice on what to do because in my opinion, my extracurriculars so far are not that impressive (I will list them at the end with details), so Im trying to do more things for senior year. I have my eye set on one EC in particular, which is my state Youth Commission which I believe I am well qualified for and could be appointed to, but my mother refuses to allow me to sign up because she does not agree with the requirement that I would have to travel 3 hours to the state capital a few times a year. The deadline to sign up is this Friday. I am also trying to join Key Club next year (which is also an option for obtaining community service hours to graduate HS), and do a summer tennis camp, but she has been noncommittal regarding both. I believe she feels like these conflict somehow with her schedule, although she doesnt seem that busy to me. I have no idea what to do next, and I want to know if my current ECs will suffice for schools such as USC, LMU, Oxy, or Chapman.  CyberPatriot: 9, 10: In 10th grade, I was my team's co-captain, and we reached the highest tier (Platinum) and competed at the state level. This was the EC I had devoted the most time to per week. Key Club: 9; I was only a nominal member because I had joined without my moms permission, so I did not participate. If I join next year, I would be a more involved member. City Youth Commission: 9, 10, 11: I am the chair of my citys Youth Commission since April, and before that I had been the Vice Chair since September 2017. I was the de facto chair for most of 2018 since the actual chair was rarely in attendance, and her eventual term expiration. National Honor Society: 10, 11: I was more involved with this club sophomore year than I am now because it interferes with work and I also feel like the club has become worthless since the former advisor left. NAACP Youth Development Program: 10: I was very involved with this program and I was elected its secretary, but I was only involved from roughly October to December 2017. However, I officially remained an NAACP member for one year thereafter. I might still be a member because I am still receiving issues of The Crisis magazine. Toastmasters Youth Leadership Program: 10: It was a workshop structured as a club. I was elected President and recognized for being the only member to attend all meetings. Computer Challenge: 9, 10, 11: This is a well-attended event held yearly at my local community college which is a competition in various computer-related subjects. I have only won a few awards at this event: 5th in Computer Troubleshooting in 2017 (two-person team), and three 1st place awards in Computer Keyboarding, Information Security Theory, and Cybersecurity - Non-CyberPatriot in 2019. Internships and work with my school: Rising 10, Rising 11, 11: I worked at my school in summers 2017 and 2018 in the summer school program, the first year helping 4th graders with academic subjects and assisting in Garden Club (which also included tending to the chickens at our school) and STEM Club, and the second year running Robotics Club. I will be doing this internship again this summer. I currently work at my school for the aftercare program, and I primarily help out (at a more minimal level) with LEGO Club and Intramural Sports Club. Senior year and others: Besides what was mentioned above, I have been considering doing CyberPatriot again, and also taking the National Latin Exam, but both seem to be dependent on my mother's approval. In the past, I have done many minor activities, but unfortunately, I didnt keep a consistently updated list of ECs back then."

I was going to spin a wheel to decide, but I was told that this subreddit is quite knowledgeable about colleges, so here I stand in front of y'all. Three Choices: 1. San Jos State University for Computer Science 2. UMass Amherst for Computer Science 3. Purdue University for Cybersecurity Pros of San Jos State * Close to home, so I get to stay with my loving parents and sister, and enjoy home cooked meals * Parents say they'll get me a Tesla (although it'll probably be a 2010 Honda Accord) for my commute * The cost will be substantially lower than my other choices at roughly $5,000 a year (with scholarships) * In the Silicon Valley, so there is a surplus of jobs in my field of study. Cons of San Jos State * Miss out on the College Life * Will not have a fresh start in a new location * Will not be able to strengthen qualities such as independence and self-reliance * Will be commuting, so my parents will constantly look over my shoulder at everything I do: getting a girlfriend, playing video games, where I go, and what I spend my money on * Not really an ""eye-popping"" college on my resum &amp;#x200B; Pros of UMass Amherst * In a location, I'm familiar with, as I lived in Mid Massachusetts for two years. * Great CS program and opportunity to also take business as a minor * Vegetarian/Vegan options are not a problem, as it has the best food options of all colleges * Relatively cheap with my scholarship (Almost UC instate cost) * Has really nice facilities, one of the tallest libraries in the world * Intranational program: can take courses from any state I want, even North Dakota * 5 College Consortium, I can make the most of my education Cons of UMass Amherst * Furthest from home * Brutal weather * Not as ethnically diverse as I would like * Boston and NYC are more of Business hubs than CS * Don't know if I'll fit in that well there * Not many people I know that will be going there &amp;#x200B; Pros of Purdue * I am very interested in Cybersecurity and I hear that the polytechnic college is actually pretty good * Will have the best college experience with sports, academics, and connections * Great ethnic diversity * Appealing college name * Will be the best program to get me a job quickly * Know a lot of people going there, so assimilation probably won't be that hard * Close to 3 big cities: Chicago (Really want to live there), Indianapolis (Know nothing about them besides the Pacers and Colts), and St. Louis (I was actually born there hehe) Cons of Purdue * Didn't get into my first choice major * In Indiana, although it does have ""India"" in it, not sure how it will be like over there * Heard that some of the programs are actually pretty hard and the student output rate is much lower than the input rate. * Most expensive college from these three (although the cost isn't really that bad at $45,000 annually) &amp;#x200B; I have gotten into other schools, like UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz (Mech E tho), Syracuse, Drexel, and Chapman, but these three are the ones I've narrowed down to.

Major: Computer Science. At Tufts, it's a department within the College of Engineering, but at Northeastern, they have their own college for CS, which also hosts a Cybersecurity and a Data Science major, both areas Id like to explore. From my experiences with the two universities programs, I got the sense that Tufts hasnt adapted with CSs rapid changes and is more theoretical while Northeastern represents where CS is headed and is more practically focused. Location + co-op + distinct CS college makes me feel like Northeastern has Tufts beat as a program. Thoughts? Job Prospects: NEU seems to have Tufts beat in this regard due to their concentration on co-op, but idk if Tufts prestige comes through here Cost: ~$50,000/year for Northeastern, full cost (~$75,000?) for Tufts...Im lucky enough that my parents can comfortably pay for either, though, so this isnt a massive factor Location: Im attracted to Northeastern being in Boston, but I do like the true campus vibe of Tufts. Only worry is that Tufts is kinda removed from the action being in Medford, while Northeastern is right there in the city, though they always advertise that its a short T ride away... Community: Tufts is purported to be welcoming, intellectually curious, and to have a very strong sense of community  Im not sure if Northeastern matches Tufts in this respect. My main worry is the relative strength of each program. I got a very good impression of NEUs CS program from their welcome day, and the Dean/Assoc. Dean at NEUs CS college left Tufts for NEU. Ideally, itd be perfect if I could have NEUs program (+ co-op) while being in Boston but with Tufts campus and community, but here we are. Let me know if Im mistaken on any of the above, leaning towards NEU atm but definitely not settled on anything. Thanks!"

Any help or advice in deciding is welcome! Duke vs UCSD Intended major: computer science Duke Pros: -Gorgeous campus. -Four season weather. -Prestige/reputation as a whole. -Lots of school spirit, especially during basketball season. -Gives me a chance to go away from home, and have independence. -Good social and extracurricular life. -Located in Research Triangle. -Smaller, more intimate computer science program. -Decent internship opportunities. -Private school. -Good food. -Well-maintained and high quality facilities and buildings. -Is incredibly easy to try different classes and switch majors if I realize that I dislike computer science. -Hard to pass up the opportunity to go to such a well-respected and prestigious school. Duke Cons: -Expensive. -Largish influence of Greek life on social scene (Im not planning to join a frat). -Could have decent numbers of elitist/snobbish people due to lots of wealthy kids going there. -Smaller CS program has less classes, and thus a lower variety of classes compared to UCSD. -Certain software industry areas such as game development or cybersecurity could be lacking classes due to smaller program, thus hurting my chances of entering those industries. -Long travel time (I live in California) makes it harder to visit family, also adds cost. -Difficult classes, which could leave me less time to work on my own projects (to build portfolio/resume) and extracurricular activities. UCSD Pros: -One of the best computer science programs in the nation. -Huge variety of classes in all sorts of different industries. -Im already accepted to computer science major, in school of engineering. -Reputation is growing to top tier level. -Better connections to gaming industry, cyber security, etc than Duke due to being larger program + location. -Large numbers of student clubs and organizations. -Tons of students so easy to find social niche. -Close to LA and Orange County tech companies, along with being far closer to Silicon Valley than Duke. -In state tuition cost. -Easy to visit family. -Great internship opportunities. UCSD Cons: -Dont get chance to live somewhere else for college. -Public school, lots of bureaucracy, they dont care about you as a person as much. -Mediocre food. -Has warm weather which is nice, but I would really like to experience four seasons. -Poor social life from what Ive heard. -Can lack school spirit, no good big sports teams to unify student body. -Facilities/buildings as a whole are not as nice as Dukes are (although computer science buildings are comparable). -Area (La Jolla) is nice, but not a college town. -Decent campus but not as nice as Dukes.

My mom went to San Diego State for nursing, her twin brother went to UCLA and Pepperdine for law, her mom went to Duke for nursing, my dad was a first generation Hispanic that went to Harvard for undergrad and UC Berkeley for grad in law, and his brother went to Columbia for computer science. I sound pathetic compared to them. I was always near the top when I was younger and my parents thought Id get into a top tier school and all but then my mental health decided to not cooperate and gave me anxiety and depression and bpd and stuff. I want to blame those issues for how I did but I know I cant. It just sucks knowing that I had the potential to do great but didnt. My family doesnt put me down about it but I can tell theyre not exactly pleased about it either. When my grades started going down and my depression started to peak. my dad told me to focus more on my studies, and I wish that I wouldve listened and ignored the other things. I also feel extra shit when I realized that I had so many advantages compared to other people due to being in an upper middle class area with good schools but didnt use it. Im going to a school thats pretty much the opposite of what I was hoping for; my school is small (3000 people, Im not on the main campus), focused on parties instead of a healthy balance between them and school, theres nothing to do at or around my campus besides go to parties, and while I know social media isnt an exact representation of how a school will be, literally no one will talk to me since Im not a partier, dont like drugs, and like Marvel. I legit joined a Snapchat group chat for my school where within a week of me joining they made a poll and voted me out and threatened me with harassment if I didnt leave due to the cap on Snapchat groups all because I told them that vaping and doing coke dont make you cool.

I'll split these into two sections: general tips that should be broadly applicable to STEM majors, and tips specific to CS majors **General Tips** 1. **Show up** - Coming into college, the biggest change from high school is the lack of structure. You go from following a rigid schedule for most of the day in HS to suddenly having classes scattered no teachers or parents to tell you what to do with the rest of your day. Often times, it can be tempting to skip class because you're tired, you're just not feeling it today, or whatever, especially since attendance is usually not recorded beyond general education classes. You might tell yourself, ""Oh the slides will be posted online, I'll take a look at them later"". Don't do this. It is significantly harder for you to self learn something from scratch than just showing up to class and paying attention. Even if you don't understand everything the professor is saying, you will at least have an idea of where to start from. Something that you might understand in 5 hours if you showed up to lecture will take you 10 hours to get if you have no idea where to even start. 2. **Keep up** - The key to being successful in college is keeping on top of your work, because unlike in high school, cramming just doesn't work in college. I know when I say this that some people will read this and think ""Well, maybe not for some people, but I'm different"". Trust me, even if you're a god of cramming, the only difference will be that cramming stops working sophomore/junior year instead of freshman year. The fact of the matter is, college classes get complex enough that if you aren't making sure you are understanding concepts as you go, you will not be able to catch up come exam time. Just as an example, the last exam I took was for a statistical machine learning class. One of the ten questions on the exam asked us to ""derive the dual formulation for an SVM"". The concise explanation of the derivation is 50 textbook pages long. Now imagine 9 more concepts like this on the exam, and maybe another 5 that don't show up but were covered in class. You will not able to learn all of this in a few days or maybe even a week. Additionally, you'll often be able to understand concepts much easier if you spread the learning out. If you try and cram an entire semester's worth of material into a few days worth of time, your brain will feel like mush after a few hours and things that would be normally easy for you to understand will feel incomprehensible to you. 3. **Utilize all available resources** - Often times, you will come out of lecture feeling like ""Wow wtf I understood none of that"". If you don't understand something, it's on you to utilize the resources you have access to and figure it out. Now, as you will probably hear many times, going to office hours can be very helpful in these situations. There are also a ton of online resources that can help. Both Stanford and MIT often have full lectures on Youtube that can help supplement your own professor's lectures and fill in the gaps so the speak. However, if you end up taking classes on very technical topics, you will often find that there is no easily understandable, easily digestible explanation available. Things like Khan Academy or patrickJMT might help in HS or intro college classes, but as you get deeper into your coursework, you will run into concepts that simply cannot be explained in a 15-30 minute video. Instead, you will have to read actual textbooks, the dense 750 page kind that takes several rereads per paragraphs to understand WTF is being said. Learning how to read this kind of dense, difficult to understand material is something you will likely have to do at some point, so it's good to start learning early. 4. **Treat college like a full time job** - I started doing this second semester junior year, and I honestly wish I had started way earlier. Now, what this entails is simply going to class in the morning at a reasonable time, say 9 AM or whenever your first class is. You will then stay on campus until at least 5 PM. Do not go back to your dorm, as I find that going back to your dorm usually means distractions and not getting work done. Instead, sit in the library and work on whatever assignments you have. If you don't have assignment, make sure that you fully understood what was covered in lecture that day. What I find is that helps you keep up with classes immensely, because you'll be tackling work as it is assigned instead of cramming last minute. In addition, it ensures that if you do have spare time, that time will be in the evening, when most of the partying and social events happen. If you instead fuck around between classes, not only will some of your friends probably be in class, but you'll have to do that work later in the day instead of going out. Finally, staying on campus in the library helps eliminate a ton of distractions and temptations, making your studying much more efficient. **CS Tips** 1. **Internships &gt; GPA** - While it is important not to neglect your GPA, keep in mind that your GPA is only valuable up to a point. In general, if your GPA is between 3.2-3.5, further boosting your GPA will have minimal impact on your future employment prospects. GPA measures your academic ability, which does not necessarily translate to a workplace setting. Instead, what employers look for is work experience in the form of internships. Internships give your resume a huge boost because they show employers what kind of value you can provide in a real world setting. CS internships often assign you a project, which gives you a real, tangible product that demonstrates you know what you're doing. In addition, internships also give you a glimpse at what the working world will be like, which can be invaluable when deciding what specific part of CS you want to go into. For example, my freshman and sophomore year, I was very interested in cybersecurity. However, after interning at Cisco as a security analyst, I realized that I really didn't like what an actual job in cybersecurity would be like, and ended up switching to machine learning, which suited me much better. If I didn't have that internship experience, I'd likely graduate and get a job in cybersecurity, only to be miserable after realizing what the field is actually like in the real world. The nice thing about CS internships is that they generally pay very well, with pay ranging from $20-25 at smaller companies to $45+ an hour at software giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or Amazon. 2. **Practice interviewing** - Unlike many fields, both CS internships and full-time jobs generally require technical interviews, sometimes called ""Whiteboarding"". These will generally consist of you being presented with a problem, such as ""Given a word, determine if it is a palindrome"". You will then be asked to write code on a whiteboard in the language of your choice to solve the problem while explaining your thought process to your interviewer. Now, as a freshman, you may not be asked these as generally you won't have taken any data structures and algorithms classes, which are essential to answer these types of questions. However, it's good to start practicing this skill early, as it's something you'll need throughout college and your future career, and it's not something that's generally taught in class. I'd start by reading through the book ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, which covers the fundamentals of technical interviews. Next, you can find all the practice interview questions you could possibly need at LeetCode.com. Finally, once you feel confident tackling LeetCode problems, you can try pramp.com, which connects you with other students so you can take turns giving each other mock interviewers. Unlike a real interview, Leetcode has have no time limit, no one that you need to explain your thought process to, and no pressure. Doing mock interviews will help get you used to answering question under pressure and explaining your thought process, which essential in real life. 3. **Be Persistent** - As a freshman, you will likely be rejected by the vast majority of companies that you apply to, as you will have minimal experience. It is important not to get discouraged and keep applying to as many companies as possible. While most students do not end up getting an internship freshman year, not only is the experience gained during the application process valuable for the next year, companies will often take note if you express interest in a company by applying. I got rejected from Cisco my freshman year, but after showing up to pretty much every campus event they were at and asking the engineers good questions, I ended up being able to skip several steps in the interview process when I applied again sophomore year. In addition, volume is important when it comes to internships applications. Since most companies will reject you as a freshman, applying to as many companies as you can will raise the chances that you find a company willing to take a chance on you. Many of my friends applied to 80-100 companies before being accepted, so don't get discouraged if it seems like everyone is rejecting you."

All help is appreciated. **Demographics**: Asian male (lol) , upper middle class family (tuition will be covered by fam). Ohio resident. **Courseload:** Taking a pretty hard courseload, taking the only AP available until junior year (recieved a 5), and am taking AP Bio, Calc AB, CompSci, Lang, and US History junior year. Schedule of similar difficulty senior year. **Stats:** ACT 34, no class rank, 3.7 UW/4.0W GPA (expect it to rise to about a 4.15W next year), SAT Math I: 730 **ECs:** Interned/shadowed for around 3 weeks at a Fortune 50 corporation this summer, doing coding and data viz. Going to be doing something similar next year for the whole summer. Data Science/Cybersecurity with a professor at a local university. Started this year and am planning on continuing through high school. Probably publishing this fall. I am taking on a position as the Data Manager/Analyst at a local nonprofit which helps raise awareness for IT careers and opportunities within the area for teenagers, including hosting a conference each year for 500+ students. I will be involved with this program year-round. If I do well enough I could be promoted to CIO. Tutoring Program: I organize a tutoring program between my high school and a local low income elementary school for 30-40 students and we have around 5 volunteers going to the school every other day during the school year. I have been participating in the program since freshman year and have led the program since sophomore year. Mock Trial : Been participating since Freshman. Worked my ass off doing nothing but timekeeping freshman year bc I joined late, managed to become an Attorney as a sophomore and am continuing to participate. I'm not amazing, but I enjoy it. Golf: Been playing for the school since 8th grade. I am decent, probably going to play varsity Senior year. I also volunteer at a local nonprofit teaching young kids golf basics. Lacrosse: Played freshman and sophomore year. Quitting bc I'm bad and don't have time. **Looking for:** I want to attend a college with a decently sized student body, definitely not less than 5000. Preferably not in a rural area, though a college town such as Urbana-Champaign is fine. Lastly, I'd prefer if the student body was more collaborative than competitive, because I'm not a fan of very cutthroat environments, and enjoy time outside of school."

I transferred from a regional school to a state school because one of my majors was not offered (Double major in Japanese and Comp Sci) and a lot of very important courses were lacking from my major like data structures, algorithims, object oriented programming classes, etc. I deferred my enrollment to work on getting instate tuition. I can afford to pay for OOS for a couple of years due to savings, however, after I decided to attend my school changed its policy, saying that they would no longer offer instate tuition to people who were classified as OOS at one point. I was told by administration that if I held property in my name, and made a certain income per year, that I would almost certainly get instate. I held a job and rented property here, and was working hard towards this, so it came as a surprise. But I am pretty resilient, and am not letting this get me down. These next two semesters are all about my growth and proving that I am an intelligent, passionate, and driven person. And hopefully I can convey my hard work to adcoms of the schools that I am looking to transfer to. I am taking 18 credit hours this semester, and if I keep up my grades, I should have a 3.76 cummulative college GPA (not counting dual enrollment courses from hs, that would destroy me) and a 4.0 at my instituion. I have a 30 ACT and will be retaking. I am also doing subject tests, as I did not have access to them in high school. My high school GPA was abysmal, 3.8 W and like 3.4 UW I believe? But I had the most rigorous course load available and took every AP except 1 that was offered at my school. The majority of my other classes were honors or dual enrollment. I had some serious health issues senior year and towards the beginning of college that impacted my grades, and I plan to talk about how my struggles with chronic pneumonia and a serious bout of mono impacted my ability to perform to the best of my ability, but struggling with my health has allowed me to develop an even stronger work ethic. I also lived in a broken home, and grew up with a lot of abuse inflicted on me by my aunt and grandparents on the other side of my family. This hurt me a lot during Hs because I was homeschooled my first 2 years, but I don't know if i should mention this in my app. My main EC's in high school were: Independent Biology research, school and regional science fair awards, Scholastic gold key in writing, Head editor for school lit journal, helped found the Gay straight alliance and became president, National Honor Society, lots of volunteering with Science Club, Two different part time jobs from Junior yr summer to graduation, Leadership team, taught myself japanese because it was not offered at school, caring for a disabled family member, and babysitting My EC's in college are: Reasearch in Artificial Intelligence, Internship at an AI company, Taught myself how to play an instrument and started taking lessons recently, Cybersecurity Club, Gay straight Alliance, selected for National President sponsored philanthropy program (My goal is to be working towards developing legislation to protect LGBT students) Japanese speakers club, will be studying abroad in Japan this summer, I had a full time job during my gap semester in retail that I may go back to, but I'm not sure if I should mention it My absolute dream schools and Northwestern and Stanford due to the quarter system, and the abundance of resources that will allow me to continue my research while taking classes in AI (which my school does not offer) I would like smaller class sizes and be able to work more closely with professors as well. I have a lot of reasons that I love these schools, and even though my chances are slim, I want to apply anyway. I also plan to apply to Vandy, Uchicago, USC, UNC, Wash U, NC State, Duke, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, Yale, maybe Upenn (I'm a little scared about having to apply to their engineering college for Comp Sci) maaaybe Harvard if I have time even though it's a crapshoot. Am I a complete idiot for wanting to apply to these schools? Be honest, is there ANY chance at all for me?

I was just looking for an opinion on all these schools. UMD and OSU are basically my top two, and my parents are pushing Rutgers due to it being instate. UMD I got into Honors for their ACES(Cybersecurity Program). I really love cyber security due to my activities in high school, and I think it's really great with the fact that I'll have a small community in a big school, I just don't know how I feel about the location, as it still feels a little too close to home. OSU is great, especially if I wanted to go more into the engineering aspect of things. If I went there I would consider switching my major over to Electrical/Computer Engineering and end up doing a minor in CS. I've heard that Columbus is an awesome city, and I would definitely want to join their motorcycle racing team if I went. Unlike UMD, I wouldn't have that small community and am a little concerned I could easily get overwhelmed in such a large school. I didn't apply for honors, though I could apply for their Women in Engineering LC. Rutgers is awful for me, it is exactly the opposite of everything that I want in a college. The campus is broken up(I hate thinking about taking a bus to each campus). Even when I visited the hall that houses CS, it just felt bad. However, it is significantly cheaper, and I did get into the Honors program which gets me a good dorm. But as for example I know UMD is good for CS, OSU is good for Engineering, but I can't really think of something Rutgers is ""good"" at. Does anyone have input in terms of how good the schools are, their environment, etc? At least between UMD and OSU, is either really significantly better than the other? Any input would be appreciated, thanks! "

I'm an engineering and science enthusiast, however I haven't been able to have time to participate in science fairs or competitions due to the fact that both my parents run a small business 6 days a week and usually work late, and have to stay at home where my brother and I can look out for each other and stay safe (the small town we live in is pretty dangerous and poor). My parents only have time to pick me up and drop me off at most 2 to 3 days a week after school for 2 hours on each day, and then not more because it gets repetitive and tires them out. However, when I'm at home, which is most of the time, and not at extracurriculars, I take the time to take additional online MOOCs in things I like (engineering, Japanese culture, cybersecurity), commit to teaching myself piano and drawing, and plan out stuff and skills to learn. I have a knack for learning, and so I tend to take the free time I have to really engage and learn when I'm not doing stuff in school. So far I've earned a certificate in electrical engineering and electronics from Tokyo Technical Institute on edX, and because of the stuff I learned from the course, I'm now collaborating and working on a research paper on magnetically levitating robots with my chess club sponsor who's also a science teacher. I never knew how fascinating magnetic levitation was, as well as the science behind bullet trains. I hope to finish and submit the paper for publication by May. With the lack of time for my parents to pick me up and drop me off for ECs, I've only been able to invest time in ECs that I really liked, especially art club and chess club, and leading two clubs. I've seen other students on here that have been involved in much much more, and earned many national awards, which daunts me. Is this a negative factor for me in admissions? Should I explain this in essays? I'd really like to go to perhaps NYU or MIT, as my dream is to work in robotics and improve human interaction between robots and people and kids someday. That, or become a security engineer. But I feel as though the fact that I've had to stay at home the majority of the time during high school really kills me in admissions."

So I've been accepted as an electrical engineering major for both TAMU and UMD. The major conflicts that I am having, however, are mostly sentimental vs financial. As a resident of Maryland, UMD is definitely the more financially sound decision. By having the full Pell grant, as well as other awards, the cost of UMD is essentially 11k a year, as opposed to TAMU's hefty, 40k a year (after factoring similar awards and grants). I have also been accepted into the ACES honors program at UMD. TAMU, on the other hand, holds a lot of sentimental value for me and my family. I was born in College Station and raised in Texas, so a part of me longs to return there. My late father was also an Electrical Engineer alumni of TAMU and talked greatly about the school while he was alive. The matter of cost isn't as pressing of an issue, as both my mother and uncle have offered to cover the expenses, but I'm still left a little guilty having to rely so much on them if I were to go. I am also concerned with how each college might impact my future as an electrical engineer. As far as I know, TAMU is ranked higher than UMD when it comes to undergraduate engineering and undergraduate electrical engineering. If I had applied as a CS major, maybe I wouldn't be so indecisive (lol). I also know that Texas, and Austin specifically, is a great place for startups. On the other hand, UMD is closely tied with the federal government and thus, is a great place to do research. Being accepted into the ACES Honor program also allows me to get a hand into the cybersecurity field. These options are great and all, but I'm personally indifferent when it comes to working in the public sector as a researcher or in the private sector as an engineer. I do know for certain that I will pursue a Masters degree, so maybe all this worry about undergrad is meaningless. Any help would be great, thanks A2C."

Moving up the rungs of the education ladder, I think computer science has really stood out among other majors as something I want to pursue in college. Slowly, I've tried to cultivate a list of activities that match my interest in this area. So far, I've really enjoyed getting involved with coding in my community. &gt; Though looking past the positives, what I've struggled with most of all is the lack of personnel in my community to help give me guidance through the admissions process. My family lives in a rural community, meaning I have to travel about 15 miles every day to the nearest high school (which happens to be ranked in the lowest quartile of our state). The opportunities there unfortunately aren't ideal for someone who's really trying to chase after top colleges. We've had multiple student deaths and shootings this year and our dropout rate is above 35%. &gt; My guidance counselors, while well-intentioned, are pretty stockpiled with other students (ratio 1:550) and aren't informed on admission into top universities. When taking my first SAT II, they revealed to me that they'd never heard of the exam before. &gt; As such, it's been a struggle to connect with people in my community with similar interests in attending a prestigious college. Everyone in my friend group (even though they are genuinely smart students) aren't interested in going further than our state flagship college (CU Boulder). &gt; I was hoping to pass it back to the redditors on chanceme to give me some advice about my list of extracurricular activities. I'm really in need of some guidance when it comes to identifying how to diversify my involvement and branch out in the future.. &gt; My ultimate aim to attain admission into a top CS + Business program by the likes of MET or Jerome Fischer; acknowledging the competitiveness of these programs, though, I'd still be content with more modest tier 2-3 options including Cornell, Northwestern, or Vanderbilt to name a few. **Subjective:** &gt; Demographics: - State: CO - Ethnicity: White - Income: ~ $150,000 (partial aid) - School Type: Poor uncompetitive suburban &gt;Activities: 1. VEX Robotics, Chief Executive Officer (Regional Awards) [9, 10] Competed in regional tournaments, winning consecutive first place titles as a team. I oversaw the leadership of our computer vision robot team and helped manage fundraising / grant applications / engineering notebook. Club membership is quite low (around 6 students) due to lack of interest in school community; I'm hoping to grow chapter membership and get a member started. 2. Technology Student Association, President (State Awards) [9, 10] This club mirrors a similar situation as with Robotics. We don't have many members, even in spite of efforts on behalf of both our advisor and club leaders to increase club's impact. We saved up enough money for our first state competition, where we placed in the top 3 in multiple individual/team computer science events. We've also done some periodic design challenges (catapults, breadboards, etc.) and community volunteering. 3. Future Business Leaders of America, Vice-President (Ntl. Awards) [10-] The FBLA chapter at my high school is taken more seriously by our student body. We have approximately 15 members in total, about 6 of which qualified for state. I placed first in my statewide event (keeping this secret for confidentiality reasons). I'll matriculate onto nationals in June! 4. [Redacted] Innovation Committee Chair Member [10-] My county holds committees where citizens can voice their input on municipal initiatives. One such group is the 'Technology' committee, where approximately 10 community members who's backgrounds vary partake in open-ended discussions about the future of technology and evaluate the fees ability of new plans. I am very grateful for giving the chance to serve in Junior year. 5. [Redacted] Tech Startup Software Development Intern [Summer 10] I'll be starting an internship with a software development company over the summer before my Junior year. My role will be as a web developer, working in HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery/C#/SQL/PHP/MVC in the early-stages of their product development. Company is very small, and to be 100% honest, I'm not sure if I totally support their mission statement. However, I'm hoping to ask my bosses (who are accomplished in their own rights) for LOR when the time comes. I think we've really connected with one another so far and have built up mutual respect. 6. Computer Engineering [State Flagship] Lab Research [Summer 10] This sounds like a seemingly better opportunity than it maybe is. The program costs money (seems like it should be the other way around) and only lasts one month. I will be working under a graduate student with professor supervision, nonetheless though, and there may be the opportunity to get our research published. 7. [Redacted] Startup Company Founder [Summer 10] I'm really looking forward to taking some time to develop a startup company over the summer. I have a very concrete vision for the product in my head, and I've identified some students around the country willing to help me build the technical infrastructure. Ideally, I'd like to use my experience with running the small company as a way to branch out my network of contacts and to potentially setup for a program such as LaunchX the summer after Junior year. 8. [Redacted] Cybersecurity Defense Center Intern [Planned Summer 11] This is highly variable to change, but in the coming months, I want to diversify my involvement in Cybersecurity specifically and work towards applying for an internship at a local defense center, which has been known in the past to mentor high school students. Opportunity for LOR here potentially 9. [Redacted] Web Development Volunteer [Planned 11-12] I've been talking with some local organizations about helping to further their volunteer cause by renovating their digital presence and branding material. I'm not sure which organization I want to go in this direction with, however. 10. [Redacted] Political Organization State Technology Chairman [Summer 10] There's a state political organization charted in Colorado. Still keeping the details redacted, I'm looking forward to my confirmed involvement as a state officer. My role more or less would be like a chairman of technology, overseeing our website and branding. Other: NHS President, Coding Projects, Looking to Publish Short Book, Some Science Fairs"

170,cybersecurity,ApplyingToCollege,"Question, I am split on this one.",8,7d1pjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7d1pjp/question_i_am_split_on_this_one/,2017-11-15 15:40:46,"So I recently got my ACT score back (34, yay!), but my GPA isn't great, but not terrible (3.46). This means that with my extracurriculars I can get into state schools I've toured and have considered. The two schools I am most considering are Auburn and Mississippi State, and I will list the reasons below that relate to the question. Auburn Pros: * Good overall education in where I want to major (CompSci) Cons: * Costs more than Miss. St. Mississippi State Pros: * I can go there virtually for free (I'm out of state, but my family has a long history with the university). * They are #3 in the nation in what I want to major in. Cons: * What if I don't want to major in Cybersecurity (what they are #3 in the nation at)? Keep in mind that money isn't too much of a problem for our family, but we prefer to save money rather than spend it (obviously). I obviously have my reach schools and backup schools (Miss St. is kinda a backup school, Auburn is a match school). This brings me at a crossroad. I can go to the #3 school in the nation in cybersecurity (Miss. St.) and possibly get a great education there, but if I discover if I don't want to major in cybersecurity, all of their other programs aren't too good, and I do not know if transferring will be an option after two years. Keep in mind I can go to Miss. St. for free. The other option is Auburn. I may eventually want to end up in cybersecurity, which will be a loss for me. But, if I decide that I do not like cybersecurity, I can get a better education at Auburn than at Miss. St. Also, I **have a chance** at getting an $18,000 scholarship if I bring my GPA up to a 3.5, but that is obviously not guaranteed. After fully typing this out, I think my goal will to try to get into Auburn and go there for two years, and decide whether I want to go into cyber security or not. If I don't, I can just stay for another two years. If I do, I can transfer to Miss. St. and get a better cyber security education there. Is my reasoning logical or illogical, and what would you do if you were in my situation?"

Or is it too weak? To me, the real hero of the James Bond movies isnt James Bond - its Q, the genius hacker who engineers Bonds gadgets, cracks his codes, and makes all of his missions possible. When I was fourteen, I watched a real-life Q demonstrate ethical hacking at a presentation hosted by my summer camp. The smiling, charismatic man invited a girl in the front to create a password on his laptop. He then tapped a few keys, launched a projector screen, and announced that he would crack the password in less than three minutes. I didnt believe him, but then I watched, breathless, as the phrase wheat_thins crawled across the screen, letter by letter. I was awestruck. I later decided to find out more about hacking by applying to the Cyber Technologies Academy, an after-school cybersecurity training program offered by Sandia National Laboratories. Arriving to my first class, I felt insecure about my abilities because I had little experience with cybersecurity. However, as soon as the class started, my insecurity dissolved into a pool of bubbly excitement. Through challenging lessons, I was learning how to hack. My favorite exercise was called Infiltrate the Death Star. When I launched the exercise, my screen went black, and bright green text popped up every five seconds to remind me that the Death Star was secure, meaning that the firewall was still up. I rapidly typed phrases like sudo ifconfig and netcat 1148, commands Id learned only a few days earlier, to navigate through the computer networks like Luke Skywalker zooming through space. Typing the commands felt like speaking a new language - confusing, off-balance, but electric with excitement. When I finally won the game, I didnt stop grinning for hours. One of the instructors noticed my enthusiasm, and asked me to apply for an internship at the Academy for the summer. Several weeks later, I found myself standing in front of the room as a teaching assistant for the same class that had triggered such anxiety when I first took the course. I helped guide the new students through the exercises, and I often got the chance to lecture when the instructor was busy. Ive always been an impatient learner, but presenting new and complex material such as the architecture of web servers to teenagers required me to slow down and consider how best to teach a class of diverse thinkers. I was also hired as a developer, writing new code to help make the course accessible to people outside of Sandia, such as local high school students and teachers. My work contributed to the U.S. governments interest in expanding cybersecurity education to strengthen the technical workforce and bolster national security. Cybersecurity is a fascinating intersection of two of my passions: computer science and political science. It is powerfully relevant to every aspect of society today, from the military to the medical sector. To explore such a complex topic, I look to Carnegie Mellons School of Computer Science. The requirements to earn a B.S. in Computer Science include a required minor or double major in a second subject, meaning that I will have the chance to investigate cybersecurity outside of its purely technical characteristics. At Carnegie Mellon, I will have a multitude of opportunities to participate in world-changing cybersecurity research, even as a freshman, at places such as the CyLab Mobility Research Center. I am also intrigued by the fact that Carnegie Mellons core Computer Science curriculum includes an in-depth study of topics such as cultural analysis and economic, political, and social institutions. I believe that looking at critical issues in technology with an open mind and a mature grasp of the humanities is extremely important to being a computer scientist. For example, I could not imagine exploring the future of cybersecurity without considering the political ripple effects of Edward Snowden, the moral ramifications of the quantum encryption revolution, and the relationship between technology and income inequality. Curious and excited to engage in a multifaceted study of computer science, I am confident that I will find a home at Carnegie Mellon."

Prompt A: What was the environment in which you were raised? Describe your family, home, neighborhood, or community, and explain how it has shaped you as a person. Potential Topics: Jamming with street musicians while traveling abroad in Asia (Music community) I live in Austin, so I could write about being a musician in ""the live music capital of the world,"" and how hard it is to survive as a musician in a rapidly gentrifying environment, as well as personal steps I have personally taken to help Austin's musician community. Competitive Eating: This one might be kinda weak for a main essay, but its unique and I wrote a supplement about it for Michigan. Prompt B: Most students have an identity, an interest, or a talent that defines them in an essential way. Tell us about yourself. Potential Topics: Improvising - whether on a musical instrument or stock trading or while the timer approaches zero in a programming competition. Hacking/Cybersecurity - long story short, I am an accomplished hacker and have turned this talent into a force of good by heightening security measures on two specific computer systems. Construction - most of my non-tutoring volunteering hours have been through construction i.e. renovating parking lots, making shelves and uniform racks in my school's band hall, etc. Construction in this essay also could involve other passions/future professions of mine including cooking and music composition. Languages: I am semi-fluent in two languages (Latin and Gujarati, other than English) and am actively learning two more (Japanese and Hindi) and am slowly picking up two more (Spanish and French). I am fluent in programming in Java, HTML, CSS, and the command line; and I am learning SQL, Python, and Javascript at the moment. I don't know how well I can tie this next part in, but I can play clarinets, saxophones, western and eastern flutes, didgeridoo, harmonica, piano/keyboards, and mallet percussion proficiently. I can also play (at about a late-middle school level) trumpet, oboe, bassoon, rhythmic percussion, drumset, mellophone, baritone, and tuba. I play and compose jazz, classical, ethnic, popular, and electronic music on these instruments. Prompt C: Youve got a ticket in your hand  Where will you go? What will you do? What will happen when you get there? Potential Topics: Some creative-writing-esque psychedelic phantasm NOLA to play jazz clarinet with Louis Armstrong at the birth of jazz. Studying Spiritual Improvisation with John Coltrane toward the end of his career. "
