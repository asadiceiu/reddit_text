A huge dose of poison rocks every system of our bodies. The body and mind need time to heal. Be gentle with yourself right now. Reliving your mistake won't undo it. We're human. Humans mess up. I know how much resolve comes along with that. I'm never doing this again. That's it. No more. Pouring this out. Gonna read Annie Grace. Alcohol causes permanent changes to the brain. It makes the brain believe Alcohol is necessary to survive. Fighting your own will to survive is not a winning battle. Staying away is a daily fight. Writing this is my fight for today. Helping someone else. I know it sucks being defeated by a beverage. But that's the reality. We're here. And our struggle will become our prized possession for all the wisdom we gain along the way.

I was really okay with being alone for the most part when I could go to concerts and other social events often, but now its starting to drive me crazy. Im so tired of this. And I know its the new normal or at least will be in the states for the next year or so, and I dont know if I can adjust. I really had no desire to drink or smoke pot when my life was full of events and new experiences and culture and activities. Now its more tempting than it was in early sobriety. Plus Im legal drinking age now so if I really wanted to I could go buy booze or go to a bar and get wasted for the first time *legally*. Intimacy and vulnerability is so hard for me so making new friends is really hard. I know I push away everyone who wants to be my friend, I have for years now. Sorry this isnt very coherent or cohesive Im just rambling about self pity at this point. I miss the world pre covid when I was really vibing with sobriety and reaping the benefits, being able to drive whenever I wanted, afford to go on trips, go to events not make an ass out of myself etc etc."
3,vulnerability,stopdrinking,What I've learned this year reducing my alcohol consumption,19,hx7epx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hx7epx/what_ive_learned_this_year_reducing_my_alcohol/,2020-07-25 04:41:11,"I posted a few months ago about having trouble accepting never drinking again, and got some wonderful feedback. Since then, I've still greatly reduced my drinking, but haven't fully cut it out completely for more than two weeks. And I'm okay with that, because of all that I've learned: 1. Bourbon flares up my arthritis. Yes, the gluten-free, no-carb alcohol I used to rave about. During one of my last nights binge-drinking, I felt fine while drunk until I switched to bourbon, and immediately my joints started aching. I said to myself: ""I'm never doing this again,"" dumped the bourbon down the drain, and went to sleep. 2. I can't be a casual drinker. One day I'll have a beer, the next day 2, and by the weekend I'm binge drinking after my husband goes to bed. Also, you can \*still\* get a hangover from just two drinks. 3. After just a week of not drinking, I feel like me again. One night I was cooking dinner with my husband, listening to music back from high school, dancing with him and just laughing and goofing around, fully sober. I realized I hadn't seen my true self in almost three years. 4. I don't want to be a wine mom. When we have kids, I don't want to be the mom that pours herself half a bottle of wine in a huge glass to ""deal"" with motherhood. 5. I will not be able to meet my health goals if I drink. In college I lost a lot of weight, and while it was definitely due to diet and activity (I miss not having a desk job), a huge reason was because I wasn't drinking. I went to a Christian college without a drinking culture (weird, right?) despite it being one of the more liberal religious colleges. 6. It's not about ""being strict,"" it's about creating a life that just doesn't involve drinking. Thanks to you all for your support and vulnerability here! Joining this sub has changed my life."

I won't give you a long story but shame has been in my life for the longest time and has had such negative impact and even fueled some poor decisions. Brene Brown has an awesome documentary on Netflix called The call to courage. I highly recommend it. She highlights the difference/connection between vulnerability and shame. One of her key points about vulnerability: 1) It is not a weakness 2) Being open and sharing significantly helps (aka why this sub is so great!) Have a great weekend!

Havent told anybody until yesterday. It was to the person who found me during my last drink. Who I ignored for months because I didnt want to confront what Id done. Giving up drinking has taught me that you cant run away from your problems. Trust me, I tried by leaving the state haha. The past four months Ive been weighed down by the guilt and shame over that moment. I was worried shed never forgive me, or wouldnt look at me the same if I ever came back and apologized. Instead, she told me she had never changed her opinion of me. She always loved me and she always saw the best in me, even when I couldnt. Idk, I know not everything on this journey will go well. I know there are mistakes Ive made that might not be forgiven. But its solidified to me that vulnerability is a strength, and that its okay to place my trust in others. That Im on the right path, and when I need to tell other people that Im sober, Ill have the courage to do so. Just wanted to share, thanks."
8,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Principles Before Personalities.,1,hgj6ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hgj6ie/principles_before_personalities/,2020-06-27 10:05:03,"So Im struggling. The pandemic halted my usual routine and Ive been disconnected from AA for a while. I reconnected with my home group, but the current media on BLM protests and the division between people in regards to the pandemic has caused so many people to be more vocal about their bigotry and their inability to understand human rights. I dont think these topics necessarily need to be discussed in AA, especially not during a meeting, but they were, and not by my choosing. Ive been attending Secular AA because traditional AA in my area is very religious, I think more so from other areas from what I can gather. My home group started to get together at a members house, and I finally decided I needed to go. I held off mainly because I work in healthcare and didnt want to risk anyones health, but they continued to invite me. It was in this meeting just yesterday, during a group discussion the owner said, ""All these protesters and looters are just about the largest group of uneducated people who have ever gotten together in one place"". I suppose this was forgetting the fact that these protests and rallies are happening globally in many places, with millions of attendees spread across the world as they've been going on for weeks now. I then voiced, I've been going to these protests, are you calling me uneducated?"" To which he replied, ""Well, you also have these white liberals who just want to feel good about themselves."" The room went silent, no one had anything to say, and the subject was changed. I didn't speak for the rest of the meeting and went home without checking in with anyone. I went to this meeting rather vulnerable and made that vulnerability known prior to these statements, stating that Ive been wavering and thinking about drinking. I don't have thick skin at the moment. So I decided to start reaching out to people Ive known from other traditional meetings and see if anyone is meeting up online or elsewhere. I vented to a friend who attends other meetings and he was sympathetic, he invited me to his home group online meeting. Then, quickly, the conversation took a turn. He knows that I normally attend Secular AA and hes known I dont really buy into the higher power stuff. It was through messaging, and this was the exchange: AA: Are you still holding fast to the objection of some sort of unseen power in the universe? Me: Haha yeah. I mean, unless you mean gravity. But a divine omniscient being or power, yeah. AA: I dont think youre an alcoholic. I dont mean that in a hurtful way. Me: Why do you say that? AA: Ive been sold on the ideas and conceptions presented in the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Me: Okay? So you dont think someone can have the physical and emotional compulsion to drink alcohol and have self destructive behavior unless they agree with everything in a single book written from 1939? AA: Difference in being a hard drinker and a real alcoholic. Same with addicts. There are people who used to do heroin but smoke weed and drink now in safety, and then there are people who are real addicts. Just my experience. Me: I do take offense to what you said because my brain looks for excuses to drink. To tell an alcoholic that theyre not an alcoholic, especially during a time when their foundation is shaken, that could lead to relapse. Ive done enough research to know I cannot drink in safety. AA: Youre essentially agreeing with me, if youre able to quit drinking on your own without some help from some fantastical sky daddy. You aint got what I got. So basically I feel pretty hopeless right now, like I dont much belong anywhere. Im reaching out, trying to get a message of recovery from other alcoholics and Im getting insults about my politics and views on human rights issues, and Im told if I dont believe in god then Im not an alcoholic and can probably drink in safety. Looking for some support. Feeling extremely alone in this right now."

10,vulnerability,stopdrinking,90 check-ins in 90 days,3,hi69bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hi69bm/90_checkins_in_90_days/,2020-06-30 05:03:24,"I'm in a weird spot today. Actually I have been in a weird spot for close to a month. My cravings have started to get strong, I'm day dreaming about drinking, wishing I could be alone in this house so I can drink without being held accountable by anyone. I never did the AA thing, I've wanted to, but my anxiety has always gotten the best of me, even after a year of sobriety under my belt. I reached out to the one sober person I admire and look up to (although we've never met, and have only had small talk online, mostly about sobriety), and she sent me some Zoom meetings to check out. I'm going to try to work up the courage to try them this week. I also told myself the least I could do is check-in here for 90 days, starting today. It'll be my little version of 90 meetings in 90 days. Writing/journaling has always been a solid tool for me, and I've struggled with it over the last month, so maybe committing to coming here every day will help me get back on track to a better mental space. Writing a little or long post explaining where I'm at mentally, physically, spiritually, is also going to be a real test in my ability to allow people to see me be vulnerable. I struggle to even let the people who have known me for most my life see me be vulnerable. I think I can't even keep a therapist for the same reason. I haven't found anyone who I feel completely comfortable opening up to. And I think that's part of my fear around AA meetings, I watch all these people so bravely open up and share their vulnerability so gracefully (most of the time), and then I feel this pressure to open up in the same way, but allowing my true feelings to come out into the open has only caused an emotional reaction out of me. Like full on panic attack melt down in front of a room full of strangers. My hope is that posting here daily for 90 days, talking about the same things I would want to talk about in an actual in person meeting will help me learn how to get comfortable with expressing myself, and not just having the knee jerk reaction to melt down and just cry. I mean crying is helpful and healthy, but it doesn't feel like it should be my only way of expressing what I'm feeling. And I think that learning how to express what I'm experiencing is an important next step in maintaining my sobriety. If drinking is a knee jerk reaction to numbing some deeper trauma that I've experienced, then eventually I'm going to need to confront this trauma so I can release it to the best of my ability. Otherwise I'm going to just keep ending up back in this heavy mental state with a desire to numb what I'm feeling with alcohol. Honestly I'm surprised I've made it a full year without realizing this sooner. So, where am I at today, day one? I haven't drank, but I did go on a little bit of a weed binge this weekend. You know, just replaced one numbing substance (alcohol) with another (weed). I think I'm currently in the depths of a weed hangover. A part of me just wants to get back in bed, and keep the stony state of mind going, but I don't think it's going to help me get out of my current depressed state, it's most likely just going to make it worse. I do have a stack of work to get done. I can either put it off for one more day, or just get it done today. I still haven't decided what I'm going to do. The longer I sit here, the more mentally and physically exhausted I feel. Maybe I need a day to just be. Problem is I'm a perfectionist that gets anxious and down on myself when I stay still for too long, and the flip side of that is that I also don't know how to tell when I actually do need a break, and how to not beat myself up for allowing that break. Anywho, I think I'm going to end on that note. I feel a bit lighter getting that all out. I think I'm going to do some chores around the house. The pup is pawing my leg right now, I think he's asking me to join him for hangs in the backyard, so I'll take him up on that offer :) I'll try to be gentle and kind to myself while I move through this slightly depressed weed hangover state of mind, and if I get the motivation to work later, then I will, but if I don't then I will rest for today and get my work stuff done tomorrow. I will not drink with you today, and I'll talk to you all tomorrow ;)"

Thanks for being here. This is tough so far and it's nice to have this subreddit for a simple distraction when I need it and the IRC just to chat a bit when I need it. Today is my Day 2. I live in Japan, maybe I set the thing wrong, whatever, today's my second full day of not drinking. It's been a tough day. Anyway, this is part feelings-dump and part question: how long do withdrawal symptoms last? I've got a couple of the usual ticks, but what bothers me most is that I'm just really sweaty. I noticed in the last week or so that I was disproportionately sweaty for the weather. I thought it was due to the weight I gained drinking and I'm sure that didn't help but I really just want to not be sweaty anymore. :( Is it weird that not being sweaty is a good motivator for me in this? Summers in Japan are *brutal* and I'm just realizing my drinking may be contributing to my heat exhaustion vulnerability. I got it four times last summer, once or twice despite my best efforts to stay hydrated, even, and it's uncomfortable both physically and mentally. Sorry for the ramble. Just tryna not ruin my futon. It was expensive."
12,vulnerability,stopdrinking,"I'd like to stop drinking as much, but, the worldwide pandemic that's sweeping the globe, and promising to usher in eternal night and all, is, really, concerning as someone who has had multiple lung surgeries, life-threatening pneumonia and has immunocompromised family members.",2,ge1igu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ge1igu/id_like_to_stop_drinking_as_much_but_the/,2020-05-06 02:58:15,"My psychiatrist has prescribed me anti-anxiety medication that I can take on-demand as spot-treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, which, ironically, is related to lung surgeries, and severe pneumonia, but, I'm still on the fence about it since I've heard that benzodiazepines can limit gross motor function, and I work out regularly. But, I'm also a software engineer, and, I need to be able to think creatively, otherwise, my career is bound to stagnate since creativity is how I solve problems within my research domain. Has anyone else found it difficult to limit, or abstain from alcohol as a direct result of the worldwide pandemic that's sweeping the globe, and promising to usher in eternal night, and whatnot? Often times, I wake up with lung pain, but, it's always anxiety-related, but, that triggers a trauma response - at that point in time, I can either wait an hour or two for the pain to subside or have a drink and use that as a form of spot-treatment so I can get on with my day. The medication that I was prescribed is ideal, but, I've always been hesitant to try benzodiazepines, or any other anti-psychotics due to the potential impact on my career - alcohol just seems, safe, until it's not, and, I really want to find something that works better. I'll be setting up a home gym within the next month, or two, since I can't work out anymore, and prior to the worldwide pandemic that's sweeping the globe, and promising to usher in eternal night, I had things under control - but, after that, is a different story. After reading articles that talk about how cases of severe pneumonia observed in COVID-19 patients only presented themselves when those cases were either severe or life-threatening, really hits home, especially as someone who has a familial vulnerability to these types of things - my entire family is in the same boat. Alcohol just seems to, help, and, while I've traditionally limited myself to 2-3 beers/day, it's moved into the 6-8 beers/day category, and while I can easily get down to 3-4, that's still, concerning to me, and I want to find healthier avenues that I can take advantage of, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). But, every time I experience lung pain, which, is every 2-3 days, I can't help but wonder if this is going to be my last week, and that's, a difficult thing to grapple with. On top of this, I've lost one of my closest friends in the last week because they thought that by going outside, I was effectively communicating that I would kill my elderly neighbours without remorse, and, as someone who's, vulnerable to COVID-19, and has direct family members who are vulnerable, that, really hits home. It really got to me because one of my brothers doesn't have a primary immune system, and my mother has a compromised adrenal system, which apparently makes any sort of viral infection potentially life-threatening. But, that's, an aside. I just, want to find a better way forward. But, at the same time, I need to figure out how to drown out the noise that's been created by the worldwide pandemic. What's, worked for you?"

I could have done 9pm and maybe 1am, but I called it early because I knew I wasn't going to make it to the end and/or I would have made myself sick or extremely fatigued and fucked up. I wanted to enjoy my weekend more than suffer that much. Im sharing this for two reasons. First, because I still feel some accomplishment because I have never run 4 times in a day, and hardly at midday in 80+ degrees. Second, I feel that this subreddit is like family. I get on a lot of subreddits but I only really post and interact on this one. I just want to acknowledge that I feel strong and I wouldn't be who I am today had I kept drinking. I am almost a 1000 days sober and I have definitely gone through changes. Maybe it's aging as well, but I have become more aware of my vulnerability through sobriety but it's a good thing.

Ill always see my cake day as the day I started to take a different approach to my sobriety. One that wasnt filled with mandated meetings, or relationship ultimatums. This worked for me. The anonymity, the availability, the fellowship, the raw emotion and vulnerability that I see everyday on this sub, did the trick. Ive been a weekly drinker since my 20s. It progressed into daily drinking in my 30s and 40s. 20 years it took me to find something that helped/worked. If youre on the fence, all I can tell you is just try it. One day. Try one day sober.

Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up. **What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning. **What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.

An emotion I wasnt even sure how to describeforget figuring out how to handle it. I cried...right theresomewhere between the tomatoes, the flower arrangements, and the lavender scented goat milk soap. Tears, rolling down my face. Not out loud. Just abundant tears. WTF? Whered that come from? What was that? It would take another decade to fully understand. The following, from Brene Browns debut TedTalk, The Power of Vulnerability provided the answer for what happened at the farmers market that day. You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other [] emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we also numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. - Brene Brown In that single moment, I had a vision of what my life could be like. A life in the country, a garden, simplicity, and nature, with like-minded friends and a community. My future. Those were *tears of joy, gratitude, and happiness*. The toothpaste was out of the proverbial tube and it wasnt going back in. I knew what my life **could** be like. I just had to put in the work. The dangerous cycle took 16 years and there was significantly more than a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin involved. Lessons had to be learned. Tools added to the tool kit.

I know this forum and the stories from others helped me so, so much when I was first starting out. This forum was, at times, my only support and the thing that got me through a day or a night or an hour or a minute. So, thank you to each and every one of you who was there for me - whether you know it or not. For all of you just starting out, I could write a book about all the ways sobriety has changed my life for the better. I've never regretted the choice, not for one second. And, at the time I quit, I had no idea all of the thousand brilliant ways that quitting would change my life for the better; I only knew it was a step in the right direction, the one thing I could do, to get me out of the dark hole I was in. And here I am, out of the darkness and in the sunlight and absolutely worth the struggle. I won't write a book, but I will share with you the one most important life changing thing that quitting did for me - it allowed me to reclaim my dignity. That first night, three years ago, of not drinking was a tremendous success for me. And the success I felt the next morning helped me to stand a little taller and to feel a little better about myself. And the next day, when I didn't drink either, felt like a massive victory. And I was a little bit proud of myself and I felt a little bit powerful. And each day that I stayed sober, I also grew a bit more confident and my self esteem grew and my dignity returned. And when you believe in yourself, and when you feel like you're worth something and your life is worth something, amazing things start to happen. One small thing can create huge change. You might not be able to see the end of the road, or how you'll get from where you are to where you want to be (you might not even know where you want to be!) but it doesn't matter. You can do one small thing, take one small step and see what happens. Thanks to everyone for your courage and vulnerability and generosity and kindness xooxox IWNDWYT"

I had the world at my fingertips as a younger man. Perfect ACT score, top 1% of my class, wittiest and most likely to succeed superlatives from my HS peers, got into a great college. Then I started drinking and smoking pot in college. And because I was taking care of all of my outside stuff, I didn't see it as a problem. Even as all my peers seemingly phased out that portion of their lives rather quickly. Kind of started to realize that all people are not created the same in terms of their propensity for chemical addiction. I always had an ""all or nothing"" personality, and didn't have the foresight to realize that could be applied to negative parts of my life as well. I fell into a deeply nihilistic depression when I graduated after not being able to get the job I thought ""I deserved"". I think it had a lot to do with not really ever having failed at much, so when that first big one came, the next years were kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy of self-sabotage. And then it was a rapid cyclical downward spiral of depression&gt;drink and smoke more to avoid that feeling&gt;more depressed&gt;drink and smoke into oblivion&gt;eventual detox and ""getting my shit together"", only to fall down the rabbit hole again at the slightest inconvenience in my life. I tried to start a tech company a couple years ago on the crest of ""recovery"" after getting a little bit of seed funding through a competition. For a couple years, I moderated my drinking and other habits to 1-2x a month and devoted everything to it. And after I put myself into a ton of debt because I couldn't let it go (and some things just don't work out), the all-or-nothing mentality started to only apply itself to the negative parts of my life. For the last 18 months, I went from somebody who ate almost no sugar and lifted weights religiously 6 days a week, to a sad, depressive shadow of my former self who ate about 5 meals a week and took in more calories from beer (6-8 microbrews a night) on a given day. And a lack of confidence in myself slowly morphed into a seething self-hatred where I thought I deserved every bad thing that happened to me. The 'most likely to succeed' turned 26 year-old minimum wage bartender loser. On the 6th of April I saw an anniversary post of an old gym pic from 2 years ago and it gave me a panic attack about how rapidly I'm deteriorating my body and mind. Basic Chad to Adrian Brody in The Machinist in 24 short months. And when the body and mind start to go, the spirit/soul follows. URL (maybe nsfw, boxers in one) That took only two years of treating my body like shit. 3 weeks ago after a legendary bender of drinking 15 IPAs a day and smoking a gram of oil a day for a week, and seeing that picture pop up, I decided to quit everything, and fucked it up a few days in because the physical withdrawal symptoms were too much. I tried to stop nicotine/weed/90-120 drinks a week cold turkey and was miserable. Sweats, chills, delirium tremens, vomiting, anxiety attacks, emotional breakdown at the drop of a hat, etc. But where typically I would have used that as a reason to slowly get back to where I was, the self-hatred was so high it superseded the misery of detox. Now a few weeks off smoking pot, tapered down to 4 beers a day for a week, then 2 for a few days, to no drinking for the last 5. I feel like shit still. And the depression and anxiety are really bad. But I kind of welcome the feeling now. Feels like I'm kind of paying a penance for my shitty decision-making, which I think is going to help me. Because I understand it is probably going to take quite a while for my brain to recover and to start producing it's own feel-good chemicals again. And that's probably an important part of the conditioning process for me, because I know I never want to feel this way again, ever. After many failures, I think I finally understand I am not one of those people who can slowly re-integrate a joint with the lads every now and then, or a couple brews at the pub, because it always inevitably spirals out of control for me--I have to be teetotal from now on if this is going to work. This community, and ones like it like r/leaves have helped a lot. IWNDWYT and hopefully, ever again, because I can't handle the freedom of occasionally imbibing. Thank you to everyone for your kind and supportive words to each other and your vulnerability in sharing your stories. It really makes you feel less alone."
20,vulnerability,stopdrinking,One year!!!,1,ga9ff3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ga9ff3/one_year/,2020-04-29 23:27:08,"Yesterday I celebrated one year sober. One year ago I made the choice to stop drinking and start addressing all the things Id been drowning. Looking back, I realize the decision to do that came from a deep place of self-love, which was weird to me at the time, because Id been so conditioned to beating myself up for so long. I beat myself up about not being able to have a baby and going through a brutal time with IVF and surgeries to do that. I drowned my feelings about past relationships and a marriage that looked great from the outside, but was fatally flawed in ways I didnt even know about yet. I hyper-analyzed everything Id failed at and created this internal narrative that I wasnt *anything* enough yet. Wasnt happy enough, successful enough, accessible enough, good enough, or worthy of anything that a voice inside me in rare moments of clarity kept shouting at me that I was. I stopped drinking and started to feel what I needed to. I examined some deep stuff Id been avoiding *forever* and finally began to release it. I exercised, gardened, cried, cooked, read, listened to a million podcasts, went to therapy, cried some more, and started to settle into this new life I was building. And something began to shift. I had really resigned myself to believing that I would never truly love myself, or be deserving of that love either. I played every negative thing people had ever said to me and Id said to myself on an endless loop, and I was just done with it. Quitting drinking made me start to see the truth of things, and let go of destructive narratives Id created. Here are some things Ive learned over the past year: - You are not your worst thoughts. - You know what to do more than you think you do. Stop over-analyzing and listen to your gut. Dont ignore the warning signs and the flare-ups you feel when youre doing something that feels off. - Your brain is a plastic organ. It can heal. - New patterns are uncomfortable because theyre unfamiliar. Keep working at it. - Vulnerability is tough but necessary. So is honesty. Find the people you can be both those things with. - Control is an illusion. Its a lack of trust. - Progress, not perfection. - Power comes from acceptance. - Everything begins with self-love. - It doesnt matter how things look on the outside. What matters is the truth that you sit with in stillness, and whether or not youre happy with what resonates. If youre not, you can change it. I promise you can. - Just do the next right thing. Today, I am the healthiest, happiest and most complete that Ive ever been. Im present and grateful for so much. Im kinder, softer, and more positive in general than I ever thought was possible. Quitting drinking is better than anything Ive ever done. And Im prouder of it too. Its amazing what starts to happen once you get out of your own way. All this said, no one can do it alone. I am forever grateful to the many, many people in my life who love me and root for me every single day, including this incredible community, the friendliest corner of the Internet. For anyone reading this and thinking I could never do that, believe me, you can. IWNDWYT"

(LONG),1,fhi1ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fhi1ky/rehab_check_out_check_in_long/,2020-03-13 02:27:00,"Soo about a month ago I shared here about my self admission into a rehab facility. Well, I did it! I went there in utter desperation after years of battling my alcoholism and addiction, and I found some incredibly empowering albeit uncomfortable truths about myself. I also had the unique opportunity to connect on a truly intimate level with men from many different walks of life sharing the same struggle. The level of vulnerability and the stripping away of the classic ""man rules"" men inherently cling to as defenses was painful but so freeing. I am now able to admit that I don't have to have all the answers, I CAN CRY, and that my story matters. Through my intensely high standards and self punitive beliefs I left myself no choice but to drink. Booze/drugs silenced my inner voice criticizing my every action...but what if I could change the inner voice's narrative? What if I'm good enough and smart enough? I'm not a big fan of idiotic blind faith, but through this process I have found that I am a naturally talented leader. Despite my own perception, I am actually quite accomplished and I have many things to be proud of. I am grateful to be willing to know and love myself. I also discovered that between my tumultuous childhood, teenage bullies, and military career I have a level of trauma my therapists only see in about 7-10% of program participants. Throw in my family's generational struggle with boozing and violence and my alcoholism and addictive tendencies are scientifically engrained in my fucking DNA. When I introduced drugs/alcohol to my nervous system as a confused 12 yr old boy, my nervous system was like ""Oh fuck yeah bud this works for us!!"". That was the starting point of a 20+ year cycle of alcohol/drug abuse, completely stunting my emotional development and sense of self. I could keep going on about so many other things. The need for community, as alcoholism is a disease of isolation. The benefits of mindful meditation and self love. How yoga has transformed my physical pain. How working through my depression and anxiety with my therapist has largely stopped my suicidal thoughts. I could go on forever about the bonds I made with men I FUCKING LOVE and the commitment I've made to myself to embrace who I am and love my story. I could go on forever about me me me...and I probably will haha...I will also say that if you're struggling, it's ok to take extreme measures. If you heard anything in this rehab rant that resonates reach out! Asking for help is so hard but there is so much relief in relinquishing control. Good luck yall!

I said that we could go for teas and hikes and gym hangs but no more bars. That the choice is for me and no one else. I was embarrassed, scared for our friendship, but she was supportive off the bat! And you know what, it's been three weeks and our friendship has taken a hit, but I'm 10000% happy with my choice. She's ditched on every gym hang and tea date since to hit the bar. Our friendship will survive, and if it doesn't then it's not meant to be - we are simply in different places in our lives. I'm happy I chose myself, and I feel nothing but RELIEF. Relief that I don't have to have one drink to be social and wonder if I can control myself. Relief that I don't have to feel pressure to be in places I don't want to be talking to people I don't want to talk to just to be social. Relief that my life has gone on and I can feel great and my depression has lifted. Few days later, my boyfriend came home drunk and asked me about the book I'm reading. I was embarrassed to say it was a book on how to stop drinking - his reaction was to ask if he could borrow it! He said one of the reasons he loves me is because I don't drink and take care of myself (lol - but he didn't know the old drunk me). Again, my embarrassment gave way to relief - not only is he proud of me but he wants to stop too! I even mentioned the book to another good friend of mine - her and her partner have been struggling and think alcohol is to blame, they're buying the book to start down the path of stopping! All these things I was so embarrassed about, the moment I mention them, they've turned not only into RELIEF but moments of vulnerability in which I've connected more to my partner and other friend. The 5 seconds of embarrassment is worth the lifetime of relief."
25,vulnerability,stopdrinking,One year today folks!,1,fqep56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fqep56/one_year_today_folks/,2020-03-28 17:14:21,"Hello! Im Jess, currently in Atlanta, Ga but sorta from Richmond, VA (military kid). I dont post much but try to upvote and read when I can on this feed for support. Today marks my one year no drinking, so as long as I can hold it together, Id like to share a nutshell of my story with yall, maybe in case this can help someone else, like your stories have helped me. Im Jess, 30 F, happily married to a good guy (since last Nov! but together for almost 8 years in July) coffee shop GM, ex-bartender, bourgeoning film photographer (@jesscretephoto on IG!) &amp; pup mom. I used to hate people who said that but, I do just love my dog that much. Where to begin, le sigh. I have strugged with generalized anxiety and depression (I think) since my early teen years. I was raised in a strict Catholic &amp; military family. My parents both came from abusive and alcoholic homes. My upbringing was fine but I later found, both co-dependent of my hurt anxious mother &amp; emotionally distant by my intense feelings of God/shame/guilt loop. If you know, you know. Its a silent thing, some pain. I didnt realize how long my feelings of not belonging, moving and having no constant-friends like others I knew had, etc. led to a lot of issues down the road. I was a pretty studious kid, top of my class in fact in HS and college- but, detached to myself and others, and as I became 18, quickly turning to alcohol for distraction. I had no no no warning or real idea how alcohol-focused college was going to be. When you arent in class, its a hunt for booze or drugs or pills for most kids, its crazy. And when you are in that vacuum, well, its all so new, you are more easily manipulated into a lifestyle more quickly than you (or your poor parents) ever imagined. I hated the taste of beer and soon found that at the good aka richer kids apartments parties there would be better cigarettes, and liquor or better liquor I could put in a solo cup and sip on, like all night sipping on liquor and no one saw that red flag, waving loudly, begging to be seen. I did many cry-for-attention things, but still held lots of shame and fear about sex and my body because of my upbringing. (To be clear, I basically was sure I would become pregnant and ruin my life in the 1% of time the BC doesnt work, and to be fair, I probably prevented that bc of my trauma but anyway..) I graduated with my BS and it was 2011 and we were coming out of that big recession. Shit was weird, Richmond was densely populated and poor. I followed a toxic guy to Atlanta and drank more to blackout more often due to being alone knowing no one and realizing I was with an abusive person who didnt love me. Gave up on my photography and video gigs after lost a job and he shamed me pretty badly for returning to restaurant industry. couldnt have known that this would just become an environment that encouraged my drinking and made the red flags continuously harder to see bc everyone was either an alcoholic or problem drinker.. basically fed liquor for free for 5-6 years with small stints or quitting and then hitting a rough patch and returning... then March 27 last year after a margarita hangover I said dude. When is enough? How much do you hate yourself? I quit. I got really into plant medicine, hobbies, spirituality, meditation, self-improvement books &amp; tools I could use to feel good that were healthy. Running! This has gone on a bit long but it has been rough. I felt like a hero in the first couple weeks.. then truly friends stopped reaching out and it got very lonely. I didnt really feel good at bars so I didnt see most of my friends who are in the industry.. and the few who stuck around, I now know are the only good ones! Whatever works for you, find tools and practices and some sort of support, even if you dont think you need it. On the hard days you will. IWNDWYT! Woo! One year yall. So Proud. Thank you for your vulnerability &amp; this platform. Love love."

Who else has found fertility tracking (or the natural family planning method) to be helpful in identifying patterns of cravings and drinking triggers? Ive been sober for 25 days in a row, but Ive been tracking my sober days versus alcohol days by writing down A or S in cells of my fertility chart daily for almost a year (I averaged less than 10 days of drinking per month overall, but now Im all clear!). Tho I didnt quit entirely right away, I was able to learn that I tend to drink WAY more the week of ovulation and the week right before my period. I wasnt a daily drinker alcoholic, but a scary binger in certain scenarios, triggers, and cyclical moments. Knowing that my cycle influences my cravings and vulnerability to go back on my sober promise to myself helps me be proactive on hard days. I highly recommend it!

A feat I never imagined undertaking. I went back to the same place this past Saturday and ran it again, twice, for a total of 21 miles. It was hard. The first loop wasn't too bad; I PR'd by 15 minutes and felt strong. I took time at the aid station to change into dry socks, grab some food, and stretch a bit before heading out to do my second and final loop. Within a mile, I realized this loop would be completely different. What had been solid ground previously had turned to mud as temperatures warmed into the 50s. I had wanted to do this race for a while. After my 10 mile trail run and my half marathon on January 1st, I decided I would do an ultra this Autumn. I had been building mileage and felt that a 21 mile trail run was manageable. I didn't have trail shoes but didn't think I'd need them; I didn't need them last time. I hadn't run over 13 miles. But what's a few more miles when you walk uphill to save energy? Since I slowed down so much to stay safe while jumping over creeks, walking over slippery tree branches and climbing uphill in the mud, I also had a lot of time to think. At one point, overlooking the fields down below, as my heart was beating so fast from exertion and I was drained with 5 miles to go, it hit me. I wouldn't be doing this if I wasn't sober. None of this. It hit me in that moment, with wet socks, muddy shoes, sore calves and legs, that this was exactly where I was meant to be and that as I've dived more into running and healing, drinking has become less of a constant nagging thought to a rare thought. So many times during my second loop, I kept saying ""This is the hardest thing I've ever done"" But it wasn't. Maybe physically, in that moment. But getting sober was the hardest thing I've ever done. Facing myself sober was hard. Facing others sober was hard. Facing my trauma, emotions, vulnerability was hard. Facing my needs, wants, desires was hard. Facing life without my easy crutch was hard. Getting sober brought me to my knees, literally. I spent so much time on the floor, looking at the ceiling, sobbing as I faced what hurt inside of me and who I hurt because of my drinking. I spent so much time in therapy, sobbing. I spent time writing. Making amends. Making more amends. Learning a few more things to make amends for. Changing behavior. Checking in with myself. Saying no to things. Saying yes to things I didn't want to at the time. I read books. Listened to podcasts. Watched movies. Checked into chat. Checked in with friends. Checked in with myself. I still do these things. But I also run. And I know 100% I can only do these new hard things because I did and continue to do the hard work of being sober. Sobriety is not always easy at first. It wasn't for me. It was gut wrenching. Confusing. It pissed me off a lot. It left me raw so often. But all of that was necessary. I needed all of that to get to a place of complete surrender to a process of learning how to live this life without the crutch of alcohol. And these thoughts are what got me through the last 2 miles of 3 massive hills to climb with a body that hurt so much ""I'm doing this because I'm sober"" because once I was able to reach a place of knowing I can live and thrive sober, nothing feels that impossible anymore. And as a sober goddess says a lot ""You can do the hard things"" If you're just starting out or still trying to figure out what you're doing 1000 days in, I promise, you can do this. You 100% can do the hard things."

It was obvious that the one-off benders were problematic but the daily glass or 3 seemed harmless and even deserved. I was wrong. What I deserved was sobriety and the beauty that goes along with it. Today I celebrate 90 days free from booze. Here is what I'm actually celebrating: 90 mornings waking up early and refreshed. No drinking means my brain has a chance to do its housekeeping while I sleep. What a huge difference this makes! 90 sweet evenings with my family playing board games, watching movies and eating too much dessert. Discovering a love for tea and fancy nonalcoholic beverages. 90 days of energy for workouts and a stronger body because of it. I have not lost weight (thanks desserts) but I'm well positioned to slim down once I taper the newfound sweet-tooth. This is one of my goals for the next 90 days. 90 nights putting my kids to bed without stinking like sour booze. Kissing their heads and knowing that those moments are locked in my memory. Before I was healed, there were nights where I slurred their bedtime stories. It makes me sick to recall. I thought I was doing it all but I was still coming up short. 90 days for my brain to heal. This is a big one. I was oblivious to how much actual brain damage I had been doing. My brain is 90 days less inflamed and 90 days more equipped to process complicated information. I'm able to learn new things again and my lifelong depression is in remission. PAWS did strike at about the 40-60 day mark and it sucked but I survived by reminding myself that I used to always feel that way and that it would pass. I'm ready to battle through if PAWS returns again and know it will be worth the lifelong freedom on the other side. 90 Days of forgiving myself and sorting through the web of self-destructive thoughts that got me drinking in the first place. This is mental maintenance that must be done and I had put it off for over a decade. 90 days of vulnerability with my spouse. They were initially leary but ultimately supportive of this lifestyle change. I never asked them to change their drinking habits but they did anyway. I'm grateful for them in all seasons but especially this one. A sober Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year. Holy hell. This was, to my shock, one of the sweetest holiday seasons thanks to sobriety. I was able to face hard extended family matters head-on. I was able to be the strong one for my sibling and I am grateful. I know that sobriety is a fight that may never end. I may always have that ""just one drink"" thought pop into my head but thanks to this community I have a fighting chance. Heres to the next 90 days and a lifetime of alcohol-free joy. IWNDWYT"

But thats not the only issue, I dont like asking for help, and I dont like admitting to a problem because I like having the freedom to fail. I like that I can relapse with a friend and they never know I was trying to quit drinking to begin with. Telling people makes it harder to slip up because it throws some extra accountability into the mix. This detox has caused me to fall behind in class, and if theres one thing I fear more than vulnerability its failure, and if theres one thing I love more than sunbstances its art. I wasnt going to take a bad grade on a final project in an art class. So, I told my professor what has been going on. I needed to tell a ~real adult~ what was going on anyways, and he was somome i trusted. I didnt share a ton of deatails, I was just honest and to the point. I basically just said that I was detoxing, that it had effected my ability to work, and that my project wouldnt be 100% complete. The reply I got to the email lifted a very large weight off my shoulders. I got an extension, and was told my grade wouldnt be effected, and that removed some stress but the relief that that brought was nothing compared to the offer of support that came with it. Having someone say theyd support me, and having someone handle the situation with so much compassion just really made me feel a lot better. I feel like I can stay sober now, I feel like I have reason to stay sober. I got that email and had to go into the bathroom and cry a bit, if my roommate werent here I probbaly would have down right sobbed. Im going to try to be more honest with myself and others going forward, Im going to reach out to another person I trust tomorrow for information on AA and such. Im going to do this right this time."
32,vulnerability,stopdrinking,The vulnerability of fellowship,1,ewua48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ewua48/the_vulnerability_of_fellowship/,2020-02-01 07:20:38,"I made it over a year once, while engaged with AA. I had the beginnings of fellowship. I also had a lot of critical thoughts about AA, and confusion, and doubt, and the main reason I was doing it was because drinking had become **A PROBLEM** So I wanted to stop drinking, and get on with life. I saw recovery as a stepping stone, I wanted to get it done and move on. And after things got better, I did move on. Moved, stopped going to meetings, felt things were under control. But a couple more years down the line, I'm just isolated. I have my little family, but no one else to talk with. To share with. And sure enough, as shit got tough, I started picking up again, leading me to a new bottom, one I'd feared in the past. I've known I need connection, fellowship, but I've resisted doing the work. It makes me feel so vulnerable. I feel like a burden. I might be rejected. I have shit to do, I don't have the time. But this bottom ... man, I give up. I reached out to some of the old numbers I still had. People picked up. They picked *me* up. I feel like a burden, but they picked me up. One guy explicitly told me: ""allow yourself to be held by the people in the room. Allow yourself to be loved."" I feel so vulnerable. But I did. I went to a lunchtime meeting, sat up front, took in a lot of good stuff. I'm glad I'm in a big city where there are some meetings that feel so good &amp; welcoming, without too much god stuff. And I literally allowed myself to be held. An older man hugged me and let me cry on his shoulder. And I think, this time, instead of wanting to recover &amp; move on, my new intention is towards healing &amp; fellowship. Instead of picking up, for a while I need to just let myself be picked up. Carried. Remolded a little. So that I can feel a part, instead of apart, and maybe help pick up others as well."

We just bought a house, and I finally feel stable. But I still drink a 6 pack every night, occasionally more. My health is starting to suffer as I approach 30, and Im terrified that Ill die young and leave my husband all alone. Its expensive in just about every way possible. I want to quit. I set a deadline for myself several weeks ago  I needed time to get my head in the right space and put to rest some stressful situations so I didnt just set myself up for failure  and tonight Ill have my last beers. Ive quit before, and I know that I can do it again. Id be lying if I said I wasnt scared and incredibly vulnerable. (Ive long used alcohol to avoid vulnerability with others.)

This has been a wonderful month. Hard as nails, but wonderful. And after more attempts to quit than I can count, for the first time I feel ready to treat this not as temporary abstinence, but a direction for the rest of my life. I wrote out some thoughts that I can revisit in times of vulnerability.  Because I want my health more than I want to drink. I want my career more than I want to drink. I want *my life* more than I want to drink. I want to wake up in the morning feeling sharp and clear-minded instead of hazy, hungover, and in pain for the first half of the day. I want to wake up knowing I didnt make stupid decisions, embarrass myself, or worse. I want to avoid fighting and drama and unnecessary pain inflicted on my loved ones. I want to make my family proud. I want to make *myself* proud! I want to remember my life. Because I know, deep down, that the best version of myself doesnt use. Doesnt self-sabotage. Doesnt willingly drink poison. Doesnt settle for living numb. Doesnt drink his life down the drain. Its not easy, but it certainly is simple. I will not drink with you today. Thank you, SD."

36,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Bit of an update/brain-dump since my last post here (when I felt like my work was going to cave the world in around me).,1,eeys8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eeys8n/bit_of_an_updatebraindump_since_my_last_post_here/,2019-12-24 19:47:35,"Wanted to come back and say I appreciate the encouragement and suggestions from my last post (and every other time Ive posted here), and to give a bit of an update, for what its worth. Since my last post here (I was really struggling with the incredible stress thats come with my new position, and honestly feeling unreasonably trapped), Ive started getting a better handle on my responsibilities at work so that I am able to clearly show value-added again, and that always feels nice. Im fortunate in that I typically catch onto the more technical challenges of my job pretty quickly (always having to relearn what I used to know as everywhere I go in my career uses a different software system to run everything.. rrrhhhrr..); and I am usually able to build my depth, breadth, and creativity in employing those technical functions *very* quickly once Ive grasped the baseline. I was worrying myself sick that Im just not going to get this for my first couple months in this new position, even foolishly wondering if Id lost my edge with sobriety. In the past 2-3 weeks, however, that recalibrate and rebuild process has finally begun to take off again- adding measurable value to my work-center and attracting positive attention in my direction. Maybe its a bit vain or childish of me, but the truth is that knowing I am creating a net-positive effect on my divisions work (and that I am being recognized for it) does a lot for my mental wellbeing. Ive also been working hard at managing reasonable expectations for myself and trying to maintain a more realistic and less emotionally affected outlook on the circumstances. Its a rock solid navy cliche that it is what it is; and while I am almost always compelled to try my damndest at making the things I work with better, a healthy dose of it is what it is does me well on occasion. Vocally expressing more of what Im going through has been an obstacle for me for a long time. I know Im not alone in that. It comes up quite a lot when we discuss all the resonance we drank. Id imagine that more people than not would rather just keep that (personal) stuff to themselves than volunteer that sort of emotional vulnerability- especially at work. And Id imagine that oftentimes, people are perfectly justified in that. For me though, finally starting to force myself out of that comfort zone and into vocalizing what Im going through to the people around me at work (the people Im usually affecting when I am going through something) has helped my tremendously. Its not only a huge relief to let someone else know when I am overwhelmed or at my stress-limit- Ive also realized that more people actually do care than I wanted to believe- and are willing to make considerations to lighten the load when need be. It was my own fear of being invalidated (toughen up. get over it.) that drew up those inaccurate assumptions that Id be pissing into the wind if I didnt trudge on trying to bury everything like a robot. I stepped out of that comfort zone and was proven entirely wrong. Its been a happy surprise and an incredible relief. The simple explanation for what I was/am going through is that Ive been put into the most challenging, high-stress, high-responsibility role I have ever been in (really gives me perspective on how nice Ive *actually* had it times previous when Ive felt overwhelmed at work...) while I am still in my infancy of learning how to live life sober. I just needed/need some time to pass and to hold to account that Im still standing, getting better at rolling with the punches/building coping skills, and tempering the mental toughness and resiliency required for me to hold this position. This may be a cake walk for some people out there, but its been one helluva challenge to me so far.. Building my resiliency here will obviously serve me well with my work- but I am also trying open my perspective to the fact that this also affords me an opportunity to grow as a whole person. Like my dad (and plenty other strong people) always used to say, If youre going through hell, keep on going. That said, I have begun opening up more to the idea of a civilian life more than I ever had before (I honestly never considered it a viable option). Barring early death, I will 100% need something to fall back on/transition into when my navy career inevitably comes to an end (whether that is 3 or 20 years from now); so Im realizing that getting to work on that exit-strategy can only benefit me. Ive at least dog-eared it for now. However it all plays out, one thing Im certain of is that when I *DO* leave the navy for another job or what-have-you, I want it to rest on a rational, sober choice made on good terms with a clear mind- NOT the result of an inability or unwillingness to come to grips with emotional sobriety."

38,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Thoughts from a substance use therapist.,9,ejr03q,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ejr03q/thoughts_from_a_substance_use_therapist/,2020-01-04 14:34:49,"This is paper I wrote for fun from my experience as a counselor. Addicts experience something breathtaking when they can stretch their vision of themselves from the immediate present back to the past that shaped them and forward to a future thats attainable and satisfying  Marc Lewis How do you convince someone that their ability to make decisions is compromised as a result of something in their brain that is influencing the determination of their decisions before they even make them? This phenomenon becomes more prevalent on a daily basis when working with those who are suffering with substance use disorders. The predicament arises in the fact that because individuals are conscious, they believe they are in complete control over the decisions that they make. These decisions that are made, to the individual, are grounded in reason and rational thinking that is aimed with their best interest in mind. Unfortunately, these decisions have the capacity for self-destruction because due to the troubled history that each person has encountered. Memory has an integral role in decisions. Memory utilizes the past to understand the present to anticipate the future. If an individuals past has had trauma and many forms of distress, their memory is going to ensure that their decisions are protective in nature. This means that decisions will be geared towards the avoidance of pain, avoidance of discomfort, the avoidance of stress, and ultimately, the avoidance of change. This is troubling because when exploring healthy life changes with someone, a therapist will encourage that individual to identify changes that can be made that will hopefully improve that persons quality of life. That is where the challenge arises. Ideally, someone can gain insight and harness motivation to change to make positive life adjustments. The thing is, this does not always work out because something stops that individual from drawing power from their insight and turning it into behaviors that are conducive to a new way of life. This leads to frustration, shame, guilt, and eventually depression as someone who has all of the desire to make changes, just cannot put it together to make a difference. One begins to learn that the unconscious mind often has a completely different agenda than the individual. One learns that there is comfort in the chaos because it is familiar, even to the point where the chaos leads to complete isolation, socially, physically, and emotionally. When looking at the benefits of using substances/alcohol, it cannot be ignored that the effects of the high, produce such a powerful feeling of safety and security. The high is a safe experience and no matter how much pain an individual encounters, the high is there to shield them from the full impact of the situation. It is impossible to isolate addiction to one singular event in time, however, different forms of trauma are the one trait that all of my clients have experienced. I have learned that addiction always begins with pain and always ends with pain. The high feels like that surge of warmth and protection that comes from the embrace of a loved one or the love that was missing for an individual who never had the opportunity to experience it. It is no surprise that opioids are the endorphins that are released in the human body when a mother is holding and begins to soothe her distressed infant. Unfortunately, the high turns on the user and the individual becomes even more trapped in walls of isolation that are reinforced by bricks of shame, fear, and despair, but this is still a state of being that is desired because life on lifes terms is too overwhelming and unbearable. The frustrating part of addiction is the desperation to get clean when using, but also the desperation to get high when clean. Where does someone turn when stuck in this persistent state of hopeless of always knowing where they want to be, but never being where they are? The effects of the environment on the individual are impactful. Fortunately, this is something that can be utilized to foster change. I have heard that the goal of psychotherapy should always be security. This is a challenge in itself because if someone has grown up in a toxic environment with abuse or neglect, the body is going to not allow the individual to feel secure and thus change is ultimately prevented. I have seen and explored this problem through my work and through my own experience. The answer has to be connection. Connection to a person, who provides unconditional positive regard, like Carl Rogers emphasized. This person can be the therapist or another person, who can provide the stability and unwavering support that conveys the message that I am here with you no matter what your emotions and feelings tell you. The therapist/person has to show the individual through their personality and support, that they can be the safety net the person needs. This happens through sending cues of safety that help the other person start to turn off that flight or fight response system or the withdrawal system. This is not an easy process, but through consistent support, it can be accomplished. If an environment caused an individual to make decisions that are protective to adapt to that environment, an environment can also be fostered to illustrate to that person that they dont always have to protect themselves and that there is so much power in vulnerability. Through trust and support, a person can learn how to tell his or her body calm down, were not in danger, and allow themselves to experience the freedoms that connection can offer. Through co-regulation (learning how to manage emotional states with someone else) with someone, a person can eventually learn self-regulation (self-soothe). They can learn that they can manage the pain that is inevitable in life. People will always experience pain in life, that is a reality. The growth starts when people lead that they dont have to face the pain alone. Through connections with other people, those suffering with substance use disorders can learn that they do not need use drugs to get their needs met because they can get those needs through other people, naturally. Change will always be hard, but through support change doesnt have to about suffering and can lead to new meaning."

I just feel like shit emotionally. There's no escape from those emotions now. I just have to kind of sit with them. It's awkward... like you're locked in a room with someone you've been avoiding. Engaging with the people around me and with the emotions inside me and with the art and literature in front of me requires a sort of vulnerability that alcohol allowed me to avoid. At two weeks, I think I'm probably at max physical benefit- I was drinking moderately heavy 3-4 nights a week, but it seems like it's physically out of my system already. My question is, when does managing life sober become easier? Do you just learn to manage your emotions in healthier ways when you stop drinking? Because this sucks right now."
40,vulnerability,stopdrinking,6 Years Sober at 25,1,duawtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/duawtn/6_years_sober_at_25/,2019-11-10 23:35:10,"So yesterday I celebrated six years of continuous sobriety. This is the strangest anniversary I've had so far, and I really want to talk a little bit about emotional sobriety for a minute and the ridiculous pressure that people in recovery sometimes put on themselves to ""act their age"". This may be the longest period of time that I've been away from a drink or a drug, but this past year has been the most challenging year I've experienced so far, and I have felt ""closer"" to a drink than I ever have in previous years. I am not sharing this for congratulations or for attention. I was not planning to acknowledge my anniversary publicly at all this year actually, because I always feel kind of weird about doing that, but as I was journaling yesterday, I somehow ended up writing a novel about it, so here we are. This is actually really embarrassing, and I acknowledge that I am completely blowing up my own spot on the internet to people that have not the first clue about my past, because I've been very careful to protect it, but I feel like this is also important. I'm attempting to be vulnerable right now, because Bren Brown says vulnerability is a good thing, and Bren Brown is Bae, but Im also terrified of judgment. I really hope this doesn't come off as preachy or egotistical, because that is not me at all. I'm putting myself on blast, because if there's anyone out there right now who feels the way I felt this year, hopefully something I say might be helpful to them. Hopefully they dont drink. This year has been very hard to say the least. I work full time during the day and have class four nights a week some days until 10 PM. I'm tired, overworked, overwhelmed, broke (my own fault), and pretty depressed most of the time. I'm too busy to adequately take care of myself most days. I'm really struggling to consistently eat well, sleep enough, get to the gym, and be of service in any capacity. I'm trying, but I just keep falling short. I started smoking again and really want to stop, but you know how that goes. Im also having a hard time being&amp;nbsp;present in my relationships. I might be there physically, but emotionally I am miles away. I wake up every day, and I feel trapped. Every time I come up for air, another random wave that I didn't see coming knocks me out and fills my lungs with metaphorical water. Some days I literally feel like I can't breathe. Like there is just this invisible weight coming down on my chest and crushing me, hour after hour, day after day. It's insufferable at times. There are brief moments of reprieve, but generally, its been rough. I promise I'll get to the bit about hope soon As the result of being too tired, too busy, or let's be honest, too unwilling to work on myself during this period, I've watched my general emotional state slowly decline, and to be frank, I've thought about drinking a lot in the last few months. If someone randomly brings up alcohol in conversation lately, I actually start to disassociate right in front of them. They are still talking to me about whatever, but my mind is somewhere else trying to remember what alcohol feels like when it first hits your stomach. I've felt extreme jealously toward coworkers of mine who go to happy hour after work or go home after a long day and drink a glass of wine on the couch or in the bath to unwind. Ive scrolled through Instagram stories of friends drinking, paused them, and felt myself get really uncomfortable as I started to imagine what their martinis taste like since I've never tried one. I felt jealousy toward my family members who were all drinking White Claw and enjoying our beach house weekend last month while I was drinking La Croix. I often sit and wonder what it might be like to sit around a dinner table with my friends, eating good food, and drinking good wine. I got sober when I was 19, and I never got to experience what that's like. I've never had one glass of ""good"" wine in my life. Franzia and Barefoot forever&lt;/3. And I never got to try a White Claw. GAH. I've been finding myself feeling like I'm missing out on something recently, and this makes me really sad and REALLY angry. All. The. Time. Especially because I know, and 100% understand, that this is insane thinking, that Im missing actual nothing, and that drinking will never improve my situation. Ive done enough drinking for one lifetime. I know and have fully accepted that I can not drink socially, but this is just the reality of what addiction and recovery looks like for me sometimes. This is a common occurrence for people who get sober young. Although sobriety has given me a life second to none, there are still times when I find myself feeling like I missed out on certain things. This feeling often manifests itself as grief. The best way to explain it to someone who may not understand is that I go through periods where I mourn the loss of drugs and alcohol. For the last week or so as my anniversary has gotten closer, I've been reflecting on the last year, and I've felt incredible shame and guilt about this. Although I've been physically sober for a while now, my brain, overwhelmed by these feelings of failure for missing the mark on self care and for experiencing this recurring obsession about alcohol again after so long, has told me that I don't deserve to celebrate this milestone. I know this shit sounds wild, because I am definitely physically sober, but in my brain, it's 100% real and very intense (if you know, you know). My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to do anything for my anniversary, and I basically shrugged and said no, because I just didn't want to make a thing about it this year. It all felt wrong. I've been talking about this to those who are close to me, and the more I share about it, the more I begin to realize that nothing about this experience is a failure. Ive gone through this before, but never to the extent that I am right now, and thats ok. It doesnt mean that Im doing it wrong, that Im doomed to relapse, or that theres something wrong with me. Its just part of the process right now. Things are challenging at the moment for sure, but things are also beautiful and transformative. I really dont know shit at the end of the day, but if theres one thing I do know, its that everything is temporary, and these feelings will pass. Some people might think, Well she lacks balance. If she doesnt take a step back from some of this shes bound to drink. I disagree. I believe, if left unacknowledged, yes I may eventually turn to alcohol, but as things are currently, I am aware of my pitfalls and am taking calculated actions to improve them. I am analyzing my habits and making small changes where I can. I am reaching out, speaking up, and keeping my sobriety a priority as best I can at the moment with as much as I have going on. In the beginning, my life was in shambles, and all I had was my sobriety and the wreckage of my past. Today, sobriety has given me a life that is so rich and full, I can't keep up sometimes, but that is not a bad thing. It's actually incredible. It will just take some minor adjustments here and there when things start to feel overwhelming. I truly believe that I will never be given more than I can handle. Nothing that I'm going through right now is bad, and not one single thing that I am doing at the moment would even be possible for the ""me"" of 6 years ago, so thats pretty cool. Everything I'm facing right now is a gift and is the direct result of a life I've worked so hard for. A life Ive been given a second chance to live. A life I legit almost lost. Almost 9 years ago I dropped out of high school, because my addiction took over my life, and I couldnt face failing. I moved to Florida to run away from the mess that I made back home. I was so ashamed and humiliated about who I was and everything Id done. 8 years ago, at age 18, the doctor told me my liver enzymes were too high from all of the alcohol, xanax, and tylenol in the pain killers I was taking. 7 years ago, I could not get through one day without putting a substance into my body. I couldn't even take a shower sometimes, because I was so sick. 7 years ago, I could barely hold a job. Not even working for my dad slinging ice cream. He seriously fired me. 7 years ago, I quit community college, because I was more concerned about getting high in the parking lot during class than actually going to class. 6 years ago, I had already been to 3 rehabs and 5 detoxes within a 3 year period. 6 years ago, after getting arrested, I told a CO in jail to go fuck themselves and lost my license for a year. 6 years ago, I was sent to the ER in an ambulance on 2 separate occasions in less than 90 days. 6 years ago, I almost lost my life in an alley in St. Pete next to a dumpster (Narcan saves lives for real). So, 6 years ago, I made a decision. I decided that drugs and alcohol would no longer be my master. No matter how hard life got, or how unbearable my feelings became, I made a decision not to to drink or use drugs no matter what, one day at a time, and I've made that decision for 2,190 days in a row now. Something that I've learned these last few years is that recovery is not linear, and anyone who tells you that or who makes you feel like sobriety is nothing but peace and serenity all the time is a fucking douchebag. If youre going through something difficult right now and feel like you're falling short, it does not mean that you're doing it wrong. Everything is always changing and shifting in my recovery. Emotional ups and downs are still normal for me, and I've had to learn how to become malleable and how to experience intense emotions without running away or letting them consume me they way they used to. Maybe your experience in sobriety is or will be different than mine, but my recovery so far has been littered with periods of really intense darkness followed by periods of pure happiness and peace. It's always worth it though, and I'm grateful every day. The only constant in my life is not drinking. Life did not suddenly become easy when I got sober like I thought it would. Maybe for a little while. My pink cloud probably lasted a year or two. Maybe even three. But with time Ive learned that the world and the people in it do not owe me anything. The world doesn't care that I'm sober. I still feel pain regularly. I still have bad days. I still randomly burst into tears in my car sometimes when a song comes on that brings up past trauma (shout out to Tom DeLonge), and I'm still afraid all the fucking time no matter how many fears I face along the way. What has changed is my ability to stand my ground and experience everything, good or bad, that life has to offer. I do not run. If youre a normal person, youre probably confused about why I would day dream about something as innocuous as drinking wine around a table with my friends when I just revealed that I overdosed on a curb next to an actual dumpster 6 years ago, because that is one WIDE gap of delusion, but addiction is a subtle foe. My addiction may sound like me and think like me, but it's something else entirely. It's like a virus that waits patiently for the perfect opportunity to strike. It will plant an unrealistic image in my head when I'm tired, weak, and vulnerable, and like a virus, it disguises itself as part of me so that I'll let it slip past my defenses undetected. The idea will take root and grow and meander through all of the dark corners of my mind like a vine, latching onto my insecurities and fears and refusing to let go. It tells me, ""it will be different this time"". It tries to convince me that I was just a dumb kid with a lot of trauma and no coping skills, but now I'm a grown ass adult, I've been to therapy, and I deserve a ""glass"" of wine after a hard day dammit. I was ashamed to admit that I had been feeling this way to my friends, because well, I shouldn't still be having these thoughts with 6 years of sobriety."" Whatever the fuck that means. Before getting sober I always had this misconception that someone with a year or more of sobriety had it all figured out. If you're also sober you know what I mean. Most of us feel this way in the beginning. I thought they were spiritual giants, and I put them up on pedestals. I honestly thought they were better than me. I truly hope nobody ever feels that way about me. I literally have no idea what I'm doing half the time, but I still show up. The longer Ive been sober, the less sober time actually matters in the grand scheme. There is no golden year or amount of time that we reach and the growth just stops. The journey doesn't just end, and I'm grateful for that. The journey is what I signed up for. In the day is where life happens for me, and more and more, thats where I try to stay. Even though Im sober, I can still be a piece of shit sometimes. I'm still mean for no reason. I experience rage, envy, and hatred. I'm SO selfish, impatient, impulsive, and I can't make good financial decisions AT ALL. I am still sometimes painfully awkward in social situations. I still have to make amends when Im wrong, which happens to be a lot, and I am constantly beating myself up for not meeting my own unreasonable standards and expectations. But I am also kind, generous, hardworking, loving, ambitious, adventurous, passionate, thoughtful, and honest. I own my shit today, and I take responsibility for my actions. Sobriety has given me the ability to take an honest appraisal of myself and to love myself for not just my great qualities, but also for all of my faults and flaws as well. With each year that passes, I learn more about what it truly means to love yourself and to love others. Sobriety has given me the opportunity to know myself- to know who I am at my core and not shy away or crawl out of my skin when things are hard to look at. Sobriety has given me every single good thing that I have in my life today. It has given me the ability to see others and to let them see me, to love unconditionally (in a healthy, independent way), and to experience the other side of true hopelessness. But most of all, sobriety has given me a choice. I never had that before, and I refuse to give that up for the delusion of drinking one glass of wine on the couch while watching Ghost Adventures on a Thursday night, because #1, that's dumb, and #2, the reality of that delusion is as follows: Me, two bottles of gas station wine deep, wandering around in the dark screaming at ghosts to come fight me. So, today Ive made the choice not to drink once again, and I hope that with faith and the proper guidance, I will continue to make that choice every day going forward for the rest of my days. And if youre newly sober or wanting to get sober, please dont let anything Ive said deter you. Ive only made one good choice in my life and that was getting sober. Every other good choice that followed was just the result. What Im going through right now is not typical for me. I do not always think about drinking alcohol. For the first five years, I barely thought about it at all. This is just a season in my sobriety, and like any season, it will pass. So, I am leaving a lot of space for myself to grow into the woman I am meant to be at the end of this. If any of my sober peeps feel this way right now, especially my young friends, its okay if your time in sobriety is not an accurate measure of what you feel your character or your life should reflect at this point. I know that we all ""know"" this to some extent, but a lot of us still feel shame when it happens to us, and we still try to hide it by putting on an act that everything is fine. ""Sober time"" seems to be what everyone is after, but time is not sobriety. Loving sober is a daily act of radical honesty and ownership, and in my opinion, that is the true measure of a person's character. It's okay to be honest when we feel like we've missed the mark. It's okay to be vulnerable about this. It's okay to let people see the truth about what recovery looks like sometimes. It's okay if youre not okay right now. We still deserve to celebrate. Grateful for today. Love y'all."

I didn't get into much detail about my addiction and trauma, but I'm glad I could be vulnerable in front of someone I love. I hate the term ""high functioning alcoholic"", but I'm really one of those people who drinks alone almost every single day and no one knows how severe my habit is. But I'm changing that. It's been a while since I've been able to be vulnerable like this. It's a little uncomfortable, but I think it's a step in the right direction. How did y'all tell your family about your addiction? If you're keeping it to yourself (like I have for a month) why aren't you telling them? IWNDWYT."

Learning to become my own bestfriend, through articles like this AND doing what is suggested. 12 Ways to Be Your Own Best Friend The longest relationship you will ever have in the history of your life is with yourself. Therefore, its up to you to labor over and cultivate the strength and depth of connection you have with yourself. Dont think it will be easy, however. As psychologists Mildred Newman and Bernard Berkowitz explain in their book How To Be Your Own Best Friend: When you decide to take care of yourself, to take charge of yourself, there is still a big job ahead. It takes thought and effort to shake free of bad habits. A part of you may well be quite indignant at the changes youre trying to make. That part of you that is quite comfortable in the old ways and has no desire to see things or do things differently can put up quite a fight. We cling to what is most comfortable to us, even if that means perpetuating our own self-destructive cycles of misery and pain. Be aware of this: you must possess courage, determination, will power and persistence in order to break old habits and firmly establish new ones. Even something so simple as admitting that youve made a mistake in the way youve treated yourself can be a large mountain to climb. As Newman and Berkowitz comment: Its an awful blow to the ego to feel youve made a mistake. Thats why people dont want to change. It would mean admitting they were wrong. So even though the following list may seem commonsense and straightforward, I assure you its not. If you do decide to adopt these recommendations you will unconsciously  and maybe even consciously  be at war with yourself. The key is to not fight or resist, but to accept. Its normal to feel a bit weird, or a bit unsettled or uncomfortable when establishing new thoughts, mindsets and behavioral patterns. 1. Praise yourself, rather than waiting for others to do it for you. As Newman and Berkowitz point out: when you do something you are proud of, dwell on it a little, praise yourself for it, relish the experience, take it in. 2. Realize that you are fundamentally worthy. Most of us equate failures in our lives with us personally being failures. We need to remember that if we outsource our self-worth and self-esteem, we will always wind up feeling like miserable failures. Why? Because the thoughts, opinions, beliefs and expectations that we use as yardsticks to measure our success and worth are outside of our control. They constantly fluctuate and change often causing us to feel like failures because we never cultivated an inner and innate sense of worthiness. 3. Laugh at yourself. Not in a mocking or self-derisive way, but as a friend would. Be good-natured towards yourself and find humor in the little strange things you say, think and do. When you stop taking yourself so seriously, you open yourself up to more inner harmony and wholeness. 4. Accept, rather than punish yourself. Does a good friend punish you with an onslaught of verbal criticism for hours? No. A true friend accepts both the good and bad in you without passing vicious judgment. They realize that no one is perfect, and everyone has some kind of monster, whether large or small, within them. Not only is acceptance the healthier option, but it also opens doorways that allow you to solve your problems, rather than wallowing in them. 5. Spend a lot of time discovering more about your character/personality. What are your deeper drives and motivations, what things do you like and dislike, what are your greatest strengths and weaknesses? Often times people look outside of themselves for the formation of their tastes, ideas, goals and pursuits because they havent spent enough time developing a strong sense of self. The more you understand yourself truly, the easier it will be to like and respect yourself for who you are, rather than who you think you are according to external people, trends and circumstances in your life. 6. Cultivate self-awareness. This is similar to the last point, but differs in that it doesnt necessarily involve becoming conscious of your personality, but rather your inner workings, e.g. your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, assumptions, motivations, etc. Paying attention to what goes on inside of you is the first step to discovering whyyou think, feel and behave the way you do, promoting self-understanding; an essential ingredient in any healthy friendship and relationship. And without being self-aware of who you are and what you do, you will never be able to develop a genuine bond with yourself. 7. Seek out Solitude. In order to develop a good level of awareness and understanding of yourself, you need time alone, away from the distractions and dramas of the world. Learning to value the restorative powers of Solitude is essential in developing a strong bond with yourself. If you cant stand being by yourself and enjoying your own company, you will quite simply never be able to be your own best friend. 8. Learn how to support and comfort yourself. A genuine best friend is supportive and comforting in times of need and distress, often knowing exactly what to say or what to do to make us feel better. When it comes to supporting ourselves, on the other hand, we often drown out our pain by indulging in food, sex, gambling and other addictions including self-pity and other self-destructive behaviors. Learning how to face our hurt, instead of escaping from it, is one of the most essential (and most difficult) ways of developing self-love. When we listen to our emotional needs, and open ourselves up to the vulnerability of experiencing shame, anger and grief, we can then take the appropriate steps to help assuage the hurt we feel in a healthy and productive way. 9. Learn how to have fun alone. When most of us think of enjoying ourselves, we usually equate it with other human contact. Going to the movies, playing sports games, attending interest groups, booking a table at the restaurant  its a sad truth that many of us have learned to enjoy life in the company of others, but notsolely in the company of ourselves. Try developing an enjoyable interest that you can pursue alone. Doing so will help to deepen your bond with yourself. 10. Do a random act of kindness for yourself each day. A nice warm bath, a relaxing hour in the sun, a delicious smoothie  there are many kind things we can treat ourselves to each day. We just need to take the time and put the effort into doing them. Doing so shows love and respect for yourself. 11. Listen to your body. A true best friend treats you kindly and motivates you to be the best person you can possibly be. The sad truth is: many of us treat our bodies terribly. We neglect them, ignore them, and consistently abuse them, creating a host of physical, emotional and psychological sicknesses. Listen to the needs of your body. If youre constantly tired, try to sleep more or research sleeping supplements. If youre fatigued, stop drinking that Red Bull and seek healthier stimulants. If youre overweight, start reassessing your diet and physical activity level. If you have chronic pain, look exhaustively into possible remedies. All too often we ignore the aches, pains and demands of our bodies, being caught up in the circus of worldly chaos each day instead. When we put the needs of our bodies above the other perceived needs in our lives, we show ourselves immense self-respect, as a best friend would. 12. Learn to focus on positive things about yourself, rather than negative. This sounds simple  well its not. Shifting your focus requires you to essentially reprogram your entire mind  especially if you have the tendency to berate, criticize and put-down yourself every day. You may be thinking nah, I dont treat myself that badly, yet most of the time you are actually unaware of the unconscious dialogue that constantly chatters away in your brain (referred to as self talk). In order to treat yourself more kindly by opening yourself to the good things about you, you need to develop a number of strategies. For instance, you could try taking time out of the day (e.g. whenever you wake up or go to sleep), to say nice things to yourself. Sounds cheesy, but its a proven way of boosting your self-worth and happiness. Effective self-talk examples could include: I forgive myself, I let go of my past, I treat my body well, I love being myself, etc. *** Becoming your own best friend takes a lot of persistence and effort, but when consistently striving to apply the above recommendations, your life will gradually become happier and more whole. The best thing about becoming your own best friend is that its a gift you will have for life, a gift that no one can ever take away from you."

45,vulnerability,stopdrinking,So I was digging up old things I had that helped me when I quit the first time. I wrote a metaphorical kind of story which details the struggle my thoughts go through while drinking. From start to finish. Its like a cycle. It is long so i apologize. This is what my brain shows me. Enjoy.,5,dlxpoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dlxpoz/so_i_was_digging_up_old_things_i_had_that_helped/,2019-10-23 22:09:43,"THE SISYPHUS EFFECT- A JOURNEY INTO THE MIND OF AN ALCOHOLIC The Mind Of Bliss - Like a child who experiences going to an ice cream shop on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The joy of satisfying that long awaited reward after a successful day of doing the daily activates. That first sip is like an instant relief. A euphoric sensation of freedom. A cut through the fabric of reality. At that moment in time there is nothing that can stop me. No thought or action can betray me. I am invincible. So we pour again. The Trail - The trail is long and the path is clear. The land is safe and pure. But I know that I need to make it to the end. There is something pulling me down this road. Like a black hole in space nothing can escape. But going down this trail I see to my left and right, entities, fragments of thoughts and sub-conscious ideas. But they are largely ignored for they all face the same direction in which I am heading. Side by side we travel and as I drink, I scarcely notice the trail shrinking to a single point. And all these forms of thought with it. The feeling of vulnerability breathing on my neck. So we pour again. The Wall - Reaching the end of the trail we look up and are amazed at the sight of a wall. A barrier of sorts. Taller than the eye can see, and beyond it a mystery. Curiosity gets the better of us so we venture closer. As we approach we feel a sense of evil unlike anything we have ever felt before. So we pour from the bottle of invincibility. A Ladder is seen out in the distance. Tall enough to breech this wall. We have to climb. We dont know why. As we climb we see the entities from our travels pass through the wall effortlessly. As if they were meant to be there. As they pass, they whisper to keep climbing. Something is drawing us to the top. But it is not in sight. So we pour again. The Great Fissure  Looking above we see a ledge. And on it is a great beast of unimaginable stature. In his hands he holds a large hammer. The sounds of the beast are horrifying yet there is a sense of unity between us. An understanding of sorts. I try not to look at it as we continue to climb. Looking up we start to see a faint end to our long climb. The feeling of the air is thin and cold. An uneasy feeling drapes over us like a suffocating blanket. As we reach the top we are finally standing on top of the wall. We see a sea of black. The smell is putrid and merciless. The sea is teeming with life unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. Disgusting creatures, some writhing in agony as if they have died One-thousand times over. Some just tread the water in their acceptance of defeat. Over the sea is the worst storm imaginable. Flashes of lightning reveal an endless typhoon. The thunder crashes louder than the largest bombs. The wind tosses waves around with ease. And finally as we drink, we spot something out of place. Across this vast body of dreadfulness there is a women. Completely unidentifiable in any way. But we know she is pure. As we turn our head towards this spirit of elegance we feel a sensation of warmth and calm amidst the chaos of the terrible sea. We take comfort in her presence. She draws nearer with every sip and as she does, we notice that she is not alone. Out of the darkness hat terrible beast with unimaginable stature walk with her, his Great hammer clutched in his hands. And an obedient scowl on his face. The Women raises her arms towards the sky, and the beast does the same, hammer in hand as if they were one. A feeling of panic overwhelms us. The women whispers a word. It can barely be heard. The word, Release. And in a single second the women throws her arms towards the sea in a violent manner. And simultaneously the beasts hammer crashes with a godly thud. The Wall starts to crack. The sea is emptying. So we pour again. The Great Flood  We are swept away through the lands we have just traveled. Going back further than where we have started. The sky is black. The storm following us wherever we go. An endless flood sweeping us in all directions, as if it has no plan on taking us anywhere at all. As we struggle to stay above the churning sea of chaos, we feel like something is trying to pull us down. The creatures that the wall once held back are now all around us. Flailing and grabbing at anything they can to get towards us. As they get closer we realize that the faces look very familiar. Almost identical but with deformities of all sorts. They all look like me. They are me. We try to swim away but its no use. The current too strong. The storm treating us like a ship without sails. We are tired. We want to give up. We let the creatures take us down into the depths. So we pour again. The Drowning - We are dragged deeper and deeper. But something is different. We are still alive. Suspended in nothingness. An empty place. An empty feeling. Around me are all the creatures that were once behind the wall. All of them with my face. The expressions on their faces offer a lifetime of stories. Without words I can understand all of them. They look broken and defeated. We are terrified. We try to ignore all that is around us. But their expressions are too powerful. We attempt to escape but that only angers the entities. All they want is to be heard, but it is much too painful. We struggle to make it back to the surface but there is no up or down here, only emptiness. With no escape in sight I close my eyes and drift off into my own nothingness. I am struck by a force that cannot be explained and my eyes open as my body shutters like an earthquake. We are alone again. Staring down a trail. The trail is long and the path is clear. The land is safe and pure. We start our journey down the trail. Like a child who experiences going to an ice cream shop on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The joy of satisfying that long awaited reward after a successful day of doing the daily activates. That first sip is like an instant relief. A euphoric sensation of freedom. A cut through the fabric of reality. At that moment in time there is nothing that can stop me. No thought or action can betray me. I am invincible. So we pour again."

None of us are conventional students (I think the youngest is 26, I'm 28) and throughout the quarter other people have shared personal information when it was relevant to o e of our small group talks. Now though I'm feeling a little insecure, and worried that they will think of me differently or that I've lost their respect somehow.

I am alive and I am free.,278,dq75h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dq75h9/today_is_day_2000_i_am_alive_and_i_am_free/,2019-11-02 04:08:35,"2000 days. About 5.5 years. If you told me when I got sober in May of 2014 that 5.5 years later I'd be working as a cheesemonger in a shop with 250 cheeses, about 50 different kinds of charcuterie, and boatloads of wine, I'd have laughed. Or been mortified. If you'd told me that I'd help people do wine and cheese pairings, or help at an event that was a beer and cheese tasting, or work in a place where I'm literally offered drinks every day, I'd have told you that was impossible. But life has changed. I spent 4.5 years teaching yoga full-time and then last year, my whole life got turned on its head. I woke up one day unable to walk. Then my joints swelled so bad I couldn't bend my elbows, knees, fingers, or back. After 2 months of tests, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I started on immunosuppressants and a biologic, but was crippled for a good four months before things calmed down. Or so I thought. I was tired all of the time and thought it was just the meds (essentially low-dose chemo), but then I started having trouble breathing when I laid down. I blacked out in the house a bunch of times one day and my partner took me to the ER. Turns out the inflammation from the RA damaged the conduction system of my heart and the electrical signal stopped making it from the top chamber to the bottom. So at 33 years old, I suddenly needed a pacemaker. Had I not gone to the hospital that day, I would have died in my sleep. I was despondent. I felt like my whole life had been taken away from me. I hadn't been able to work for almost a year, I'd lost the ability to strength train or practice yoga with any regularity, and I felt hopeless. And then I finally found a treatment for my RA that worked. With a fully functional heart and a body that could move, I decided there was no more time to waste. I have 11 years worth of battery life before I need a new pacemaker, and I was going to LIVE. I love talking about food with people and have made cheese and charcuterie for years. [So I got a job at the cheese shop](URL as a monger and fell in love with it almost immediately. Teaching people about something I find so fascinating refueled me. I got back to my regular yoga practice--less vigorous, but still present. With the help of two very dear people, I finally got back to strength training, [started mace swinging](URL and kettlebell training and now after 2 months, I'm hitting personal bests that I couldn't reach \*before\* I had RA. [On Tuesday, I did a 210# squat,](URL smooth and pain-free. But everything is temporary and there are no guarantees. I still have flares, and sometimes I still walk with a cane for a few days at a time. So I do my weight lifting seated and work presses, curls, extensions...etc. I pivot again and again and again. This disease has taught me to adapt more than anything else ever has. [I am grateful for every day my heart beats](URL and every day I can simply get out of bed and be on my feet for an 8 hour shift. And alcohol has no place in that life. There is nothing it can offer me that will improve my situation--all it would do is take my memory, my autonomy, my strength, and my freedom. And I am not willing to give any of that away. I will live every day. I will not be a hostage to this disease, no matter what it throws my way. And I'll be present and sober for every second. Thank you, SD. I'm fairly quiet on here, but I'm always reading, and I'm always grateful for the vulnerability and strength you are all so willing to offer.

Very encouraged by all of your posts and vulnerability. I am 16 days in without having a drink. For me, I was by no means a daily drinker. Would go a couple months without getting drunk, but every few months or so, I would totally over-do it and spin completely out of control. I have gone 30 days doing Whole30 in January, but this has been different. It's just me. I don't have a specific diet tied to it, and I am doing it solo. The occasional benders would deepen the depression I have been recently struggling with in life. I plucked Adderall from my life about 1.5 months ago. Booze has always just been comforting to me. Even when I go out and don't intend to get wasted, I have come to realize these past 16 days that it's a huge crutch for me. Never did I realize I was relying on it so much, never did I realize how much of a people pleaser I could be. The drunken benders lead to so so much darkness. Hook ups and STDS, anxiety the next morning, and then need to take Adderall to try to get through the day. A vicious cycle that I can't handle anymore. Although it's only been 16 days, I have had so many different realizations. My mind is finally starting to feel clear, I am feeling more confident and motivated with work, and my spiritual walk has improved greatly. I want this to be forever. Am I nervous still? Yes. I am going to try to check in daily to keep this thing going! I want to feel better and better every day."

So, sobernauts, what are you thankful for TODAY? &gt;[When we numb \[hard feelings\], we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness.--Brene Brown](URL That quote comes from [Browns famous TEDx talk on vulnerability](URL Its well worth your time if you havent seen it, or seen it recently. Below is a longer excerpt from the transcript that places that quote in more context: &gt;...you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin... You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. I find the connection of hard feelings and good feelings interesting. I was certainly numbing the hard and uncomfortable feelings when I was drinking. At the time, I would have told you that it wasnt affecting, and maybe even enhancing, the more enjoyable feelings. Im not sure that I was wrong, and the numbing was mostly moving from uncomfortable to a more comfortable and fun fuzz. I was certainly miserable, looking for purpose, seeking meaning. But vulnerable? Certainly not in the sense that Brown is talking about. I still struggle with that, even experiencing the fear, disappointment, joy, and gratitude. What about you? Does this quote, or other of Browns work, resonate or enhance your understanding? Bonus track: [Comfortably Numb](URL obviously."

I do drink a half bottle of wine to cope with social anxiety before seeing friends, even those Im quite close to, and I drink some more while Im with them. I drink up to a bottle of wine in the evenings because it elevates my mood from apathy to euphoria. It makes movies and television so GREAT! I drink before sex and dates, to allow myself a freedom of vulnerability and intimacy. That being said, I still lack true intimacy in relationships. Three times now, Ive begun seeing suddenly after drinking. It always comes to me in a matter of seconds, and I cry for hours. Perhaps the problems I push deep inside myself actually come out when I drink. The most recent time this happened, I planned a suicide. Do I have a problem? I dont know. Probably. What I do know is that I use alcohol to feel better, and I can never imagine giving up alcohol for good, and maybe thats an issue. So here I am. Ill start with a week. Maybe a month. Well see."

I learned about a part of me that I didn't know existed, and maybe have been avoiding dealing with for so long... Even in my sobriety. I'm still so ashamed of myself 4 weeks down the line that I have the hardest time staying sober. Since then, I have had 5 nights where I have had some drinks to calm my nerves. Tonight is included. I'm still fighting. I'm still seeking for the answers to how to deal with the parts of myself that I despise so deeply. This community is a integral part to me understanding my vulnerability in this battle, and I truly want to say a major thank you to everyone who has been so damn supportive, positive, and REAL with me in my personal journey in becoming a healthier, and honest human being.

Just the bar section of a restaurant. But some people sat down, then two more. The first two bought the other two shots to initiate a conversation. Its 11:00am. In the past Id have joined. But was just as happy about the fact that they were having shots as if I had one myself. After all, I had coffee. But I knew that they would be friendly and engaging in conversation and it struck me that I can hang out in this environment and still enjoy it. I, myself, dont have to drink, but I enjoy being around other people whos inhibitions are lower. Then I realized, THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I MISS ABOUT DRINKING!!! It dawned on me that Im pretty extroverted and have a high tolerance for social vulnerability but that not everyone else is, without booze. I had avoided hanging out in bars and my friends have been drinking less. But the friendly encounter with some strangers reminded me that I can still find that sense of connection, the one that comes from people who are being a bit more vulnerable around each other, in a bar without being drunk.

57,vulnerability,stopdrinking,24 Hours Sober  This Stumbling Journey,16,cpp1vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/cpp1vt/24_hours_sober_this_stumbling_journey/,2019-08-13 16:13:10," They say that issues with alcohol run in families, and thats true for me but probably not in the way you expect. See, my parents never drank when I was growing up. I have no recollection of my mom having a glass of wine with dinner or dad bringing home a six-pack or even sitting at a bar. I remember one family function when my uncle let me taste a beer in front of my parents  I thought it was disgusting and my mom and dad were happy to agree. That one sip of beer was the only bit of alcohol I consumed in the first sixteen years of my life. But before I was born, I believe that alcohol played a defining role in my very existence. I knew I looked a little different than my sister, who was younger than me by five years and who had been born about nine months after my parents were married. Sometimes teachers or people at church would look at me a little longer when my family was introduced. Its not that I was born with two heads, but in suburban Wisconsin, people in the nineties took note of pretty much anyone with a trace of color in their complexion (in the most polite way possible, dontcha know). So for a long time, I was aware that my dad wasnt exactly my dad the way other kids dads were. And one evening as my family was about to watch a movie, I distinctly remember, as I climbed onto the kitchen counter to get a bowl for popcorn, I turned to my mom and asked, If dad isnt my real dad, then who is? I assume that probably fucked up movie night. So for one thing, my mom and dad were more or less compelled to bring out the birds and bees routine maybe a few years earlier than they were aiming for. After that lovely primer (including vaguely-anatomical, hand-drawn visual aids), I learned that when my mommy came back from art school to live with grandma, she was surprised to find out she had returned with a bit more than an A.A. in Graphic Design. They named me Matthew, which meant Gift of God and was also the most popular baby name of 1987. It was between that and Shane, which coupled with my Scotch-Irish heritage would have really completed the whole born lush persona, so thankfully Matthew won out. As I grew older, in bits and pieces I uncovered a few more details about my origin. Apparently mommy didnt remember who she had met those years ago in college, the young man who would become my biological father. There was a party where she fell asleep and woke up on a couch and didnt remember how she had gotten there. When I was old enough to comprehend the idea of rape, she told me that she thought that someone had probably slipped something into her drink, since she had never partied at all high school and had never blacked out in college. This childhood knowledge of the act and ignorance of the actor painted the source of half my genetics, perhaps half of my self, as nothing but a monster. Growing up in a very religious family, I learned up to three times a week about the polarized duality of good and evil, heaven and hell, angels and demons. And as my hormones charged my slight rebellions in adolescence, I began to suspect that perhaps there was a trace of the devil in my own blood. In fact the second half of my life thus far was precisely delineated by my induction into binge culture. I remember reading in middle school about the spread of heavy drinking and hazing on college campuses nationwide and thinking why would anyone ever have so much to drink that they blacked out? Fast forward through a few years of stellar grades, one half-ride scholarship and deeply-repressed emotional trauma from the antagonistic relationship with my stepfather, and I find myself on the business end of a handle of Smirnoff triple-distilled vodka, playing Halo 1 on PC and really having a ball letting my motor skills go to shit. What will fourteen ounces of 80 proof spirits in the span of two hours do to a first time drinker who weighs roughly 130lbs? First youre playing video games and laughing with your nerdy pals. Then a glimpse of vomit running down the wall of your dorm room. Cold water from the shower head, soaking through your clothes as you cry and apologize. A quick ride in the backseat of a squad car but no flashing lights  this is business as usual. A nurse who raises her eyebrows and scoffs at my roommates claim that it was my first time drinking. The taste of charcoal and a number: 0.29. That number (my blood alcohol content upon admittance to the ER) was high enough to be considered an act of self-harm by the university I was attending. I didnt tell them who provided the booze, because I aint never been no snitch, but they placed me on some type of collegiate probation anyways. I remember having to go to one session of counseling with some person who was likely a grad student. I have always been more eager to please authority figures than I have been willing to show vulnerability, so Im sure the paradigms and strategies I presented for avoiding risk-seeking behavior in the future were well polished and convincing. My mom and stepfather (henceforth known as dad) and twelve-year-old sister didnt have to see me in the hospital room because I was released once my BAC dropped enough. They met me at a McDonalds across the street from my dorm. My dad appeared concerned and relatively inexpressive. My mom tearfully asked me why I had done this. My little sister looked at her best buddy and hero with some mixture of sadness and puzzlement. They bought me a filet o fish, walked me back to my dorm and hoped for the best as they packed back into the minivan. This was day one of a journey that I stumbled down, at times cloaked in the invincible armor of euphoria and hubris, at others weeping from the rawest vulnerability, and drifting into every blackout as a solipsistic wanderer, disconnected from my own ability to record new memories, unable to decode the intentions of loved ones, drawing from a deep well of instinct and trauma, and entering the dreamless void absolutely alone, as a man goes through the door of death  but unlike death, this darkness would take me more times than I could possibly count. Number 1 and 2 of my drinking days were far enough apart that I assumed I had gotten the binge bug out of my system. In fact I swore Id never drink again, but when its been a couple of months and youve been fine, maybe your friend from down the hall offers you a screwdriver because thats not really hard liquor anymore. And maybe you find a case of beer abandoned on the beach a week later. And then theres some jungle juice at the frat party that youre pretty scared to be at. Lo and behold: a habit. Alcohol has some pretty interesting metabolic pathways that Im not educated enough to comprehend, but the most relevant interaction its had for me is how it affects my mood. When Im sober, Im a pretty witty gentleman but after three drinks I have a quite charming manner, after six Im your best friend forever, after twelve Im either gonna fight you or fuck you and if not, fuck off. This seems fairly common and is in no way charming in reality. But the real inscrutable chemistry are those hangover mornings, especially as I age (and not like fine wine) those depleted, glazed-over conference calls where I have nothing to give and lately, the suicidal thoughts that buzz around like flies in my serotonin-starved brain, things Id never consider if not for stripping myself of all chemical support. Sometimes on waking, disoriented and dehydrated, Im blessed with an hour or two of mania where I feel intensely dramatic and oft wax poetic in the mirror like some deranged, diseased Thespian. And then on a weekend I fall asleep, or on a weekday I parlay that mania into a few hours of poor work. Of course if youre a true American, instead of letting yourself black out, you can always just find some good old-fashioned Cocaine. That way, youll remember being an asshole and the hangover will be ten times worse. Rough start to your day? Try some Adderall - look for it in the school supplies aisle. And the cycle compounds. If these Calls to Action sound somewhat convincing, know that I have the craft of a serpent: I am in marketing, where half-educated people with severe emotional inadequacy are employed to spread their anxieties throughout the public for immense profits. The little boy who wanted to protect his mommy and all women from evil monsters is now slightly brutish himself. As I became aware of the willful fallibility of memory and the ways nice guys treated girls when one or both of them had been drinking, I began to wonder if a Rohypnol-induced violent rape was really the starting point of my journey. This made me wonder a bit if that horrible beast I pictured in my youth was just a young man in 1986, finding out he was a bad drunk a few decades before the biological son hes never met would do the same. A few years ago my dad who raised me gave me a DNA test kit and I still havent spit into that cup. Im not ready to meet the shaded side of my family tree; Im afraid I might see a glimpse into a cursed future, but you never know. In the right timing, that could be part of my healing and recovery. I saw a post online the other day that defined a new word for me, it was hamartia. This word was employed by the Greeks in describing the tragic flaw in a character that leads to disastrous results. It comes from a root meaning to miss. I have written thousands of social media posts, hundreds of journal entries, dozens of essays, a few poems and a screenplay or two but never has the subject focused so unbearably closely on what I see as one of my greatest weaknesses. And despite my dry and religious upbringing, I know that drinking is not a sin for all. My fatal flaw is not indulging in true evil, but simply a miss. A mistake is a thing I can relate to. And there are stretches of days or weeks when I hit my target, my sober life where I feel like the hero of my own story again. But then the fear and alertness to my weakness softens, and I miss again. Last night I missed, not too horribly, but enough to strip away the veil of comfort from my mind and start me thinking about what my life will look like after another decade and a half of this stumbling journey. Im afraid of where Ill find myself, of what Ill think of myself, and if Ill even make it that long at all. Though Ive described blacking out as a solitary venture, waking up youre never alone. There are the friends who fill you in on your antics, and sometimes it isnt quite as horrifying as you fear. There are the lovers who saw you clearly at your worst, who are mentally packing up and leaving already. And theres your family, who will answer every pathetic morning-after text searching for sympathy, partly because they love you and its what they believe is right, and partly because they are afraid of what youll do without their support. So you stumble along this path thinking that you trip alone, but dragging those close to you along for the ride, like so many hostages to your habit. That twelve-year-old sister from earlier in the story grew up to be a strong, intelligent and balanced young woman and is one of my best friends in the world. My dad and I dont really speak too deeply about anything, and my mom dispenses advice and motivation regularly but cant tell me what to do. So it falls to my sister to pick me up, to eventually tell me that she cant counsel me until I seek professional help, to send me a link to a counseling service website, to venmo me the $50 to sign up for the consultation and then to find I never filled out the paperwork to complete the application. Well today I told her Im going to finish this. Im going to start therapy this week. I already teleconferenced with my potential therapist who is a super glowed up African American lady which for some reason makes me happy. Hopefully hourlong sessions twice a month will be helpful. In the last year I started working out like a maniac (thanks, yet-unknown mental disorder) so I realized that I do have the willpower to make lasting changes based on habit. And, according to a great pal of mine, if I treat my brain like my biceps, I can turn this journey around. I can hit my target, which is a good life where my family is proud I overcame this affliction, where Im capable and trustworthy enough to have my own family, where I find myself on some morning mountain truly free and clear.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!* **Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!** I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happensgood or badand invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](URL and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others. It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol! **This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](URL we're not ready to give up. **What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](URL or have followed the pledges from the beginning. **What this isnt:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

When the barrier to vulnerability is about safety, the question becomes: Are we willing to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen? A soft and open front is not being weak; its being brave, its being the wilderness."

I was falling behind in all of my college courses. I barely ate anything, other than lucky charms and microwave macaroni. I was pouring whiskey into my beers. I was depressed, lonely, and felt worthless after getting out of a long, toxic relationship. Today I woke up early on a Sunday to eat a bowl of steel cut oats before my yoga class, and just got back from a leg workout. I haven't had alcohol in over two months. I'm in a healthy, stable relationship, I have a job, and I'm teaching myself how to code. I feel like my brain is clear. Things aren't perfect, and I still get angry sometimes that others can drink and I cannot, that people will judge me, that there is a lack of knowledge about alcohol and addiction, but overall I am so glad I made this decision. It took me a while to get here, a lot of self reflection, a lot of vulnerability. I want to give myself credit for how far I've come. I am happy. IWNDWYT."

I'm thinking about getting a new sponsor after having a discussion with her today that ultimately made me uncomfortable. I was having a prank war with a couple of guys outside of a meeting the other day. She was joking around about us causing trouble and I said so and so started it. I found out today that she thought that I said so and so asked me out. She completely misheard me. She approached so and so after the meeting and told him how inappropriate he was and I'm way too young for him. He's trying to take advantage of my vulnerability and needs to stay away from me. I'm early in my sobriety so she told him the he could derail my sobriety and kill me. She brought it up today and I told her that she misheard and she feels terrible about it. Then she launched into another lecture about not dating in the first year and reminding me how terrible it was when she dated and got married in the first year. I have no intentions of dating anyone nor have I indicated any interest in doing so. Also, the fact that I hang out with a group of guys is a problem according to her. I should only spend time with the women of the group. The guys are the only ones there around my age and everyone else is at least 15 years older. I do talk to the women in my group and have plans with them. I also always participate in service and help out where I can. So and so person pulled me aside to discuss things with me. He said he had not had any intentions. Well... duh... But he did warn that some female sponsors will treat you like they are your daughter and get into business that isn't necessarily any of their own. The whole situation is weird and I feel like a boundary has been crossed somewhere. I wish she would have talked to me before approaching so and so. Also, I'm not trying to date nor have sex with any of the guys that I know. I made it clear to them that I'm off limits. The whole thing is just bugging me."

The reason is kind of complicated, but this was out of respect for me - however, since it hadn't been super direct, I couldn't be totally sure of the situation. A few days back, we happened to run into each other at a cafe. We chatted for a bit, then kind of both stopped talking for a moment, just like lost in each other's eyes. Right then, I became 100% sure the interest was mutual. It sounds cheesy, but I don't know any other way to describe it. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, it was INCREDIBLY terrifying, but also exciting. I'm 26 and can't remember having a moment like this since before alcohol became a daily/hourly habit.

Here's a short list detailing some of my exploits: * Getting caught in high school by the cops in a construction zone of my suburban neighborhood. We were celebrating our graduation by lighting a bonfire, drinking a big bottle of vodka, smoking lots of marijuana (then totally illegal in our state), and facing felony trespass charges that would have F'ed our college plans. Thankfully the cops took the teach 'em a lesson approach, and after subduing us a gunpoint (dark &amp; they just saw men running away from cops), they let us off with a warning that included all of us being cuffed and loaded into the cars crying before being cut loose. * Being so blackout drunk at my UCF dorm that I threw entire gallons of Sunny Delight (don't judge me lol) at the open doors of all our neighbor's dorms. It was such a sticky mess that my RA demanded I clean every drop of it up or be kicked out of the dorms and possibly school too. * Flipping my car in a blackout drive home from the club and waking up in the hospital 8 hours later only to have the nurse exclaim, ""Oh sweetie, good timing. The State Trooper just left after waiting most of the night for you to wake up."" * Only receiving an expired license ticket after being pulled over, heavily buzzed, with a decent amount of cocaine in my shirt pocket. * Passing out drunk on a bench behind the House of Blues after getting kicked out of your favorite band's final show, 3 songs into the set list, for puking so badly in the pit that the band stops the show and points to the door. I had to piece this one together because the Disney Cop who found me had seen my step-dad blowing up my phone trying to pick me up, and was ""kind "" enough to answer and fill my family in on my legendary night. You can imagine the shame I felt hearing about that one the next day. Actually was one of the first of many 30 day breaks I would take, to you know, moderate lol. * How about the countless fights, emotional nights out, jealous moments, etc with my now current wife. The fact that she somehow saw past this and marry me really does prove I'm the Teflon Man. In Feb 2017 my son was born and fortunately I was smart enough to do another 30 day fast. It really bonded us as a family and not a moment too soon because in June of that year I had a near fatal stroke at the age of 31. It was the result of an artery dissection in my neck, due to having my neck manipulated. Will never know if alcohol played any part in weakening my body to the point of vulnerability, but it surely didn't help. Now with a 4 month old at home, I had to relearn to talk, walk, work, live. The next 3 months off work as a restaurant manger were the best in my life despite the neurological and physical deficits. I lived every moment to get better, for me, and for my family. Didn't even think about drinking during this time. Even remember telling friends that when you feel stroked out and not like yourself, the last thing you desire is something making it even worse. But in true Teflon fashion, I regained all of my abilities and of course the right to drink. My mom tragically passed from the cancer she had been fighting last year. Did the obligatory thing and got smashed that night, and once again the night after the funeral on the following weekend. Surprisingly, I tackled everything else around this time with little help from the bottle. As the sadness began to fade into the distant past, life got better. My drinking was now more ""controlled"", just sitting on the porch with an IPA and great cigar watching YouTube and walking safely to bed, what's the big deal right. I truly loved and looked forward to my nightly, but not every night, routine after the kid went to sleep and of course I, the SuperDad, deserved it. But for once I couldn't seem to shake something I was feeling deep down. Despite my actual levels of intake being the most reasonable they had been in years, the problems began to stick to my scratched Teflon coating. Perhaps it was the ever present moderation anxiety, or the constant turmoil in my marriage as a result of my ever shortening fuse, but my wife and I got into a huge fight on the night of May 31st after spending a fortune on a sitter, drinks, movie tickets to see Aladdin (our love story kinda lol), and pizza we never picked up on the DUI worthy drive home. I woke up in the guest room still angry on June 1st and immediately went into recon mode. I surveyed my scattered memories and hatched an appropriate plan as an antidote. Except this time it didn't work, the shit was sticking, she was done...and I was crushed. It's been 32 days since that night, and we are in a much better place. I tried to drink yesterday, but it didn't work despite my wife even bringing home the White Claw herself because we we're going to do an ""alcohol experiment."" Don't know if it was the endless Recovery Elevator, The Bubble Hour, or That Sober Guy podcasts...or even the multiple books/audiobooks I binged this past month such as Alcohol Lied to Me and This Naked Mind...or even all of your stories on r/stopdrinking but something inside me fought back last night when she showed up with my enemy in hand, and encouraged me to have just one (because she is a normie and saw how good I've done lately and felt I deserved it and could handle it). I probably could have had had just 1, 2 max, to demonstrate the my iron will, show her (and me), that see I'm better now and all I needed was another 30 day detox like before to get my head straight. But something inside of me doesn't want to let go of how incredible I feel now. At the top of my game physically, great father, loving husband, but most of all finally being comfortable enough to shed my shiny nonstick exterior where for one that is dinged and dented but real.

If I hadn't, I never would have discovered just how hard and rewarding rigorous honesty is. You see, sobriety has opened me up to doscovering my ability to keep the smallest little secrets from other people, and myself. Little secrets that become the withholding of information. That withholding inevitably becomes blame I place on other people for not knowing they hurt me and shame I feel. Both for being angry at someone who doesn't know I am angry and for not giving myself permission to own my space in the world. Space I which am allowed to talk about the things that hurt me with the people I love and trust. The blame and the shame become the cancers that breed my addictive behavior. Now that I am sober, on a daily basis, I practice talking about my boundaries, I own up to my missteps and I make myself receptive to feedback from others. It's hard. It's so hard. Sometimes I feel that vile temptress sneaking back in. My brain telling me that it would feel better to cover my vulnerability under a cloud of dissolution and denial. In those moments when I feel weakness, some cosmic coincidence always seems to give me the opportunity to have an honest moment and the temptation is eradicated. It's in those moments I know that I am truly awake to myself and I cannot go back. Going back would be like taking the red pill and I don't want to forget. Because nothing. Not one thing in my life feels better than an unladen heart. And for that, I am so so grateful. I will not drink with you today"

You all rock! \- Mindfulness meditation, for teaching me that every breath, every moment and every challenging thought/feeling comes and goes. \- My psychologist, whom I **adore**. Their wit, humour and compassion have enabled me to pursue the person I always dreamed of becoming. \- Mark Manson and Bren Brown, for shining light on some of my most difficult struggles. \- Lastly, but certainly not least, my parents.

Created this account to help with substance abuse. I've had problems with alcohol for about 8 years and have (unfortunately) recently started taking amphetamines to help with writing. I know I need to stop the stims outright, especially because of the dangerous interaction, and maybe drinking too, or at the very least cut way down. Part of my rationalization is buying into this pernicious cultural picture of drinking as glamorous and sophisticated. What's so bad about a glass of wine while I write? Why can't I go to the caf with the twinkly lights, and enjoy a rum and coke while I edit? Everyone there is chic and interesting and I want to be like them. 1) Because this turns into spending an hour searching for promo codes for alcohol delivery sites, fiendishly calculating what the better deal is, and then ordering three bottles of bad wine straight to my door, which I then proceed to finish in one sitting 2) Because I will be unable to return to this neighborhood caf after getting sloppy and throwing myself at the barista/bartender in an attempt to get free drinks (scarily, this works) Addiction is not glamorous. I'm increasingly sloppy and lazy (see #1), overweight, my living conditions are revolting, I am BROKE (see #1, AND #2), I make a fool out of myself in front of people I respect and care about. Alcohol is not my muse, and does not unlock some hidden artistic genius inside me. It's destructive and has hindered my progress since the first day I started using. Thanks for listening. I've been following these subs for the past few weeks and you all sound lovely and supportive. I've gotten various forms of help before, but this format seems to encourage vulnerability in a way the real world isn't able.

She's 23 years sober and an inspiration.,107,bv9uyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/bv9uyj/who_doesnt_love_brene_brown_shes_23_years_sober/,2019-06-01 02:42:31,"Brene wrote this today about what being sober has meant to her. When I got sober, I thought giving up [alcohol] was saying goodbye to all the fun and all the sparkle, and it turned out to be just the opposite. Thats when the sparkle started for me. Mary Karr I celebrated 23 years sober this month  May 12 to be exact. About a year ago, I was talking to a dear friend who was newly sober, and our conversation shifted something in me. For the first time in my life, I realized that my sobriety isnt a limitation. Sobriety isnt even a have to  its a superpower. In fact, right after the Netflix special launched, someone asked me about the secret to my success, and the first thing that came to my mind was my sobriety. Of course Steve, Ellen, and Charlie are huge factors, but Im not sure Steve and I would have made it long enough to have Ellen and Charlie had I not been sober and trying to live an authentic, honest life rather than trying to outrun, outsmart, and numb vulnerability. If youve read my books, you know the story: One of the final projects in my masters program was to develop a family genogram (a tool used by behavioral health professionals to help clients visually map out their family histories and relationships). After an hour-long fact-finding conversation with my mom, I was speechless. In Rising Strong I write, I realized that much of what had been dressed up as hard living was really addiction and mental health issues. Yes, there were wonderful folkloric stories of struggle, triumph, and rebellion, but there was also story after story of trauma and loss. I remember at one point in our conversation saying, Jesus, Mom. This is scary. What the hell? Her reply was, I know. I lived a lot of it. I graduated two weeks after the call with my mom, and I stopped drinking and smoking and went to my first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting on May 12, 1996. One day after graduation. I wasnt sure if I was an alcoholic, but during my teens and twenties my partying ranged from shes fun and wild to self-destructive. And, I was and still am a believer in the adage, If youre asking yourself if your drinking is problematic, then, at the very least, drinking is probably not serving you. And, if youre scared shitless that your life wont make sense if you stop drinking, find a friend to take you to a meeting and/or reach out to a mental health professional. At first I struggled to feel drunk enough to belong at AA. Not many people ride into those meetings on a scary genogram. The DUI-divorce-got-fired stories made me wonder if I was in the wrong place. As a rule-follower, I found a sponsor and asked her if I was in the right meetings. She diagnosed me with a Pupu platter of addictions not too much of any one thing, but enough of each one to be concerned. Her advice was to quit drinking, quit smoking, quit emotional eating, and quit trying to control and manage my familys crises. Awesome. On it. I havent had a drink or cigarette in 23 years, and Ive only really missed drinking three or four times  mostly when I need a way to medicate overwhelming anxiety. As much as I try to work a live and let live vibe, Ive watched civilized drinking ravage the lives of so many families and friends that Ive developed no interest in it at all. The romance of wine clubs, scotch tastings, and a few beers while we watch the game is dead for me. I know there are many healthy, moderate drinkers (Im married to a guy who drinks a 12-pack per year), but I also see drinking culture as a great cover for pain. And, as Father Richard Rohr says, If we do not transform our pain, we will most assuredly transmit it  usually to those closest to us: our family, our neighbors, our co-workers, and, invariably, the most vulnerable, our children. As the mother of two teenagers who are navigating binge-drinking culture, Im so proud that we raised our children in an environment where alcohol didnt play a central role, and that we didnt buy into the bullshit of, You need to just expect your kids to drink. We are very clear about our expectations and our combined family histories of addiction: We dont expect you to drink until you are 21 and, if you do, there will be consequences. And, heres the family history you need to understand . . . The evidence about early drinking ages and addiction issues is real. They deserve to know the facts. Ellen recently told me, When I got my license and you told me that if I ever drove after a sip of alcohol or got in the car with someone who had been drinking that I would never drive a car purchased by you  it was scary and I knew it was true. When I asked her how she knew, she said, Everyones parents say that about drinking, but they drink and a lot of them even drink and drive. You live this rule. The co-dependence stuff is something Ive learned to recognize and work through in healthy ways. Turns out that resentment is a shitty but effective indicator light when Im taking care of others in the wrong way. And, by wrong way I mean trying to control situations by looking generous but really trying to protect my own self-interest. I love what Anne Lamott says, Help is the sunny side of control. Stop helping so much. Dont get your help and goodness all over everybody. Over the past two decades, food and work have emerged as my real drugs of choice. Like most addiction, theyre fueled by shame and the not enough gremlins. Theyre also tricky addictions because Im good at abstaining but not so good at moderation. Food and work dont lend themselves to abstinence. I once heard someone say, Abstinence-based recovery is like living with a caged, raging, tiger in your living room. If you open the door for any reason, you know it will kill you. The non-abstinence-based addictions are the same, but you have to open the door to that cage three times a day. Sounds about right. I have my own program for food and work thats an interesting combination of abstinence and contemplative prayer. Its much harder because of that tiger thing, but I keep working on it. Maybe Ill share more when the daily walks with the tiger become more predictable. Not easy, but more predictable. #PracticeOverPerfection For now, I want to share three inspirations that form the cornerstones of how I live into my sobriety. 1. I went to AA meetings regularly during my first year of sobriety, and I still work the program. Its not for everyone, but it makes sense to me. And, Im unapologetic about taking what works and leaving the rest. This passage from the AA Big Book is the truest and most important touchstone to my recovery: That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality  safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we afraid. That is our experience. That is how we react so long as we keep in fit spiritual condition. For me, this means that if I stay in fit spiritual condition  boundaries, vulnerability, honesty, authenticity, connection to God, healthy food, exercise, and sleep  I will experience the miracle of neutrality. I wont be running toward or away from cold beer or warm carbs. 2. Ten years after I got sober, my breakdown spiritual awakening started. In addition to not drinking, I had just quit sugar and bread for the first time. I thought I was going to come out of my skin. I sat across from my therapist, Diana, and said, You need to give me something for my anxiety. I cant take it. Theres nothing to take the edge off anymore. Im freaking out. Diana calmly replied, What do you want me to give you? Infuriated by her calmness, I said, I dont know! Medicine. Something for the anxiety! Im like a turtle without a shell. I have NO SHELL! No booze, no muffins, nothing! Im a turtle without a shell in a briar patch. Everything in the briar patch is poking me and jabbing me. It hurts. She said, Maybe we should talk about getting out of the briar patch? I was pissed. Get out of the fucking briar patch? Thats your advice? Instead of giving me a new shell, you want me to live somewhere less prickly? Seriously? Diana said, You dont need to find a different place to live. Maybe we could just think about a different way to live. One that doesnt require that heavy shell. DAMMIT. We spent the better part of a year identifying the briar patch, and I learned how to be a turtle without a shell. Today, when Im feeling poked and jabbed by life, my first instinct is still to reach for the shell, but now I catch myself. My briar patch is not enough sleep, too much work, too many expectations, resentment, perfecting, pleasing, proving, and a few other thorny things. 3. This last one is a quote from Mary Karr. I read it in an interview she did for The Fix. I recommend you read the entire interview  it blew me away. That schoolmarm part of me  that hypercritical finger-wagging part of myself that I thought was gonna keep me sober  that was actually what helped me stay drunk. What keeps you sober is love and connection to something bigger than yourself. When I got sober, I thought giving up [alcohol] was saying goodbye to all the fun and all the sparkle, and it turned out to be just the opposite. Thats when the sparkle started for me. Today, Im grateful for my sobriety and the sparkle it brought to my life.

Since I quit drinking in March all I wanted to say was, I did this, I beat this addiction, me. I wanted to carry it all on my shoulders. So I did it on my own and didnt ask for help. I relapsed yesterday. I cannot make this journey alone. My ego and addiction tells me I can, saying, You can control your drinking. You can do it yourself and you dont need help. I have proven over and over again, that simply isnt true. I need help and its ok. There is such strength in vulnerability!!! I cant hide my addiction in the dark and successfully beat it. I have to put all of it out to be seen, to be shared, and then to recover with others. Thank you all for sharing and supporting! Together we can do this."

I am new to reddit so I ask for patience while I manoeuvre my way, learning the meaning of the acronyms (I googled IWNDWYT - soon to be my new mantra). I joined reddit after some encouragement from my adult son. As he put it, it is more interesting than scrolling my newsfeed on fb. So here I am. When I happened to come upon the r/stopdrinking and read some of your stories I was touched. The vulnerability. The truth being written has encouraged me to look in the mirror. I would say that I am a social drinker but that would be a lie. I enjoy it - a little too much. So much so that I sometimes wake in the middle of the night heart racing in a sweat whispering to myself that I will never do this again.....until next time. My mother use to say ""tomorrow never comes"" no truer words have been spoken. Yesterday was a typical day. My husband, myself and another couple had plans to go see the new Elton John movie last night. Prior to dinner my gf and I shared a bottle of red - we needed to get caught up on our girl talk before the guys arrived from their late afternoon pool game. A typical beginning to our group date night. At the theatre another 9oz of pinot is poured for me.....if that isnt enough a night cap before bed is planned upon returning home - except my night cap turns out to be 3 more glasses of wine - this time white. I have a problem AND I know it. When I review my life from teen years to now mid 50's my drinking was out of control before children and now has crept up again after my children have left the nest. At 4:30 this morning I once again awoke to the heart racing, night sweats but also to hearing a woman screaming. I jumped out of bed and checked outside and saw no one. Upon reflection I wonder if the woman screaming was my soul wanting to be saved."

Instead, I've spent most of my days for the past 15 or so years nursing hangovers from secretly drinking 1.5 + bottles of wine a night. So my days have mostly been marked by regret and just trying to get through the day, but not being overwhelmed by the urge to drink (thank heaven for small favors!). But then 4:00 PM or so rolls around. I've learned to think of 4:00 to 7:00 PM as **the Witching Hour.** That's when my brain suddenly switches gears and The Beast (my alcoholic inner voice) takes over. What sounded like the most STUPID idea in the world just a few minutes ago (stopping for wine and starting to drink on the drive home) suddenly feels inevitable. It's all I can think about. Resistance feels futile. More often than not, I just give in so I can stop worrying that it's going to happen. Lately I've been playing with this idea of ""leapfrogging"" over the drinking thoughts and remembering how I will feel if I just make it through the Witching Hour sober. Typically, if I get through dinner without any wine I'm fine for the rest of the night. If I don't drink, I'll be able to sit and enjoy a good book without forgetting what I read the next day. I'll feel cozy and calm when I climb into bed with my husband at the end of the day, rather than feeling overheated, embarrassed, and dreading another night of dehydrated stupor and morning of suffering and remorse. Leapfrogging over the strongest urges/cravings hasn't always worked for me, but it has sometimes, so I keep it in my toolbox and thought I'd share it here. Anyone else struggle with a similar window of vulnerability? If so, do you have a name for it? What tricks and tips do you have for getting through your own Witching Hours? IWNDWYT John"

Anyone with depression/addiction/anxiety/trauma/other adverse life experiences probably knows. Something happened today that simultaneously took a lot of pressure off me, made me relief-cry, and was a wake-up call to me. I had to level with my dad about old money mistakes and being harassed by the bank. Someone showed up at our door claiming to be from my bank and while it wasn't for me, the thought that it might be a collection agent chilled me to a panic. Long story short, my dad bailed my ass out. With kindness and concern and generosity and non-judgmental friendliness. It was grace and relief and also a bit humiliating. He hugged me and comforted me. But something after that made me want to numb myself. The precursor to wanting to drink. A barrier crossed, I suppose, or some sense of uncomfortable vulnerability. ""This is uncomfortable, let's try and run away from it,"" I heard that voice. I've been putting sobriety on autopilot these last few days. Just checking in, saying a prayer of gratitude every afternoon, and so on. Noticing the relief that the only ""refill"" I'm anxious about is my iced water. This moment of desire I had earlier today and this sub help me recommit to the sober life in this moment, and all the tolerance of discomfort it entails. It's rough, but I can do this. To be sober is such a strong support to the rest of my life and the values/feelings I hold dear and aspire to - non-violence, freedom from shame and delusion, kindness, generosity. Sobriety is the fundamental drill that helps me strengthen those muscles. The quote is from a Mary Oliver poem that I turn to when I'm feeling very confused about my general career + life direction.

That is the time I get up during the week to get my daughter to school. Without drinking to oblivion my body woke up naturally and said get up, get the dogs out! Have some coffee and look at the beautiful sunshine! I had been looking forward to sleeping in but I feel refreshed and incredibly grateful this morning. Yesterday I struggled a bit. The blues crept up on me but I knew drinking would just leave me with regret and Id wake up with the anxiety and depression that accompanies my hangovers. This is my second bout with sobriety. The last time I quit, about 5 years ago, I stayed sober for over 6 months. My dad died at that point and booze said:  heres your free pass, have a drink. You were never that bad anyway. We all know how that went for me, Im sure. I did go to AA at that time and although I believe in AA and it did help, honestly it just wasnt for me. Time will tell. It did equip me with some helpful mantras but didnt jive with my personality type I guess. The experience did really hit it home for me that relapse is part of recovery for some. Even if you fail, you learn throughout this process. This sub is important to me because all of you wonderful people have also equipped me with vocabulary I can relate to and I see that we are all one in the same and my shame is so greatly alleviated by your stories. I read every post every day and youre all my heroes. Whether you relapsed or made it to quadruple digits you have influenced me and taught me even more. What has really helped me was a phrase someone shared that I repeat to myself constantly. There is never a morning where I wake up and say: Im glad I drank last night. Thank you so much for that. My anxiety was heading to borderline agoraphobia and I was so scared of this beautiful life, had become a shadow of myself but now I am hopeful and productive as possible again. Alcohol poisons your mind, make no mistake about it. Another plus is that the excess alcohol weight is already falling off. Im eating a lot more than I did as a drinker but apparently two bottles of wine a night maybe with a few shots of brandy will really pack on the pounds and keep you fluffy even though its killing your appetite. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for your raw honesty everyone. I think one of my issues is my inability to show vulnerability and that makes me hide things, really suppressing things with alcohol. Im betting a lot of you can relate. Ill end this with telling you all that I hope you know how important you and your stories are.

I started running the numbers... I am 47, I really started drinking when I was 18 and went to college. It was a big party school so: Monday nights, Football (and beers), Wednesday nights, 25 beer night, Thursday night, beers (Thursday is the new Friday), Friday night, beers (end of week celebration!), Saturday night, beers (cuz its Saturday night, duh), Sunday, Football games! And beers... Well that doesnt set one up very well for not drinking. After college it was probably 3 night a week going out drinking with friends. Then growing up and getting married, having kids, job stress... beers or wine just about every night. Next thing I know 30 years has gone by and I dont know the last time I went 3 weeks with out a drink. Ive been on the wagon before or been sick (cold) for a week or so, but never a break this long. I feel great. My energy is terrific and my mood is so much more calm. What the fuck have I been doing for 30 years!? As I put my son to bed and lay with him for a few moments I rested up thinking for the first 12 years of his life dad has held him and smelled of beer or wine breath, yuck. Never again. I finally feel present. It feels right. And I want better for my family. I certainly dont want my son to throw away 30 years chasing the party or reliving the old college days or self medicating with alcohol. I am so glad I have finally woken up. Thank you all for being here and sharing your stories, baring your soul and not being afraid to show vulnerability. I cannot get over how drawn I am to SD to read the posts. The strength I draw from the camaraderie is remarkable. I am humbled. I will not drink with you today. "

A year ago my husband had an emotional affair and moved out. He'd long been saying I was no longer the person he knew. I got angry every time he said that and said he married me for better or worse. We're trying to work things out and reconcile. I've been trying to figure out why my memory is failing, why I've gained weight around my midsection, why I can't get to work on time in the morning. I'm a doctor and can't keep some of my charting organized (note: this is never in a way that puts patients in harm's way. Somehow when it comes to others' safety I can pull it together). It all comes back to, it's the alcohol, stupid! I'm the person no one would ever, ever think would become an alcoholic (and no one knows, still). I was the person who drank one or two, socially, maybe once or twice a month. Yesterday as I was on my second glass of wine at 4 pm (and plenty buzzed) I was on the phone with a lifelong friend who said, ""You're such a lightweight!"" I laughed right along with her. I went ahead and had one more when I got home, then vomited about every half hour, all night, diligently running down the stairs to the downstairs bathroom so I wouldn't interrupt the sleep of my two kids. I couldn't make it to work today and called in sick. I'm going to an AA meeting in a few hours. After having my second kid 4 years ago I went back to work 3 days a week and started to treat myself to a drink or two on the nights before my days off. That turned into 2 or 3 a day. Now I drink 2 or 3 a day, 5 or 6 days a week, and definitely get drunk at about 1.5 drinks in. I do dumb stuff while intoxicated. Sometimes things I forget I did until I see the text evidence or find (ugh) vomit in a place where I forgot to clean it up. I fool myself by saying, ""I still feel the effect of one glass of wine; I don't have a tolerance and don't have a problem, right??"" The day after any day I don't drink, I feel AMAZING. I swear off drinking forever!! Never again!! I look at alcohol in the grocery store and think, ""Ha, who wants that stuff? You have no power over me!"" Then a day later I think, ""Well, maybe just one..."" which is never just one. I have to stop. I have to stop. I have to stop drinking. My plan for today is cry a while longer no drinking go for a run, then clean myself up and go to an AA meeting. considering treating myself to a gym membership and a personal trainer if I make it to two weeks, but I realize that goes against the one-day-at-a-time mindset?

I wont go through my entire back-story, it doesnt matter too much how I got to rock bottom for the purpose of this post. What matters is how I felt on that day. The horror, shame, and guilt at what Id done and what Id become. And fear, absolute terror that I was unable to change no matter how much I wanted (needed) it. I cant begin to express the depth of that fear and shame. Guilt, too, at how Id behaved, but a deeper shame - absolute shame in who I was, how weak I was, how unable I was to stick to the changes I promised myself Id make, and how I simply wasnt worthy of anything better. The shame and fear was so strong that I just couldnt get past it, over it, or around it. I couldnt talk about it, I couldnt distance myself from it. And I couldnt face up to it. Yet I was drowning in it. All I knew how do was drink to myself away from it. And that wasnt working out for me. What i ended up doing, what I had to do, was deny it. I had to pretend it didnt exist for a while. That shame I was carrying made me feel completely unworthy of love or kindness. There was no way I could do myself the kindness of becoming sober when I felt that way. I needed to put that shame in a box and push it to the side while I focussed on not having that first drink I used my well-honed skills of denial (the same skills that allowed me to walk back into work after another one of *those* nights out), and I put the shame aside so I could focus on not having that first drink. I didnt forget about it though. I made an appointment with a counsellor (therapist, whatever you want to call them), so I could get help to unpack it in a way that wouldnt overwhelm me. And by the time I started unpacking that box, I had a little more time under my belt, just enough to gain a tiny sliver of confidence in my sobriety. I had enough distance to be able to more clearly see what was in the box and to allow myself to be vulnerable while I unpacked it. And it turns out that the stuff in that box was not at all what I thought it was. There were things in there that I ended up being quite proud of. There were things that I realised had nothing to do with me. There were things that no longer existed - that I just had to recognise and leave behind. And there were things I had to apologise to people for, to own up to, and to face the consequences of. Anyway, thats just my experience, but I hope that someone reading this might find it useful. You dont have to become perfect overnight, it might be okay to just focus on the practicalities of not drinking and leaving the other stuff until you feel stronger. And, by the way, that shame, the guilt, and all that emotional shit that comes with rock bottom or the morning after the night before - its not who you are, its just something youve experienced. Rock on soberinos, you can do this, and everyone here knows that you deserve to be healthy and happy, even if you dont quite believe that yet. "

I want to say that while I am not officially quitting I am stopping indefinitely. I was drinking Every. Single. Night. And while I wasnt getting wasted but buzzed, it was tiresome and taking its toll on me. Ive recently learned how much of a vulnerability alcohol can be for me. The last time I drank, I really learned this and I knew I just needed to stop, so I did cold turkey. I also believe my drinking was allowing me to be complicit in a toxic relationship, drinking to just drown all that shit and sorrow out, a way to ignore what was going, to mute the emotion, the feelings of helplessness, hopelessness. So many things have changed in the past 2 months, completely...aside from the lack of drinking, Ive also left the 3yr mess of a relationship, moved into temporary housing, job searching to get back on my feet. Ive changed my diet as well. And may now take it further and go completely sober (eliminating weed &amp; cigs) (also if there are subs for stopping weed please share!) I am proud of myself, not just because Ive stopped drinking but because I also have not gone back to it despite the elevated levels of stress/ distress. I honestly knew I wanted to slow down. I just didnt think Id get here. Id wake up thinking about drinking that day, it seemed so difficult to stop. (I would usually start in early evening) I remember points of scrounging up change just to be able for afford that fix. And now here I am unconsumed by the thought of it. Unwavering in my NO when offered. Able to go into the liquor store to buy my cigs and not be tempted to get my usual. It feels so damn good to BE in control. You all can do it!! Go Me &amp; Go You!"

Sometimes it's good to get stuff out there. I love this group and the fantastic posts, and I read it every day. I usually hit this sub several times a day, in fact. Thing is, I'm figuring out why I keep drinking even though I don't really want to. I'm just terribly sad inside. Isn't that awful? I just keep telling myself how much I've screwed things up. It's like a constant voice in my head. This Valentine's Day crap totally mowed me over. I'm reading your posts and lovely comments about how you were able to avoid drinking yesterday (and I'm sincerely happy for all of you!) Well, not me. Last night I found myself wandering around my kitchen drunk after several beers at the bar, eating leftover Indian food and talking (mumbling? rambling?) out loud to my ex-girlfriend who wasn't in the room (my dog was) and listening to sad music. Then a moment of clarity sitting there in my kitchen thinking ""what the hell happened here?"" I feel like a total loser. Or even worse - I'm feeling like I've made myself invisible. I don't like to look people in the eye. I don't feel significant or that I matter. I'm just...kinda here. Thanks alcohol. You have done your job so well...I'm so happy I turned to you for all the help. Here's the deal - I'll never get over the ex and the mountain of all the other stuff I'm carrying around if I keep drinking. I've had long-term sobriety before. I lost it a few years ago. Slowly and steadily my life has gotten worse. That was my thought this morning when I woke up - ""what went wrong, here"" and tracing it back *specifically* to the half beer that kicked off my relapse almost 4 years ago. Having a beer every now and again has turned into having multiple strong beers every other night - either alone or with a few other drunk people at some shit bar. Then coming home and drinking more beers and inevitably smoking, too. I've put on weight. I stopped going to the gym, stopped training Muay Thai. Stopped riding (and teaching) motorcycles. Stopped playing music. Stopped hanging with friends. It's the worst. It's a half life. So yeah, relapse totally sucks. If you have some sobriety, good job! Hold on to it with everything you have. EVERYTHING. Relapse is a shit fest. There is absolutely no worse show than the one I'm in, and I bought a VIP ticket to the front row. I hate it, and I hate alcohol, and worst of all I hate myself right now. Real talk here. Thank God my dog is so awesome.

86,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Addiction is a Dual Personality Disorder,4,atntiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/atntiy/addiction_is_a_dual_personality_disorder/,2019-02-23 09:32:13,"This is written for those yet to make a firm decision to stop, or control where they are. Addiction is a Dual Personality Disorder There is in this a remarkable similarity to Multiple Personality Disorder, in which the conscious self switches between islands of identity and awareness, with a limited knowledge if any, of the other identities, and each represents emotional ways of dealing with interpersonal conflicts. Dual Personality Disorder,as I term it, involves two identities, in this case, one is created by the chemical addiction, and the other is the neglected and injured original self which feels a great and intolerable vulnerability. The therapy of the MPD condition involves attempts at increasing awareness of each splintered self towards re-integrating it into a strong, capable whole. *Addiction is a chemically induced MPD,* which relies upon one identity, or consciousness, pushing out the other, and so loses connection of the other, sober self. The Addict's alter grows each time one succumbs and becomes intoxicated. The thing that addicts and those heading towards addiction, fail to understand, is that they are a battle ground between two personalities for dominance of their consciousness. The addict personality developing inside, is much like any normal personality, and has arguments to convince you. It is, highly manipulative. The first stage in defeating it, is to become aware that there is a battle happening. When you drink, you must make an effort towards mindful awareness. You need to see that the addictive alter, that has developed in you, takes over when you forget what the normal self feels and needs. The part of you that feels the hangover tomorrow, is switched off by the alter, just as in MPD we can see that each personality chases out the other. By focusing on the part you forget when you drink, you strengthen that part of you, and the awareness becomes very quickly a natural habit, and it results in the strengthening of that non addict side. The original you, you must make an effort to remember. Mindfulness employed as you drink, will become easier and automatic very quickly. The next stage is to identify that the change in consciousness that occurs prior to a decision to drink, also continues with each additional drink, until you succumb completely to your alter. The reason why past addicts find it so hard to go back to moderate drinking, is that they tend to drink to switch off the moderate side of themselves, and are left with this manufactured alter, which wants only to drink until the complete control of you is the outcome. This side has no moderation. So, one must identify the point at which this awareness, between the two side, is lost, and the original you is switched off. For some, it might be after the 3rd drink, or the 5th drink. For others the 8th, etc. When your conscious contact with your sober self is lost, you must identify this level before you drink. And when you reach it, you will identify that line. When you reach that point, or safely just before, the next drink will turn into a glass of your own blood. You will perceive that drink as your own blood. Your blood laced with diseases like hepatitis. It will taste like blood, and you will feel extremely nauseous lifting it to your lips. This line will now become harder to cross, almost impossible. You will not lose consciousness of what effects alcohol has on you, or how the sober you will feel tomorrow, at any time. And as you get used to this level, you will want a lower level in the future. The key is to keep the sober identity connected as you slip away. To strengthen this, it is important to have faith. I am not talking about any particular religion, or membership of a congregation. I am talking about the faith that gives you the power to think positively about not drinking, your ability to cope easily with life, and brush off the triggers that have tended to activate your addiction alter, which in reality, are its excuses to take over. Faith that there is a higher guiding force, that puts hostilities of others in your way not as personal attacks on you, but as opportunities to now view them as constructive signs and messages. Instead of being hurt by those around you, at that moment you are struggling, they are educational examples of their own weakness and how you can learn from them and rise above them. Consider the behaviour of others as educational videos on the foolish, self destructive behaviours that anyone can become consumed by. A boss who treats you as worthless, are themselves facing that outcome, and you are being shown their nature so that you may detach from them or leave, eventually. An ex who treats you badly, is destined to repeat all the same negative patterns they did before, and have taught you to detach so that you may not be hurt again, or care overly for them in the future in a way that could derail you on your new path. In short, all the negative, hostile behaviours that would trigger you previously, that of your alter who must drink to cope, are actually lessons acting as sign posts, and must not be taken personally. There are no excuses to give in. It is merely a battle between two selves, which requires mindfulness to change."

I havent been to any groups or step programs, and I find that a little odd. I thought Id need more support, and maybe someday I may need to, but right now, changing my thoughts about alcohol and drugs seemed to help me get stronger and push myself to improve my life at 41, with no wife or kids. I just knew I wanted this change, to see past the fog, to let in the light, Embracing the pain of suffering with self-medicating habits helped me heal. I needed to cry, then to laugh, then cry again. Ive since weened off of cigarettes, pot and harder drugs, and found that my anxiety and self doubt is dissolving. Life without these pacifiers is growing more positive by the day. I run in the mornings, share my story, embrace my vulnerability, and use it as a positive navigation tool. 200 days and not looking back."

I never posted - thats my Stuff that Im carrying, vulnerability. Anyway, I want to keep this post positive! Because its my day to celebrate being a woman, as well as my third try at sobriety (Day 1 ), I want to share this incredible quote from Lena Waithe that shes light on so many of my own values and truths: Heres the thing. Life comes at you fast. So do what you love. And try to spread joy and some truth while you do it. The best things arent made by man, but by [my] God. No new year, new me. No resolutions. I just want to keep going. So heres my truth: I want to commit myself to loving ME. And to do that, I need to start holding myself accountable. And being real with myself by acknowledging that Im on my way to knowing real loss if I dont at least TRY, because thats what happens when you love something more than you love yourself. So Im going to put myself FIRST. Because thats what I deserve. So when I feel the urge to drink, that means calling up my sister, who is the only person in my world who I feel safe reaching out to. Shes the light of my life, and I know that her love and support can get me through to the next morning without taking that drink. So with all that out in universe, IWNDWYT. "
90,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Love and Alcohol,1,afb03n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/afb03n/love_and_alcohol/,2019-01-13 07:00:01,"I had this realization the other day and wanted to share here. A sobriety-granted epiphany about love and dating and vulnerability that struck me and continues to hang in my mind quite a bit. Sorry for the length, just haven't really processed this through with anyone and, hey, what is the anonymous internet good for if not that?! In late 2017, I began dating someone who I really clicked with after a series of underwhelming relationships. Someone who, right away, I was like ""something is really special about you."" On our first date, we met up for drinks. Usually a date would last two drinks, but she and I just stayed, and stayed, and stayed because we couldn't stop talking. I got home very drunk, but very excited to see her again. On our second date, she came to see me perform in a storytelling competition, which I won. We got drinks at intermission, and stayed to celebrate afterwards, and stayed and stayed. I got home very drunk again, but feeling happy to have found her. Without doing a date-by-date rundown, suffice it to say that we would often meet up for a drink and talk well into the night, ending up leaving the bar pretty drunk after having talked for hours. At the point where a date might naturally end, one of us would usually ask, ""what do you think, should we get another?"" And we always did, because we always wanted that one-more-beer worth of conversation and company. She was the first person I had really, really liked in a really, really long time. After a month or so of this (and a particularly drunk weekend), she said to me, ""you know, we can hang out sometime and NOT get shitfaced. You know, if you'd like."" Which of course I'd like. I asked her if I could bring some seltzer waters over her place later to watch a movie? And I did. Fast forward a bit to early summer. I'd found out that I received a prestigious fellowship that would take me abroad for the academic year of 2018-2019 and she was going to be gone on her own work-related stuff for most of the summer. We decided that it didn't make logistical sense to do long distance, which we were both really fucking bummed about because things were going well, we liked each other, and the lousy-feeling option unfortunately was our best option. We got drinks the night before I left, and the next day she drove me to the airport. In October, I came back for a week on a pre-planned trip to a friend's wedding. I asked her if she wanted to grab dinner at 6pm and she said of course. So we met up for pizza, we got a beer. Then she asked if we should do another? And of course we did. We had a lot to catch up about. When we finished that one and I asked if we should grab another? She suggested going to a live music bar I really love, so we went there and had another. And then another, and then another after that. By the time we left it was 1am. When we got to her porch, she asked if I'd maybe like a whiskey? She had some upstairs and we could have one last round on the porch? And I said yes, of course, and I finally got home around 3, very shitfaced. When I described my night to a friend the next day, my friend said, ""awww, she missed you."" Which hit my like a brick because it was obvious but completely unstated. We'd just caught up over beers! ... For 9 hours! This is long, sorry. What's my point? My point is that the other day it occurred to me that our perpetual habit of ""one more round"" had \*always\* been a way of expressing ""I want to spend time with you because I like you"" without the vulnerability of having to SAY that. It can be so goddamn hard to tell someone, ""I love being around you all the time and can I just sit here and listen to you forever"" but it is so goddamn easy to say ""should we stay for another round?"" She did miss me, and I missed her. But for some reason, saying ""I miss you"" with all the emotional weight it carried felt impossible. Alcohol kept me from developing bravery in the face of vulnerability. I outsourced the expression of my love to the glass in my hand rather than facing the discomfort head on. I hope that she and I get back together when I return, and I feel like sobriety has given me a clearer head of how to not only access my feelings but give them the respect and voice they deserve. Anyway, thanks for reading. Have needed to get that off my chest for a bit. "

92,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Hot damn! I made it one year!,1,akw9oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/akw9oy/hot_damn_i_made_it_one_year/,2019-01-29 15:15:11,"Hey SD Fam! Here I am, one year without any booze! Im so amazed that I made it this far. Last January was tough as shit for me, and I really wasnt sure when I quit last time if I was going to make it one week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, or even a day. My longest streak before that was 22 days, I think? I owe my sobriety to you wonderful folks, and the book *This Naked Mind*. That book was a life-changer, and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs inspiration to quit or an extra push. I thought Id share some things that have worked for me this past year, in no particular order: **Substitution**: I cannot begin to tell you how many LaCroix, Polar, Bubly, and off-brand seltzers Ive drank this last year. As soon as I got off work I would pop one open. I would drink 6 cans easily in one night, or even more when it was nice outside, and on the weekends. I still drink it now, but after it started getting colder I started drinking more tea, and I drink a shit ton of tea these days. **Routine**: Ive posted before that routine has helped me immensely. Ive always been a creature of habit, so I got into a routine of getting off work, having a seltzer to chill for a minute, going to the gym or taking a walk, coming home, having some tea, watching TV, reading, and going to bed at a reasonable time. On the weekends Ive gotten into a certain groove to structure my time as well, although its a lot looser. **Marijuana**: Probably not what a lot of folks want to hear, but pot was a godsend for me in the beginning. I live in a legal state, so I substituted weed for booze a lot at first: during the week, on the weekends, on vacation where I knew booze would be around a lot, and when going out with friends. It helped me sleep at night, and took the edge off when I really had a craving for alcohol. My pot consumption has gone down considerably the last couple months, and I really only use it if Im going out in a social situation where I know Ill be anxious, or on a weekend when Im going out, like to a concert. But it hasnt been a weekday thing for many months, and its not even an every weekend thing now. I've never had the same relationship with pot as I do with booze, and Ive never abused it, so this works well for me. YMMV. **Exercise**: I started out with long walks listening to podcasts, eventually moving up to going to the gym, and starting a weightlifting routine again. I picked up my New Rules of Weightlifting for Women book again, and Im currently on stage 4. I got stalled during the holidays, but Im going back to it this week. When I dont lift weights, I go swimming, or run on the treadmill. I still take plenty of Very Long Walks, and will say that if you can get outside I highly recommend it. I love the gym, but nothing really beats getting outside, whether it be your neighborhood, city, or out in nature. **Reading**: Bren Browns book *Daring Greatly* really spoke to me, as do her TED Talks about shame and vulnerability. Weve all done shit were not proud of, and getting through that shame about our pasts is crucial for moving forward. Ive also read books on Stoicism, Circadian Rhythm Diet (I do Intermittent Fasting), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (currently reading that one), relationship attachment theory, memoirs by other alcoholics, and some non-fiction and fiction. I think that having a well-rounded reading list about all kinds of different things, no matter where your interests lie, is important for keeping your mind off drinking. Plus, learning new stuff about yourself and the world around you is just dope AF. Im sure theres plenty that Im missing, but those have been the main things that have helped me. If you look back into my post history youll see positive posts, negative posts, and everything in between. Theres been some days where its been incredibly hard, but the vast majority of days have been easier than I thought. Honestly, I kind of surprised myself with how much easier it got after the first 6 weeks or so. Getting to my first month was a big milestone. Really, my anxiety thinking about how hard it was going to be when I quit kept me from quitting for way too long. The reality is that it can actually be easier than you think. I know this has been quoted before on this sub, but I only discovered BoJack Horseman about a month ago and immediately binged all 5 seasons, so Ill leave you with a quote from the jogging baboon from BoJack: Every day it gets a little easier But you gotta do it every day  thats the hard part. But it does get easier. Thank you again, SD Fam. I could NOT have done this without you. Coming here every day is the absolute Number One thing that has made a difference in my life over the past year. IWNDWYT. "

I feel like the attached social stigma is some tragic state of weakness - but if I strip away my facade and ego, I have to admit am in a pretty weak and grim state. For me, there isn't a family history of alcoholism, although I suspect there are some in my generation that are struggling. But if there is a genetic component, it is perhaps a tendency towards depression and anxiety, and I am self-medicating instead of practicing self-care. But in any case, I'm an alcoholic now. I've drank so much that I've become addicted to an addictive substance. It's pretty easy for me to say to friends *I've quit drinking, I'm older, the hangovers are too much*, etc, but the honesty and vulnerability it takes to say ""I'm an alcoholic"" - just haven't made it past that hurdle yet. I'd have to admit that I struggle most and drink most when I'm alone, when people won't know. And I'm ashamed. I've been reading the books (Naked Mind, Alcohol Explained, memoirs etc) and posts here, journaling a lot. I know that the days I spend sober are infinitely better than the drinking nights &amp; hungover days that follow. I guess I've come to a place where I realize I can't do this alone, that I need help and support. It's very hard for me to admit I need help, with anything. But I'm here today, coming out of the lurking sidelines, and saying it to all you lovely people. I'm an alcoholic, and I will not drink with you today."

I've been attending AA, but I'm really thinking I need something more intensive. I can do it on my own, until I can't. I feel like if I start looking into rehab, it would be insane to go a month into sobriety. I was diagnosed with anorexia at 15, that spiralled into or was replaced by alcoholism and in the past drug use. I conquered drugs on my own, the eating and drinking are still a struggle. I can stop right now, I'm scared and that is fueling the fire, but that fear will subside and I think I have avoided figuring out the base issues that cause me to cope in self destructive ways. I am a people pleaser and I struggle with vulnerability, even when I go to a Dr. and want to discuss that I get through a day by making a rigid schedule but that I don't really feel joy, I freeze and tell them everything is ok. I know the alcohol and starvation can mimc depression, so I'm not sure if I am depressed or not, but I can't get up the courage to ask for help and I think being in a facility for a month with round the clock care, they may start to really get deeper into my head. I don't have a family Dr. and I'm scared to go into a walk-in and reveal so much about myself. Something needs to change though, I did a sober month in November and the unhappiness didn't subside, I just packed my day until I could sleep to get through, which I do with alcohol too I guess, I use it until the day is gone. I just don't know where to go from here. It's so hard to find help anywhere."

One way to bring some *hygge* into your life, I am learning, can start with simply placing comforting things in your home or workspace. That plush blanket, those candles that smell of bacon cookies (that was supposed to say baking cookies but autocorrect makes a good suggestion), soft incandescent light from a lamp, a fire in the fireplace, the Christmas lights. My favorite less-common idea Im looking forward to trying is putting a sprig of rosemary or other fresh herb inside my pillow case. Things that make you feel good, feel at home, like flannel pajamas and fuzzy slippers and warm cinnamon rolls and hot coffee and a book (now I'm ready for it to be Saturday morning!). These seem like easy-peasy no-brainers, right? This aspect of *hygge* is about setting the stage to slow down and de-stress, two pillars of self-care, which is indispensably important on the journey of recovery. I have written and rewritten this paragraph, getting tangled in the emotions and self-abuse that prevent taking good care of oneself and that make it so much more necessary, but the bottom line is: DO IT. Those easy-peasy no-brainers that help the tension leave your shoulders, that let all the muscles of your face relax (go ahead, try relaxing them now! did you find you had been scowling or squinting or frowning?), that let your heart open just a bit wider.... *Hygge*. Comfort yourself. You deserve it. You need it. You'll be better prepared for healing and growing. Making time for my own self-care required... wait for it... getting over myself and my attitude that it would be selfish and I was undeserving of the indulgence of ""down time."" I had to admit vulnerability in asking for help to be able to spend time on myself. I truly am a better wife, mom and employee when I make time to truly feel unpressured and comfortable. Are your self-care skills improving? Do you defend your boundaries and heed your needs? What are your favorite comfort items? I do not drink; therefore, I will not drink with you today. Love, k_ss"

(365 Day whoopin'),1,aauhdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/aauhdj/heres_my_year_365_day_whoopin/,2018-12-30 20:10:52,"Hello dear friends, Thank you all so much for the support, advice, grief, dejectedness, elation and all the other things that being here has brought before my eyes this year.. Here's a stream of consciousness for you all, so please forgive the self reflective rambling. 365 days ago I had my last sip of alcohol. I didn't have much faith in myself, so I didn't tell many people IRL about wanting to quit. I started with ""a few weeks off"", then ""dry January"", then ""for a while"", then eventually said ""I'd promised myself I'll do a year off beer"". I wasn't a ""problem"" drinker. A happy drunk, that had a rapacious capacity for alcohol, I think I have some sort of syndrome whereby instead of getting sleepy and overly drunk, I can start metabolising the alcohol quickly and get like an energy surge. I am yet to investigate scientifically if this is actually a real phenomenon or not. I will power up when drinking though, and can easily take on 20+ units of alcohol in a sitting. Easily. \*shakes head and sighs\*. So although I didn't cause fights, or make *too much* trouble, I was consuming far too much alcohol. My nature is a bit all-or-nothing, and my capacity for it led to regular sessions that were clearly unhealthy. I was overweight to the point of morbid obesity and depression was starting to tinge the periphery of life. I am so glad to get this mental blcok of ""a year! lol!"" out of the way, it has become a hindrance of late, the tricky booze brain has been playing tricks, you know the ones.. ""you could celebrate with *just a few""* ""you could just have one night back on it and *then give up again""* . I hate it, and I hate the fact that I am even considering it. As an aside, last night was a particular challenge as I attended a party with all my best friends where the majority of the purpose was to drink alcohol, all my old favourites, expensive bourbon, spiced rum and bundaberg ginger beer, posh lager, cocktails, ice cold Sauvignon Blanc, champagne galore (we know how to party, eh?), and I did have to resort to some sad sack chocolate munching to distract from this. Now I've reached ""the milestone"", for me, I feel a bit freer. I'm just carrying on now. Now I just don't drink. I'll still have challenges, and surreptitious or insiduous attempts (from my friends, largely benign, from others maybe not so, but less impactful on my psyche) to get me to drink alcohol. I think it stems from a variety of reasons, some cliche like ""misery loves company"", but on the whole if I harken back to what I was like, I just wanted everyone else to have the same ""great time"" I was having whilst getting drunk. Other things like events and occasions will still present their own problems too. We're off on an all inclusive holiday in February and I'm already fighting this mental battle, and my SO is saying ""well you could perhaps just have a few on holiday""... I can't pin any of this whole thing down, I don't think anyone can, although there are some nice insights, particularly on r/stopdrinking from people actually going through the same struggles. My psychological barriers and pathways to sucess or failure are a constant moving target seemingly, so when I think I'm golden all of a sudden there'll be a ""*surprise motherfucker!""* moment and I'll feel all the vulnerability return. Then I thinik I'm stupid for feeling vulnerable at all. Then I'll feel like a twat because ""why can't I drink normally, like a normal person and take it or leave it?"". Then I'll have to go through the whole mental process of wondering why I actually want to drink loads of booze at all, anyway. I like to return to a few mantras or midsets that have already been well established here by others: Play the tape forward. Is it worth it. Why do you even want to drink - Address the problem don't treat the symptom. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

There were big drinkers in my family, and I was allowed to taste it at a young age. It was normal to see people drinking daily. For stress relief, to celebrate, because this wine goes well with the steak, whatever. I wasn't a daily drinker or even much of a partier when I was younger, although family vacations and holidays involved a lot of alcohol. For the longest time, I relied more heavily on food for comfort. Alcohol started becoming more of a regular thing for me when I got interested in the craft beer scene. Then there were always extra excuses to drink. Rare beers on tap, free tastings, beer events, seasonal beers... But I think I started to actually rely on it more after I started to get more control over my food issues. After losing a bunch of weight and going through another health issue, I decided I didn't want to drink like that anymore for health reasons. So I just stopped. As an experiment, I told myself. All along, planning on returning to drinking. I just wanted to be a ""normal"" drinker who could take it or leave it. Or just drink on special occasions. So after several months, I started again. The special occasions plan lasted only weeks and I was back to drinking daily, only I wasn't really enjoying it anymore. And I found myself getting more drunk on various occasions than I intended. So after a particularly drunken NYE party with a spectacular hangover, I knew I never wanted to feel that way again. And I knew I wasn't, and wouldn't ever be, a normal drinker. I stayed sober on my own for almost 5 months before I went to my first AA meeting. I wasn't sure I belonged there at first, until I heard other people describe their thinking and their fears and I realized how similar I was. It didn't matter how much I was drinking or how high or low my ""bottom"" was... I wanted to hear how they went from feeling miserable and anxious and alone all the time to feeling peaceful and light. I know AA isn't for everyone. I certainly had to spend a lot of time figuring out my concept of a higher power as well as come to terms with my ""powerlessness"", since I had quit on my own. But being a part of that program has been a very unexpected gift in my life that I didn't even know I needed.

My daughter will be gone all this week, and things with my SO are... just off right now. Im terrible with relationships, which Im sure is largely due to my fear of vulnerability which is also likely a reason I drink. Its a lot easier to drown my emotions with a bottle than to express them to a real live human being, who will do who-knows-what with them. Its hard to truly connect with a partner this way. At any rate its looking like I will be a tad lonely and sad over the next few days. And its the Thanksgiving holiday here, and my birthday weekend, so gotta navigate all this sans alcohol somehow. So, my plan is to have a plan. Get a to-do list going, and also have a few rewards in store. Likely will get myself a massage as a present. Yoga classes in the evenings. Just joined a gym and I have a personal training session planned, which Ive never done before. Work on my budget. Ya know, fun stuff like that :) All in all I feel 99% sure I will come out on top. I have to remember that although drinking provides a temporary relief I will feel awful the next day and I WILL regret it. And then... more sad-sads. But x100. "
99,vulnerability,stopdrinking,The question,1,9z5jta,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9z5jta/the_question/,2018-11-22 04:57:34,"Something has shifted. What I have learned from many people here is that there comes a moment where you can finally start the change. For me, it was afters years of halfhearted attempts. Some people can quit cold turkey, some people never let it get too bad, and others like me let it fester. In the past when I blacked out and behaved terribly, they always looked away. Stayed quiet when I apologized and when they saw me taking shots a few weeks later, I could see the concern in their eyes but once again they looked away. Whispers the next day. In retrospect, all I ever really wanted was someone to sit me down and ask why? Just one syllable. Be it out of concern, curiosity, boredom, or malice. Drinking excessively and acting out time and time again at it's very core is tolerating self destruction, acknowledging failure brings you comfort, and giving up. All I needed was someone to ask why because I could not do that for myself. So many friends and strangers had come before and once I ran away, there was no going back. It was constant newness but underneath it was an anxiety festering. Once I made a mistake, I didn't face it just went out with a new group of people. When I threw a blow dryer at my boyfriend, I would bully him into forgiving me. Band aids when you needed stitches. I know want to stay. I needed to ask myself why. I needed to want to get better and surround myself with people whose mere presence made me want to be a better person. I finally have that. I made a decision to stop running away. No more rationalization, no more apologies, it was time to be seen. I have a problem and there is no fixing it. It has taken me years to get to a place where I surrender and show my vulnerability. That this is my flaw and I am still worthy of being loved. That when it comes to alcohol, there is no control even if the night ends well. This person is who is going to face the world. This is the person who is going to ask for love, for friendship, for human interaction. No one else. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

I woke up thankful to not be hungover and had a great plan for how to conquer this day. I stopped into a meeting before going to see my family, I drove myself, I brought my own things to drink, I was doing SO GOOD! And it was actually really great to be around my loved ones with a clear head. During dinner I was vulnerable with my family about my recovery and some chats Ive been having with my therapist. I never really open up to my family about these things, especially the trauma I am working through in therapy. Part of my recovery is releasing the guilt I feel about what happened to me. So as I am sharing this with them, my grandpa spoke up and said something backhanded about how if I had been sober none of it would have happened anyway. His comment hurt, a lot. I have spent yearsyears blaming myself for what happened to me. That exact thought about my drunken state being the cause circles my head on a regular basis, but I am fighting like hell to find peace and be better. Im fighting for myself. His single comment really managed to hit right in my sore spot. I politely finished my dinner and helped clean up. I stopped by a meeting on my way home. Thats 2 in one day for me which is a first, but I am finding those rooms are my safe space to share my vulnerability. Today I learned I may not be able to do that with everyone, even my loved ones. Im not going to drink, because it wont take those words or my feelings about them away. Thanks for letting me vent SD friends, thankful for you. "

Thanksgiving was a bit difficult with the wine and bourbon flowing freely but as the family caterer, I was able to keep busy. I have not let the greater world know because there is still a tinge of shame in my admission that I cannot control alcohol. What has happened to me in the last few weeks has been a microcosm of my life. At prior forks in my life, I can try to go at it alone with my loneliness and anxiety, trying to control my drinking, and convinving myself to be ""normal"" rather than myself. Or I can admit that I don't have this down pat, that I need support from the people around me, and that some things like drinking are fully outside my control. My way has not been successful. I admit that fully. So at this fork in the road, I choose the other way. The one of interdependence, the one of vulnerability, and the one of being my fully flawed self. "

Shame at my past behavior, shame that something as benign as a beverage was enough for me to become someone I never wanted to be, and shame at my fear that I was really a monster. &amp;#x200B; Life without alcohol isn't easier. The heartbreak, the anxiety, the fears have such an acute pain to them but the vibrancy of the jokes, the hugs, the deep conversations you have with the people you love is worth staying for. Whereas life with alcohol is in black and white, life without it is in the highest resolution possible, the darkness is more opaque but the bright colors are vivid in a way I could never imagine. &amp;#x200B; To be sober is to make a decision daily to live in a world in which the opaqueness of the dark moments and the vividness of the brightness are something I have to sit with, just me. No social lubricant, no avoidance, no distraction. And no shame at how scary and uncomfortable that is. I am overwhelmed daily. &amp;#x200B; Last night I had such a moment of vulnerability, rejection, and sadness. But I am here, another day sober. No drink for distraction, no visit to a bar to find superficial human connection with someone else drunk on a Tuesday night, no need to escape. I have been laying the groundwork for this moment for a very long time. &amp;#x200B; The decision to stay, to be vulnerable and honest, to look my shame and fear in the eye, and to sit with my demons. To say I am scared that I ruined my life. To say I am not sure I am good enough and at the same time that I am too much. And to keep asking to be accepted fully both by myself and the people in my life. No distractions, no escape. Just me. &amp;#x200B; I am still here.

A few bad decisions caused by alcohol made me slip into a deep depression. I found the shame utterly unbearable. I was barely coping. I would wake up and cry multiple times a day Today I realised I was still letting the alcohol control me. The shame was colouring every part of my life, it was seeping into everything I said and did, like black ink in a pool of water. Wherever I turned all I could see was dark. I was fixated on it, on the idea I was a terrible person. That by hurting people, I was somehow wrong or broken or unfixable. I couldnt enjoy being sober because I was still so sad and fixated on what Id done when I was drunk. I spent three days making a pinata for my friends birthday and I still utterly hated myself. I still saw myself as worthless, despite my friend sending me a lovely message afterwards. My friend who I hurt by saying stupid things while drunk has forgiven me, and I still felt utter shame and wouldnt forgive myself for it. Well today after a month of wallowing, Ive decided I will no longer let the shame control me. That I will not let my addiction tell me who I am. Yes, I have made mistakes. I have fallen down in the dirt, but I chose to get back up again. I didnt have to get sober. I CHOSE to get sober. I choose every day not to drink. And with everyday I choose to be sober, I get to work on being a better person. I will still make mistakes when Im sober. I will still hurt people. I am human. BUT I will be in control of them.

But I still kept drinking. At month four I lost my job - which in part, was caused by my lack of motivation due to guess what? Binge drinking all weekend. When I lost my job, I thought I was fine, but without structure my breaks which were faulty at best, stopped working completely. The breaklines were cut. Everytime I drank, I never knew when I would career down the road and smash into the things in my life: I crashed into friendships, my relationship, my self-esteem. 50 days ago, I was finally done again. I had caused too much damage. For the first three weeks I wallowed in misery. I felt awful. I lived in perpetual shame. BUT I did the work. I started going to therapy again. I journaled constantly. I began focusing on other activities: hiking, reading, writing, volunteering, going to gigs. I watched these TED talks from Brene Brown on [vulnerability](URL and [shame](URL which honestly saved my life. I began to feel the emotions - the happiness, the sadness, the anger. I began to really feel them. I went out and danced until 3am totally sober, and had a blast. I started investing back into my relationship with my SO. I helped my friend who got sober just before me. I helped another friend who was feeling so low, and gave her hope, when she couldn't find any. AND in 50 days - I am starting a new job on Monday. I am moving into a house with a garden (so excited for a garden) in three weeks. I am more centred. I am grateful. While some part of me wishes that none of the bad stuff had happened, another part is glad. I have no excuse anymore to drink. I can't pretend that everything will be ok. I am able to admit that I am truly powerless over alcohol. But I have so much more power when sober. I may have lost things through alcohol, but in sobriety I am already regaining so much. Thanks for the support SD, even when I crawled back tail between my legs admitting I'd fucked up. I can't wait for the next 50 days. IWNDWYT."

108,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Celebrated 10 months recently,13,9hz2bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9hz2bv/celebrated_10_months_recently/,2018-09-22 21:40:43,"I used to relapse at the 6 month mark. Now I totally understand the disease and accept that abstinence is the best and only option for me. I enjoy my life much better sober, i know how to heal from old pain, grow from it and i learned how to create a new life one day at a time. With the help of therapy, AA (and learning from people who were more sober and more knowledgable than me) I was able to recover from binge-drinking one day at time. Every month gets easier. And thoughts of drinking are a mere thought not a incessant-obsessive craving anymore. And thats a miracle to me. The thought passes under 5 seconds because my life was more shitty than good when i drank. Now I 'get high' on life. I surround myself with sober cool people, higher quality partner selection, more respect and love for myself, less self-pity. My life was by no means easy - I had an incredibly difficult life as a young age. And it took 3 years of work to make recovery stick. But it sticks now. Once you know you are allergic to alcohol (aka. an alcoholic) you can accept, get help and choose abstinence. Unfortunately once you have the allergy, it becomes very difficult to moderate. In one way or another it catches up to you until you can't stop. My three relapses at the 6 month mark taught me that. When I replaced the empty space with an abundance of tools and major lifestyle adjustments and thinking patterns/behaviours - thats when i noticed the most substantial results. HELPING OTHER ALCOHOLICS helps ME stay sober. Millions of people are out there suffering - I would be a self-centered person if I didnt get help, clean up the wreckage of my self-sabotaging ways and help teach others how to stop the cycle too. And it feels amazing to help others who are suffering. Keep working hard at your recovery. You don't need to do it alone. No one should have to. The strangers I met in meetings are my new friends today. My life is much more happy, joyous and free because of SEVERAL SOLUTIONS I INCORPORATED into my life. Therapy, yoga/exercise, AA, a good doctor, a simpler job, letting go of drinking/smoking buddies, and building new relationships, staying away from bars and unhealthy people, learning to love and respect myself though countless self-help books. Watching psychology vids on youtube, letting myself grieve, cry, rest, relax. Taking a group cognitive behavioural therapy class (free), journalling, reading the big book, being honest with people, implementing strong boundaries with people etc. I have MULTIPLE solutions to my personal recovery program. Lying to myself while pouring ethonol into my body, soul and feelings wasn't one of them. It might have served me to numb my pain in the past. But eventually I learned that vulnerability is an act of courage. And courage/strength is something I knew I deserved. Trust me when I say - I have been through hell and back. Today I am happy to be fully aware and conscious enough to continue to get help/support when I need it. Im happy I am aware to make positive changes. Im happy I have finally healed - that I truly love and respect myself for everything I have overcome.

That same day I'd also decided to quit looking at porn and masturbating. This was another destructive addiction I'd been struggling with. I was going strong until a week ago I followed links I knew I shouldn't follow, and looked at images I shouldn't be, and I started edging. Thankfully I had the willpower to stop myself before finishing, and at that time I was proud of that accomplishment. But this was only the beginning of the end. Last night the same thing happened again and I stopped myself. In my anxiety riddled mind now I was worried whether that counted as a relapse or not. I read other people's similar stories and many did consider that a relapse. And just like that the switch was flipped (I realize now that I'd allowed it) and I said fuck it, the dopamine was already released, I might as well finish the job. And I am so sad I did. I feel fucking awful. Almost immediately felt nothing but regret and shame. And it's like this demon in me sees this vulnerability in my willpower and is now trying to claw me back in. I don't want to go back to that life. Even last night as I lay there, I kept saying to myself, you can't do this, you can't go back. You can't go back. I know this isn't r/pornfree or r/nofap, but addiction is still addiction, and I just need help staying sober. I'd go to a meeting right now if I didn't have to work. The damage is already done, I'd already reset my badge on those other subreddits. I just want to stay sober and not use that relapse as some flimsy justification. I feel as though I only have so much willpower left. When I gave in to that different addiction last night after fighting temptations, a war broke loose in my mind. I thought, you already broke the seal on one addiction, might as well break the others and then just quit them all at the same time again some day in October. How do you handle living in such uncertainty? How are you all so strong? How do you handle battling so many different addictions when one gives out, the others grow stronger? All I know is that I am sober right now and I want to stay that way. But my mind has such a sinister way of turning onto itself and I'm afraid of just saying fuck it, and heading right back to using. And I know I'd regret it so badly. This all or nothing, black and white mindstate I find myself in is the real villain. I know the recovery is a process, and that my ideas of purity or strictness are not realistic. All we have is today. Sorry for the rambling. I'm just barely hanging in there."

I know for me its just annoying the amount of explaining and vulnerability that goes into explaining why Im not drinking, but its much easier to say Im doing Whole 30. Anybody else dealing with sugar cravings and eating all the things after becoming sober? For those who dont know about Whole 30, its a program that claims to sort of reboot your metabolism. You cut out sugar, wheat, dairy, alcohol, legumes, and most additives.. You eat 3 big meals a day consisting of a palm sized portion of protein, thumb sized portion of fat, and fill the rest of the plate with vegetables. "

Yet, I feel its hard for me to meet people with whom I authentically connect. There are of course activities of all varieties  team sports, volunteer activities, gyms/clubs, or any other of the sorts of groups one might find on meetup (new to town, hiking, music, language, etc). Chess clubs. Dancing. And theyre all a good time. But I find that often when I leave, I didnt make any deeper connections. Take joining a gym/club as an example  Ill go, workout or engage in some activity, may even chat a few people up. But it usually doesnt lead to anything else. And the somewhat disheartening part is that its not that Im scared to ask them to grab a bite afterward. Its that I feel I dont often meet anyone with whom I would rather go grab a non-alcoholic drink than do something on my own. Possible contributing factors: - I am an introvert. A self-diagnosed INFJ for those who put any stake in Meyers-Briggs personality typing. So I definitely crave a lot of solo time. But that doesnt explain times when I wish I had more friends to call. - I have a relatively high need for cognition. My career is one that involves a lot of thinking and writing. I like talking about philosophy, or politics, or the latest pop neuroscience. And yet, I dont think of myself as the stereotypical nerd  I was never part of the dungeons and dragons crew. I like talking about Kevin Durants game winning shot last night or the latest episode of Atlanta. I really dont mean to degrade anyone  if anything, people who enjoy D&amp;D style role playing games probably have a healthier and more contented social life than me. Im just trying to paint an accurate picture and I think its true that we all associate more or less with various subcultures. - I am relatively sensitive for a guy. I tend to enjoy speaking with people who let their guard down, show some vulnerability. I couldnt care less about the latest 2019 car releases, particularly if the person you are engaging with isnt also interested in connecting on a more personal level. As a result, and I hate to generalize, but at least as self-reported data from my life, I tend to click with women much more easily than men. That said, I am a straight man who is in a committed relationship with a woman. She is supportive of my having friendships with women, but it tends to be more complicated to navigate than friendships with men. - Not sure how to phrase this last one, but I am a white male interested in issues of social/racial justice. I feel somewhat alienated by large swaths of institutional America (corporate life, country club culture, excessive materialism). And Im not part of a strong ethnic subculture. Im not classically religious. Appreciate the spirit of traditions like unitarianism/humanism, but often find that they are populated (no offense again!) by older people or, less frequently, married couples with young kids  again no reason not to be friends, but feels like we arent sharing similar life experiences. All of this adds up to feeling like I dont know where to find my people. Im a lot of contradictions, many of which maybe arent consistent or dont make sense and so are hard to find replicated in others. I know you dont need to find everything in one friend  can have a tennis buddy and a jazz friend etc. But feels like you do need someone with at least a certain critical mass of similar traits/tendencies/modes of being. I keep seeing articles about how men have an increasingly hard time making or keeping friends as they age. Or about how men in our culture are losing their sense of place. Maybe thats me? I guess if Im being completely honest, I probably do have a somewhat love avoidant personality type. Tend not to very easily firmly attach to people. And I am a younger brother who I think grew up as more of a follower than an initiator. So I am sure these things factor in as well. But please help! How did you find your people? How can I do the same? I really value the wisdom of the SD community  its helped me in many other ways. Would love for it to help me solve this. Im tired of going to one-off events and having a decent time. And of course Im not spending time at the bar these days. Would love to find my tribe of smart, culturally aware, empathic/vulnerable, justice-oriented men in the US. Where are you? Or am I going about this all wrong? Thanks for any help!"

I made it through Day 3 with your support. The support was unbelieveable. People I've never met, cheering for me, rooting me on, wanting what's best for me. It's a new feeling, and I'm not used to it. I'm used to bottling everything up and pretending to be perfect, and it really means a lot to me to show vulnerability and receive support and affirmation. But then came day 4. The guy I've been seeing for the past 3 months, who I'm head over heels for, came over. He doesn't know about my issue with drinking, and he brought some whiskey with him. He does know about my issues with trauma and PTSD and that I'm in therapy for it, and is super supportive. He wanted me to drink with him, and I didn't know how to tell him that I am trying to quit. I don't want him to know just how messed up I am, and how much I am trying to rebuild myself. It's embarrassing enough that he's seen me have panic attacks and crying jags - the last thing I want to do is to admit to him that I'm also a questionable alcoholic. I thought, 'okay, maybe I can just pour a tiny bit of whiskey in my glass and a ton of coke, and keep filling up the coke.' Nope. I didn't do that. I got drunk, and he went to bed before me. While I was cleaning up, I poured myself two more shots of whiskey. I passed out on my couch sitting up. He found me around 3am, and put me to bed. He was very nonjudgemental about me passing out. But I'm mortified. This isn't who I want to be. Why did I take those additional shots? We were done for the night. Why did I need to keep going? I hate myself right now. I'm a loser and I have no control when it comes to drinking. You all praised me on day 3, and I fucked it up on day 4. I feel like such a failure. Who am I to think I can be successful, happy, healthy, the person who goes to yoga and kickboxing instead of passing out on their couch sitting up. I want to be healthy so badly. But I don't value myself enough to. Boy, my therapist is really going to earn her money with me. How do I forgive myself for drinking again?"

When I first quit alcohol, she showed up within a couple of months and I was in love. Totally. Like we moved in together after a few months. And I was amazed. Sobriety brought me this amazing life so quickly. I was always so afraid to get into relationships, or even talk to women, and thought the booze was helping. It was the opposite, drinking kept me lonelier and more withdrawn from other people. So now this relationship has ended. And my memory is good enough to remember all the loneliness of my drinking days. I have no urge to drink, although I felt a little nervous while packing up her liquor. Would this sadness break my resolve? But instead of following the old path of numbness and intoxication, I called my friend and I talked to her. It really helped. And that vulnerability and connection was impossible with alcohol in my life. I am grateful for this relationship, I am grateful for my sobriety. I am also terribly sad and IWNDWYT."

I posted when I had two weeks and couldn't wait to be able to say I had 30 days, although I don't know what keeps happening to my badge... Anyway, two years ago I checked into rehab after a brutal rage and scary night with my gf. I checked myself out after 11 days because I wasn't ""one of those alcoholics"". I managed to stay dry until day 25 or something. Took me two more years and many more blackouts and moments of utter stupidity to realize I was ""one of those alcoholics"". So here's to 30 full days of sobriety and I'm never looking back. One of the things that finally caused me to put down the poison was the loss of a job after four days because I was having a panic attack due to being hung over. My left arm and hand was tingling and numb and I couldn't think straight. I had never felt anything like it before and thought I might need to go to the ER. I left my job to go have my gf ( a nurse) check me out and got fired for leaving. Glad I don't work for such an uncaring boss but it still sucks to have lost a job due to drinking. I had hoped to write that I have found a new job and my life is 100% better after 30 days. Sadly, I am still in search and being 43 and having stayed home with kids for 16 years helps very little in the competitive market I'm in. But as I sat one day feeling angry and disillusioned, I realized that this is what making amends is, this is what staring personal responsibility in the face feels like. I wasted so much time drinking rather than focusing on my career and furthering my skills. And this is why I got sober...so I can do just that and hope it's not too late to find that perfect job for me. To all of you, thank you so much for your honesty and vulnerability and your immense courage, sharing your struggles and successes has helped me so much in realizing that I am so blessed to have made this decision before rock bottom looks like a hospital bed or jail or the grave. I'll take a lost job and make sure it's my last! IWNDWYT!!"
117,vulnerability,stopdrinking,7 Months sober and it's not all awesome. It's mostly awesome...but I've been experiencing PAWS these past couple months. I hope they go away at some point.,9,91rzk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/91rzk4/7_months_sober_and_its_not_all_awesome_its_mostly/,2018-07-25 23:49:19,"I'm pretty much experiencing most of the PAWS symtoms, the one that scares me the most is ANHEDONIA. I've basically lost my ability to have fun. Nothing pumps me up right now :-( #1  UNSTABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOODS One of the most frequently noted symptoms of PAWS, and part of why this syndrome is often mistaken for depression, are major and uncontrollable swings in mood. This can happen intermittently in episodes that can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks before disappearing again. Sometimes, those suffering from PAWS who are experiencing these mood swings can appear to be exhibiting an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. #2  SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION The most affecting of these changes in mood are depressive symptoms, in which individuals experience an extreme and overt melancholy that can feel like an anchor tied around their necks. These symptoms can last only minutes or linger for days, with no apparent trigger behind them. This can be an understandable source of frustration, and even cause a relapse. #3  EXPERIENCING ANXIETY OR PANIC ATTACKS While depression is at one end of the mood-swing scale, anxiety and panic attacks are at the other. While these anxious feelings can be triggered by cravings and a reduced ability to handle stressors, similar to the depressive symptoms, there is no outside motivator required to cause anxiety or even something as severe as a panic attack. #4  ANHEDONIA Anhedonia is a term used to describe a condition in which someone has lost, either partially or entirely, the ability to experience pleasure. Anhedonia goes much further than just a loss of interest in activities and pursuits someone previously enjoyed and is often described by those experiencing it as the feeling that their ability to enjoy almost anything has been switched off. A typical symptom of withdrawal, those with PAWS are likely to suffer longer and more extreme bouts of Anhedonia, losing interest in not only hobbies or socializing, but also in relationships, sexual activity, and even basic desires like eating. #5  STRONG DRUG CRAVINGS Even if it is not the most common, perhaps the most expected symptom of PAWS are cravings for the substance that the individual was previously dependent on. While these cravings will eventually fade in strength, they can still sometimes persist for long periods of time after someone has achieved sobriety. Cravings can be extremely problematic, either serving as a trigger for other symptoms of Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome or putting an individual at risk of a relapse. #6  POOR COORDINATION AND CLUMSINESS Individuals experiencing Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome will often exhibit a general loss of physical coordination, including dizziness, slowed reflexes, poor balance, and issues with hand-eye coordination. Because of this, they will often be seen tripping or bumping into things, dropping things, or spilling food or drinks. Apart from simply being the manifestation of another PAWS symptom, a secondary reason behind this lack of coordination is distraction caused by comorbid feelings of depression and disinterest. #7  DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP Similar to becoming clumsier due to being distracted by feelings of depression, those suffering from PAWS will also usually have a great deal of difficulty getting to sleep at night. This can be due to feelings of anxiety and restlessness, as well as a lack of stimuli to keep them from focusing on the negative psychological symptoms that are characteristic of Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome. #8  SLEEP DISTURBANCES Unfortunately, even once someone experiencing PAWS manages to fall asleep, theyre unlikely to stay that way. Individuals will often have their sleep interrupted, either from withdrawal cravings, unusually vivid and unpleasant dreams, or altered sleeping patterns causing them to wake up for no particular reason. Because of these disturbances, people with PAWS will often oscillate between going as long as several days without sleeping to sleeping for days at a time once their exhaustion has caught up with them. #9  INABILITY TO CONCENTRATE OR THINK CLEARLY Similar to the loss of coordination, those with PAWS can have difficulty focusing or thinking clearly due to the distraction from cravings or feelings of intense depression. The lack of sleep can also cause them to struggle with concentration, creating a vicious cycle, as their minds inability to focus on something other than the negative feelings manifested by PAWS is part of what makes sleep seem so impossible. It becomes quite difficult to concentrate for anyone experiencing Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome. #10  THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE OR SUICIDE ATTEMPTS If the depressive symptoms of post-acute-withdrawal syndrome have become frequent and severe enough, they can progress to a stage where the individual can begin to have suicidal thoughts or ideations, and may even make an attempt to commit suicide. If this is the case, professional help should be immediately sought to ensure the individuals safety and help to treat them. Thoughts of or attempts at suicide should always be taken seriously. #11  INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO STRESS As part of post-acute-withdrawal syndrome, individuals often become extremely vulnerable to stress and situations that might provoke feelings of stress. Like a raw nerve or an exposed wound, even the smallest contact with a stressful situation can be enough to overwhelm them and cause an outburst. These symptoms are only magnified by the presence of mood swings and an increased vulnerability to panic attacks. #12  INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO PAIN In addition to becoming more sensitive to stress and anxiety, individuals experiencing post-acute-withdrawal syndrome will also frequently exhibit increased sensitivity to physical pain. While it decreases a persons capacity to feel joy, PAWS can conversely heighten their capacity for pain, making even the most negligible injuries feel excruciatingly painful. #13  INTENSIFIED EMOTIONS While the symptoms of depression and Anhedonia can make those suffering from PAWS feel numb or empty inside, the other extreme is also possible: namely, an intense overflow of emotional feelings. Individuals with Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome will often exhibit the most extreme level of any given emotion. This can mean becoming overly excitable when happy or excessively confrontational when angry, which can occur in very close proximity to each other if the individual is also experiencing sudden shifts in mood."

120,vulnerability,stopdrinking,First time having sex and emotional intimacy since quitting,3,8u3vs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8u3vs3/first_time_having_sex_and_emotional_intimacy/,2018-06-27 07:28:11,"This weekend was the first time I'd had sex with somebody and felt any real emotional intimacy since I'd quit drinking. Me and this person used to date some years back, things were fairly serious, but we hadn't seen each other in a long time. I have had some vulnerability and emotional closeness with some new friends and folks in AA, but those don't really compare. Even when I was drinking, I had sex sober, but I was always in withdrawal at some level. Loneliness was both a large cause of my drinking and a result of it. Self-isolation is a dangerous tendency to have, it turns out. In AA they are always harping that you shouldn't date in the first year of sobriety, and I understand the wisdom behind that even if I don't feel particularly compelled to follow it. After all, if one's life is ""unmanageable"" in Jan, it's unlikely come March that they'll be able to be and remain healthy in something emotionally charged as a romantic relationship. I had been anxious that doing this would somehow result in my brain being filled with thoughts of moderation or going back to drinking, but that hasn't been the case at all. I didn't really think that would happen, but other people with more time than me made it sound like a guarantee. If anything, this weekend was an affirmation of the many benefits that come from sobriety. Drinking me would never have done the myriad of things required to make this happen. She was very glad and supportive of me working to stay sober and she doesn't really drink but for non-addiction-related reasons. I felt some loss of control, as I always did with her and do with any romantic interaction, but it felt much more manageable than it ever did when I was drinking. The good news is that this person lives about 10 hours away, so I don't have to worry about falling into something that will threaten my sobriety, and I think that enabled me to be a lot more vulnerable with her than I would normally have been with somebody in a similar context. I feel a peace and serenity I haven't felt in years. Vulnerability feels amazing. Just wanted to share that. No real ""point"" to this story, just wanted to tell somebody, I consider you all here my closest friends, which is maybe a little weird, but I think it's probably because I'm much more able to be vulnerable with strangers on the internet than people in real life, though it's something I'm working on. Thank you all for listening, for your wisdom, and for sharing this journey through sobriety. I am very grateful to each and every one of you from the people with 10 hours to the people with 10 years, and even those of you who I know are lurking, still drinking, and wondering how you'll ever manage life without alcohol.

Got to penalties in the England game last night (9.30pm) and my best friend had been messaging me with tales of downing a bottle of vino watching the match. I had managed juice - but at penalties I went to the fridge. Half a bottle of white wine that my husband had left from a few days ago. I poured a glass - took 2 mouthfuls then a moment of clarity and I stopped drinking - told myself I didn't need it and threw the remainder of the glass and the rest of the bottle down the sink. Put the kettle on and celebrated the football with a cup of tea. This has reminded me that there is no 'safe time' or 'safe situation'. I had been super proud that the wine had sat in my fridge for a couple of days and I just ignored it, but today, although I am not beating myself up, I am more fragile about all our vulnerability as we go through early days.

I didnt know that when I quit drinking Id have to sort through so many bad memories, sit through so many intense emotions, or that Id come face to face with my character defects. I also had to see a psychiatrist and get on some medicine to treat an underlying mood disorder to support my sobriety. I found a great AA group and I found a way to make it work for me. I make myself share every week. I even have my eye on a sponsor! There is a great line in the opening of a podcast I love called The Mental Illness Happy Hour, which I feel is very applicable: Through vulnerability comes healing. I set out to deal with this issue that I felt was holding me back in life, but now sobriety feels like a lifestyle that I have to protect for the rest of my days on this earth.

123,vulnerability,stopdrinking,"Alexander, the Great Alcoholic",0,8y5eft,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8y5eft/alexander_the_great_alcoholic/,2018-07-12 11:22:06,"Allison Weintraub April 20, 2003 Although Alexander the Great was a Macedonian, who were a people who were notorious for drinking, as well as a devoted member of the cult of Dionysus, Alexander spurned the over consumption of alcohol early on in his life. However, with his rise to power came an increasingly frequent consumption and abuse of alcoholic beverages, abuse that finally resulted in his demise. As his pothos drove him to unimaginable conquest and power, a certain void of loneliness developed in him that could only be filled with a dependence on alcohol and its mood altering effects. As Alexanders use of alcohol amplified, his mood and temperament became progressively more violent and unstable, which caused his companions to fear him and the repercussions of his anger. During the last half of his journey, alcohol played a major role in the decisions, actions, and frame of mind of Alexander during his campaign. Alexander came from Macedonia, a place where the consumption of alcohol was not only common, but was a daily activity practiced by all. The Greeks, who were cousins and neighbors of the Macedonians, diluted their wine and drank in moderation, were very scornful of Macedonian drinking practices. To them, moderation was the hallmark of the civilized,(OBrien p 6) and the way the Macedonians drank could only be described as barbaric. Macedonians did not dilute their wine, and drank to get drunk, sometimes when dining even before their meal was served. In Macedonian culture, intemperance was sign of strength and manhood. Drinking contests were a common form of entertainment, although in some cases the victor would end up dead from his overindulgence.[1] One theory among scholars, such as John Maxwell OBrien, who study the role of alcohol in the life of Alexander, is that Alexanders drinking was largely due to his being a member of the cult of Dionysus, who was the God of wine. Throughout OBriens book, Dionysus is often blamed for a large part of Alexanders apparent over consumption of alcohol, and the book The Invisible Enemy, is aptly named to show the negative influence of Alexanders devotion to the God on his alcohol consumption. However, one reviewer of OBriens book, Waldemar Heckel, finds OBriens focus on Dionysus to be distracting from the truth behind Alexanders possible alcoholism. He claims OBrien, with his desire to link Alexander with his mythical past strains the evidence and finds connections everywhere.[2] I tend to agree with Heckel, and feel that this is a topic that strays to far into the divine and mystical nature of Alexander to have much relevance to my topic. Although it is an issue that has importance in understanding the nature of Alexander, it would impede rather than support the topic of this paper.[3] Because Alexander came from a society where alcohol was consumed regularly and in such high quantities, and was a member of a cult that worshipped the God of wine as well, it is difficult to assess whether Alexander drank more than the common Macedonian. It is also impossible to determine whether or not he was unquestionably an alcoholic, given the fact that he would be judged by modern standards and it almost unfeasible to do so given the difference of cultural norms and practices between antiquity and the present day. Some scholars, such as John Maxwell OBrien, have tried to view the life and actions of Alexander through the pretense that every decision he made was through the veil of intoxication. Yet this approach to understanding the life of Alexander through one aspect of his being is unfair, and leaves out a big part of who Alexander was. It is not just or historically accurate to take every antidote of Alexanders life and try to prove its relevance to his possible alcoholism.[4] Rather it is much more useful to look at certain incidents of Alexanders life in which the presence of alcohol seems to have greatly effected his actions. Furthermore, while it is not viable to undoubtedly conclude that Alexander was an alcoholic, it is possible to study his actions and behaviors as well as the presence of alcohol as recorded by the primary sources to try to determine how much alcohol affected his life. These behavioral characteristics can then be studied and compared to what contemporary researchers know about alcoholism, and a hypothesis can be drawn about whether the manners of Alexander was similar to the manners of someone who in our society would be deemed an alcoholic. Contemporary psychologists and researchers of addiction have studied alcohol dependence and struggled to define it as one encompassing problem. However, because this disease manifests itself in many different ways and through a variety of people, no one definition can be used to describe alcoholism. Instead, researchers rely on a set of characteristics of alcoholism based on a collection of signs, symptoms and behaviors that help us make the diagnosis.[5] Researchers have however identified two types of alcoholics. These two kinds of alcoholics are known as type one and type two alcoholics. Type one alcoholics usually develop problems with alcohol later in their lives, after the age of 25. After their drinking problem becomes prevalent, type ones usually cannot abstain from drinking if they wish. These people are usually non-violent and non-confrontational when under the influence, and often regret their drinking when sober. Type one alcoholics tend to be low profile people, and use alcohol to ward off negative feelings. Genetics only play a moderate role in development of type one alcoholics, and ones environment has a high influence on a type ones drinking escalation. Type two alcoholics exhibit very different symptoms and behavioral characteristics than type one alcoholics. Where type one alcoholics usually develop their addiction later in life, type two alcoholics become addicted to drinking early in life, usually before the age of 25. Where types ones are docile when drinking, type twos are often violent, impulsive, and aggressive when under the influence, and experience a psychological loss of control when intoxicated. Type twos can often abstain from drinking when they feel the need to, and use alcohol to create positive feelings. Type twos usually have high profile personalities, rarely feel guilt or anxiety about their drinking, and most type two alcoholics are male. It has also been found that genetics plays a large role and environmental factors a small one in the development of a type twos alcoholism.[6] The characteristics exhibited by a type two alcoholic are all character attributes that Alexander the Great exhibited frequently throughout his lifetime. Through the sources, we know that he was often violent and impulsive, especially in battle. His father, Philip was also known to be drunk often, so genetics probably played a role in Alexanders drinking problem. If Alexander was indeed a type two alcoholic, his environment, that of a place where drinking was part of daily life, would not have a great impact on his choice to drink. Although the sources record instances of Alexander regretting some of his actions that were done when he was believed to be drinking, not one of them ever records him having feelings of guilt or worry about his drinking itself.[7] I intend to assert through historical evidence that Alexander exhibited clear characteristics of Type Two alcoholic, and this disease of total personality,[8] did indeed have a great affect on his actions and behavior while on campaign. Philip, Alexanders father, is known to have been one of the greatest drunks of antiquity. Peter Green describes Philip as a strong, sensual heavily bearded man who was much addicted to drink, women, and (when the fancy took him,) boys.[9] Philip, who was notorious for his drinking, often gave protracted drinking parties, engaged in drinking bouts, and got drunk with predicted regularity.[10] Demosthenes, an ancient Athenian orator, once even described Philip as a sponge. However, Philip was neither a violent or impulsive drunk. He favored drinking after great victories, or sometimes even before the battle. He could sober up pretty quickly when necessary, and could take criticism and laugh at his sometimes foolish drunken behavior with ease. It seems that Philip favored the pomp and celebration that defined an ancient drinking party, or symposium, and often liked to surround himself with individuals who enjoyed the celebration of drink as much as he did.[11] Assuming that Philip was indeed an alcoholic, the role of genetics is something that has to be considered when trying to establish whether Alexander was an alcoholic. It has been proven through many scientific studies that alcoholism is sometimes passed through genetics. It has been found that, Type one alcoholics show little heritability, whereas type two alcoholics have shown substantial father-to-son transmission of alcoholism and antisocial characteristics.[12] One study done in 1981 in Sweden looked at adopted children whose biological parents were alcoholics but whose adoptive parents were not. It was found that a larger percentage of these children became alcoholic themselves than would be seen in the general population.[13] Even children who had been raised by their adoptive parents from birth still had a high occurrence of alcoholism. For these children, who are mostly type two alcoholics, their genetics played a much larger role in the development of their alcoholism than their environment did.[14] James Graham, the author of a book entitled The Secret History Of Alcoholism, which explores the nature of alcoholism and its effect on people, asserts that We know that it is transmitted genetically; not through the mind or the environment but through the body chemistry...one becomes an alcoholic because one is biologically vulnerable, and tests this vulnerability by drinking.[15] If Alexander was indeed a type two alcoholic, living in a culture where overindulgence in drink was common would have had much less of an affect on the development of his addiction than his relation to Philip would have. The sources agree that Alexander the Great thoroughly disapproved of extreme drunkenness as a young man. Plutarch tells us In spite of his vehement and impulsive nature, he showed little interest in the pleasures of the senses and indulged in them only with great moderation.[16] He especially held great disdain for his father Philips often-apparent drunkenness. Relations between father and son were strained anyway, and tensions surrounding competition between the two as well as the issue of the inheritance of Philips throne often caused their tenuous relationship to become even shakier. One such incident that echoes not only the fragile relationship between Philip and Alexander, but also the contempt Alexander held for his fathers often intoxicated state, is the wedding of Philip and Cleopatra. Philip had taken numerous wives either than Olympias, Alexanders mother, but this marriage proved to be a particularly uncomfortable situation for all involved. Philip knew that marrying Cleopatra would be a smart political move that would unite Macedonia through marriage ties. Attalus, Cleopatras uncle, was a popular general, and an excellent ally for Philip to have. Furthermore, with a new united Macedonia in mind, and a new heir to rule it, Philip openly accused Olympias, who he had long been estranged from, of adultery. By doing so, he put Alexanders legitimacy to the throne into question.[17] In addition, it has been claimed by Satyrus that Philip, unlike his other wives who he married for purely political reasons, had fallen in love with Cleopatra, which further insulted Olympias.[18] Plutarch agrees that Cleopatra was a girl with whom Philip had fallen in love with whom he decided to marry, and that the domestic strife that resulted from Philips various marriages and love affairsled to bitter clashes and accusations between father and son.[19] The wedding party saw the collision of all the tensions between father and son explode into a near devastating situation. Alexander attended the wedding feast, without the company of his scorned mother. He took the honorary place as Philips son right across from him, and made a remark about the deceit he felt was being imposed upon his mother. Finally, after a great deal of wine was drunk,[20] Attalus, Cleopatras uncle, rose to give a speech. During this obviously pointed insult at Alexander, Attalus implored the Macedonians to pray to the gods that the union of Philip and Cleopatra might bring forth a legitimate heir to the throne.[21] Alexander, understanding the implications of this insult immediately, threw his drinking cup at Attulas head. Philip, rose without delay, and in his drunken confusion and anger drew his sword on Alexander but fortunately for them both he was so overcome with drink and with rage that he tripped and fell headlong.[22] If Philip had not been so overcome by wine, he most likely would have run Alexander through. However, Alexander, still intact and seemingly quite sober, could only look at his father with great disdain, remarking Here is the man who was making ready to cross from Europe to Asia, and who cannot even cross from one table to another without losing his balance.[23] It is clear that Alexander is making a clear reference to Philips intoxication, and is viewing his fathers drunkenness as a fault and a weakness. Alexander was only sixteen when this incident occurred, and had not yet met the demons that plagued his father. Despite his early disrespect for intoxication, Alexander seems to have undergone a transformation or metamorphosis,[24] as he grew older and became more and more powerful. In most type twos, alcoholism develops early in life, usually by the age of twenty five. By the time Alexander was twenty five years old, he had already achieved greater glory through conquest than most men achieve in their lifetimes. However, with power often comes mental unrest. All the primary sources agree that Alexander, in his later years, was enjoying his wine a little too much. In book five of Quintus Curtius Rufus History Of Alexander, Curtius praises the many attributes of Alexanders character, but goes on to relate how they were marred by his inexcusable fondness for drink.[25] Even Arrian, who is often known to defend Alexanders actions, comments on how Alexanders drinking had become another innovation in drink too, he now tended in barbaric excess.[26] Alexander was also known to host uproarious symposiums in his later years. For Alexander, the Symposium offered an arena in which Alexander could critically measure the usefulness and loyalty of others while eliciting responses that would assure him of his own worthiness.[27] The symposium offered Alexander a chance to get some insight into the minds of his companions, as well as offering a sort of bonding that could only come through celebration and intoxication. This is a drastic change from the Alexander of ten years earlier, who openly thumbed his nose at his fathers own penchant for drink. The year 330 BC saw one of the earliest manifestations of Alexanders metamorphosis from ridiculer of intoxication to destructive lover of drink. During this year, Alexander entered Persepolis, one of the grandest and most decadent cities of the Persian Empire. Persepolis was not only filled with innumerable works of art, but was a Holy City, akin to Mecca or Jerusalem, and equally rich in solemn rich associations.[28] However, despite, or maybe because of the riches that filled Persepolis, Alexander let his men sack the city, a privilege they had been denied earlier at Susa and Babylon. After doing so, Alexander left the city for the field, but returned to the great city in a months time, in full celebration of his victories. What happened next is an issue that not only the ancient sources but most modern Alexander scholars have debated over for centuries. Persepolis was burned to the ground, but the motives, reasons, and causality of the burning has never been agreed upon. The first story of the incident, as recorded by Quintus Curtius Rufus, Plutarch, and Diodorus, claim that the burning was the result of drunken revelry turned bad. These sources agree that Alexander and his friends were celebrating his victories in true Macedonian fashion by having a symposium, where as usual, the wine ran freely. Soon, they were joined by a number of courtesans, the most famous an Athenian who was named Thais. In the words of Diodorus, While they were feasting and the drinking was far advanced, as they began to be drunken a madness took possession of the minds of the intoxicated guests.[29] According to these sources, Thais, in her drunken state, rose and gave a stirring speech imploring Alexander to destroy the city by burning it to the ground, in retribution for the similar injustice the Persians had done to Athens when they had conquered Greece. Quintus Curtius Rufus tells us that As the drunken whore gave her opinion on a matter of extreme importance, one or two who were the worse for drink agreed with herthey were all excited by the wine, and so got up, when drunk, to burn the city which they had spared while under arms.[30] Alexander, encouraged by wine and Thais, indeed took up a torch and lit the first flame that would destroy one of the most magnificent cities in the East. The other argument of what occurred at Persepolis is based on the reports of the incident as recorded by Arrian. He tells us that the burning of Persepolis was a calculated decision, and nowhere does he mention the symposium and drunken revelry the other sources agree took place before the incident. Instead he asserts that Alexander intended to burn the city down, though this act was against the advice of ParmenioAlexanders answer was that he wished to punish the Persians for their invasion of Greece.[31] Arrian claims that Parmenio advised Alexander that it would be foolish to burn his own property,[32] but Alexander was so intent on revenge for the wrongdoings done to Greece that he ignored Parmenio and exacted his retribution. It is difficult to argue with certainty about what actually happened at Persepolis, whether it was the result of Alexanders apparent type two destructive alcoholic nature, or a calculated plot of revenge. Yet, most of the evidence suggests that this destruction was an accident fueled by alcohol. For one, since all the sources but one agree that the symposium did take place and did have an effect on Alexanders actions, it is most likely that this version of the story holds some truth. This does not necessarily mean that the story is true, for these sources might have all gotten their information from one common source. However, since the story exists in the first place, and since these three sources all deem it to be true, it probably has some credibility. Furthermore, the only source to disagree, Arrian, is a primary source who is known by scholars to romanticize and be very forgiving of the darker side of Alexander. As OBrien states Arrians brief treatment of Alexanders stay in Persepolis may reflect the historians own discomfort with what transpired there.[33] However, even Arrian agrees that Alexander did not show good sense in this action.[34] Another dynamic that points to the burning being a result of a drunken accident are the reactions of Alexanders troops once the fire had started. Quintus Curtius Rufus tells of how The army, encamped not far from the city, caught site of the fire and, thinking it accidental, came running in a body to help.[35] If Alexander had been planning to burn the city all along, he would have most likely informed his own men beforehand, in order to keep them out of harms way as well as to help facilitate his plan. OBrien concurs that It remains difficult to defend the thesis that Alexanders actions at Persepolis were premeditatedKnown as a meticulous planner, Alexander would have taken the necessary precautions to minimize the chance of injury to himself and others.[36] Additionally, if Alexander were intending to completely destroy the city through means of fire, he would have most likely done so when his troops had ransacked the place one month earlier. If the burning was a deliberate act of revenge, he would have told his troops that they had full liberties of destruction during the sacking. This way, his troops would have been aware of what was going on, and the destruction would have been complete, swift, and absolute, which would have been a more effective way of punishing the Persians. Despite all the evidence for alcohol being a major factor in the destruction of Persepolis, most Alexander scholars continue to struggle with the disagreement of the sources about what happened at Persepolis. The most effective way to deal with the conflicting stories is to find a middle ground as to what really happened. Perhaps Parmenio did indeed warn Alexander not to destroy Persepolis, but as we have seen before, Alexander often ignored his generals advice. Furthermore, it is probable that Alexander was already under the influence when Parmenio gave that advice, and for his own reasons Arrian chose to leave the story of the symposium and aftermath out of his own version. As Mary Renault, an Alexander scholar, has concluded Parmenios objections are no doubt historically true. He may have even been reminding Alexander of intentions which he himself had expressed at soberer moments. On the whole, it is not hard to conclude that, it seemed like a good idea at the time.[37] Following the line of Renaults argument, the evidence seems to affirm that the burning of Persepolis was indeed an accident stimulated alcohol, and that Arrian chose to omit this fault of Alexanders for his own purposes. Another incident where Alexander showed extreme aggression and destruction when alcohol was being consumed was in the Autumn of 328, only two year after the destruction of Persepolis[38] Alexander and his troops were in Maracanda, and the heat and growing animosity between Alexanders Macedonian troops and his new Persian courtiers spurned short tempers.[39] Maracanda sweltered dustily under a burning sun. Everyone, Alexander included, had begun to drink rather more than was good for them.[40] One night, a celebration was held most likely to honor Alexanders friend and soldier, Cleitus the Black, a man who had once saved Alexander life[41], on his appointment as governor of Bactria. Pretty soon the banquet degenerated into the usual uproarious drinking party.[42] Alexander soon began to boast of his awesome achievements, and court flatterers excelled themselves in praise of Alexander and the denigration of his father.[43] Cleitus who was already annoyed at Alexanders growing orientalism, found these remarks, as well as the extreme sycophantism of the Persian flatterers, and the unkind words about Philip, very upsetting. The sources disagree as to what was actually said by whom, but according to Bosworth, this inconsistence is largely due to the fact that the very nature of things must have been imperfectly recollected by participants after they regained sobriety.[44] Source disagreement over authentic words aside, it is believed that Cleitus defended Philip and remarked that Alexander could not have achieved his greatness without the Macedonian soldiers. By now, tempers on both sides were high, and soon the old guard and the Persian soldiers were engaged in a great debate. It seems that these issues, of orientalism, sycophancy, and the general discomfort of Alexanders Macedonian troops as they moved farther and farther away from their home, were matters that were on many peoples minds. Bosworth reminds us that We cannot penetrate beneath the evidence of the sources, that Cleitus had been alienated by the increasing oriental despotism at court[and] his combativeness fortified by alcohol, he gave expression to the general disquiet.[45] Because Cleitus was drunk, and his temper fired up, he was able to say what others might have feared to speak of in more soberer circumstances. What happened next was surely the result of rage fueled by too much wine. Quintus Curtius Rufus tells us that by this time Alexanders temper was such that even sober he could hardly have controlled it.[46] Both men exchanged more drunken angry words. Alexander, now beyond any sense, looked for his sword, which had wisely been removed by one of his men, and instead threw an apple at Cleitus. The two men were finally separated but unfortunately met up again outside the tent, where Cleitus recited some provoking lines from Euripides play Andromache.[47] This was the breaking point for Alexanders anger, and in his drunken and angry state he seized a spear from one of his guards, faced Cleitus as he was drawing aside the curtain to the doorway, and ran him through.[48] Both Arrian and Plutarch defend the actions of Alexander in this incident. Plutarch says that it was misfortune rather than a deliberate act, and that it was Cleituss evil genius which took advantage of Alexanders anger and intoxication to destroy him.[49] Arrian reiterates that Alexander was deeply hurt, by Cleitus comments and that he himself strongly deprecate Cleitus unseemly behavior to his sovereign, and for Alexander I feel pity, in that he showed on this occasion the slave of anger and drunkenness.[50] While both sources try to absolve Alexander of his guilt, they both also admit that Alexanders actions in this situation were greatly influenced by his intoxication. Although both men were angry and drunk, only Alexander turned his rage and intoxication into physical violence. Type two alcoholics are known for their extremely aggressive and destructive behavior when under the influence. Many researchers, such as R.O. Pihl and David Lemarquand of the psychology department at McGill University, have concluded through extensive study that The consumption of an intoxicating dose of alcohol increases the likelihood of violent behavior[and that] the consumption of alcoholic drinks, typically in large quantities, occurs prior to and in close temporal proximity to most forms of violence.[51] In both the burning of Persepolis and the killing of Cleitus, Alexander exhibited extreme levels of violence and destruction when under the influence. Type two alcoholics are known for experiencing a psychological loss of control while drinking, and often are arrested for getting into fights and other violent situations when drunk.[52] Alexanders combination of drinking and aggression could be an indication of his possible type two alcoholism. James Graham writes about the problem with type two alcoholics, how their alcoholism drives them to seek positions of power, and how this power is often abused because of their aggressive nature. He writes, A young alcoholics thirst for power is never quenched by mere success. The sick need for ego satisfaction that puts them on a life long power trip also causes them to abuse power.[53] Graham asserts that alcoholism can influence a person even before they are actually drinking, that this inherent disease inflates the ego at an early age and the inflated ego influences the selection of a career.[54] On of the main characteristics of a type two alcoholic is that they exhibit high profile and novelty seeking personalities.[55] Could this drive for power and success fueled by alcoholism have contributed to Alexanders unrelenting pothos? Graham believes that Alexander was indeed a type two alcoholic, and this disease drove him to unimaginable conquest. He writes, Alexander the Great was an alcoholic. The same alcoholism-created egotism that led him to murder trusting subordinatesalso drove Alexander to conquer the world.[56] Although Alexander did show clear sign of type two alcoholism, and this disease probably did have an effect on his power drive, it is narrow minded to believe that Alexander was only driven by his alcoholism. The character of Alexander is one of extreme complexity, and to pass off his pothos as a result of only alcoholism would be in bad judgment. There are too many other factors that might have contributed to his love of conquest.[57] However, while alcoholism is most likely not the only reason behind his motivation to conquer the world, it might have indeed have had an influence on his thirst for power. Remorse is an emotional response that has often been associated with alcoholics. While it is true that type one alcoholics often feel guilty about their drinking, this is not the case for most type twos. In fact, type two alcoholics have a low frequency of guilt and fear about [their] alcoholism.[58] However, the sources agree that Alexander showed extreme remorse after both the burning of Persepolis and the killing of Cleitus. Quintus Curtius Rufus claims that both Alexander and his men regretted the burning of Persepolis. He tells us The Macedonians were ashamed that a city of such distinction had been destroyed by their king during a drunken orgyAs for Alexander, it is generally agreed that, when sleep brought him back to his senses after his drunken bout, he regretted his actions.[59] Even Plutarch, who cant seem to make up his mind about whether the burning of Persepolis was accidental or calculated, does agree, Alexander quickly repented and gave orders for the fire to be put out.[60] Alexander shows similar signs of remorse almost immediately after he slaughters Cleitus. Arrian asserts,  When the deed was done, Alexander immediately felt its horror.[61] Arrian also states that some sources claim that Alexander tried to kill himself over his anguish by falling upon his own spear, but whether this antidote holds truth or not, the sources do agree that Alexander retired to his room and there he spent the rest of the night and the whole of the following day sobbing in agony of remorse.[62] It is obvious Alexander felt immediate and extreme remorse about both incidents. Yet, we know that remorse was a common characteristic of Alexanders, even when he was not drinking. For instance, when Alexander destroyed Thebes in 335 B.C.,[63] it later came back to haunt him as one of the worst psychological errors of his time,[64] that he regretted as some of the most painful experiences of in his life.[65] The remorse that Alexander felt about the destruction of Thebes is the same kind of regret Alexander exhibited over the drunken destruction of Persepolis and the killing of Cleitus. Because it seem to be the nature of Alexander to have feelings of repentance over his actions regardless if they involved drinking, and because type two rarely have feelings of remorse about their drinking, his apparent alcoholism probably had little to do with his regretful nature. It seems to be more of aspect of his character in general, than a facet of his alcoholism. On June 11, 323 B.C. the man who had conquered most of the known world fell ill and died. His death has been much debated by scholars and sources alike. Alexander became ill, and spent the next few days fighting a high fever, which finally killed him a short while later. Plutarch, Arrian, and Diodorus all attribute his death to poisoning. According to them, Aristotle, Alexanders old tutor prepared the poison, which was then transported to Babylon by Cassander, Antipaters son. Then Ioulus, another one of Antipiters sons, administered the poison to Alexander, which was possibly stored in an asss hoof.[66] This claim, which is recorded in the diaries of Alexanders last days, was up until recently dismissed as propaganda. Many believe that this account was written by Perdiccas, one of Alexanders commanders, as an attempt to indict Antipater, a long time foe of Perdiccas. However, to some scholars, such as Brian Bosworth, holding Perdiccas accountable for the false accusations of poisoning seems implausible simply because of the fact Too many of Perdiccas close associates are indicted by name as parties to the poisoning, and If the documentis the work of Perdiccas' party, it was framed in a remarkably counter-productive fashion.[67] Other men such as the regent Polyperchon have been accused as creator of this supposed piece of fiction. However, controversy surrounds his probability of being the orchestrater of this poisoning account as well.[68] Even more so, it is also argued that There is, likely the story, no substantial evidence which supports the account and to go beyondthe traditional explanation of fever is mere speculation.[69] On the other hand, some scholars have begun to assert that there is sufficient evidence available to support the account of poisoning. Both Antipater and Aristotle[70] had animosity for Alexander for various reasons, and both men greatly disapproved of Alexanders growing orientalism. Recently, R.D. Milns, a biographer of Alexander, has written about the similarities of Alexanders final illness to strychnine poisoning. This type of poison is easy to get and can be kept for a long period, possibly even in the hoof of a mule. Even more so, it is best disguised in uncut wine, which is how it is believed Ioulus might have administered the poison. Another theory surrounding Alexanders death is that he died of some disease that he got on his journey. Malaria and pleurisy are two diseases proposed that fit the symptoms he exhibited in his final days.[71] It is very possible that Alexander picked up one of these diseases on his journey, and his immune system, weakened by years of physical and mental abuse, could not sufficiently fight it off. Alexanders increasing frequent consumption of alcohol has also been contributed to the cause of his death. Although, his apparent alcoholism is rarely thought to be the only cause of his demise, it is often attributed to the breakdown of his mental and physical health. Most of the sources record Alexander participating in numerous drinking parties in the days before he became very ill and perished. The king was now as often as drunk as sober.[72] His best friend and alter ego Hephaestion, had died from a fever very similar to the one Alexander was about to experience a short while earlier, and was known to have drank excessively anyway, despite the doctor s orders.[73] Alexander was heartbroken by the death of his best friend, but Plutarch tells us he set aside his grief, and allowed himself to indulge in a number of drinking parties.[74] Diodorus tells of how Alexander was called on by one of his friends, Medius, to take part in a drinking party, where he drank much unmixed wine in commemoration of the death of Heracles, andfilling a huge beaker, downed it at a gulp, where he instantly shrieked aloud as if smitten by a violent blow.[75] It appears that Alexander was drinking quite a bit in his final days, and this consumption of alcohol was obviously aggravating his body and having a negative impact on his health. As Peter Green declares In either case, advanced alcoholism, combined with the terrible wound he sustained in India, had finally lowered even his iron resistance to the point where he could no longer hope to survive.[76] Alexanders frequent drinking bouts obviously aggravated his condition, and while his alcoholism probably did not kill him itself, the effects it had on his health most definitely hastened his demise. In order to understand the change in Alexander, from healthy youth who could bend the world to his wishes, to feared and paranoid abusive drunk, one must first understand the internal workings of Alexanders mind. Alexander had conquered most of the known world, but in turn the world had claimed him as its victim. For a decade or more his body had been cruelly overloaded, his mind for much longer. [77] His pothos continued to drive him to relentless feats of conquest that could never be satisfied, for Alexander there was always more to conquer. Alexander would have tried to conquer the world if his men had not refused to go on. Yet, as he advanced farther and farther Eastward, his mental stability began to break down. He began to assert himself as a God, despite apparent misgivings of his companions. While at first he might have made this claim as a political move[78], it is clear that as time went on he truly did believe in his divine existence. Even recent writers report that during the final stage of his career Alexander lost mental balance, believing that he was not a man but a God.[79] However, it is obvious that the refusal of his men to go any further combined with his failure in India and the Gerosian Desert had [caused] a severe psychological reaction in Alexander. He had discovered the insecurity of power which all his successful scheming could not overcome.[80] It is during this time that Alexander began to drink much more than was healthy. Among other things, this might have been due to the extreme grief and loss he felt over the death of Hephaestion. Hamilton claims that the death of Hephaestion had a huge impact on Alexander and his mental stability. In 324 B.C. Hephaestion, the only man he fully trusted drank himself to death. Alexander now approached more and more closely to insanity.[81] In general, Alexander had reached his breaking point, and alcohol, which is used by type two alcoholics to create positive feelings,[82] might have been a good outlet for his mental unrest. As Green puts it In any consideration of his later years, the combined effects of unbroken victories, unparalleled wealth, power absolute and unchallenged, continual heavy physical stress and, incipient alcoholism cannot be lightly set aside. Abstemious as a boy, he now regularly drank to excess.[83] Alexander was lost, his loneliness at the top was finally too much for him, and he chose to drink away his pain. As Hamilton states, The story of Alexander appears to us as an almost embarrassingly perfect illustration of the man who conquered the world, only to lose his soul. [84] Alexander had indeed lost his soul, and the alcoholic demons that had once plagued his father, had helped carry it away. Alexander the Great is still to this day one of the most admired and awe inspiring men of all time. In a miraculously short span of time he conquered most of the known world, and would have gone on if he could. However, there is darker, more menacing side of Alexander, a side that until recently scholars have tried to ignore. He was often impulsive, rash, and especially during his later years prone to acts of violence and the use of fear tactics. The weight of the world and his unchallenged authority was finally too much for him, and he was dead by the age of thirty-three. The cause of his demise is debatable, but it is certain that during his final days he was abusing his body further with frequent drinking. If Alexander the Great was actually an alcoholic is something that is impossible to prove, but through evidence of the sources it is clear he exhibited many characteristics of a type two alcoholic. His violence and destructive nature when under the influence, his genetic vulnerability, as well his increasing dependence on alcohol in his final years are all sign that he was the victim of this disease. It is clear through the evidence of the primary sources that Alexanders apparent alcoholism did have a large impact on his life and decisions."

On May 15th, 2017, I was so scared to stop drinking that I took a Xanax to calm my nerves. On May 16th, I awoke sober, ready to confront my vices and commit to giving sobriety a whole hearted attempt. I had NO idea what was in store. The first week I had two full blown panic attacks, but I did not drink or smoke or pop a pill to escape it. I sat and cried and hyperventilated until the worst was over. I had felt my feelings to their full extent and survived?!? That was new for me. A few weeks later, I dumped my open bottles down the drain, flushed my stash, and gave everything else away. I started putting more obstacles between myself and the first drink. At first I didnt really understand why *I* had to be sober. I hated being 24 and unable to party normally like everyone else. Why did I always have to take things too far? Why did I want to escape myself so badly? Why didnt I care about myself or what could happen to me? Why me?? I made a list of things I will never have to experience again by not drinking. No more hangovers, no more waking up in strangers beds, no more ruined friendships, no more driving drunk, no more mixing drugs/alcohol... I rattled off two pages worth of never agains and would refer back to it if I had a craving. Finally around 60 days sober things started to click. I realized I didnt *have* to be sober, I get to *choose* to be sober. I get to experience the full spectrum of life. I get to do the deep work on myself. I get to feel all of my feelings and notice all of lifes miracles, things I never felt or noticed before, but were there all along. Trudging through the motions of life was no longer an option. Some days were better than others, but honestly my worst day sober will always truly be better than my best day drinking/drugging. One of the most surprising things of early sobriety was hearing stories of nights out from my friends where theyd recall me being passed out or like I wasnt even there, when my memories are of me being social and fun. Weird right? There were times in the early days when I would look in the mirror and barely recognize myself. I was slowly unbecoming everything I wasnt, yet not fully stepped back into myself. Each day has started with the same promise to myself. I promise to do whatever it takes to stay sober today. Some days were easier than others. Some days Id eat ice cream and go to bed a 8pm. Other days Id be at a music festival and think no one would even care if you drank right now, except I realized that in fact, I cared. I cared about myself now. I couldnt escape my own actions anymore. I used to joke that my moral compass was broken, when in fact it was there all along. I can no longer act recklessly, cheat, steal or lie, because I have to live with myself full well knowing exactly what I am doing. Before it didnt matter what I did because there was always an exit strategy, an escape route away from myself. When that stopped working, I was forced to figure something else out. That something else has been kindness and compassion towards myself and others. To practice mindfulness, gratitude, love and care. Sobriety has allowed me to get into the drivers seat of my life and take control of my future. Stopping self medicating was only the beginning to so many other changes internal and external. Everything inside me is different. The way I view the world, myself, my circumstances, my past, present and future is through a lens of love and acceptance. I never thought in a million years sobriety would ever be for me. I loved my vices like I love my closest friends, but sometimes when you close one door, a world full of opportunity is waiting for you. I know this year has set the foundation for a long, healthy and beautiful life ahead of me. Sobriety is the gift that I give myself daily, and the gift that truly keeps on giving. If youre just starting off fighting the good fight, KEEP GOING. Even if you slip and fall, brush yourself off, figure out what youve learned and carry the fuck on, warrior! We choose to live the way others wont, so that we can live the way that other cant. And that is living a life full of intention, purpose, passion, creativity, love and kindness. The world needs more people who are awaken in their lives. I love you SD. Without all of your stories and vulnerability I would not be here writing these words today. Thank you for being here and showing me that I am worth it, and Ill never be alone in this journey. Heres to the next 365. "

Wow! if I had only known\) ##### By Ben Taub 03 MAR 2016, 00:00 Scientists investigating the role of dopamine in alcoholism have come up with some surprising evidence that may help to explain why addicts find it so difficult to stay away from booze. Publishing their findings in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](URL the researchers suggest that when an alcoholic stops drinking, the brains ability to use dopamine changes, altering the way that the reward system is wired. Like many drugs, alcohol is known to stimulate the production of a [chemical messenger](URL called dopamine, which activates the so\-called reward center of the brain. Previous [studies](URL into the nature of addiction have revealed that this dopamine response is significantly reduced in alcoholics, leading to a need to drink more in order to feel a buzz. This reduction in dopamine levels causes what is known as a hypodopaminergic state, although little is known about what happens to the brains reward system when alcoholics try to stop drinking and enter a period of abstinence. To investigate this, researchers began by examining brain tissue from deceased alcoholics. They found that these brains had fewer of a particular type of dopamine receptor than normal brains. Called D1 receptors, these are the sites on the membranes of neuronal cells to which dopamine binds, causing these neurons to become excited. Any reduction in these receptor sites would therefore be expected to decrease the brains responsiveness to dopamine, thereby explaining why alcohol fails to satisfy. In addition, these brains were found to have fewer [dopamine transporter](URL sites, which allow for any unused dopamine to be sucked back up and recycled. So, as with D1 receptors, the disappearance of these sites is likely to hinder the brains ability to use dopamine. The study's authors also note that the brains of deceased alcoholics displayed no reduction in D2 receptor sites, which bind with dopamine in order to inhibit, rather than excite, neurons. All in all, this evidence explains how alcohol dampens the brains reward center, compelling alcohol\-dependent individuals to continually seek stimulation through booze. Next, the study authors sought to determine the sequence of events leading to this situation. To do so, they used radiography techniques to track dopamine levels in the brains of alcohol\-dependent rats that were denied alcohol for several weeks. They discovered that dopamine levels dropped during the first six days, confirming the existing theory that acute alcohol withdrawal is characterized by a hypodopaminergic state. Interestingly, during this initial period, the availability of dopamine receptor sites and transporter sites were found to be normal. However, after three weeks, the researchers noted that dopamine levels were in fact elevated, as the number of available receptor and transporter sites plummeted, so that the rats brains resembled those of the deceased alcoholic humans. This increase in extracellular dopamine levels is explained by the fact that less of it is able to bind to receptor sites, and therefore more of it remains unused in the gaps between neurons, known as synapses. Significantly, at the three\-week mark, the rats displayed continued behavioral effects associated with alcohol cravings. As such, the study authors conclude that, while acute alcohol withdrawal may be associated with a hypodopaminergic state, prolonged abstinence actually leads to a hyperdopaminergic state  meaning dopamine levels in the brain are higher than normal. Crucially, they say that both of these states are representative of a dysfunctional reward system, and therefore increase a persons vulnerability to relapse. [URL"

I, like many others have been lurking here for a while now, coming to terms with the reality of my situation. I am a young woman who comes from an alcoholic home in a country that is rampant with this virus. It is almost comically normal to be a drunk here where I live. I have known for a while that my drinking pattern is dysfunctional, but have constantly hid behind excuses of unfulfilled needs. I have discovered psychology as my life's passion and art (and often a way to rationalize and excuse bad behavior) and have delved deep into myself to root out issues and dysfunctional patterns. I met the love of my life (a decade older than me) at a young age and have thus been able to discover and heal a lot of who I am. For a while now I have been standing in this doorway, too scared to truly do what I understand I must: to choose responsibility for my success and find my fulfillment in what I give, rather than being stuck running away from problems and demanding that what I need (in order to be this or that) come from somewhere outside of me. My search has led me to acknowledge that not only was my father a drunk, the only other parent I had left, used me as a scapegoat and an emotional dumping ground. And now I see similar patterns emerging in my own marriage. I feel scared constantly. Sometimes I feel like I'm married to my abusive mother... I haven't had a drink in two days. We have been fighting. Today he mocked and humiliated my weakness, my acknowledged problem savagely and I felt even more broken and un-seen. I feel in shock and completely lost. And the only ray of light to go by now, is that whatever may come, If I want to rise to the challenges and opportunities the universe has presented me with, I must own my strength and honor it... With humbling gratitude, I see now that I have been given a gift- a way to become who I truly know I am. To find my strength in staying sober. I am present and in control. Thank you! All of you here are a magnificent force! A community that comes together in vulnerability and finds true strength and grace! I am humbled to not drink with you today. And tomorrow. "

Why? Vulnerability comes with the fear of being judged. I believe you only find strength when you are honest with yourself first. There are good people, and they will help and encourage you along your journey to sobriety. Dont be afraid to be vulnerable with the people you love and can trust.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!* **Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!** I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](URL and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others. It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol! **This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](URL we're not ready to give up. **What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](URL or have followed the pledges from the beginning. **What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Alright guys Im hoping I got the formatting right I have my laptop today but I am not awake yet lol. Today I would like to speak about vulnerability. The biggest fear amongst animals is to be vulnerable. If anyone has adopted a dog you will know it takes them a long time to warm up to having their belly rubbed  for an animal it is most vulnerable on their back. As humans we all fear being vulnerable. Why? Vulnerability comes with the fear of being judged. I believe you only find strength when you are honest with yourself first. There are good people, and they will help and encourage you along your journey to sobriety. Dont be afraid to be vulnerable with the people you love and can trust. The opposite of addiction is human connection, and you will find connection by opening up, asking for help, and communication with those around you. Hold your loved ones close, they love you too.

Tonight when I came home from work, it was chaos as usual; my husband was cooking, my twin boys were running wild, &amp; my dog Charlie was pawing at his face &amp; tearing around the yard. I appeased the twins with mini muffins before dinner &amp; went outside to check on Charlie. He has somehow wedged a stick in the rroof of his mouth. As gingerly as I could, I slid my hand into his mouth &amp; was able to remove the stick, all as my husband &amp; kids watched from the window. Now, you'd think sticking your whole hand down a 100+ lb. dog's throat would be the reason I ended up with a nice purple bite mark on my arm tonight, but friend, you'd be wrong. Charlie was as calm &amp; gentle as he has ever been. He's the goodest boye I know. One of the twins (age 3) was raring to go tonight. I think he can sense my vulnerability. I've been missing my oldest son (out of state with his dad) &amp; have been somewhat blue all day. El J efe, as we call him, had decided that all of the wrongs &amp; injustices that he has encountered in his young life could only be made right by sinking his teeth deep into my arm as I helped him dress after a bath. I held &amp; rocked him as I rubbed my sore arm, &amp; the tantrum passed. We talked about not hitting or biting, &amp; he hugged me as I kissed his curls. I am so thankful to be 500 days sober today. Without my sobriety, I am sure I could not have helped my dog. Without my sobriety, I might have lost my temper with a cranky toddler. Without my sobriety, I would not have the full &amp; crazy life that I have today. Thank you all for being here, night &amp; day, &amp; for encouraging me.

Out of the blue, he says hes worried about me and my drinking. Drinking...as if Im still doing it. This confuses me because I feel like things are going well on that front. I have 2 months under my belt. Making a lot of progress emotionally. Starting to do step work. Of course, I know that that can mean nothing, when it comes down to it. But its probably the longest Ive gone without drinking since my pregnancies. And Im proud of myself. It hurt to realize that the work Im doing isnt registering with him. Hes so worried about what could happen in the future, whats going on now doesnt seem to count. Trying to be fair. We dont talk about it a lot. So maybe he assumes the worst. But part of the reason I dont like talking with him about it is *because* he assumes the worst. It feels like Im living with someone who has already bet against me I can almost hear my therapist saying to me, What other people think of you is none of your business. And Im trying to remember that. Trying to understand that how he feels about my sobriety is colored by his alcoholic father and the scared little boy he was growing up. But, bottom line, it just hurts. And its not all about him. Its also the realization that we dont have the kind of relationship I wished we did. Where we could share fears and love and vulnerability and fuckups and acceptance without feeling the need to put our defenses up. And Im a part of that, too. To stop drinking is only the first step. The real work comes when you peel back the layers to see clearly what you were drinking to avoid in the first place. Sucks. Hurts. But I will not drink with you today. "
132,vulnerability,stopdrinking,**Addiction creates suffering.** Suffering is the stress created by craving for more. List the stress your addiction has created. How did it manifest day to day? Moment to moment?,13,85gbtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/85gbtv/addiction_creates_suffering_suffering_is_the/,2018-03-19 13:44:39,"*(The questions posed in the title are taken from the book, Refuge Recovery, by Noah Levine. The book suggests that you engage in a thorough ""truth inventory"" as a part of recovery. The questions above are the first prompt in the book. As part of my own process of recovery, I have begun working on my inventory. I am including my response below, for a few reasons: 1. As an offering of gratitude to this community for everything it has provided me with, particularly in my earliest days of recovery. 2. As a part of my ongoing effort to increase comfort with vulnerability. 3. In the off chance that it may aid someone else in their recovery. I invite you to to offer your own answers.)* My brain maintains a constant, ever morphing to do list. It is forever adding, subtracting and shuffling items on the list; re-calibrating the order of the items based on its tailor-made algorithm for ranking priorities. This list is a living organism in my mind, ever growing and changing with the tides of needs and responsibilities. It can take shape, dissolve, and reform fifty times in a day. Yet, somehow, for fifteen years or more, the item at the top of the list never changed. Through all the ebbs and flows of feeling, through all the shifting states of responsibility, this one item remained immune to the elasticity of life and brain function. That item: ensure constant and immediate access to booze at all times Whats even more remarkable than a single item topping a daily to-do list for over fifteen years straight, is that somehow this momentous streak of prioritization went relatively undetected by the moderators of said to-do list. My system, my brain and body, somehow had little to no awareness that all of their actions, reactions, drives, thoughts, feelings, their plotting of next steps and what-ifs were driven - first and foremost - by a proximity to alcohol. Booze first, everything else next. This was not always problematic: At 22, living in a city whose very identity is built upon its loving acceptance - its outright celebration - of indulging any and all carnal pleasures, surrounded by young people drinking into the wee hours of the morning. Pitchers of beer were $7, pool was free, daytime drinking was just called daytime. In that environment, ensure constant and immediate access to booze at all times, was the top item of any and everyones to-do list from the macro to the micro level. It quite literally was my world. Problems with this ranking of priority didnt create friction until or unless I found myself in worlds, or engaging with to-do lists, that had differing priorities. It only created tension when I found myself in a world where alcohol was not a priority. These moments would rise and present themselves like a personal challenge, a call to arms. Every internal resource must be brought to bear on this affront to our core values, our world view. In these moments I would become a colonizer.tromping into unknown or foreign territory and planting my flag for the land of the double IPA. There were times when this meeting of worlds would go smoothly. I would harness my charm and sociability; bring expensive, coveted drinks to dinner parties; ask that after-hour work meetings be held at the brew-pub; brown-bag tall-boys at the local Tuesday night summer concert series; ask my three year old to patiently wait just one more minute before we go outside to play so that I can quickly grab that Heady Topper from the fridgeAnd, son, please excuse the fact that I can only play with one hand, the other is doing important business at the moment. But there were other times where the worlds simply wouldnt or couldnt co-exist and I would be left with no other option: conquer all! One particular example comes to mind.I was visiting family for Thanksgiving. There was an essential football game on, but my family did not have cable and we couldnt watch it. We had run out of alcohol. A blizzard had set in (literally and metaphorically). Stores were closed. If I reflect on my running to-do list at that time it went: 1. Constant access to booze. 2. Constant access to football 3. Relax and enjoy family. 4. Reflect on gratitude and all the beauty that life has offered to you. As stated before, item 1 was immovable, stored in a part of my brain immune to compromise. Incidentally, at that time in my life, between the months of August and February, constant access to football was equally entrenched at #2. Therefore, items 3 &amp; 4 could not possibly be achieved until or unless items 1 &amp; 2 were wholly satisfied. It must be so! You can imagine the state that I entered, how pleasant my mood and demeanor must have been, to motivate my entire family to pile into a car, navigate treacherous roads through driving snow, in search of any open bar with a television. I acutely recall stomping down the buried sidewalk, yards ahead of the closest family member, driven by one central and grinding purpose. I recall it so clearly, because the experience was visceral. There was a ferocity to the tension in my chest. My body was on a mission and it would not be stopped; not by potential risk to my loved ones, not by closed for the holiday signs, not by a group of other humans who would have happily spent their evening relaxing on couches and chairs, enjoying each others company. I could not see them. I could not feel them. Not until I swung that frigid bar door open, not until I got the waiter's attention, not until the cold pitcher of beer was in my cup and in my hand and in my body. And then, suddenly, color returned to my world. My world. These moments of dissonance are powerful teachers. At the time, with beer safely in hand, I would view these moments as crises averted. Or, in the rare occurrence that I couldnt coerce my way to some booze, I would add the person or place responsible to my blacklist of relationships. Never to be seen again. If you or your establishment were not equally willing to revere, foster, enable, or defer to the notion that alcohol rules all, then there was no place for you in my world. For me, there was no dissonance. It was my world or nothing. A minimization or exclusion of alcohol was an exclusion or minimization of me. And, I believed that any anxiety born out of these experiences was born out of that personal affront. I believed that the overwhelming discomfort, toxic mood, pounding heart that I experienced when alcohol was not available was due to the fact that people were creating barriers to me being myself. I was certain that these moments of tension said something about you and your acceptance of me. Of course, they werent about you. These moments of dissonance were incremental offerings by my mind, my body, the universe; they were attempts at teaching me about me. They were red flags waving - at times subtly, at times wildly - attempting to alert me. The rapid change in mood, the grip in my chest, the singular sense of purpose at the cost of all things - these were my systems way of telling me, This is suffering. You are suffering. That feeling of anxiety experienced when alcohol was unattainable was not the mark of being misunderstood, it was the mark being addicted. Booze quietly and effortlessly held its impenetrable grip on the top of lifes list of priorities because it was stored in the part of the brain responsible for my survival. The idea of being denied alcohol was interpreted by my body and mind as a threat. That visceral experience that I remember so acutely from that Thanksgiving (and so many other moments of dread associated with the absence of booze) was my body launching into fight or flight. Alcohol was not something I wanted. It was something I had to have. And the idea of being without it gripped me with unquenchable fear. To believe that alcohol was my greatest protector was to believe that I couldnt live without it. Built into this type of relationship to alcohol is the foundational belief that, if left to my own devices, without the life raft of booze, I would drown. Without knowing, my central operating belief had become: I am not capable of living.without alcohol. What this means, in its most distilled form, is that my constant drive for booze was not simply to satisfy a craving for a buzz, for release, or for escape; it was to satisfy a desire to live. And every time that I sought living through the aid of the drink I was reinforcing the message that I am incapable of living without it. It was a vicious cycle of suffering disguised as life. One night I found myself sitting on my living room couch at two in the morning. I had been drinking since the previous morning. My son and my wife, pregnant with our second child, slept upstairs. I was downstairs, staring at a screen, cradling a double IPA like it was my infant child. A thought arrived, from a place that remains obscured, You are not living. You are dying. My life had become a constant act of suffering - all energy directed toward and consumed by the seeking of liberation through a 16 oz. can of beautifully hopped IPA. All the while, my life lived and breathed and slept in the rooms around me. When I decided to stop drinking I was terrified. I understand that terror more clearly now. I was asking myself to do something that I believed myself incapable of: to enter a world that I felt wholly unprepared for, to face reality without the aid of a pacifier, to be vulnerable and live to talk about it. (At the risk of losing any audience that launches into their own process of fight or flight at the mention of a higher power...) It was a massive leap of faith. I am over nine months sober today. Our baby girl is 9 weeks old and my son loves when I wrestle him with two hands. To this point, I have survived. It turns out that I have a fairly advanced survival system that is highly skilled at adaptation. It turns out that the attainment of alcohol was not actually the essential mechanism of survival. The seeking was. I survived, at every stage of life, because there are wildly loyal parts of me that work tirelessly to seek out methods of survival. Picking up the drink was just one of them. Turns out my brain is like any living, breathing organism: it wants to heal and it wants to live. When given a safe, healthy, and loving environment to thrive it will do both: heal and live. I am experimenting these days with a new item at the top of the ever-morphing to-do list. That is: ensure constant and immediate access to gratitude at all times. It is a work in progress. But in those fledgling moments when gratitude stakes its claim to the top spot, the world becomes (almost) unbearably beautiful; imbued with a vibrancy of color and a depth of feeling that drinking-self could never have imagined. And then, Pay the f**king bills! skyrockets to #1 and the magical hues are gone. And then a funny thing happens. I pay my bills. And the to-do list shifts again. "

I *never* expected to make it this far along without multiple lapses, if indeed my first lapse didn't result in just going back to how I was for the rest of my life. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone, beyond words' ability to capture it. Y'all are each and every one of you my teachers, companions, sisters and brothers on this journey. One of the things I value so much about SD is the ethos of kindness that pervades this special corner of the interwebz. The constant compassion of the mods and long-timers, the special regular posts by /u/Lee_in_NY and /u/sfgirlmary and /u/Stratyturd and /u/EmbryonicJourney and /u/Possibilitarian and others that give such a beautiful cadence and meaning to the daily milestones of our weeks. Monday isn't ""oh damn Monday"" anymore for me, it's AoK day :) Wednesday isn't just Hump That Load only a Little Further Day, it's a day to reflect on both ups and downs together. Thursday is Thankful Day, Friday isn't about ""get smashed and bugger the bunch of them"" it's ""get it off the chest and hit the weekend feeling lighter"".... Today an interesting piece popped up in my daily Guardian email that seemed so appropriate to today, because one of the gifts for me of doing sober the SD way is my own personal belief that kindness is one of the most important things I can add to my small part of the world is not put down here, it is positively encouraged. Kindness runs rampant like dandelions, kindness speaks as loudly and often as the burbling of frogs on a warm night, kindness shines as brightly as the lights of a house spotted far beyond in some paddocks while travelling down a highway at night. Y'all are the kindest group of humans I have ever known. So here's a read that celebrates that - *spoiler alert* - kindness is the biggest trend and possibly the most beneficial trend sweeping through many nations. Looks like we are collectively remembering what some cultures, such as those nations in Africa where [""ubuntu""] (URL is a guiding principle, never forgot. My favourite bit - which reminded me of /u/Lee_in_NY s AoK this week: *""To be a hero today is simply to be a person who leans into the vulnerability that comes with seeing other peoples problems. It is to tie a scarf around a tree. Being a hero today requires no expert skills, no powers of flying or invisibility  in fact, one of the things that has helped devalue kindness over the past 30 or so years is the fact that we all know how to do it, we have done since we were children, but as a mark of our power and importance, choose not to. Being a hero today is to not look away.""* Here is the [full article] (URL - ignore the click-bait and kinda negative headline! Much love to all - and thank you.

This is the furthest I have ever made it without drinking. Today I am insanely proud of what I have accomplished in 30 days and cant even imagine what I will be able to accomplish with more time. I grew up with sober parents. My dad, by choice, and my mom in support of my dad. When I was 14, my parents had a nasty divorce and it had a pretty big effect on my mental health. I was always sort of the wild child in my family, and this took full form during my high school years. This is when the most damage was done. I went to parties every weekend, got blackout every time, started smoking weed, hooked up with guys I didnt want to, and just flat out made risky decisions and lied to my family. Even with that, I knew enough to get out of my hometown after HS. I went to college and a whole new era unfolded. My freshman year, I partied like any other normal freshman. But in the later years, I got blackout drunk on a consistent basis. This is also when I started chain smoking cigs. I damaged a lot of relationships and probably hindered my potential at the time. Again, I knew enough to get out of my college town and moved away after graduation to get a job and start on my own. Blackouts were less frequent, but SO much worse. I said stuff to my family and friends I would have never dreamt about saying sober. I drove drunk. I bailed on commitments. I didnt respect myself. The final straw was last thanksgiving. My future in laws came to visit and I took them to meet my family. The day was going great, until I hit that point of no return and blacked out. I was stumbling, tried to drive ALL OF US HOME, and dont even remember half of the things I said. I thank god my family and my fiancs family love me the way they do, because that could have really broken a lot of things. After this, I didnt quit drinking completely, but I was thinking about it more. I probably had 2-3 more blackouts before I decided to quit. On feb 15, I quit drinking and smoking. I made it 2 weeks and relapsed. I was quitting with my conscious mind, and it didnt stick. Next day I was back on the wagon, determined to quit. I read Annie Graces book and realized that in order to quit, I needed to continue my normal life but without alcohol. I needed to show my subconscious that I was just as much fun sober as I am drunk, if not more, and I couldnt have been more right. I hit the ground running, and realized that I needed to put my blood, sweat, and tears into this if I l wanted it to work. I started running, lifting weights, spending more time outside of the house, and making plans with people doing sober things so I had accountability. Now, I am at 30 days and feel on top of the world!! I know I have a long journey ahead, but I feel like if I can accomplish this, I can accomplish even more. To anyone out there considering quitting, it is so possible!! Take it one day at a time, and realize that it does take WORK and VULNERABILITY to truly make a change. Use your resources and be HONEST with yourself. You can do this!! Heres to 30 days and 30 days more! Thank you universe for allowing me to see! IWNDWYT!"

Over the past 4 years, I have put him through a lot and nearly every situation had alcohol dead center. I wrote this speech to read to him at dinner, and I would love some feedback. I really want to make this count, and you are a saint if you actually read all of this. ""XXXXX, I hope you are enjoying your surprise. Hopefully I did not overhype this. We have always talked about going to XXXXXXX at some point for dinner and I wanted to be the one to take you instead of you being the one to take me. I would have done this next week, but you will be out of town so I chose today instead. On May 11th, I will be 6 months sober. I know I talk about it every month that goes by, but to me, every month is a milestone. 6 months is a big one for me, I am halfway to a year. Now you may be wondering why a dinner out is a surprise for you for my 6 months of being sober, but it's because of this moment right now. This dinner and the speech I am reading to you right now is a giant resounding thank you. I know I thank you all the time for the many things you do for me, but I want it to be bigger somehow. I stopped drinking by myself, but I didnt do this by myself. I didnt become a better person by myself or a better partner by myself. So much of who I am now and who I am hopefully going to be is because of you. You are my support, you are my inspiration, my mirror, and my reward. Sometimes I feel sad at the thought of never having a glass of wine with you again, or never recreating a night at FAVORITE COLLEGE BAR where we talked ourselves in love. I have come to realize though that it wasnt the drinking that made these moments so special to me, but that in those moments I was able to open up and bear my soul to someone only to find they are a kindred spirit. You make me so brave, XXXXX. You have been making me brave for years. Not just with the sobriety, but with everything. When we met, I was so scared of everything. I was scared of moving on with my life, becoming an adult, and failing or even succeeding. I was scared of vulnerability and connection and especially intimacy. I didnt trust anyone, and I had no plans to start. You made me brave enough to live the life I really want to live. Brave enough to try to be the person I have always wanted to be but never thought I could be. You made me believe in myself and youve made me believe in love. You have shown me more kindness, more trust, support, and compassion than anyone I have ever met before you. I feel like you are a part of me. I feel so at home and safe with you, even when I am scared. I have not made this easy. Lord knows I have had plenty of growing pains and selfish moments that could have made everything crumble. I have been childish, selfish, and sometimes just downright mean. I made my baggage your burden and refused to let go at some points. I have been suspicious, cowardly, and pessimistic- but somehow you saw past that and you saw exactly what youve always seen...me. I know I make long emotional speeches all the time, and I am hoping that this beautiful night in this beautiful place together will make this moment stand out above the rest. Because I just need to thank you for being the light that I clung to and the home of my heart. You have profoundly changed me. You have loved me, protected me, supported me, and provided for me in ways that I never thought I deserved and never thought I could find. You have pushed me to be someone that I am proud of, and someone that loves you more than you could ever know. I know I am still not perfect and I never will be, and we have plenty of bickering, misunderstandings, awkward moments, and beautiful life stopping moments together and I am so honored that I get to share all of them with a man like you. You have been an amazing friend, a phenomenal boyfriend, a hell of a fiance, and I know you will be a dream of a husband because you are truly the man of my dreams. So I just wanted to take you here now, buy you a beautiful dinner in a beautiful dress with an amazing view of the city and let you know just how much I appreciate you and everything I am because of you. I love you so much, and you are my best friend. You have made me brave. You have given me safety, excitement, and love. You have given me so much love, and I am going to spend every day of my life trying to give you what you have given me tenfold."" Thank you, and IWNDWYT. "

About three months into my sobriety, I decided my good friend wasnt just someone I had a crush on. So I did something I wouldve never done before quitting drinking: I confidently (but respectfully) sat her down and told her that its obvious we have feelings for each other and that I was taking her on a date in 2 days. And then we started building trust, intimacy and vulnerability. I can do all of those things because I no longer drink. She knew me as a drunk; what a gift to have the option of hiding my terrible past behavior taken off the table! We moved in together in August. Shes the love of my life, my best friend and Im gonna marry her. You want to gain self worth and achieve things you think you cant? Just quit drinking. You will find so much value in yourself that booze has been hiding. For a long time I decided that I wasnt going to get to fall in love; I came to this brilliant conclusion after dating the same exact type of woman so many times Ive lost count. Then I got my heart good and broken to shreds and I freaked out. How did I let another human being treat me this way? Why do I hate myself? I was embarrassed that I didnt value myself. When I quit drinking I began to allow myself to own my good qualities. Im a good friend. Im a great uncle. I can cook. I am kind to strangers. And I seem to make a beautiful, brilliant, hilarious and kind woman happy. Shes the love of my life and currently snoring while snuggled up against my shoulder.

The physical effects include shrinkage of the prefrontal cortex and the brain stem. So, what if I have been sober for a while and then relapse? From one study: *In the relapsers, lifetime consumption of alcohol predicted later vulnerability to white matter volume decline and third ventricular enlargement with resumption of drinking. Resumption of drinking after a short period of abstinence arrests third ventricular volume improvement and produces white matter volume loss (Pfefferbaum, 1995).* Not only will your brain start to lose volume improvements, but very importantly, lifetime consumption of alcohol maintains a heightened level of vulnerability to this negative impact even after one quits drinking.

Not a wreck that's settled, forgotten, and sitting at the bottom of the sea, now home to a beautiful little reef system and a friendly moray eel named Velma, no. I'm a wreck in progress. With alcohol, my emotions were muted, distant, and manageable. I could pass over anger, sadness, paranoia, feeling hurt, like an ice skater, paying little more than a passing glance at the still and murky landscape below the ice, in the darkness of the deep, frozen lake below. But without the booze, I'm more like a skin diver in that lake (why waste a metaphor,) tangled up in the vegetation of my dark, watery psyche. I thought, like many of you, I suppose, that quitting drinking would spring this magical epiphany inside of me, that I would suddenly be happier and healthier and sitting on top of the world, but in reality, I've only gained the freedom and opportunity that only true vulnerability can provide; the chance to actually stand up to my insecurities and fears, and with a clear mind, confront them, understand them, and if not make friends with them, at least establish some boundaries and mutual respect. I am happier, not drinking, though also sadder, angrier and more self conscious. That's ok. We're supposed to feel those things. My life is better not drinking, because I'm living my *whole* life, not just the parts that are easy. I might have a panic attack, or a few hours of despondent moping, but I will not drink with you today. I'll be too busy conquering, surrendering, battling and befriending the parts of myself that I've let go for all these years. Best wishes to you all."
139,vulnerability,stopdrinking,What 50 days of complete sobriety has done for me.,12,7s8oa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7s8oa2/what_50_days_of_complete_sobriety_has_done_for_me/,2018-01-23 07:23:54,"*If I could photograph the transformation of my mind and spirit the change would be more apparent and this post would be more relevant.* My Father was an abusive alcoholic. My maternal grandfather died of alcoholic pancreatitis two years ago. My maternal grandmother died at 52 years old from alcoholism, I never knew her. She, horrifyingly bore witness to her grandmother hanging from a ceiling beam as a child from the latter effects of alcoholism. I am genetically, double pre-disposed to alcoholism and addiction. If youre educated in addiction, you understand that (although it can and will lead to mental illness) its not inherently a mental disorder. Alcoholism is an actual physical and chemical makeup composition of who a person is, has been and could be. Being genetically predisposed means that ones DNA is literally wired and programmed to operate as that of an addict. I am a textbook archetype of a child of addiction and the lack of cognizance of my programming, Ive added insult to injury. Whether it was one drink or ten drinks, I was voluntarily and progressively writing code for my own brain to suffocate; not only physically but mentally and emotionally. I justified my social drinking, because Im a raging introvert and the only thing that enabled me to thrive in the social scene, was having an altered state of mind. I progressively developed anxiety, depression, hair loss, muscle loss, nutrient loss, weight-gain, higher BMI, lack of empathy, contempt, loss off memory and most of all, lack of fucking self-respect in my 10 year stint of binge drinking with my buddies. My decision making process, safety of my well-being and above all, Love for myself had slowly evaporated with every drink I daintily chugged down. Its said, that rock bottom is where you build a new foundation but I humbly disagree. Driving home after a night of social drinking and seeing a car driving in the ditch in my rear-view mirror (whom I put there), was closest to rock bottom that I EVER wanted to be. Had that driver not been paying attention, a head-on-collision and a subsequent intoxicated manslaughter charge and an ever-present guilt from the pain I couldve caused the loved ones in that vehicle, wouldve been something I probably couldnt have dealt with. This was my rock bottom. Alcoholism, pornography addiction, cocaine addiction, gambling addiction,sugar addiction, nicotine addiction or any other addiction that youre facing is progressive and its consequences will eventually and ravingly take their place. Im sure many are aghast and in judgment of me after reading this. But please keep in mind the parable of the splinter and the plank. This catharsis of truth for me is not a sermon on the mount, coming from a place of sanctimony. Im a bottom the barrel beggar, coming from a place of surrender and vulnerability. It has been my foundation where where my health, hope, happiness, empowerment and Love for myself is finally, albeit slowly, is being rebuilt. In geek terms, Im rewriting my programming and restructuring my brain chemistry and my DNA. In Biblical terms, Im ending my generational curses. Edit: pervasive grammatical errors Love to all."
140,vulnerability,stopdrinking,100 days! Reflections...,34,7tmea5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7tmea5/100_days_reflections/,2018-01-29 06:24:15,"I don't carefully track days, but recently I did the math and realized that today I am 100 days sober. My last drink was on October 19th. Wow. My drinking issues were like stage 1 cancer. Problematic, though less severe. I didn't drink everyday, but my social life revolved around alcohol insomuch any meet up with friends always included 2-4 drinks. And sometimes those 2-4 drinks turned into an unplanned binge and I woke the next day with a horrible hangover. My binging became more frequent in 2017. I hated it, but never wondered why or if the problem was alcohol itself. I met a recovering alcoholic who asked me how I felt after having a few drinks. ""I want to keep drinking. But doesn't everyone feel like that?"" I asked. ""No, they don't."" It made me question my relationship with alcohol for the first time. About a week later I decided to have a drink alone, which turned into a few drinks, as it always does. I woke up the next day and recognized I had a problem and needed to stop. That was 100 days ago and I haven't drunk since. I've learned a lot over the past 100 days - **Any activity can be done sober.** I've drunk seltzer in bars and had dance parties with friends. Almost no one notices or cares that I'm sober (which is crazy - I ALWAYS noticed if someone didn't drink). **Sobriety can give you bliss without the hangover.** I love the high I get when I'm out with friends and start having a giggly good time, like I used to feel after a few drinks, and realize it's because I'm actually happy. **Sobriety did not take away my problems.** I used alcohol to mask and avoid my problems. Now that the alcohol is gone, I have to confront and deal with my anxieties and imperfections. I've made progress, but I still have a lot of work to do. **I have more discipline to tell myself not to do something.** Don't eat gluten, dairy, meat or soy? No problem. Don't look at X toxic website? It's gone. Sobriety on its own hasn't improved my discipline to affirmatively act, but it's given me a super power ability not to do things that I decide are bad. **Sobriety grounds me.** In meditation, you focus on your breath. A meditation session may have a particular focus or your mind may wander, but you can always return to your breath as an orderly constant. Sobriety serves the same life function. **Sobriety has given me a stronger sense of self.** Sometimes I wonder what a hypothetical person would think of my sobriety. Then I think, ""but I don't care what other people think. I'm doing this because I know it's what's best for me."" This attitude has impacted my entire attitude - I feel more confident and secure in my identity and don't feel so emotionally impacted by other people's actions and opinions of me. **[stopdrinking](URL has made me more compassionate.** It's inspiring to be surrounded by people who're all openly imperfect and are trying to improve themselves. I'm grateful to all of you for sharing your vulnerability here, and for always responding to others with both honesty and love. I take sobriety day by day and don't make lifelong pronouncements. Perhaps one day I will consciously try out very light drinking, as I've never tried to moderate before. But right now, any level of drinking doesn't interest me at all. Sobriety has no downside and has brought me so many good things. Thank you for being a part of my journey. "
141,vulnerability,stopdrinking,One year without the boozin,530,7w42ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7w42ie/one_year_without_the_boozin/,2018-02-08 22:06:12,"Thank you. Every last one of you, thank you. I am proud of you. I am grateful for your commitment to yourselves, your today and your tomorrows. Please dont congratulate me for one year without boozin, give yourself some credit for your successes and some breathing room where you need it. Because its tradition heres my story: Started drinking young. Acted like an idiot when drunk. Joined up in ye ol armed forces. Did whatd youd expect a solider to do, push ups, travel, more push ups, drink like it was a fucking Olympic sport and Im up for gold, get promoted and demoted because of drinking, more push ups. More drinking. Did Some fighting. Got a good sized injury and generally gave the hell up...because of the shame I associate with vulnerability (can you hear me right now?)... Summarizing the rest, I acted like more of an idiot when drunk as an adult. I disrespected my now Exwife and put her in situations where she felt unsafe. Id break shit around the house and not remember...who the fuck does that around someone they promised to honor and cherish? Id yell at her because I knew shed get upset and leave me alone so I could get housed. Id ignore my wife so I could drink alone. I made such lousy excuses for my utter and complete bullshit. I lied myself into situations no one would care about normally to cover for boozin or so that I could booze. I rationalized. I didnt drink and drive...which means its ok to get blackout drunk and tip the bartender half my paycheck. I didnt physically abuse my wife, which made it ok to get drunk and drag her into the hell going on in my head. My dad was dying and I cannot recall the important words he was trying to say to me because I decided to drink all of his good scotch, as it was too hard on me emotionally. I was a fucking coward. The turning point: Youd think it was my dads death or the divorce? HardLy! Those loses only gave me additional excuses to hide deeper into the bottle (any bottle, even yours). My cause was due to my having failed a stranger. Someone Id never met. I failed and she suffered because of it. Ill own that failure for the remainder of my life. I now wear it as a badge. A reminder of what we owe one another as human beings. Its an honor to shoulder this burden, because I can and I can do it without a 24 pack of death crawling around my guts. What Ive learned: The hard truth is drinking didnt take a thing from me. I gave it everything. My marriage. My youth. My time. My money (a lot of frickin money). My mind. Friendships. Respect. My dogs. When I really just wanted the booze to take away the fear, guilt, and shame I felt. All of which are the only damn things I couldnt fit in that stupid bottle. My advice: Take today and make it your own. Give yourself ten minutes and hour, just some time, any time! And dedicate it to you. Do yoga. Lift something heavy. Theres always push ups. Drink some coffee on the porch. Take a breath and look away from the silly mundane bullshit we blanket ourselves within. Make yourself uncomfortable. Give yourself a high five every once in awhile. That said, kick yourself in the nuts every once in a while too. Tell your dad you love him. Kiss your wife more often. Hold her hand when shes scared. Tell her the fucking truth you dumb bastard. Your dogs are good boys. Give them treats and a walk. Make those apologies. Forgive. Stretch your back out. Drink water. Dont drink booze. Or beer. Or wine. Or whatever the hell your brand of soul toxin is. My Today: Im rebuilding. Im learning to be humble and let my pride go. I already did some damn pushups. Ok fuck it. Ill do more. Im forgiving myself and atoning for my failures. Im not dating. Im not spending money like an asshole on asshole things. Im not longing for or bothering my ex, she deserves peace after all. Im going to do some hippie shit meditation Kung fu stuff. But mostly today, Im not drinking with you. Edit: words because on mobile and Im still not smart. "

I'm 28/m and a father of two. I'm also an alcoholic whos torn worlds apart with my irresponsible actions. On the outside I'm a man, but deep down resides the true nature of my vulnerability. I'm still that boy. That scared boy who longed for love, and for friendship and mostly for family. In the last 10 years I've had numerous run-ins with the law as a result of my drinking. I no longer have any custody of my two children and though I see them weekly, its more like these beings walk in on Friday and out of my life on Monday. They're memories to me when they leave and their absence leaves me alone, with every other aspect of myself that I despise. I am a walking tragedy, comprised of self hatred, full of fear and depression. All of which I created out of the chaos that I call my life. My drinking has cost my sons a family. Its left me in debt, financially and emotionally. I owe so much more to the people that have had to endure me and my actions. I'm sober now and hope to find redemption for my deeds in the days to come. Its really my state of depression that worries me and the darkness I'm shrouded in. I don't really know how to finally rid myself of the past and the thoughts that I try to numb so often. I'm a binge drinker btw and I've taken every rough road imaginable on this course. I'm just truly terrified my actions will create irreversible damage to others and that I cannot allow to happen. I could use support to see tomorrow with sober eyes and possibly become a man of true worth in the future. "

My anniversary was this past 11/25/2017 - one year baby! I'm proud of myself! It's funny, being diagnosed with chronic diseases was a little easier than I expected and I attribute it to sobriety. The concept of 'forever' here was made easier because I already dealt with that struggle when I committed to a future of sobriety. Also, I'm far healthier and more able to handle this condition. Now, here's the vulnerability. I feel so foolish. I had this kind of hope of a gift from the universe for making it past one year. It may sound immature but it's how I felt and in return I received the gift of two autoimmune diseases. It just feels like I'm going to have to live the rest of my life atoning for a short, reckless time. I'm 27 and it gets overwhelming at times because I'm not sure I've been able to fully accept what's happening. Thanks in advance everyone. I will not drink with you today!

I'm sure many of you, if not all, can relate. I don't like feeling bad, so often I will do anything in my power to change the way I feel. If I am hurt or sad, I will become angry. I overreact and do things that I regret. It's hard for me to sit with emotions that don't feel good. Sometimes I will ""go cold,"" which baffles and hurts my loved ones. I'll feel like I've done something wrong, or I've failed in some way, if I feel bad. Or I'll blame everyone else, particularly those closest to me. I knew that last night was going to be trying for me. I was stressed out about something I've got going on today along with something that was happening last night. I felt angry at people for not being here for me. I felt lonely and sad. I felt afraid. I cried. Instead of becoming destructive, I cried. I accepted things as they are. Man, did I ever want a drink, but I didn't have one. And then something beautiful happened. Instead of lashing out, I reached out. It turns out people are much more receptive to honesty and vulnerability than unwarranted anger and blame. I remembered that I don't have to act a certain way just because I feel a certain way. I can't always be in control of my emotions; they are natural and happen for a reason. (Perhaps I felt bad so that I know to reach out for support?) *But* I can be in control of how I respond to them. I still felt afraid and stressed when I went to bed, but I wasn't angry and I wasn't lonely. Plus it felt good to cry honest tears. I had no idea that negative emotions could be therapeutic. It's moments like these that assure me that I'm on the right path. "
145,vulnerability,stopdrinking,I think I hit a mental milestone,19,7lilf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7lilf5/i_think_i_hit_a_mental_milestone/,2017-12-23 03:48:13,"(edit: this got all rambly, but it's mainly just for me to write out some thoughts). This is my third try at a sober streak... first was 2 weeks, second was 2 months, now at 11 days. Before, when I lapsed, it was due to feeling like if I deprived myself of alcohol, then it proved I had enough self-control to safely go back to pleasure drinking. If you look carefully you can see the seeds of downfall in that thinking. It's hard to resist the sense of deprived pleasure indefinitely. I'd always be asking myself 'when do I get my nice things back?' After my 2-month lapse I feel like I've moved past that. For a couple of weeks, I drank moderate-heavy on a few occasions. Never got seriously drunk, but I felt exhausted and depressed the entire time. I couldn't keep up with my kids or my work. I remembered this was how my first relapse was. How could I forget? So this time, it's burned in my brain. Whatever ""moderation"" is, I don't enjoy it anymore. I'm 46 and don't have the energy to spare, nor the time. So now I don't feel deprived anymore. This is not me resisting a drink, this is just me valuing my sobriety. Before, I resented my wife keeping alcohol in the house because I felt so bitterly tempted, like she was mocking my vulnerability. Now there's a 6-pack in the fridge and I don't even care. I'm not out to tell everyone that they're drinking poison and I'll have none of it. Some people drink, some people never drink, some people stop drinking. I'm the latter category. It's a big deal to me, but I can't make it a big deal for everyone else. Now I have the humility to realize that even though I'm feeling good and non-deprived, I have to be vigilant and mindful every day. Alcohol is all around us. I never know when a ""really good reason"" will pop up and bite me before I have time to remember that I don't do that anymore. So tl; dr I am feeling relieved because I don't drink, and I don't feel deprived. About 10 times a day I think ""I'm glad I don't have that problem anymore. I know I have to do maintenance to stay that way, but it is what it is, and I'll do it."

Not wanting to go to a house party.* &amp;nbsp; **New Years Eve 2017: December** &amp;nbsp; Its the third time my body has been absent alcohol more than sixty days. In three hours the clock will strike its final seconds of the year with 2018 waiting for its genesis. October 13th holds the last sip of spirits to my lips. After that my tongue laid barren of ales and imported hops. These final moments feel weighted with the guilt of compiled inaction and remorse for a life that could have been lived. Some alternate dimension where my triumph against alcoholism held firm. Where progress carved its place in my history, not failure and regression. This was my supposed year of action. This was the year of triumph finally over the shackles of sobriety in youth. A fantasy constituted of control and revelry. The self-imposed isolation and absence from the desired life of youth and participation ended. No more the weekends of subsiding in the complacency of my hermitage. No more fits of dwelling in the potential for my social participation. No more repetition. No more loneliness. &amp;nbsp; One year and a week prior, my year and half of sobriety carried a declaration of success. Here sat a man cured of dependency and wrought with an unalienable conviction to not be stricken by the moments of drunken stupors and forgotten nights. No more did alcohol hold the firm grasp of addiction over me. The catharsis of coworkers and friends acknowledging their first sight of me drinking. This was my liberation. The revelation and awakening of being cured. Once again I stood as the model socialite. Acceptable to all. Rejected by none. The life absent social interaction now blooming into its rebirth. Before the eventuality of its fading, my new found confidence rushed through my blood. Invigorating my confidence in the control that was lacking in my previous months of sobriety. The only discomfort held by my new found vulnerability to the judgement of others. They all held witness to my triumph. My jury of peers to judge its validity. Exclamations of joy and affirmations showered on the return of someone they never met. The Kevin of old dead. The ill-fated voyage unbeknownst to them launched from its port unto a sea, that while foreign in appearance, held the more familiarity than any of us would know. &amp;nbsp; Now, at this exact hour. Here sits a sober man with no inclination to drink. No motivation to return to the court of public opinions. The voyage failed and my rebirth stillborn. It didnt work. No more the faith blinding its sole participant. My recollections back to my revealing to others of a reborn Kevin burning into my soul. Now, more than ever, the inquiry of others felt my contempt. This years fire grows dim and these words flow onto the page in lieu of my fellow mans company. I am empty. I am not fulfilled and vindicated for the year of life. It feels wasted. &amp;nbsp; But I am still sober. I am not dead. I have not cracked. Maybe the appreciation of that will allow for some vindication eventually. Yet still my actualization of it falls flat. Escaping my purview and dimming my desires to not be here. "

Yeah, you there trying to quit drinking all by yourself- got something to tell ya. **You need to tell someone**. You can't outthink and outmaneuver your way out of this; you have to tell someone who you trust that you have a problem with alcohol and that you're trying to recover. This was my problem. I thought I could think my way out of it and go it alone. My drinking was a secret, so there was no reason why my recovery shouldn't be a secret as well. I was wrong. My recovery failed for that reason. It failed many, many times. It reminds me of the character Raskolnikov from Dostoyevsky's *Crime and Punishment*. He carries a secret with him throughout the novel that tears him apart from the inside, psychologically. He feels alienated from his fellow human beings, and the range of his freedom of action grows smaller and smaller. The only thing that can end this type of psychological alienation is to communicate with another human being. I just told a close friend of mine about my struggles with alcohol, how I've tried to stop many times and been unsuccessful. How boredom and loneliness grew to habit, and how habit grew to losing control of the situation. It's scary to communicate that because it shows vulnerability. A lot of us who drink ironically are the very people who want to *seem* like we're in control. Still, I had something building up in me where I knew I had to say something, even if I was afraid to. It was *necessary*. If you can relate, go with that feeling and blurt it out if you have to; go where the feeling leads. I feel like a tremendous weight has been lifted from my shoulders. You may be carrying something that you don't need to carry."

It was pretty gruesome, blackout drunk. Not that gruesome that I did anything bad, just the fact that I drank that much. I know that my heads still going to be all over the place due to the alcohol abuse, but i really cant stop feeling sorry for myself. Nobody wants to be anywhere near me, my eldest son who's always been a tower of strength and support to me...has asked me not to contact him again. Except I did, this morning...I was looking for some love and kindness really, thats what I'd hoped for....i know it was too soon and I should have waited, he just ended up being quite viscious and nasty. And although I know i deserved it, it hurt like hell. Now i just cant stop thinking about how shitty my life is....whether i drink or not. Ive had the year from absolute hell, and I have to face most of it alone. I started the year being a kidney donor for my middle son, who also happens to have special needs and mild learning difficulties. I seriously wasnt prepared for what a big thing we were both facing. I wasnt prepared for how ill I felt afterwards, it threw up lots of horrible feelings for me.....I'm alone, I dont have a partner, I dont have anyone to take care of me....physicaly or emotionally. I have a toxic relationship with my sister, who used the whole operation as a points scoring exercise....I wont go into the boring details, but suffice to say, i left the hospital feeling like the biggest piece of shit in the world. It took me a long time to be able to see the transplant as a good thing. It was a horrible experience. On top of that, my son didnt cope well with the operation at all, due to his special needs, and all the lifestyle changes that came with it. Guess who he took it out on? Then almost immediately his disabilty money stopped...again, he acted like i personally had been the one to stop his money. I'm still fighting to get it re-instated, due to his special needs and myriad of other problems he has. This has meant extra paperwork, deadlines etc...its been so stressful. My eldest son (the one who doesnt want to speak to me) has ssvere social anxiety and agrophobia, so i do lots for him too. I just helped them move into a new place, but they wont do anything for themselves...they havent bothered unpacking or cleaning the new place, and wont until i go do it for them. I feel its my duty as their mother and because of both their difficulties. My mum passed suddenly a month and a half ago, she was only 68, and she was my rock....she was a difficult woman at times to be fair, but she alwasys supported me in my drinking problem without any judgements at all. she also helped me in other ways...she was always there, and now shes not. Then theres my daughter who still lives with me, shes 16 and just started college....i sorted out all her paperwork for her, made two trips to college with her....when i couldnt really afford it, and took up two whole days (we have to use buses as I dont drive) I do everytihin i possibly can for her, i help her out left right and centre, i comfort her when shes upset, i give her money etc etc.....do you know that even when my mum died, I had to ask her to come down from her room and sit with me.....my feelings and or upset mean absoultely zero to her I help out a niece who has a psychitic illness and is really reeling from the death of my mum...she was my mums carer as well and lived with her. I have a friend who is an awful life situation, and always there to help her too....but out of all of them, this friend is the ONLY one who gives me anything back. If im upset, i get told i'm childish, shouldnt be thinking that way, making mountains out of molehills...I'm literally not allowed to be a human being. I asked my daughter and my niece for a favour on thursday and neither of them would do it.....my son again said i was making a mountain out of a mole hill.... but it was just the latest in a long line of ""fuck yous"" its just indicative of the way i get treated. and it hurts. Now ive had a drink, sons hating on me big style (i totally understand how he feels but his words have been so harsh, its like im not even a human being) My daughter cant even look at me without contempt in her eyes. I understand and I dont blame them, theyre sick of false promises, its just compounded my feelings of being absolutely alone and I'm so sad. Its a bit of a paradox really, because deep down I think I'm too toxic to be around anyone....yet craving some love and companionship. The one friend who does give back to me, I hate putting my shit on her (as i said shes in a pretty awful life situation herself) I'm sick of the daily struggle of paperowrk, appointments, getting buses that take hours to get anywhere (live in a really rural area) as well as the cost of buses when im so broke, and having no partner or anybody to offload on...without fear of being made to feel silly or stupid. I just want someone to listen and understand exactly what its like to be me. The vulnerability and loneliness I felt after the operation is still hanging on me....even when Ive made concerted efforts to just stop it. My son actually said oh you poor thing, you have a nice house to live in and a family.....do you know how many people have worse lives than you? instead of just saying, ""that must be a bit shit for you"" and giving me a bit of recgnition and comfort. I'm too fucked up to even consider looking for a partenr and even if i wasnt, we live in a small rural community,......i am just known as a drinking problem, again....not a human being, a drinking problem. Everyone knows it. even these past 30 days sober, was just filled with stress and upset and nobody at all thinking to give me any comfort or support. I'm not suicidal at all, just feel like theres no point in living like this.....im 45 now, ive given up on life. Ive no job, no qualifications to get a job, no partner, no social life and no support, and no chance of getting them either. I'm so tied of it all, and feeling mega sorry for myself.....i know it doesnt help tho and wish I could just stop and try to find some positivity somewhere"

Some days finding gratitude can feel exhausting &amp; like an intrusion into my want to isolate &amp; sit lonely in my vulnerability. But if I wasn't spending my time writing &amp; thinking my gratitude, what would I actually be doing instead??? Nothing!

154,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Reflections on approaching 50 days,6,73e4wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/73e4wj/reflections_on_approaching_50_days/,2017-09-30 20:04:59,"Not quite at fifty, but it's the weekend, and whilst round numbers are pretty, each day is its own. Forty-eight days sober might as well be fourteen in terms of my dry spells over the last decade and a half, so what's a few days, eh? Starting out here, I found other people's stories and the changes they'd seen after quitting to be really helpful, so consider this post passing it forwards. I never intended to quit. I started out as I had shit to do, and daily drinking was getting in the way. I knew my drinking was problematic: there were fights and fuck-ups, there were many Mondays awake till six in the morning, and many evenings alone with a bottle. There were negotiated deadlines, and postponed necessities. There were excuses and accidents, insults and plain bad behaviour. Still, I was in a pretty heavy-drinking scene, and I was far from the only one, or even the worst. What I needed was a little time out to get my act together before a big new stage in my life. What I wasn't prepared for was withdrawal. I had no seizures or pink elephants, no desperate urges to run to the shop for a bottle or three; just chronic misery, discomfort, headaches, depression and sleeplessness for two to three weeks -- about as long as I'd planned to dry out. From what I've since read, they get worse each time. Some deep personal reflection, coupled with this sub and a lot of reading have helped me understand how bad things had gotten, and where it was I was going. I'd like to think that I could drink again, but it scares me. I know now I've got no brakes, and whilst the gradient starts slow it gets steeper on the way down, and sooner or later I'll be careening down the hill at terminal velocity. Anyway, let's celebrate the good things about sobriety, it's really been a gift. I'll try to frame them all in the positive and pick out a few that don't get mentioned as frequently. - My phone is always charged. - I've followed through on everything I've needed to do on time, and where applicable, to a high standard. - I've read two books for pleasure, on top of what I need to do for university, and my usual dicking around on the internet. - The maths for me is complex, as it involves multiple currencies and booze at wildly different prices, quiet days and heavy days, and a poor ability to count. This said, a penny saved is a penny earned, and I'm up at least three-hundred and fifty euros if I'm up a cent. - Whilst booze made me chatty at night, sobriety makes me chatty in the day. I have clarity and confidence when it's most important. What's helped: - No La Croix for this Anglo on the continent, but I've discovered one part soda, one part pure fruit juice, and a dash of flavoured syrup is as delicious as any cocktail I knew; incredibly versatile to boot. A shame I'm not really happy with the idea of a ""mocktail"" shaker in the house. Maybe one day. - This is completely personal, and I know it wouldn't be something a lot of folks here would feel comfortable with, but spending time around drunk people has been a major reinforcing factor. When with friends, I've seen the lights go out around ten o'clock when it's time to leave. With strangers, well I was living in the centre of my city's party zone for a few weeks, and the aggression, vulnerability, vomit and inanity I witnessed held me strong at a tricky time. Thank fuck I'm out of there now! - I've moved town, and everyone I'm meeting doesn't know me. I tell folks I don't drink, and that I used to have a problem. It works a treat. I'm never pressured, and I know my new acquaintances will worry if I suddenly start drinking which is great for accountability. - I'm also returning to education, so I have a focus. I was so fucking drunk and high last time, it's great to be coming back with the tools to do the job properly. Anyways, longer than planned that, thanks if you made it to the end. It's had its ups and downs, and it's not always been easy. I hope it was cheering for those starting out, it's definitely been good in terms of motivating myself going forward. I'm out of the woods and onto the world map, tutorial stage is over and now I need to play the game. Big love to the SD massive, wouldn't have gotten here without you. This place is the best. ** Edited for flow and typos."
155,vulnerability,stopdrinking,empty shell,3,74rtd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/74rtd9/empty_shell/,2017-10-07 11:43:34,"This will be sort of long and not very happy and I sincerely apologize for anyone I bum out, but I have to get it off my chest. I used to be a very social, very happy person. I love talking about news, politics, books, movies, anything. Mind you, I'm not saying they were groundbreaking discussions, but I love love love talking to people. And now I don't have anyone to talk to. And I mean literally no one. A handful of friends I have alienated because I didn't want to bum them out with my recent struggles, so I avoided contacting them at all, and well, a flower not watered is a flower that wilts. My mom and sister I'm avoiding because in my sobriety, I am realizing that our communications are unhealthy, to put it mildly. My father is just....a person who, in the past has hurt me immensely with his alcohol addiction and has never apologized even after getting sober 3.5 years ago and is now just someone who lives in a another country. I have some friends whom I've talked to about what's going on, and they are understandably avoiding me. It's a lot. There are friends whom I want to hang out with, but I know if I do it cannot be a sober affair, and I don't want to go into details with them about everything because I'm scared I'll break down and expose my vulnerability and be left alone and helpless again. I have no one to talk to about my fears, successes, tribulations, interests. I have turned to living vicariously through others on reddit and in TV shows. Four days ago I got back on the workout horse and I was feeling so elated! I couldn't make it to the gym on wednesday, but didn't want to skip a day, so I ran around my basement like a chicken with its head cut off for half an hour and the whole time I was thinking about you guys. Then after cooling down, I laid down and meditated for ten minutes before taking a shower and cleaning up. The next couple of days I didn't do much, but was so proud of myself for just upkeeping what I had cleaned that night, and that felt like such a huge accomplishment. I was climbing out of the hole. The weekend is tomorrow and I'm dreading it because I know that like every other weekend, every ounce of self-respect I hold dear will evaporate when my husband picks up the kids and treats me like the waste of space he thinks I am. I can't find a therapist to see on weekends, and I can't afford hiring someone to watch the kids even for a couple of hours during the week. Not to mention, I'm afraid of the person I end up with following my last trial down that road (she wasn't bad, but there were many factors that would stress me out more while seeing her than help.) Anyway I feel literally like a sore (did I mention I burned off a couple thousand calories this week?) empty shell, and there's nothing more I want to do tonight than fill it with wine. I was going to make cookies, but I only have one egg and purposefully didn't go to the grocery store because I knew I was too weak to resist that aisle. So now it's late, the kids are in bed and I can't go out, so my empty shell will stay empty. You guys are literally the only people who know what I'm going through. I feel lonely and worthless and I just need a crutch, but don't know where to find it. I posted a couple days ago about a getaway, and got some responses, but alas, there's no room left this year in the places close to me. I even thought about going to Chicago for a couple of days (5 hr bus ride) but just thinking about the finances makes my head spin. Also, I know I'll be berated for leaving my husband with the responsibility for find childcare for a day on such short notice. Also, I really really really want to get divorced, but I feel like I should start seeing a therapist first, so that when my husband inevitably starts quoting my ""mental instability"" and ""hysterics"" (that's what he calls my period mood swings) to fight for custody I can have someone who can back me up. Did I mention he only calls ONCE during the week to talk to the kids but DEMANDS that they NEED to see him every weekend because he's their father? WOW I'm so so sorry for venting all of this to you all. I know you're not therapists, but I really have no one. And I don't want to break down again and drink because I know that it won't solve anything and it will just spiral me further into depression. So ok, the shell stays dry tonight, and hopefully tomorrow I can fill it with some more sweat at the gym. Or whatever. I know when I wake up to your kind responses my resolve for tomorrow will strengthen, so in advance, thank you. And thank you for the strength the past few months. I would not be here without you all."

Wont lie and say life is perfect and all is swell, but its moving in the right direction. Whizzing through The Sun and Her Flowers, by Rupi Kaur, and have already found my favourite passage from her new book that I picked up today : really resonated with my experiences in life recently... whether it be directly or indirectly. Perhaps some of you will find that as well  *It has been one of the greatest and most difficult years of my life. I learned everything is temporary. Moments. Feelings. People. Flowers. I learned love is about giving. Everything. And letting it hurt. I learned vulnerability is always the right choice because it is easy to be cold in a world that makes it so very difficult to remain soft. I learned all things come in twos. Life and death. Pain and joy. Salt and sugar. Me and you. It is the balance of the universe. It has been a year of hurting so bad but living so good. Making friends out of strangers. Making strangers out of friends. Learning mint chocolate chip ice cream will fix just about everything. And for the pains it cant, there will always be my mothers arms. We must learn to focus on warm energy. Always. Soak our limbs in it and become better lovers to the world. For if we cant learn to be kind to each other how will we ever learn to be kind to the most desperate part of ourselves.*"
157,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Weekend Writing: Embracing Uncertainty,18,769zmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/769zmt/weekend_writing_embracing_uncertainty/,2017-10-14 15:06:22,"I read this quote this week and I've been feeling teased and tantalized and...relieved by it. *""Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives won't have titles until much later.""* ~ Bob Goff The current chapter of my life is entitled ""Putting my own oxygen mask on first."" I'm in the midst of major uncertainty as my relationship of 30+ years finds its way to a new state of being that likely won't include remaining married, but we're still living our way into that place. Uncertainty and change evoke vulnerability for me and that's not comfortable, either. That being said, I am recently coming to have a sense of possibility and renewal, which allows me to think there is possibility for the next chapter to be beautiful. **What in your life feels uncertain? How can you embrace uncertainty in order to create the next chapter of your life? What do you need to do? What/who will help and what/who might get in the way? Even if you have to re-title it later, what would you like the next chapter's title to be?**"

I just had surgery &amp; before going into it I was super nervous cause I read all these things but didn't understand what I was going to go through. So, I thought I could make a thread for those who were going to have this experience. First off, I didn't think it would affect me. 1. I felt guilty, a massive amount of guilt (like first-day sober guilt) 2. I got angry, I was angry at everyone for everything 3. Those emotional things I thought I was dealing with and had accepted or come to an understanding.. well that all disappearing in a bundle of emotional vulnerability where I lost it. 4. I went off my SSRIs for a couple days (that was awful) That is just a few things. Luckily my husband was away on a work trip so my mom took care of me. Cause I had a lot of unreasonable anger come back at him. I think it would be good to prewarn your caregiver of the emotional rollercoaster that comes with surgery cause I completely forgot those happen even if my mother didn't &amp; my husband has never had surgery so he would have thought I was crazy again. Also, the terrifying thing of painkillers was it replicated me being drunk. I relived my rock bottom. It was terrifying feeling like I was trying to get sober but I physically need to drink to get past the withdrawals. The fear of if I didn't drink I would have DTs &amp; a seizure again. (Luckily I knew there was absolutely no chance of alcohol being in my system). Also, painkillers tend to make me relive my childhood trauma &amp; my night terrors that had been subsiding came back full force. But I waited for cause if it got better quitting drinking when my only other option was death. I could do it. I stayed sober."
159,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Today's the Day,2,6vbmai,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6vbmai/todays_the_day/,2017-08-23 01:07:01,"I've decided to stop drinking from today onward. I've tried to limit my alcohol intake before, but, gradually, it has increased again to where I have between 3-7 drinks once or twice a week (at least). Although this amount may not seem like much, I've found that this amount affects me greatly in terms of the following day's hangover, concentration and productivity levels, not to mention specific mental and physical conditions. Because I am prone to anxiety, I find that, if I've been out and something stressful happens, I might sleep walk and cause undue stress for my girlfriend (and anyone else nearby). It's at the point where I'm worried about our relationship, as I love her dearly. To be more specific, I went to a pub last night (I live in NE England, although I am American) and my anxiety was triggered when a friend's friend got really aggressive towards me and tried to pick a fight. Luckily, the bartender and my friend both intervened, but I was shaken afterwards and I left relatively quickly for my girlfriend's house. However, I had consumed approx 6 pints, and when I fell asleep, I apparently sleepwalked and (I'm ashamed to say) urinated on her floor, prompting her to clean it up (as I was still asleep). Unfortunately, she couldn't sleep for the rest of the night and now she's justifiably angry with me. These instances have occurred over the past 2 years, but, as nothing like that had happened for the past year, I thought that whatever stress I was under had finished (I've recently completed my PhD). I've spoken with my friend from last night, as well as another friend, and I've decided that it's best that I stop drinking, since my vulnerability to anxiety leaves me correspondingly vulnerable to future occurrences of the same type. One cannot guarantee that every time they go out will be tranquil, and one cannot guarantee that sleepwalking wouldn't be triggered through just a few relaxed drinks either. I'm also fully aware that I wouldn't have gotten into this mess if I had not gone out last night. So this is it, the beginning of my alcohol-free, clear and present days. Thanks for reading, and I hope to be active in this subreddit for the foreseeable future. "

My wife and I met on our first date at a bar. 5 beers (each) later, we were smitten. It's been mostly up, some down since then, but on June 25 after a particularly awful weekend, I swore off the stuff. She and I both come from a line of distinguished alcoholics, and I've decided that I've been to the top of the liquor/beer mountain and want to be the best father for my son I can be, and best partner for my wife that I can be. My wife still drinks, but only occasionally. However, she has used my vulnerability about being sober against me several times in arguments. She will say things like, ""you're just scared to go out and tell your friends you aren't drinking anymore"" or ""you've suddenly decided you're not drinking anymore, great!"". I think she is bummed because her drinking buddy is gone, hopefully forever. She asked me about my sobriety the other night with dinner and I told her it was going GREAT and she looked at me with a bit of disappointment. Guys and gals, I think I'm dealing with an alcoholic partner who secretly or subconsciously wants me to keep going with them. I just cant do it anymore. Anyone else deal with this? I will not drink with you tonight! "
161,vulnerability,stopdrinking,I Broke My Sobriety While Visiting A Friend This Weekend.,4,6i6us3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6i6us3/i_broke_my_sobriety_while_visiting_a_friend_this/,2017-06-20 00:47:05,"I had 73 days under my belt and knew that I would most likely break that sobriety streak - the longest streak I've ever had - during this trip. &amp;nbsp; I had an beer at a bar one night then the following night I had a glass of white wine at dinner with the same friends. It didn't get out of control at all! However, I do have a bit of anxiety now. It's like a sad void that I feel like I desperately need to fill right away. The trip was to New York City and part of the anxiety is because I'm sad that I'm back home now. The friend I was visiting is truly the greatest friend I've ever had the opportunity to meet. Also, it's New York and I essentially was a New Yorker for 3 full days: got a metro card, rode the subway, learned the railway lines, had a ton of options for food and entertainment e.t.c. It was an exciting experience like I've never felt before. It felt new, fresh, and warm. It felt like the first time I had a drink. &amp;nbsp; So being back home is bitter sweet. I wish I was back in New York and things were always fun and great and carefree and that I was with the best and most caring person I know (outside my family). Now that I'm back home, I remember why my alcohol problem got so out of control: I felt isolated. I felt like I had no friends here. I felt like alcohol would be a great substitute. Turns out, there's no substitute for life. There's no substitute for experience. There's no substitute for friendship. I have to be proactive. With this trip, I went out of my way to do something I've never done and that was be vulnerable and put myself out there to connect with a person I was interested in getting closer to as a friend and spend 3 days in a city I've never been in. My friend and this trip were both a reminder that I'm surrounded by some pretty amazing people that open me up to some pretty amazing opportunities. &amp;nbsp; **The challenge is to be proactive and never fear vulnerability or rejection or whatever is holding you back. Just do it!** &amp;nbsp; If I fix the issues that lead me to abuse alcohol three months ago, then abstaining from it moving forward or consuming it responsibly when I chose to will become easier. Even though I broke my sobriety, there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it isn't a freight train. It's the shine emanating from the many opportunities we all have available to us, all of which might give us a more happy and fulfilling life. We just have to reach and that takes effort. &amp;nbsp; So, it's been 24 hours since my last drink. I'm not sure how long it will last but I know that today I won't drink with you. I'll try and fix my underlying issues too so the road can be a bit more manageable, even after I stray away a little bit."

I left right afterwards for the rest of the week and came back on Tuesday to find my team in total chaos, with hurt feelings, thinking I didn't have their backs, etc. While on my trip, *I* hadn't been able to let it go, because I knew I'd done the wrong thing. I came back prepared to apologize to the two people and found I had to apologize to my whole team and ask for their grace. When I was drinking, I would never have admitted I was wrong, would never have allowed myself to be vulnerable in front of my direct reports, and would never have been able to turn something like that around the way I did. I *think* (only time will tell) that this will actually make us stronger as a team and create deeper trust in me as a leader. At least that's my hope. And if that happens, it will be because I owned my shit, and showed strength through my vulnerability. **For your writing consideration:** ***Tell us about owning your shit, if you can, and what impact that has had in your life.

I can't believe I'm actually posting. Last night, I pushed through a thousand pounds of discomfort and did the thing I hate the most - admitted vulnerability. I told my husband that I had to stop drinking, but that I don't want to at all and I don't know what to do. I started to cry (also something I hate). I told him that the medication I've been on for two months comes with a ""no alcohol"" label, and that, according to what I read online yesterday, I've really been playing with fire by ignoring it. We had a conversation about my mental health and how drinking impacts it (short-term happy, long-term sad - something I learned on this sub). This morning, over coffee, he looks at our empty wine rack and says, ""we need to get some wine - the rack looks empty"". He doesn't drink wine. That's my bag. (In addition to bourbon, vodka, tequila, and beer). I am so lost. In one month, I will be 40. I have been drinking since I was 12. I have two beautiful children. I am an artist. The idea of letting it go gives me tears just thinking about it. Drinking is my favorite thing to do. I'm terrified that my art will suffer. I will lose creativity in songwriting and conversation and painting and ideas in general. The next to last thing I want is to stop drinking. But the LAST thing I want is to continue ""living"" my life in a blur, with my mood dictating me instead of the other way around. This is my one chance at life. My one chance with my children. Tl;dr - I'm scared and don't feel supported. "

Starting work has thrown my old schedule into disarray; I have to get up earlier, stick to a travel schedule, walk about 10km a day getting to and from train stations, meet new people (people who have never known me as a drinker - bloody hell that is a GOOD feeling), learn a million new things a day, and find a way to make space in the day for self-care. It's exhausting and exhilarating, and I am doing it! I'm not doing it perfectly, and that's absolutely good enough. Anyway, I am off for my week away by myself tomorrow. The 'mindfulness retreat' itself was cancelled due to low numbers, but I figured I'll go anyway and use the time to practice mindfulness, breathe, do a few yoga sessions (just for the comedy value - I guarantee I will be the one to fart and fall over, probably at the same time), eat well, and learn to be by myself. I'm keen to check in here more often, too. As I said, I don't feel I need to (in that i am not feeling on the brink of drinking at all), but I do want to. If there is any way that I can help someone else here in the way that you all have helped me, by sharing my experience or being here to listen, that's want I want to do. An, of course, we all know drinking is a sneaky sneaky thing, and I need to be regularly among people who can offer help if I do need it. So, that's it for me today. I am packing my books (by the way, if you are interested, Brene Brown has some amazing books on vulnerability and shame that I have found insanely useful and insightful), lots of gym gear (ever the optimist), and cross stitch gear, and I am ready to do this thing! I am a little nervous, I've never been away by myself before, and I am not very good at socialising, or facing unknowns (what if they're all super-fit, happy, slim, chatty rich folk? What if I get lonely? What if I;m not perfect at everything? What if????) but I am going to do it anyway. Thank you all for being here, and I am proud to not drink with you today. Talk to you soon, friends! "
165,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Starting over or not?,13,6fvmje,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6fvmje/starting_over_or_not/,2017-06-08 05:10:50,"There seems to be a black/white view of the world when it comes to sobriety. We have a clean date, we consider any use as a relapse. But the text of the primary 12-step groups states ""we did not become addicted in a day, nor will we recover in a day."" Some paraphrasing but that's the jist of it. So my husband was hospitalized about 10 days ago. It was quite stressful &amp; I used opiates, not just to relieve physical pain, but to help me cope with the anxiety of my husband's vulnerability. Yet, even as I used, it was not the mindless oblivion of before. Rather I was able to observe myself more closely. It was similar to Grace's video of herself, deliberately drinking to objectively watch herself under the influence. While that was absolutely not my intention when I used, it became the consequence. I saw myself in an entirety different way. I was able to see my impairment, my ditherings, my loss of judgment and ability. I also knew that I would not continue to use. I gained valuable information about myself, information that I would not have believed without that specific data. So have my previous 58 days been a total loss? I can't believe that either. I have striven for a better understanding of myself and to that extent I have gained much. The information I gained last week adds to the database I'm accumulating. I found that knowledge once gained changes a person forever. I cannot go back to the unconscious person I was before, regardless of any substance use. That being said, I also cannot ignore the needs of my health. It's damaging to my body to use alcohol or abuse opiates. I want health: spiritual, emotional and physical. So I continue on my journey.

166,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Feelings: the other F-word,2,6gsc7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6gsc7v/feelings_the_other_fword/,2017-06-12 23:52:43,"Hello all, I'm not really sure what to write but I know I need to get this out, I feel like I'm spinning mentally, and although I am not currently craving a drink I feel like today is one of those days where a slip could happen if I'm not careful. I guess I could start out by telling you that I've never been very comfortable with emotions, or the feeling of vulnerability or weakness when they're expressed or I hit a breaking point. This has started getting better through the work I have been doing in sobriety, between my Step Work and I have recently started seeing a psychologist to work through some past trauma but I'm definitely still not comfortable expressing certain feelings, and quite frankly, they unnerve me. Today is one of those days. I'm extremely on edge and very unnerved. Yesterday was a mess, and after barely sleeping last night, I can feel myself unraveling at the seams. I can feel myself go from almost breaking down to going into autopilot and squashing down my emotions and feeling numb, almost zombie like. Yesterday, a friend of mine who was on my amends list passed away before I had the chance to try to make things right. The guilt has been overwhelming. I've spoken to my sponsor and another sober friend and they both have explained that maybe I wasn't meant to make a direct amends and that I can do other things to try and make things right, like go to the funeral, offer support to his friends and family, make a donation in his name, etc. Logically, I know that this all makes sense, but it hasn't stopped the feelings of sadness, regret and guilt. My friend also pointed out I was delaying on making certain amends, by which I mean I had the opportunity and just didn't take it and told myself I would try to the next time I saw the person, and maybe this was a lesson for me to take. In any case, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I didn't want to leave my bed, but I also didn't want to fall back into old habits of cancelling plans to have a pity party, which seems to have been reserved for nursing a hangover and regretting the things I had said or done the night before, and I didn't want to go back there after nine months and a bit of doing so well. In the end, I followed through with meeting with a friend (basically my sister) and my dad for dinner. That's when I got a call. My mom was in a panic, screaming. She lives in a town home and her neighbour two doors over (all in the same row as the house she lives in, by which I mean, attached to her house) had a huge fire. She was running around trying to get her pet and panicking asking if I could potentially have her and Oliver (the cat) stay with me. Of course I said yes, and I heard sirens, and she hung up. I tried calling her back but she didn't pick up. I was in an internal panic, trying not to freak out, trying to think rationally, trying to plan how to get her if needed, if I had everything she needed at my place, all while wondering if she was okay. An hour or so later I started getting updates. The fire was under control. Paramedics we're treating the neighbour for burns to his arms and face, the police had blocked off the street and taped off her home. They were waiting on the firefighters' inspection to see if they were allowed back into their homes. Fire and water damage affected every unit in the row, except my mom's, but there was so much smoke. They opened all the windows and brought in a ton of industrial fans to try and ventilate the house. My mom kept changing her mind about coming over. One minute she was, the next she was saying she was afraid if she didn't sleep at home that night she wouldn't be able to again in the future due to fear. I spent a lot of the night worried about the smoke and her asthma and just on edge. I don't feel like I've slept at all, I was tossing and turning so much. The only reason I know I got some sleep was the nightmares. I started having vivid flashbacks twisted with fictional situations, combining into some crazed nightmare, leaving me to wake to my own screams, sweaty and shaky. Now I'm at work. I don't know why I came in, I realize now I shouldn't have, but I feel like I needed the distraction and was afraid of being left to my own devices. I'm overcome with an assortment of emotions washing over me in waves, and I feel like I'm losing it. I'm going to call my sponsor on break, and have spoken to my boss and may leave early, but I just feel like I can't trust myself. I may not be craving a drink, but I know well enough to know I want to turn off these feelings, that a part of me wants to numb. I'm hoping that by putting this out there, getting it off my chest, and admitting how I'm feeling will be the first step toward setting my head straight. I plan to not drink with you today. I just need to breathe. Ps. I'm sorry if this is long, and appreciate anyone taking the time to read. I'm writing this on my cellphone so sorry about any formatting, spelling or grammatical errors. "

He is a great guy. He is honest and straightforward and, from what I can tell, only ever tried to be good to me. Something wasn't right for me, though, and even though I made the decision to leave, I've been wracked with fear, regret, and a feeling like I could have done more to reach across the aisle and connect with him more. Two weeks ago I reached out to him and asked him to consider reconciling because I realized that there may still be a way to salvage what we had, while building something stronger in the process. He is naturally fearful and cautious. I'm trying to be OK with whatever the result ends up being. So, I'm alone right now. I miss him. He's out at a festival all weekend with a bunch of our friends, having fun and seeing some of our favorite bands, and I'm at home by myself, trying to concentrate on homework and not crying. He didn't tell me not to come. He told me I was still welcome to join. I made the decision to stay here. And still, I feel so, so alone. Being lonely makes me want to drink. I know this. I try to distract with friends and Netflix. But all I really have right now are my thoughts, and boy are they domineering. I want something to take this pain away but I get the feeling I'm just going to have to go through this process and learn how to deal with it as a conscientious sober person. God, this sucks. What sucks even more is that many of the problems I've been facing have been popping up as a result of getting sober. They are things that I stuffed down for a long time, that I have only recently recognized as issues that need my attention. Things like trauma, depression, anxiety, trust issues, and feeling alone even when I'm in the company of people I love. I've ignored these things for so long that they've been rushing at me in waves and they feel like too much to handle sometimes. Thank god for therapy, I suppose. Regardless of whether he gives me another chance or not, I feel overwhelmed by the mountain I have yet to climb. I still have hope that he can see that I'm trying to offer my honest heart to him now, and I hope this gesture of vulnerability can help us start to re-build the trust that I broke. But I don't know. It's hard to tell at this point where his heart will land. I'm just alone. And being alone sucks right now. But I won't drink about it. I'll just keep on keeping on. &lt;3 "

I am staying sober for me, but they don't deserve the stress I put them through when am I drinking myself to death. I am very grateful for having the energy to take that [walk](URL today.. ten days ago I was crawling in my kitchen for water, because I was too exhausted from detoxing to stand. About a year ago I had to use the power cart at walmart for the same damn reason. Enough is Enough - I am tired of being beaten, broken, victim. I am strong and I am capable and I need to buck up. It is a beautiful lake and has a huge expression of the love our community has (the rainbox painted performance stage in honor of the Pulse victums) &amp; has some pretty cool art displayed.

During my two [meetings](URL today I came to realize that I do kinda have a ""higher power"" - its connecting with people, karma, the universe, the power of positivity. &amp; also that praying doesn't necessarily have to be praying.

It turned out to be no big deal, but I was so anxious &amp; upset by the time I got home.

Needless to say, wasn't feeling so hot Thursday morning and I was super-pissed at myself on top of it - it would have been day 10. So, okay....resetting my badge, yesterday was my new 1st day...lesson learned about vulnerability to stress. To keep this from happening again I confided in my husband about what I'm doing (not that he hadn't noticed me not drinking - probably it's been years since he came home to the sight of me without a wine glass in one hand and the bottle in the other) but I hadn't really talked to him. The reasons are complicated, probably for another subreddit. Suffice it to say that I was a little worried he'd be annoyed that I'd chosen this instead of trying to ""just cut back."" But I talked anyway and the conversation went well and he was really supportive and happy for me. And he confided he's been worried about his own consumption levels (he can moderate, though. I can't). worried about the kids seeing us sucking down wine all the time, worried about his health and my health, etc. So we're on the same page. And now I'm dusting myself off and getting back on this damn ornery horse, and I will enjoy not drinking with all of you out there tonight!"

It would have been before the summer after I graduated high school and I was 18. A couple months before I turned 18 I tried marijuana, and then alcohol after high school graduation. So really the last time I was completely clean for 100+ days consecutive was when I was 17. Then I went to college. I tried opiates, speed, molly, salvia, ecstasy, psilocybin , and cocaine. I did not use those abusively. I abused the alcohol and marijuana. I'm 28 now. I'm not exactly who the 17 year old me thought I was going to be. I have a strong tendency to binge drink and mix in other drugs when I do... but ask me any day what I'd rather be doing and I'll tell you: the gym, reading and studying, working at my job and supporting the families that I work with, pestering my brother to play disc golf with me, and walking around looking for some good coffee and someone for conversation.

It took me multiple attempts from last July to this January to be confident enough and to be able to ""handle it"" enough to not go back to old cycles. Anyway, these are some of those virtues of SD that are totally worth acknowledging and articulating again and again, because SD is a shining example of an authentic, cooperative, and supportive community: * A legitimate ""forum"" in the classical sense, where people are equally welcomed to hear and be heard. * An arguably community-wide disposition of wanting to improve yourself * Acceptance of vulnerability, relationships built through sharing of humbling experiences and self-reflection I'm 100% interested in hearing what anyone else may have to add to the short list that I started here... ... and thanks SD.

I wasn't aware that this sub existed until about 10 minutes ago when someone posted in askreddit about this community. I am a 27 year old male and I have finally come to terms that I have a drinking problem. It's not a good feeling when the loved ones around you tell you that they do not like who you have become and that you have a drinking problem, but even worse is the moment you stop denying it and accept it. It is incredibly humbling, scary, and real. I do not drink every day, and can go a few weeks sometimes without drinking, but my problem is, every time that I do drink I binge drink EXCESSIVELY. I am a 5'6"" male and I weigh 125 pounds. The other day I consumed 18 beers and 4 shots. I hardly remember any of it. I would say that 7 out of 10 times that I drink I black out. Every time I go to the bar I always get ""secret drinks"" when no one is looking because I know I will get yelled at. I literally have had to be carried to bed like a baby sometimes due to my blackouts. My girlfriend was crying last night because she just can't handle it anymore.

The really sad part is on the way to work this morning I actually thought of picking the alcohol over her and that is when I realized I really need to start getting my priorities straight. I'm scared. I feel vulnerable. I hate who I have become. Why can't I just drink normally like others? Why do I always have to take it so far? Am I a bad person? What do I do from here? All of my friends and family can drink normally and I don't know if I can be around them while being sober. The temptation is too great. Does that mean I have to stop being around them?

I thank you all for the encouragement, support, vulnerability, and reminders that I (we) are not alone. Tonight, I'm struggling. I know this is what I need to do for myself, and some days I'm really damn glad I'm doing it, but the last couple days it's been kinda hard. I have more-than-fleeting thoughts of drinking. Some days I have a lot of energy and feel like my body is restoring itself, other days I have a hard time getting out of bed. The biggest problem is crippling self-doubt that I didn't (fully) realize I was covering up with drinking. I'm experiencing what so many others talk about experiencing: realizing that without drinking, you don't know how to cope. Things that I would usually drink to cover up are more raw now. Eight-hour workdays are easier to get through because I have more energy (sometimes), but forty-hour work WEEKS are harder because there's not as much sense of a reward, and I don't wind down from the stress as well. I'm trying. I really am. I see a counselor. I'm on antabuse and neurontin. I drink La Croix and Sleepytime tea. I try to be gentle with myself. I read all of This Naked Mind. But there's STILL this part of me that just... can't let go. This part of me that feels wound up and empty at the same time. The worst is my lack of confidence. I write, and my dream is to publish a series of novels. It's not a passive dream. I have about 400,000 words written over 5 books (the last two as of yet unfinished) and the first and second one I've revised several times. I've tested the waters with agents, not expecting to get an offer of representation, just to get an idea of what I need to do and how much further I have to go. There's this part of me - always has been this part of me - that worries that I'm not only not good enough YET, but that I never WILL be good enough, that there's something fundamentally wrong with my writing, that I don't have what it takes. I feel like I'm kidding myself or that I shouldn't even call myself a writer. Drinking covered up a lot of things. Most of those things I knew I was covering up, on some level. But this... I mean, I knew I doubted myself sometimes. I knew there was still work to do and that I need to keep improving. But drinking muted those feelings, or at least turned the volume way down. Now there's nothing that takes the edge off. I'm overwhelmed with self-doubt and sadness. I feel embarrassed or hopeless at the slightest negative comment, even in the form of feedback, which is something we all need to get better. Logically I KNOW it's irrational, but knowing and feeling are two different things, and on that front I can't convince myself there's any point at all. I've been writing less and editing less, even though I still really REALLY want to do this and I've put so much work into it already... and I think it's because there's this part of me that doesn't think it will pay off anyway. Anyway, I went off on a tangent there and I apologize for that. But this is connected to drinking in that I don't know how to cope without it. I was covering up a problem with self-confidence that I knew I had - but I didn't know its severity, and that part just hit me like a drunk. The self-consciousness and doubt seems potent enough to be worse for my writing than the drinking was. I don't want to think that way... but sometimes I do. Also, I wanted to be healthier. Less calories = healthier, and more weight loss, which is something I need. Right now, that's the biggest thing keeping me on the wagon. Even with that, I keep thinking to myself... ""I can just eat less food, drink again a few nights a week instead of every day, and be healthier than I was before I stopped."" I have two problems with that: one, I'm pretty sure that's bullshit and doubt if I'd be able to moderate; two, that was SUPPOSED to be a big reason to stop drinking, but it wasn't supposed to be the only thing keeping me on board. I was supposed to stop drinking so I could focus better on my writing, too. It means so much to me. But if not drinking is going to make it even harder to achieve my ambitions than it already was... That's one huge facet of my motivation gone. On a cognitive level, I know I really need to not drink. I know that's what's best for me. But on an emotional level, sometimes I don't feel like it's worth it. I can't decide if I'm trying to fall off the wagon or trying to stay on. I'm almost at two weeks. Last time I relapsed, I was almost at one week. This is progress. But I don't want to use ""hey, I made progress at least!"" as an excuse to relapse again."

I received my 1 year chip at my AA meeting two days ago and opened up publicly on social media about my sobriety for the first time. I shared with a few close friends that I am an alcoholic when I started my recovery but overall kept things pretty private. I am private by nature and keeps things close to the vest. However, I was tired of sheepishly smiling if people would tell me to come by for a drink or joke about me drinking because some major event was coming up. I also wanted to let others know who may be sharing the same struggles that there was a way out of it. I felt relieved that I no longer was hiding my alcoholism. However, I started to feel that classic scenario of ""well you made it a year"" and all this new attention I was receiving was starting to make me anxious. I kinda knew what I was getting myself into by opening up to the public, but I was not prepared. The same feelings of anxiety and vulnerability started to creep up that I used to use as excuses to get home or go to a bar as soon as possible to suppress these thoughts. I started to regret that I went public with my sobriety and wanted to go back in my private cave. I texted a friend who's been with me on this journey since the beginning and I asked if he wanted to hang out. This was the best decision I could've made. I could've gone home alone with this knot in my stomach, but instead, I was with friends who I love. We ordered food, shared laughs, and my anxiety went away and I was at calm again. Those feelings of anxiety changed to feeling proud of myself. I have severe low self esteem but I honestly felt proud. Since then, I've had people text me and send me messages in private sharing their struggles with me and sharing their stories. One friend has reached out for help and I offered to assist in any way possible. We're hopefully meeting for coffee soon. I realized a few months ago that the physical act of not drinking alcohol is just a part of my recovery. It's a very large part, but it's just a piece of the puzzle for me. I have a lot to address about my emotions and thoughts that I used to suppress with alcohol. I wanted to say how grateful I am to have found this subreddit. I read it every morning on my way to work and I find reading the stories of others struggling with the disease to be incredibly powerful. I wanted to thank all of you for sharing. Forever grateful. "

I am over the moon. So hey, thank you. In the beginning I thought I'd ""maybe try out a couple of weeks"" sober. I'd really hurt my liver and was still trying to scare myself straight, thinking this was the only way I'd get myself to stop. I had no idea that what I really needed was to hear the truth. Your truths, and then my own. Your vulnerability and willingness to share has been so transformative for me. I am a completely different person, having read your confession posts about stashing empties, about being too drunk to care for someone in need, about cluelessly treating their most beloved like absolute shit, about the way alcohol addiction affects your life, even during the hours you are sober... To see other people take the reins and say, ""Hey, I'm an alcoholic, and I have NOT been my best self. But I want to change. I am TRYING to change."" is beyond beautiful, inspiring, admirable. It is the epitome of the human experience. The definition of awesome. I was raised by/among people who are extremely unhealthy and unwilling to admit mistakes and failures. Everything is rug-swept and they all just keep spinning, spiraling, while ferociously defending (literally to death) that everything is perfectly fine. Here, there is no room to grow, heal, or live again. Thank you for offering me asylum from this sickening mentality. I'm rambling and I apologize. I just need you to know you have each contributed to saving my life. And I am so very proud of you all, it makes my heart ache in the most drippingly sweet way. Thank you, SD. I genuinely love you all. I won't be drinking with you today."
175,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Monday's Quote: Start Here,7,5xrgpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5xrgpj/mondays_quote_start_here/,2017-03-06 16:08:09,"*""Let yourself be gutted. Let it open you. Start here.""* ~ Cheryl Strayed (AKA Dear Sugar) **What it means to me:** This is how I know I'm doing my work, because I feel gutted, and then, open. In my vulnerability, I soften, which, in turn (oddly enough) makes me clearer and stronger. The more I get feedback on the impact of this soft strength, the more committed I am to nurturing it. Which means...being gutted over and over again as I face those things that get in my way. It's a cycle (sometimes it feels like a vicious one), but each time I actually allow myself to soften into it, I end up feeling grateful."
176,vulnerability,stopdrinking,a long-ish excerpt from daring greatly (bren brown) that i thought might be appreciated here,3,5xul4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5xul4c/a_longish_excerpt_from_daring_greatly_brené_brown/,2017-03-07 04:38:40,"this book is all around fantastic and i highly recommend it. there's a section specifically on numbing to sidestep vulnerability, from low-level poor coping mechanisms to full-blown addiction. i thought this was an interesting analysis and that y'all might appreciate: &gt; Having spent years working closely with addiction researchers and clinicians, I had guessed that the primary driver of numbing would be our struggles with worthiness and shame: We numb the pain that comes from feeling inadequate and ""less than."" But that was only part of the puzzle. Anxiety and disconnection also emerged as drivers of numbing in addition to shame. As i'll explain, the most powerful need for numbing seems to come from combinations of all three--shame, anxiety, and disconnection. &gt;The anxiety described by the research participants appeared by to be fueled by uncertainty, overwhelming and competing demands on our time, and (one of the big surprises) social discomfort. Disconnection was tougher to nail down. I thought about using the term *depression* rather than *disconnection*, but as I recoded the data, that's not what I heard. I instead heard a range of experiences that encompassed depression but also included loneliness, isolation, disengagement, and emptiness. &gt;Again, what was really powerful for me, personally and professionally, was seeing the strong pattern of shame threading through the experiences of anxiety and/or disconnection. The most accurate answers to the question about what drives numbing sound more like the answers to, ""What's your sign?"" *Anxiety with shame rising. Disconnection with shame rising. Anxiety and disconnection with shame rising.* &gt; Shame enters for those of us who experience anxiety because not only are we feeling fearful, out of control, and incapable of managing our increasingly demanding lives, but eventually our anxiety is compounded and made unbearable by our belief that if we were just smarter, stronger, or better, we'd be able to handle everything. Numbing here becomes a way to take the edge off both instability and inadequacy. &gt; With disconnection it's a similar story. We may have a couple of hundred friends on Facebook, plus a slew of colleagues, real-life friends, and neighbors, but we feel alone and unseen. Because we are hardwired for connection, disconnection always creates pain. Feeling disconnected can be a normal part of life and relationships, but when coupled with the shame of believing we're disconnected because we're not worthy of connection, it creates a pain that we want to numb. &gt; One step beyond disconnection is isolation, which presents real danger. Jean Baker Miller and Irene Stiver, relational-cultural theorists from the Stone Center at Wellesley College, have eloquently captured the extremity of isolation. They write, ""We believe that the most terrifying and destructive feeling that a person can experience is psychological isolation. This is not the same as being alone. It is a feeling that one is locked out of the possibility of human connection and of being powerless to change the situation. In the extreme, psychological isolation can lead to a sense of hopelessness and desperation. People will do almost anything to escape this combination of condemned isolation and powerlessness."" &gt; The part of this definition that is critical to understanding shame is the sentence ""People will do almost anything to escape this combination of condemned isolation and powerlessness."" Shame often leads to desperation. And reactions to this desperate need to escape from isolation and fear can run the gamut from numbing to addition, depression, self-injury, eating disorders, bullying, violence, and suicide. the book goes into details about how to work through this and the importance of vulnerability in terms of creativity, productivity, and positive relationships. highly recommend!!! it has been an enlightening read in early sobriety, and a nice complement to recovery work.

177,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Day 103 - stepping up the vulnerability game,18,5yvtz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5yvtz8/day_103_stepping_up_the_vulnerability_game/,2017-03-12 11:06:48,"I am working on a cross-stitch piece as a gift for some lovely friends who will be tying the knot (pardon the stitch-related pun) next week. I've made two attempts that I trashed, and have made it three quarters of the way through the third try. I've put many hours into it. It looks pretty good, but it's not perfect, and I'm worried that it will be noticeably asymmetrical once it's in the frame. I NEVER make things for people, I have no faith in my skills (I only just started cross stitch about a month or so ago), and I'm now wondering if I've bitten off more than I can chew here. I don't want to give them something they'll think is tacky or feel awkward about. But I've put so much into this thing that sheer stubbornness is making me follow through with it. What on EARTH am I thinking? The stupid bravado of sobriety is surely somewhat to blame here. ""Oh, yeah, I'm doing new things, finding new hobbies. Who WOULDN'T want a piece of my crappy amateurish work to treasure as a memory of their special day?"" Ugh!!! But, I've also been reading about vulnerability recently, and I guess this is one way to put myself out there a bit more. Take the risk, hope that they won't have to pretend to like it, and hope that they know it was (clumsily) made with love. I'm extremely anxious about the whole thing. And that leads to more anxiety - am I going to be so stressed about it that I end up drinking at the wedding to avoid the stress and embarrassment? Good heavens, having written this all out I realise how silly I'm being. At worst, they'll pretend they like it and I probably won't ever know they're lying out of kindness. I need to stop sewing, chill the fuck out and go to bed!"
178,vulnerability,stopdrinking,A One Year Letter,30,5p40qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5p40qp/a_one_year_letter/,2017-01-21 01:01:51,"Below is a letter I sent to someone that I have known since July, but did not share why I didn't drink. As I quietly celebrate my anniversary today, I wanted to share this with the community that helped make this magical year possible. I will not drink with you today! My raspberry leaf tea bag has a single word written on the dunking paper attached to the string: pause. As the twinkling lights from the Christmas tree glimmer in my glasses (I feel the need to keep it up a little longer, as it gives me joy), I answer the call to put into written words these swirling questions, thoughts, and anything else that flows through my fingertipsall to share with you. A year previous, my Christmas decorations were also up, for very different reasons. My house was trashed, I had not put together any of the toys I had purchased for my son, and my life was quickly falling apart. I was an absent parent. I had no close friends, no one texted me with the exception of my mother, and I hated who and what I had become. I have not discussed with you the difficulties I had with alcohol, only telling you that I no longer enjoy drinking. That is, of course, a version of the truth that leaves out the sordid details. In four days, I will quietly mark my one year anniversary from my last blackout session. One whole year sober, and vastly changed for the better. I drank at least a bottle, often more, of wine every single evening for six years. Not a day passed when I didnt pass out in the evening. I was often still drunk in the morning as I drove to work, praying that the gate guards never smelled it emanating from my skin; I would usually start my hangovers at 1000 in the morning, when the buzz finally began to wear off. The workers at the various liquor stores knew me well, but never commented on my daily extravagant hauls. No one knew how bad it had gotten, as I wasnt close to anyone. My mother is a wine drinker, and was married to my alcoholic father, but said nothing (she still claims that I probably didnt really have a problem, and I choose not to argue with her). By some miracle, no one at work suspected a thing, even with my frequent absences and horrible morning bathroom issues. For many years, I romanticized my drinking, believing it was a hobby and adult pleasure that enhanced my life and made me culturedin reality, it made me addicted and miserable. In the last year of boozing it up, I began trying to find ways to control and moderate my drinking, establishing schedules and limits, trying various amino acid supplements to curb the cravings, doing 30 day cleanses to reset my tolerance, on and on. One of the last ditch efforts I made was to begin drinking liquor types I didnt care for (vodka, gin) in an effort to drink lessit didnt work, of course. It just made me drunk and angry. None of the moderation efforts worked, and I began to slowly understand that living this way isnt normal. Normal drinkers dont panic when it comes to the long evening, dont tremble in shame and anticipation at popping the nightly cork or opening the wine box spout. Normal drinkers dont hear from their children that they never see their parents without a wine glass in their hands. Normal drinkers dont stress out at a night at the bar, desperate to get home safely and consume their real fill where no one can see them. The final straw was the weekend morning drinking that began to creep into my routine. I found myself dosing my coffee with Irish cream, or mixing up a bloody mary or three. I started taking drunken naps in the afternoons, with my child wandering into my bedroom to check on me. I grew ever more distant, and he began to withdraw from me, begging me not to stop at the liquor stores on the way home. On the 20th of January last year, I stumbled across a reddit site called stopdrinking while looking at something totally unrelated. I read through the threads and stories of peoples experiences, and realized that this was an online community of people like myself that desired to quit, but didnt know how. The rule for membership was simple: only post when sober. There was also a recommendation to post a daily proclamation not to drink for the next 24 hours. The site has a tracker for the number of days in which you are a member, with different icon achievements for a week, 30 days, each month, and a year. I posted my affirmation, read a shit ton about what I could do to keep myself busy, and began to stop drinking one day at a time. The first two weeks were hellish, but with a crap ton of ice cream and herbal tea, I made it through. I began to replace my night drinking with other habits: writing in my journal, taking baths, and listening to music. The baths are still a central part of my recovery, and might remain so for quite some time (hence why my surgery restrictions against bathing were so unexpectedly difficult, and why the narcotic they gave me scared the living hell outta me). I stocked up on the sparkling water flavors and foods that took time to prepare and were good for my body. Slowly, slowly, I began to feel again. Feeling again is really similar to nerves waking up after a traumatizing injury. The first tinglings are terrifying, because you dont know how intense its going to get, and your imagination begins to have its way with you. But with enough time, you begin to believe that no matter the feeling, you are experiencing it with a vivid clarity that borders on a mystical experience. Emotions are still rather sacred to me, truth be told. Happy or sad, mad or bored, it is all divine and rather astonishing. When I met you, I had passed a number of first time sober milestones in my life. I had never had sex with someone for the first time (or usually thereafter) sober, believe it or not, and had certainly never been on a sober first date. I had my first alcohol-free vacation as an adult in the mountains, even while my family drank wine around me. I still have sober milestones often; these recent holidays were a success, and last night, I went to a bar for the first time. Those writings and poems to you were the first Id penned clear-headed, and I was shocked to discover that I am just as good of a writer. As I sit and type this out, Im still so thankful that this gift did not leave me. After all, I had somehow managed to complete my Bachelor and Masters degrees with 4.0 GPAs while utterly shitfaced the entire time. But what gives me pause tonight, more than anything, are the changes in myself and the connections I have made with others. I now have close friends who love me, and tell me so often. After the summer of tears (oh, I have never cried so much in my life, if youll recall), my emotions are fairly stable and reliablebut the expansive joy I often feel is far more priceless than any sip of wine I ever savored. I love my body, most days, and feel proud of who I have become. I know, as the child of an alcoholic, that it will take time to repair my bonds with my son, as I was functionally absent for many years of his life. But we are taking steps to heal him, and I am hopeful for a good outcome. And I got to know you, of course. I didnt know how to tell you about this part of me before now, honestly, as I was still processing it when we began spending time together. Everything I read advised that dating in the first year of sobriety is a patently Bad Idea , and I can see why in some ways. I had no clue who I really was without the crutch of hazy drinking, and it was incredibly difficult to get to know myself while trying to reconcile this new me in the context of others. Even so, I think I went about it the right wayyou and I have certainly traveled through some wonderful and rough moments, and even when my heart was tearing in half, I still didnt reach for the bottle. On Friday, I want you to be one of the few people who know why it is incredibly important day for me. Other than the aforementioned website, I have not used any outside services or step programs, only a belief that a completely sober me is a better me. I am far more me than I have ever been, and as scary as this path can be, it has made me feel levels of ecstasy and vulnerability that I never dreamed possible. Most of all, I am beyond excited to see what lies ahead in the coming year, as it just keeps getting better and better. I hugged 25 people that came to my birthday party last nightI hope to be a shining light in each and every one of those beloved people. Many of them, including you, have never known that previous drunk womanand Id like to keep it that way, one day at a time. "

Or what I hope normal will be for me. I started learning cross-stitch, and I'm terrible at it. As I should be; I've not done it before, and I need to make mistakes so I can see what to do and what not to do. I received feedback on the bid that we didn't win, and realised that I have a lot to learn if I'm going to submit winning bids. Fortunately I'm going to a seminar on bid writing next week, so I'm glad I've got the feedback, I can use it to focus on learning what I need to work on. I gave a presentation to the Board of my industry association. I don't know how it went, but I showed up and did it. Speaking in front of groups is not easy for me so I've asked for feedback. I watched a really interested Ted Talk about vulnerability, shame, and whole-ness. My counsellor and my dentist both cancelled their appointments due to illness. And I had to not attend a forum because I was ill too. I reconnected openly and honestly with some good friends. Another friend asked me to draw on my calligraphy skills to write up some song lyrics for him. I realised that a couple of people on SD haven't been around, and I worry for them. And I miss them. I missed my husband who was on his second business trip in as many weeks, so I set up a weekly date night with him. I was lonely, and so I enjoyed my own company. I watched the inauguration and remembered watching Obama's a lifetime ago with very different feelings. I meditated, I took my medication, I wrote in my journal, I tried to eat healthy. I did my laundry, i checked in here, I changed and washed the bedding after the cat threw up on it. I cleaned up the kitchen and did some shopping. I got my SMART Recovery handbook in the post. Unexpected things happened, and some were fun, some were interesting, some were boring, some were challenging. And expected things happened too, some were fun, some were interesting, some were boring, and some were challenging. This is becoming my normal, and I love it."

Issues with physical health, mental health, vulnerability, anger, uncertainty, work issues, effort, effort, effort. Tonight when writing my list of three things that made today amazing, I had to dig deep to find something. All I could think of was that I showed up to hospital for my biopsy, I wore my cozy bobble hat (not during the biopsy, obvs), and I didn't overreact when I realised that my business partner may have been lying to me. Upside, I had a little chuckle when the doctor, as he was doing his paperwork before he started poking about my cervix, complained that he couldn't find his pen. It didn't exactly fill me with confidence, so I was relieved to note that he was still wearing his watch and wedding ring at the end of the procedure."

It doesn't leave, it's been a dark speck that I have ignored for so long, but now I am ever so slowly turning to face it. I am not ready to dissect it and see what it's made of yet, but I am looking at it. Thinking about what it might be made of, turning it over and over, holding it up to the light. And researching it. A week or so ago I came across a couple of Ted Talks that really made me stop and think. Brene Brown has done two Ted Talks, the first on vulnerability and the second on how shame and how it relates to vulnerability. Absolutely hit the nail on the head for me, and it gave me a real foothold into understanding vulnerability and shame. I thought I'd include them [here](URL and [here](URL (I hope those links work - I am so bad at this stuff!) Anyway, I thought these videos might be useful for others. Please do let me know your thoughts if you watch one or both, I am keen to understand this stuff from as many perspectives as possible.

Eighty days of waking up with a commitment to not take that first drink, and actually following through on it. I have made that commitment for years, but I have only followed through on it for the last 80 days. That's what made the difference. And it has been equal parts simple and difficult. Simple - Do not pick up the first drink. And I will be honest, that was easier than I thought. I haven't been hugely tempted. I am extremely aware that I have had an easier time of it than others here, and I am incredibly grateful for that. Difficult - Changing everything else in my life. Creating better routines, finding productive ways to spend my time, exploring the issues I was trying to drown out with alcohol, working out how to move past my husbands' drinking, learning to be mindful (damn that's tricky!), trying to find out who I am. Just showing up and facing what the day brings. And it turns out that difficult is not necessarily a negative thing. The actual process of going through all of those things has been interesting, educational, liberating, and even fun. And the results have been absolutely extraordinary. So much more than I could have imagined. There is more to me than I ever thought, and it turns out I am not nearly as awful as I thought. I am good person. I have reasons to be proud of myself. I am not my mistakes, and through this journey I am learning greater empathy, I am learning to be more aware of myself and the world around me, and I am learning that vulnerability is not a weakness. In some ways, I am incredibly lucky - I get to see the world with fresh eyes, I get to forgive myself and let things go, and I get to be a part of this incredible community of other brave souls who face the difficult every day because we know there is more to us than drinking. Thank you, everyone, thank you for showing up here and sharing your stories, offering support, reaching out for help, making me laugh, cry, and think.

I need to lay down some truth here for accountability purposes. I've been feelin' the blues for about a week now. A couple of days ago, I was looking around the kitchen for something and came across a bottle of vodka that my wife squirrel'ed away as a kindness to me. My hand was shaking as I took a swig, and poured the rest down the drain. When I fail/fall I try to ask myself where/why I went wrong and what I can do different next time. What have I learned about myself: Depression makes me want to drink, drinking makes me depressed. I'm more vulnerable to take that stupid swig when my mood is in the dumps. Self defeating cycle begins. Luckily this time, I knew right after I'd done it that there was no way in hell I wanted to go down that rabbit hole again. I have not touched any since. So I guess I learned that lesson - one drink is too much (as we say in these parts), and that the blues are a sure indicator of my vulnerability to drink. What will I do different next time? Pour it out immediately and ask questions later I guess. Put something / anything between the opportunity to drink and actually putting it to my lips. Go for a walk, check in with SD, text a friend for accountability. Maybe promise myself that I can drink tomorrow if I REALLY want to, and hope that when tomorrow comes I deal with it appropriately then and there. I dunno, any other suggestions or experiences along these lines? Not drinking today!!! Join me if you will. EDIT: One more thing. I have not reset my counter because my number inspires me to keep going. Of course the immediate goal is +1, but I'd like to see triple digits and beyond someday.

187,vulnerability,stopdrinking,My 4 Pillars of Recovery,19,5g9tn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5g9tn0/my_4_pillars_of_recovery/,2016-12-04 01:41:26,"Someone for whom I have a ton of respect showed me a little laminated piece of paper he keeps in his wallet. He has had it in there for over 20 years now. He showed it to me a few years ago and I loved it so much I took a picture of it. It is the screen saver on my phone. I tried to apply these 4 principles every day: 1) **You, Not me:** This is designed to remind me during the day that, in most of my interactions, I need to think about the other person first. My default position has usually been one of selfishness. If I try to think of the other person first, my interactions tend to go much better. 2) **Maybe They're Right:** I tend to always want to be right. It is a really excellent reminder to consider another person's position. When I do this I remain *teachable* and teachability is one of the greatest positives to my recovery. A closed mind is very hard to improve. Not only that, when I apply this principal in non-recovery situations, I find that I am a much better attorney and worker. 3) **Take Risks:** I love this one. It was explained to me by this gentleman that this does not mean set up your extension ladder on a patch of ice to clean the gutters. This means, in terms of our every day interactions, don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Ask someone to coffee; send a note to that person you admire but might be intimidated by; ask him out; open yourself up to vulnerability and rejection. These things are all part of life and, when we do get hurt or rejected, we will always learn and grow from it. 4) **Be Grateful:** And, above all else, live your life with humility and graciousness. You want a solid support group for your recovery? Well, then, let those people who are out there, willing and able to support you, know that you appreciate everything they do. Use your humility to truly thank them and others for all they do in this world When we are grateful, we are much less likely to blow up or fly off the handle. That customer was rude and you want to explode? How about being thankful that you have your shitty job today and you can put gas in your car? When we live our lives in this manner, it shows outwardly to others. Think about it...who would **you** rather hang out with the guy who always believes the world is fucking him over or the person who is grateful every day for what she has? Anyway, I have no idea if this means anything to anyone but I do know these 4 things have been incredibly important in helping me to grow in my recovery the last few years. I wish I had been introduced to them in my first year of recovery. I hope you all have a great day!"

I am about to go to my main meeting and am worried that the political fallout might trickle in. Most people are good about observing the traditions and 'rules' about keeping politics out, but this is clearly not just a political thing, it's a world-impact, emotional, distressing thing for many. It's almost like - I worry that people who are ""down"" about the results cannot NOT talk about why, and then the others will shoot them down. If something in the world is making you feel emotionally uncomfortable, that's what drives a lot of people to a point of vulnerability. Have any groups been splitting off?"

You become ever thinner and more brittle inside, until even the slightest emotion bowls you over. One hug, and you think you're going to shatter and be lost.' If Jordan ever needed a piece of fatherly advice, Perdu would tell him: 'Never listen to fear! Fear makes you stupid.'""* ~Nina George, The Little Paris Bookshop **What I get from it:** This epitomizes my experience over the past few years. I have been living with fear from so many things, and trying to protect myself from feeling the fear, that I am afraid I may shatter if I allow myself to feel vulnerable. I used to use alcohol to numb the fear or deny it, so without that coping strategy, I am aware of how much it drives my life. I'll be starting a new job in a couple of weeks, working with a very vulnerable population, and I *want* to feel my vulnerability, to some extent, because it's from my vulnerability that I can find my compassion. So, it looks like I've been being really stupid and perhaps I *need* to fall apart a bit so I can pull myself back together."
191,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Went to see an astrologer in preparation for starting my new job,6,5dgnis,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5dgnis/went_to_see_an_astrologer_in_preparation_for/,2016-11-18 03:18:38,"*TL;DR: Astrology reading and implications for my life and new job. Bottom line: don't drink; increase self-awareness, self-acceptance and self-compassion.* I'm getting ready to start a new job week after next in an organization that I really respect. I did a funny/weird/*woo-woo* thing yesterday and went to see an astrologer because I wanted someone who knew nothing about me and came to his information in a way I have absolutely no understanding of to give me a hit of what's been going on in my life. I've done this a few times before and have found it eerily accurate. A lot of what he said didn't mean a whole lot to me (especially anything about *x* planet and *y* constellation or conjuncts, etc...I know absolutely nothing about astrology). He looked at my birth chart and said that it was likely that 1) I had felt extremely ""different"" growing up (*check*), 2) that I had undergone significant childhood trauma (*check*), and 3) that I had little tolerance for BS (*check*). Also that my chart indicated someone who might deal with this sense of being so different that I might turn to addictive patterns (*check*). He said I was likely to be highly sensitive emotionally (*check*) and that I may have compensated for that by creating a hard shell around me, like a lobster (*check*). Now -- the irony of this metaphor is that a few years ago I was at a women's retreat and that was *exactly* the image that came up for me; I was a lobster, soft and gooey on the inside with a hard exo-skeleton to protect myself. When he said it, I sort of shook my head like ""where did that come from?"". He proceeded to go to the exact week five years ago to tell me that a specific astrological event happened that is often considered a ""destroying incident,"" metaphoric, of course. Except, it was the week when I literally almost died. OK, so I'm giving him a little more credibility as he tracked the fall-out from that and it aligned with multiple events in my life where I felt like everything I knew/had was being destroyed. On to *now* -- getting fired this summer really threw me for a loop and I've spent much of the summer and fall taking stock of what to take from that into my life and into my next, now new, job. What's been clear is that my exo-skeleton has hardened even more after events in the past few years and that caused me to have reactions that were even more disconnected from my heart, which didn't serve me well in a work environment, especially as a woman, because like it or not, we're supposed to be the ""gentle sex."" The astrologer said that in the next couple of years, leading up to an event in January 2019, I have the opportunity to have a re-do (my words) and to ""soften"" my shell to balance out my vulnerability and my hardness. Bottom line -- my drinking was a strong contributor to an intensive re-fortification of my exo-skeleton over the past few years. Feel vulnerable? *Drink.* Feel hurt? *Drink.* Feel judgmental? *Drink.* So my challenge moving into my new job is: Feel vulnerable? *Feel vulnerable and speak to it.* Feel hurt? *Say so.* Feel judgmental? *Find the self-judgment and deal with that.* I need to have compassion and create space for myself before I can do that for others. Drinking decreased my capacity for self-compassion and self-acceptance. As I move into this new job, I want to maintain not just my sobriety, but my willingness to look at myself and do/be better. When I interviewed for this job, I said that **I want to do *good* work, *well*.** I mean this in relation to both my personal work and in this new organization; not drinking is key."

During the weekdays, I would come home and cook dinner while polishing a bottle of wine. Every Friday afternoon, it was routine for me to greet my wife (then fianc) with a handle of Jack Daniels (instead of flowers) and make sure it was polished come Sunday. No exceptions. Additionally, I began smoking cigarettes while driving to work, prior to attending court, and in some cases before and after client meetings. I stopped exercising (because I had no time), and my diet primarily consisted of Chinese takeout and pizza. It nearly destroyed me and broke my heart. Without question, I was killing myself slowly, but surely. Ironically, I ignored the all-too familiar warning signs. After all, I lost several close friends in the legal industry because they failed to address their depression, anxiety, and addiction issues. All things considered, why would I neglect my mental and physical wellness? Simple, lawyers like myself, are taught never to show weakness or vulnerability, as their jobs partially depend on maintaining this impenetrable faade of resilience. I was frightened of the scenario that word would get out that I was seeking professional help, and my career would come to an abrupt end. I realized the job environment was the cause of this and stepped away from a six figure job. I confessed to my family and wife about my problem, and went cold turkey. The withdrawals were unreal. I had to stay away from triggers, and focused on physical and mental wellness. Candidly, I spent the next year or so saddled with confusion, self-doubt, anger, and regret. Rather than wallow in a state of depression, I chose sobriety as my vehicle to regain my clarity and confidence. During this long period of introspection, my creative juices began to flow once again and I finally discovered my purpose. Today, I coach and counsel attorneys and professionals who suffer from alcoholism/addiction/depression and may be seeking a career transition. Paying it forward is my therapy and keeps me sober :) How do you stay sober?"

Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joythe experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light. ~Bren Brown **What I get from it:** I used alcohol to lessen my sense of vulnerability by numbing my emotions. I hate the feeling of vulnerability. It makes me feel, well, *vulnerable,* like the soft side of my belly is open for whatever wicked teeth are out there ready to devour me. Even so, I understand that in vulnerability is perhaps where my greatest strength lies. When I choose to be less afraid, less defensive, or less suspicious, then the possibility arises for greater awareness, deeper connection, and perhaps even a lightness of being that feels rare to me. Not being numbed by drinking allows me the opportunity to stop my automatic shut-down and decide if being vulnerable might actually be in my better interest in the moment."

I'm a loved one, looking for some insight from this community. My boyfriend detoxed at the hospital on Monday after about a month of serious drinking (he's been at it many, many years, but I'm newer to this). He was given Librium to take for a few days and we went home. I was able to stay with him through to the the next afternoon, when I had to go to work. He lives with someone he met in recovery, the idea being that they'd 'keep an eye on each other'. I spoke with this roommate about leaving my boyfriend in his care for a few days (I work live-in shifts 2x/wk). He seemed like he'd mostly be around, and having been a former addict, I assumed he'd be pretty on top of things. Well, he wasn't. He was gone for hours at a time and even left $ so my boyfriend could 'get out of the house, go get some food'. It isn't surprising what happened next, straight back to drinking. He took off the next morning (yesterday) and aside from a few texts, no word and no idea where or how he is. So, my question: I'm feeling pretty angry towards this roommate and I want to understand if my anger is justified. I do understand that drinking is ultimately a choice, but considering these particular circumstances, I really don't think my boyfriend was capable of making decisions at this very vulnerable time. He was sober for a day, day and a half maybe, if it counts while he was on Librium. The day he started drinking, perhaps the moment, was when he ran out of Librium and to my mind, faced with the returning anxiety and the long-lasting fog of his last drinking binge, I don't at this point believe he should be held particularly accountable for his 'decision making' (at that point, it seems more like a physical impulse). As a recovered addict, I really thought his roommate would be there for him, would understand the particular vulnerability of that space, and would keep a hawk eye on him until I got back and we got him into a meeting and all the other supports we had planned. I don't feel like I'm angry just for the huge existential sake of it, I feel angry very directly towards this person who in my opinion really fucked up. When he called me Thursday afternoon, finally, he told me what had happened and said 'could you please not contact him for a bit so hopefully he can keep it together and get his paycheck and bring me the rent. I don't want him to get worked up'. The rent! So fucking important! This is a man who has been hospitalized for a suicide attempt in the past and numerous times for near-lethal drinking. He was near-lethal when we got him in Monday and that was before he assumed, as I'm sure he does now, that he's lost me, his home, and his job. Please help me understand if my anger is misplaced. At the end of the day, blame does not help anything but looking honestly at a situation can at least teach us all something. I know you all have a much better understanding of that specific space between detox and getting supports in place, and I'm really curious about accountability at that time. Thanks."

As an alcoholic/addict, actually taking care of myself was the LAST thing on my mind. I wanted to feed my addictions, to the detriment of my health in all aspects..mental, physical, spiritual, and social. Now that I'm sober, I've had to learn how to stop self-hate and putting myself down, and start caring for myself. As with yesterday's post, I used many different sources for the info below..I DID NOT WRITE ALL OF THESE myself, I wrote some and compiled the resources into a list. Please share/add ideas of your own in comments! ************************************************** *There are so many things we have no control over. Practice releasing people, situations, and things by repeating, Thats not in my job description! You will gain freedom and some time for yourself when you quit worrying about everything you cant do in the first place.  Rosemary OConnor* Developing a self-care plan will help you think about the small steps you can take in your own life to build your resilience and reduce your vulnerability to compassion fatigue. **Self care practice should address all of my needs: Physical, Social, Psychological, Spiritual and Financial.** **BIOLOGICAL/PHYSICAL SELF-CARE** (caring for your own physical health) Exercise: yoga, walking/jogging, cycling, swimming, dance, martial arts, team sports, rock climbing, tennis, aerobics, and pilates. Physical self-care also includes activities that promote relaxation, health, and hygiene like: warm baths, massages, facials, saunas, haircuts, manicures, and regular dental and doctor visits. Dietary: In active alcohol addiction, alcoholics can be taking more than **50%**of their caloric intake in the form of drinks with little to no nutritional benefits. (According to various studies/sources). Because every substance wreaks havoc on the body in unique ways, it can prove useful to consult a nutritionist or addictions specialist when considering your recovery diet. Taking any supplements as directed by your doctor, choosing nutritious foods and keeping hydrated are obvious but important parts of healthy physical self care. **PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF-CARE** (taking care of your emotional health) Quote from a recovery webpage: Self-love isnt the same as self-centeredness. Making the effort to love yourself is an early part of healing from all the years you practiced self-neglect and self-abuse. Seek activities that help us to feel clear-headed and able to intellectually engage with the outside world, now that we arent fogged by substance abuse. Ideas include: Therapy, outpatient treatment, recovery meetings, Keep a daily reflective journal, engage with a new non-recovery hobby, engage with positive friends and family, Learning to say No to requests and demands that tax our mental and physical energy. **SOCIAL SELF-CARE** (taking care of your social needs and networks) Obviously this post is using a sober social outlet, as /r/stopdrinking has been a wonderful resource for many of us here! In addition, sober communities through recovery programs like SMART or AA, or any of the many recovery programs offered depending on your areathese communities are great ways to develop social connections with other non-drinkers. When we have a good foundation of social contacts outside of drinking, the options are endless: book clubs, sports teams, continuing education courses, pet enthusiasts, fishing/hunting clubs, art classes, fitness groups, and outdoor enthusiasts. Trying new hobbies and finding non-alcohol related groups through resources like Meet Up can be a good way to avoid the Im Bored complaint common to many of us early on. **SPIRITUAL SELF-CARE** (drawing on sources of spiritual help that might comfort and guide you) *Spirituality does not necessarily equal religion.* Quote: Spirituality is a personal search for meaning in life, for connection with all things and for the experience of a power beyond oneself. Some find it helpful to think of religion as rules or practices agreed to by a number of people, whereas spirituality is completely related to ones individual experience and connections. Spirituality self care CAN involve religious services and organized religious practices, but this category also includes things such as mindfulness, meditation, journaling, yoga, breathing techniques and guided meditation, walking, music, movement, and even the martial arts. **FINANCIAL SELF-CARE** When hiding our spending on alcohol/bars/etc., finances often take a back seat to our addiction. This can be a big problem for us in recovery. Some people are helped by meeting with a financial counselor to look honestly at our spending habits and expenses. Taking an inventory of debts, bills, expenses and income amounts can help us get a good grasp on what needs accomplished. Financial self care can involve setting reasonable financial goals such as paying off debts, creating an emergency fund (hey, no more booze billstime to save!), planning ahead for retirement and safely structure any out-of-control spending habits. *************************************************************** **SELF CARE GOAL LIST:** * I will take 15 minutes a day of quiet time to practice meditation, or journal. * I will work out at the local gym three times a week for 30 minutes each time. * I will walk reasonable distances instead of taking my car. * I will go to Pilates classes with my friend Jane once every week. * I will eat three fruits a day, and take a B6 multivitamin. * I will prepare two meatless dinners a week. * I will pack balanced lunches from home at least 4 out of 5 work days. * I will schedule one monthly therapeutic massage. * I will save $1 per day to be used to celebrate on my sobriety anniversary. * I will pay all bills on time, and pay more than the minimum payment on debts. * I will follow through on all dental and medical appointments, be honest with my medical care providers, and follow their instructions. ********************************************************* What have you done for yourself today?

Anyway, I expect that Ill be posting on here from time to time, sharing my experiences and asking for (and eventually providing!) support. First question: Any tips for talking to you partner about how to best support you, while also trying to minimize the burden youre putting on them? I know this is very individual, but do you have any thoughts based on my current internal experiences (described above)? My fianc is incredibly supportive, and were doing great overall.

FIRST: **Several very important caveats when looking at this topic.** The steps are in some sort of order  in theory by the time one gets to eight and nine we are no longer doing the things we have to make amends for. I, for one, used up Im sorry, I will never do it again by the time I was 12, but kept using it until I got sober. That living a sober life is often the best, if not the only, amend we can make.  And it is one we can start long before we have to deal with the specifics to individuals. We need keep our expectations low. There are people who are not even slightly interested in forgiving us. (Especially people who are still drinking and drugging.) This is not about us, not about getting them to understand why we did what we did. It definitely is not about their part in it. Its about our remorse, and evidence of our change. Do not try this alone. A sponsor, a therapist, a spiritual adviser, is critical to keep our warped thinking and perceptions (yes you) from making this more (or less) than it needs to be. That whips and chains are still optional. That we have to put ourselves on the list of people we have harmed. --- end of caveats. Step 8 made a list of people we had harmed.yeah, even those who were bigger assholes than us. We have to own 100% of whatever our part was. **This does not mean blaming the victim in abusive situations** It may mean taking a look at how we let the situations go on for as long as they did. It certainly means learning  and this is the recursive nature of the steps  going back to 6 and 7 changing the behavior that kept us locked in these emotional prisons. (And I strongly suggest professional assistance in such cases  this is not an area a sponsor is likely to be able to help with to the degree necessary.) Step 9 made amends except when doing so would do harm **loophole alert** And as alcoholics loopholes are dangerous. I have known a man who confessed embezzlement to his employer and went to prison for it. I also know people who tried to make amends and got punched in the face. And then punched back. There are no hard and fast rules here. But we are learning self compassion here (and also its limits which is why having a sponsor or therapist involved is important). We can put someone on the list and not make the amend directly (for example they are still drinking, are violent, or there are others involved who should not be dragged into it) This is not a free pass. Perhaps an unsent letter. In some cases a visit to a grave. An anonymous donation to a charity. The whole idea is to rid ourselves of the shame that tortured us so, hopefully to eliminate the need to cross the street when seeing someone (or having them cross first). The reason is that shame will try and make us drink again. This shame was often present before we started drinking, and yeah while drinking we did things we are ashamed of, but they really only cemented our negative self esteem. Step 9 is a milestone in our recovery, it is saying we are past that. (Therapy may be an important part of untangling this bowl of cold spaghetti)  again recursively going back to our character defects which dug the holes we fell into time and again. We come from a wide range of dysfunction and our trails of wreckage can be quite different. Again, many of us may need professional help when entering this canyon of vulnerability. There is no deadline. But the benefits are worth pushing for. Again, this planet is a much safer place because we are in recovery. That is important to keep in mind. Our recovery is an amend to the universe. "

These are snippets from various journal articles I have read, edited to make the more readable. Enjoy! ***** **WHAT HAPPENS WITH PROLONGED, EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION?** In general, alcoholics show significant volume loss in cortical and subcortical brain structures that includes both gray and white matter shrinkage. These widespread deficits occur in the absence of major nutritional deficiencies, although nutritional deficiencies can cause neurodegeneration and could contribute to alcoholic degeneration. Both postmortem and in vivo imaging studies of brain morphology find abnormal reduced brain volumes of gray and white matter across multiple regions. The frontal lobes are the most insulted region in the alcoholic brain with the superior frontal cortex showing significant neuronal loss. The frontal lobes regulate complex cognitive skills such as working memory, temporal ordering, discrimination and reversal learning that underlie judgment, attention, risk taking, motivation, mood and wanting. **Disorders in these behaviors are central if not causal to the consumption of dangerous amounts of alcohol despite the knowledge of negative consequences.** Accordingly, chronic alcoholics demonstrate impaired judgment, blunted affect, poor insight, social withdrawal, reduced motivation, distractibility, attention and impulse-control deficits. **WHAT HAPPENS WITH LONG-TERM SOBRIETY?** Human studies provide substantial evidence that sobriety results in improvement during abstinence. Studies have found improvement in component processes of nonverbal memory, visuospatial abilities, attention, as well as gait and balance within months of sobriety. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies of brain structure find increases in cortical gray matter volume within 1 month of sobriety followed by increases in white matter and reversal of ventricular enlargement with longer abstinence. **Very long abstinence has been reported to resolve most neurocognitive deficits associated with alcoholism.** Recent studies have found associations between the recovery of memory and lateral ventricle shrinkage and the recovery of ataxia and fourth ventricle shrinkage. Thus in general, studies suggest that recovery of function during abstinence is associated with ultrastructural changes in brain that include growth of both white and gray matter as well as improved overall function. **WHAT ABOUT A RELAPSE?** Brain tissue volume gains are lost with alcoholism relapse. Humans who relapse do not show recovery of brain volume or cognitive abilities consistent with recovery of brain function and anatomy contributing to successful recovery from dependence. In the relapsers, lifetime consumption of alcohol predicted later vulnerability to white matter volume decline and third ventricular enlargement with resumption of drinking. Resumption of drinking after a short period of abstinence arrests third ventricular volume improvement and produces white matter volume loss (Pfefferbaum, 1995). In their analysis of the 13-month data, they separated those alcoholics who had maintained abstinence during the 13 months from those who had resumed drinking (albeit at a reduced level). They found that the abstainers had improved in learning, memory, abstracting and problem-solving, and verbal abilities, whereas the intermittent resumers had improved only in verbal abilities. **These results show that alcoholics who resume drinking, even at a reduced level, do not achieve the same gains in cognitive function as their abstinent peers** and that even abstinent alcoholics do not fully recover their cognitive abilities after 13 months. (Fein, 1990) To state it clearly, cell death occurs during intoxication, so a binge relapse in early sobriety will be a huge set back. "

Last week were my first AA meetings. I gotta tell you, mentally, I went kicking and screaming. Not only did I not go when my therapist recommended it months ago, but I didn't go until legally required when my probation (DUI) finally kicked in. I also was convinced during that first meeting that I was not like these people. Sure, I had lurked around this subreddit for the last few months and had a few false starts - even declaring I was going to drink on Thanksgiving and that will be it...and then the final day of the semester came....and then the weekend before going to jail when my football team was playing....and then Xmas eve, Xmas, and starting a new job....and New Years Eve. Even though I acknowledged the fact that I have a drinking problem, I am not an alcoholic. I even refused to really say it when I finally worked up the courage to say a few words at the second meeting, ""I suppose I'm an alcoholic"". They tried to push a chip on me that first day, before NYE. It's a good thing I didn't take it at my first meeting or the second 'cause I would have had to get another one...and then maybe another down the road. I can attend my required meetings, listen to these people, do my time, and learn to moderate. Learn to stop when the stopping is good. Learn my lesson about drinking and driving, fix everything else: the procrastination, the self-loathing, and all the rest. So, I did just that, starting attending my required meetings. People there were friendly. That doesn't mean I fell right in step behind them. The call and response seemed a little - for lack of a better term - cult-ish (ritualistic was a term my bff brought up that is a better descriptor). While people were very friendly and approached me with kindness, I have certain social anxieties. I work in the restaurant business, it's my job to talk up and charm strangers, but ask me to make friends with them, a true connection, and I clam up, run away, wall myself off. Vulnerability makes me spiky like a porcupine. Then there were the 12 Steps. Step One: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcoholthat our lives had become unmanageable."" What the hell kind of bullshit is this? I thought. I'm not powerless, I was managing - mostly. I choose when to drink and when not to drink. I'm going to beat this sonofabitch and exert my power over alcohol. That's why I'm here. To show how powerful I am over this shit. Powerless? Pfft. I don't need to not drink. But, there is a problem with sitting in a room with a bunch of people talking about their drinking problems...they sound like what my drinking problem sounds like in my head. Listening to these people describe the illusion of control, the realization that the arrest saved your life, the hurt that this addiction causes your loved ones were all the things that had rattled around in my own head for months. And then at my second meeting. Someone addressed step one in a way that I could understand: We have power over alcohol, we lose that power when we start to drink. That was it. That was what I needed to hear (on top of all the other confessions). Once I started drinking I was not content until I had reached my ""limit""/drank every drop in the house/passed out. Once I started drinking, that was it. Gone were any plans I had made - start the laundry, read a chapter of a text book, do some research. I would sit, relax, enjoy my drink and put it all off until tomorrow, over and over and over again. If I can't stop once I start, who has the power? Not me. That's for sure. So, on Jan. 1 I stopped and I felt great and I felt like I could go the distance. I resolved myself to share and pick up my chip at the next meeting. The next day was great, the day after that, I had to remind myself a few times that I would not drink that day. That's fine, I understand there will be days like that. So today, I was sitting a home, just showered, home from day three of ten that I have to serve in the sheriff's work program as part of my probation (also not fun, I promise). Then something interesting happened. My boyfriend came home and had an single serving bottle of white wine for me. (I had not told him my new plans for sobriety, if I fail, I was not accountable to him). In my new resolve, I told him he might as well throw it away. Really proud of myself for my response. He was impressed. I was impressed with myself and I started to get ready for meeting up with my girlfriend, we had plans prior to my third AA meeting. Then it got really interesting. While I was fixing my hair and makeup, I started obsessing about that one, small bottle of wine that was now in my house. Where as before I would worry if I didn't have one full 750mL bottle of wine to get me through the evening, now this one single serving bottle of cheap white wine was calling to me. It's only one glass. It won't hurt. Two days ago I laughed at myself when I made the suggestion about buying alcohol and now....now I was terrified of what this obsession meant.....I told him to get rid of it before I got home. The whole meeting I just sat there thinking about the power this small bottle of wine had over me. I couldn't stop thinking about it. All we talked about was powerlessness tonight. I never did got the chance to share, there were others there who needed it more than me. I listened and applied their snippets of wisdom to what was going on in my own head. But, I have my chip and I will not drink today. Not today you bastard. "
202,vulnerability,stopdrinking,Using Mindfulness To Beat Addiction [x-post r/leaves],15,3zwe3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3zwe3t/using_mindfulness_to_beat_addiction_xpost_rleaves/,2016-01-08 04:12:24,"Hi /r/stopdrinking, I found an amazing scholarly article that I havent seen discussed or mentioned anywhere. It covers some really amazing topics that I believe should be helpful for anyone suffering from addiction. Reading it was almost mind blowing for me. The original article can be found here: URL The authors are Eric L. Garland, Brett Froeliger, and Matthew O. Howard. *I have rather aggresively re-edited the material by hand for reddits consumption.* Every sentence from the original article was hand picked for this reddit post. I put a lot of work into this. Ive added links to Wikipedia, added section titles and broken down information in a more friendly way. I liberally bolded text. Ive also bastardized their hard work by adding reference to various internet memes and adding my own personal flavor. *Like a boss.* **Summary** Prominent neuroscience models suggest that **addictive behavior occurs when environmental stressors and drug-relevant cues** activate a **cycle of cognitive, affective, and psychophysiological mechanisms** that compel the user to seek out and use drugs, mkay? **Mindfulness-based interventions** (MBIs) target pathogenic mechanisms of the risk chain linking stress and addiction. Empirical evidence is presented suggesting that MBIs ameliorate addiction by enhancing cognitive regulation of a number of key processes, including: clarifying cognitive appraisal and modulating negative emotions to reduce perseverative cognition and emotional arousal; enhancing metacognitive awareness to regulate drug-use action schema and decrease addiction attentional bias; promoting *extinction learning to uncouple drug-use triggers from conditioned appetitive responses*; reducing cue-reactivity and increasing cognitive control over craving; attenuating physiological stress reactivity through parasympathetic activation; and increasing savoring to restore natural reward processing. Heavy shit, I know, but just keep reading. **Introduction** Although addiction has been a subject of societal concern for millennia, over the past several decades, discoveries from cognitive and affective neuroscience have deepened our understanding of this age-old, vexing, and pernicious problem. The perspective emerging from several lines of research is one in which addiction is seen as a **cycle of compulsive drug-seeking behavior** fueled by [dysregulated](URL neurocognitive processes. Key processes implicated in addiction include motivated attention, automaticity, reward processing, emotion regulation, stress reactivity, and inhibitory control. Key terms: * Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), not to be confused with * Men in Black (MIBs) * Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention * Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement **A Neurocognitive Model of Addiction** *Addictive responses arise from automatic habits and unregulated craving.* Research with animals and humans demonstrates that chronic (*giggle*) administration of psychoactive drugs results in adaptations in multiple neurotransmitter systems in the brain, consequentially altering functional neural circuitry that governs a broad array of interactive processes (e.g., affect and reward, habit learning and memory, and cognitive control over prepotent environmental stimuli). Current research suggests that the dopamine system plays a critical role in the progression from drug initiation to chronic and habitual self-administration. **As such, drug-related cues come to evoke powerful, conditioned motivational responses that may be fully dissociable from the pleasure and reward elicited by drug use.** Think about Pavlovs dog, here, that's you. **The habitual behavioral response to drug-related cues is thought to be coordinated by drug-use action schemas, i.e., memory systems that drive drug seeking and drug use.** Importantly, cue-reactivity confers compulsivity to drug-seeking behaviors, motivating the redditor to consume drugs even after long periods of abstinence and despite countervailing motivations to remain abstinent, particularly in contexts that elicit unregulated stress and negative affect. Indeed, stress biases behavior toward habitual responding. You know the drill. Because obtaining and consuming psychoactive substances are motivationally salient goals in addiction, drug-use action schemas stored in memory guide implicit cognitive processing of stimuli associated with previous drug-use episodes. This implicit cognitive process is manifested as a preferential focus of attention toward drug-related cues, known as [addiction attentional bias](URL When attention is focused on drug-related cues, motivation for drug-use increases, which then amplifies the salience of the curs. As such, the poor redittor may find him or herself consuming drugs without awareness of the intention to use, in much the same way other complex goal-oriented, thought-action repertoires can be engaged habitually without conscious volition by conditioned contextual cues. I know, right? **Down, down, down we go** As the addictive habit becomes more entrenched, individuals struggling with addiction experience a loss of cognitive and get all Charlie Sheen on everyone. As a result of cognitive control deficits, actively addicted persons may experience an intense, overwhelming compulsion and motivation to seek and use drugs that is difficult to regulate. Moreover, persons in recovery from addiction often experience the impulse to *light that bitch up* despite their desire to remain abstinent. Yet, due to deficient or atrophied proactive cognitive control, such individuals may attempt to reactively inhibit this upwelling of unbidden motivational drive by employing willpower to suppress the urge to engage in the addictive behavior. **Thus the pendulum of prefrontal regulation swings from a context of under-control to one of over-control.** Through such over-control, suppression may promote relapse insofar as this cognitive strategy inadvertently results in a rebound effect, i.e., an increased rate of the thoughts and emotions it is directed against. To make a long story short, you end up wasting a ton of brain energy going back and forth in your brain, even more so than Hillary Clintons flip flops on Iraq or gay marriage. Individuals who rely on suppression as a regulatory strategy exhibit greater amygdala activation in response to negative emotional information than individuals who tend to use reappraisal. **The use of *suppression* to rid oneself of craving or affective states once they have already arisen is costly in terms of neurocognitive resources and likely to fail**. Simply avoiding these thoughts wont work, chief. This failure to resolve conflict between emotional drives (e.g., craving) and higher-order goals (e.g., the goal of abstinence) during attempted suppression may further bias cognitive processing toward drug-related cues and mental contents, inadvertently increasing attention to substance-related thoughts and urges. Consequently, suppression of thoughts of substance use leads to greater enactment of consummatory behaviors. **When addictive urges are chronically suppressed over time, the neurocognitive resources for self-regulation are depleted, resulting in an inability to inhibit substance-related cognitions and an attentional bias toward drug-related cues**. Ultimately, regulatory resource depletion that occurs during sustained suppression of urges may contribute to relapse. You cant just sweep your thoughts under the carpet, it aint going to work. Keep reading. **Break it down for me** From a neurocognitive perspective, **addiction occurs through basic human learning processes gone awry; neural resources devoted to learning become hijacked** due to the neuropharmacologically rewarding properties of the substance. Once an intentional decision, over time **the act of seeking and consuming drugs is established as an automatic, compulsive habit, one that becomes increasingly difficult to inhibit** as brain structures involved in self-regulation become dysregulated by the combined action of stress and the pharmacologic agent itself. Unwittingly, the struggle to reassert control over the addictive behavior through misguided attempts at urge suppression results in hypervigilance for salient cues such as the sight of a bar, an old hang-out spot, or a familiar drinking buddy, which trigger uncomfortable physical sensations and a strong desire to consume substances, even after extended periods of abstinence. Eventually, the addict succumbs and relapses, which strengthens the addictive habit through the processes of conditioning and negative reinforcement. Hence, behavioral interventions that aim to interrupt automatized drug-use action schemas and restore more normalized reward learning processes may prove to be beneficial in helping drug abusers maintain abstinence. **Similarly, treatment approaches that train context-dependent prefrontally mediated cognitive control as an alternative to the maladaptive strategy of suppressing addictive urges** may free neurocognitive resources for the effective regulation of emotional distress and substance craving. It is in these regards that MBIs may be especially efficacious for the treatment of addiction. In other words, simply avoiding the thoughts related to addiction is not a winning strategy  one must roll up their sleeves and purposely dig into their own thought patterns when a craving occurs. **Mindfulness Training Ameliorates Addiction by Targeting Neurocognitive Mechanisms. (Boom, There Goes The Dynamite)** Although mindfulness is an English term linked with a set of contemplative practices and principles originating in Asia a bajillion years ago, in its modern usage, mindfulness refers to a psychological phenomenon currently being studied for its relevance to mental and physical health in fields such as medicine, psychology, and neuroscience. The practice of **mindfulness involves two primary components: focused attention and open monitoring**. During focused attention, attention is sustained on an object while the practitioner alternately acknowledges and lets go of distracting thoughts and emotions. Objects of focused attention practice can include the sensation of breathing; the sensation of walking; interoceptive and proprioceptive feedback about the bodys internal state, movement, and position; and visual stimuli (e.g., a candle flame). Focused attention practices are often the precursor to open monitoring forms of mindfulness meditation. **During open monitoring, a state of metacognitive awareness is cultivated wherein mental contents are allowed to arise unperturbed without suppression or distraction** while the *quality of awareness itself remains the primary focus of attention*. This state of awareness is metacognitive in the sense that it involves monitoring the content of consciousness while reflecting back upon the process or quality of consciousness itself. In other words, **the redditor maintains awareness of the *locus of attention* (without trying to retain focus on a particular object)** and his or her level of cognitive arousal **without reacting to or elaborating on any particular content of consciousness**. **Engaging in these practices repeatedly over time may induce neural and cognitive plasticity**; recurrent activation of the mindful state during meditation may leave lasting neurobiological traces that accrue into durable changes in the dispositional propensity to be mindful in everyday life even while not meditating. Germane to the current discussion of neurocognition in addiction, **dispositional mindfulness is significantly inversely associated with addiction attentional bias and craving, positively associated with autonomic recovery from stress and substance cue-exposure**. **Through focused attention and open monitoring forms of meditation, MBIs exercise a number of neurocognitive processes believed to go awry in addiction.** Indeed, MBIs may be fruitfully conceptualized as means of training or exercising prefrontally mediated cognitive control networks which have become atrophied or usurped in the service of drug seeking and use. By strengthening PFC functions and the ability of the PFC to modulate other brain networks in a context-dependent manner, MBIs may provide the global benefit of enhancing neurocognitive flexibility  augmenting a domain-general resource that may then be applied across the manifold subcomponent processes implicated in psychological health (e.g., cognitive regulation of automaticity, attention, appraisal, emotion, urges, stress reactivity, reward processing, and extinction learning). URL Image: Mindfulness-centered regulation: the central tenet of this model posits that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may remediate dysregulated habit behaviors, craving, and affect primarily by way of strengthening functional connectivity. **Habit responses** Still with me? This is where shit gets real. Substance dependent individuals typically experience euphoria during initial stages of drug-use. Yet, as experience with the drug increases, the reward associated with drug-taking becomes dramatically attenuated. Despite diminishing returns in positive emotional experiences resulting from hittin that dope chronic, dependent users continue to use. **Undergirded by neuroplastic changes in striatal circuitry, habitual drug-use becomes an overlearned process that can become automatized.** Mindfulness training may enhance functional connectivity in a cortico-thalamic loop including prefrontal, cingulate, parietal, and dorsal thalamus nodes, strengthening an executive regulatory circuit providing feedback to the striatum and medial temporal lobe. **This feedback process is theorized to allow for greater consciousness of thoughts and behaviors that were previously enacted with little conscious awareness.** The practice of mindfulness in daily life is focused on developing awareness of automatic behavior. Indeed, many MBIs prescribe **informal mindfulness practices where individuals are instructed to engage in everyday, repetitive tasks (e.g., washing the dishes) with full consciousness of the sensorimotor aspects of the activity.** Such informal mindfulness practices are designed to reduce mind-wandering and strengthen conscious control over automaticity. Potentially as a result of such practices, **mindfulness training has been shown to decrease habit behavior and reduce rigid adherence to scripted cognitive responses**. When closing the reddit tab on your browser, take a moment to think about what you actually want to do next before you automatically reload the site. These findings accord with early theoretical accounts which conceptualized mindfulness meditation as a form of deautomatization, whereby patterns of motor and perceptual responses which had been rendered automatic and unconscious through repetition are reinvested with conscious attention. Thus, is plausible that mindfulness training may deautomatize habitual addictive responses through both formal meditations focused on regulating automatic appetitive impulses as well as informal mindfulness practices designed to increase generalized awareness of automaticity. **BOOBS! I mean, Attentional Bias** Mindfulness training may strengthen the capacity to regulate attention in the face of conditioned stimuli associated with past substance use, countering attentional biases by refocusing attention on neutral or health-promoting stimuli (e.g., the sensation of ones own breath or a beautiful sunset). **Repeatedly redirecting attention from substance-related cues toward innocuous stimuli may foster extinction of associations between substance-related cues and drug-use action schema**. When you see someone else use a drug, dont just shut it out of your mind  create a new, positive thought pattern off it. This potential mechanism may explain how attentional bias modification among addicts leads to decreased substance use and improved treatment outcomes. **Cue-elicited craving** Mindfulness-based interventions may positively influence craving-related processes in several ways. First, **mindfulness training may decrease [bottom-up reactivity](URL to drug-related stimuli**. Second, **mindfulness training may decouple negative emotion from craving**. Although negative emotion is a common precipitant of craving and subsequent relapse, mindfulness training may extinguish this association, such that an addict experiencing sadness, fear, or anger could allow these emotions to arise and pass without triggering an appetitive reaction. Indeed, substance dependent individuals participating in Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention were less likely to experience craving in response to depressed mood, and this reduced craving and reactivity to negative emotion predicted fewer days of substance use. The theory is that conscious craving occurs when an activated drug-use action schema is blocked from obtaining the goal of drug consumption. As such, **persons in acute withdrawal, persons unable to obtain drugs (e.g., due to lack of funds or availability), or persons attempting to maintain abstinence in the face of triggers may experience an upwelling of craving for substances**. Ring a bell? Yeah. I thought so. In contrast, according to this theory, addicts who are able to obtain and use drugs in an unimpeded fashion would not experience craving. Similarly, persons in long-term residential treatment who are isolated from drug-related cues are unlikely to be conscious of craving. **Without awareness of craving, the addict may unwittingly remain in high-risk situations and thus be especially subject to relapse as soon as they bust out of that joint.** Indeed, lack of awareness of substance craving has been shown to be predictive of future relapse. MBIs may increase conscious access to the appetitive drive to use substances by virtue of their effects on increasing interoceptive awareness. **The recovering addict may utilize mindfulness training to become aware of *which* cues are under the spotlight of attention, and become more sensitive to *how* those cues may trigger changes in body state and motivation drive. So, so money.** Hence, mindfulness may increase awareness of craving and thereby facilitate cognitive control of otherwise automatic appetitive impulses. **Cognitive appraisal (the personal interpretation of a situation)** Insofar as stress evokes automatic responses and impairs prefrontally mediated cognitive control functions, exposure to socioenvironmental stressors may render addicts in recovery vulnerable to relapse. Mindfulness training may allay stress-induced relapse by virtue of its stress-reductive effects. Although early theorists believed that mindfulness meditation reduced stress primarily by evoking a generalized relaxation response, modern research indicates that mindfulness practice may also attenuate stress by targeting cognitive mechanisms. Oh. Whats that? Its 1950 on the phone and they want their research back. One potential target of mindfulness is cognitive appraisal, the process whereby stimuli and their environmental context are evaluated for their significance to the self. Appraisals of threat or harm elicit negative emotional reactions coupled with activation of stress physiology. **When recurrent, such emotional reactivity biases perception, leading to exaggerated, overestimated appraisals of threat and underestimations of self-efficacy, and ultimately, sensitization to future stressors.** Sound familiar? In contrast, mindfulness, which has been conceptualized as a non-reactive form of awareness may enable the redditor to cognitively appraise his or her present circumstances with less emotional bias, and to more accurately assess his or her ability to cope with present challenges. **Not Going All Kanye West** When individuals are unable to marshal effective problem-solving to resolve a stressor, lack of a favorable resolution may lead to deployment of emotion regulation efforts to manage the emotional distress elicited by the stressful circumstance. Individuals with elevated negative affect at baseline who later received mindfulness training exhibited increased emotion regulatory capacity coupled with greater recruitment of attentional control resources and reduced amygdala activation during exposure to negative, self-relevant stimuli. Thus, by **enhancing top-down cognitive control over emotional responses in a context-dependent fashion, MBIs may reduce drug use precipitated by negative affective states.** Mindfulness training may promote cognitive reappraisal, the process by which the meaning of a stressful or adverse event is re-construed so as to reduce its negative emotional impact. Why do I feel so shitty when I see a back alley? Should I really feel that way? Why?. During an adverse experience mindfulness practitioners first disengage from initial negative appraisals into the metacognitive state of mindfulness in which cognitions and emotions are viewed and accepted as transitory mental events without inherent veridicality. Subsequently, the scope of attention broadens to encompass a larger set of previously unattended information from which new situational appraisals may be generated. By accessing this enlarged set of contextual data, present circumstances may be reappraised in an adaptive fashion that promotes positive affect and behavioral activation. **For instance, a newly abstinent alcohol dependent individual might reappraise an affront by a former drinking buddy as evidence of their need to build new, sober relationships.** This context-dependent use of prefrontal regulatory strategy represents a middle way between hypo- and hyper-activation of cognitive control resources, thereby preventing resource depletion and untoward rebound effects. **STRESS  Y U NO LEAVE ME ALONE?** In addition to pro-regulatory effects on emotion, mindfulness training may facilitate neurocognitive regulation of the effects of stress on the autonomic nervous system. **As addicts in treatment develop dispositional mindfulness through mindfulness training, they may be more able to engage prefrontal cortical modulation of the sympathetic fight-or-flight response via parasympathetic nervous system activation of the vagal brake, resulting in increased HRV and heart-rate deceleration in the face of stress or addictive cues.** Autonomic flexibility engendered through mindfulness training may help persons in recovery from addiction adapt to situational demands without succumbing to a stress-precipitated relapse, again, like a boss. **Show me the Neurons baby** With repeated drug-use, neural sensitization may occur whereby the drug elicits a potent response in striatal-dopamine neurons coupled with a strong degree of positive reinforcement. **At the same time, long-term exposure to drugs significantly attenuates neural responses to intrinsically rewarding stimuli in the environment (e.g., a beautiful landscape, the smile of a baby, a delicious meal).** In other words, through neuroadaptation the addicted individual learns to experience reward via **self-administration of drugs rather than by enjoying the subtle beauty of the natural environment** or the affiliative or health-promoting objects found therein. This **rewiring** (OMG, theres that word) of reward learning entrenches the drug user in a cycle of drug-taking that serves to maintain the ongoing use of drugs. Indeed, vulnerability to relapse has been attributed to increased incentive salience of drug-cues and decreased salience of intrinsically rewarding stimuli. **By teaching participants to mindfully attend to pleasurable objects, events, and lolz, MBIs may amplify hedonic processing of natural rewards and thereby counter the allostatic effects of addiction on reward neurocircuitry.** This form of selective attention to positive experience, known as savoring, is one of the most robust positive emotion regulation strategies. **During savoring, one not only attends to a broadened diversity and range of sensations and perceptions, but also to the positive emotions elicited by the sensory-perceptual experience**. As such, attending to present-moment experience prospectively predicts positive emotion. Kinda like that fucking book *The Secret* which ought to be burned. Anyway, learning to mindfully savor pleasant events may offset negative affective states that often trigger addictive responses, and restore the salience of naturally occurring and intrinsically rewarding objects and events (e.g., social affiliation, healthy diet and exercise behaviors, engagement with novel and stimulus-rich environments, etc.). **Through mindful savoring, MBIs may provide a means of reward replenishment and ultimately reverse the reward deficiency syndrome inherent in addiction  a therapeutic process plausibly important for allaying craving and deterring relapse.** So dont just enjoy that In-and-Out burger, fucking *make love to it* right on the counter, *animal style*. **Kill it with fire** Individuals in early recovery from addiction often **attempt to suppress craving for drugs and alcohol as a means of maintaining abstinence**. However, these suppression attempts often backfire, resulting *in a sad panda* and a consequent rebound of substance-related thoughts. Critically, attempted avoidance of substance cue-reactivity may prevent extinction learning from occurring, which requires inhibition of conditioned responses in the presence of conditioned stimuli. In contrast, mindfulness training provides an effective alternative to suppressing unwanted substance-related thoughts, emotions, and urges by **promoting acceptance of and exposure to these mental experiences**. By learning to not sweep everything under the fucking carpet, Mindful exposure to substance-related thoughts and cues may prevent the post-suppression rebound effect and facilitate desensitization to conditioned stimuli. When engaged over time, this practice might result in extinction learning of previously conditioned associations between substance cue-reactivity and addictive behaviors. **What Have We Learned, Reddit?** In contrast to mindfulness, which leads to cognitive and behavioral flexibility, addiction may be characterized by mindlessness, i.e., habitual or scripted responses that are often deployed automatically without conscious volition or regard for goodness-of-fit with present goals or the socioenvironmental context. **Although procurement of many psychoactive substances requires significant planning and intentionality, the appetitive drive that motivates drug seeking may emerge in a context of mindlessness, manifested as obsessional thoughts of using and compulsive urges that seem to arise in an unbidden and intrusive fashion in direct contradiction to rational decision making.** Moreover, the behavioral routines involved in the ritual of drug administration can become automated and executed mindlessly in much the same was as other complex repertoires can be engaged without conscious volition by conditioned contextual cues. Hence, individuals treated for substance dependence with higher levels of mindlessness tend to experience higher levels of craving and consume larger quantities of addictive substances than their more mindful counterparts. These findings suggest that habitual, reflexive responding can confer vulnerability to individuals in recovery. **Conversely, greater attention to and awareness of ones reactions to substance-related cues predicts less substance use among persons in recovery from addiction**. In light of Tiffanys proposal (*wait, who the fuck is Tiffany?*) that automaticity drives appetitive addictive responses, mindfulness of ones automatized reactions would presumably allow for greater self-regulation of mindless reactions elicited by drug-cues, and increase proactive cognitive control over substance use. **Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement places a special emphasis on providing training in mindful savoring as an approach to restoring natural reward responsiveness.** Concomitantly, a growing recognition of the role of attentional suggestes that regular, brief mindfulness practice of focused attention on respiratory sensations strengthens electrophysiological indices of enhanced attentional control. Conversely, open monitoring forms of mindfulness meditation might be most useful for generating awareness of cue-elicited activation of drug-use action schemas and could enable the practitioner to regain conscious cognitive control of automatized addictive behavioral routines. When a recovering addict with a history of using drugs to cope with negative emotions encounters a cue associated with past drug-use episodes while in the context of a stressful environment (e.g., walking past a bar after getting in an argument with a work supervisor), this encounter may activate cortico-limbic-striatal circuits subserving **drug-use action schemas**. After completing a course in mindfulness training, the addict may become more aware of the *automatic addictive habit as it is activated*, allowing for top-down regulation of the precipitating negative emotional state and the bottom-up appetitive urge. **Specifically, the individual may engage in mindful breathing to first disengage from and then restructure negative cognitive appraisals, thereby reducing limbic (e.g., amygdala) activity, autonomic reactivity, and dysphoric emotions related to the stressor.** Concurrently, the individual may become aware of **when his attention has been automatically captured** by the sight of people drinking in the window of the bar, and, through formal mindfulness practice, activate fronto-parietal mediated attentional networks to disengage and **shift focus onto the neutral sensation of respiration**. During this process, as sensations of craving arise, the individual may engage in metacognitive monitoring of these sensations, and in so doing, facilitate prefrontal down-regulation of limbic-striatal activation. **As mindfulness of craving is sustained over time without drug-use, the sensations of craving may abate**, promoting extinction learning to weaken associative linkages between conditioned addiction-related stimuli and the attendant conditioned appetitive response. **Once working memory has been cleared of active representations of substance use, the redditor may shift attention to savor non-drug related rewards, such as the sense of accomplishment that may arise from successfully resisting the temptation to drink (i.e., self-efficacy), appreciating an episode of Rick &amp; Morty without being clouded by inebriation, or the comforting touch of a kitteh in your lap.** Through repeated practice of regulating addictive responses and extracting pleasure from life in the absence of substance use, the individual may re-establish healthy dopaminergic tone and foster neuroplasticity in brain areas subserving increased dispositional mindfulness. To wrap this shit up, mindfulness may facilitate a novel, adaptive response to the canonical people, places, and things that tend to elicit addictive behavior as a scripted, habitual reaction. In so doing, the practice of mindfulness may attenuate stress reactivity and suppression while disrupting addictive automaticity, resulting in an increased ability to regulate and recover from addictive urges. The tools of modern science have only begun to elucidate the many ways in which mindfulness training targets the risk chain of addiction at the attention-appraisal-emotion interface, because, you know, *thats a thing*.

Day 2 I decided to go see my general doctor and admitted my drinking habits to him. Told him I really needed help sleeping and that alcohol was the only thing that seemed to do it for me. For context, I was 30 minutes late to the appointment because of traffic (I run a courier business -- last minute delivery during rush hour), and I guess because of heightened sensitivity to the now non-existent chemicals, I was particularly angry and stressed. I wanted to get in and get out so I could go home and sleep. Anyway, tell him the truth about the pint/pint and half/entire bottle of whiskey I had been drinking for 3-4 months and ask for help to get me to sleep so I have a better chance at not relapsing. He says he'll give it to me but suggests I need AA. I say I'll think about it... not into the whole higher power thing. He says the only reason he would give this to me at all was to help with withdrawal symptoms. It won't be a permanent thing. I say I don't know how else to do it at this point. He says I need therapy and better coping skills. He can help me by upping the anxiety meds I take but that i have unaddressed depression and need to do something, see someone. I say I can't afford it and that the anxiety drugs only make me feel like I'm not falling off a cliff, but I know my body wouldn't react differently and help these other issues. He loses it. I have never had anyone get this mad at me in years, but the gist of the conversation was him throwing down his pen, looking directly at me, and while sitting no more than a yard from me yelling Doctor: ""Well you just know everything, huh?"" Me: ""Wha.. what?"" Doctor: ""I'm just trying to figure out where I fit into this situation. You come in here 30 minutes late, ask for my help, then suggestion after suggestion you shoot down. You think you know so much? Then why are you here? Me: ""....."" Doctor: ""Because you're drinking yourself to death. What you're doing goes down a path that has no bottom, and there is no magic pill for it! You have made a total mess of things and now your manipulating me to give you drugs and..."" Me: ""Manip?! I never manip..."" Doctor: ""Shut up."" Me: ""...."" [doctor stares at me] Me: ""I... you're the doctor."" Doctor: ""Oh that is such a smart-alec response. You have no idea the severity of what you're doing to yourself. Let's not do this. Get out."" I sit there stunned as he stares me down. I can't keep eye contact and look at the ground. I feel embarrassment, vulnerability, fear, regret. No one had spoken to me like that in years, but goddamn did I need it. Not sure how long passes but neither of us move. I choke back tears and say: Me: ""You.. you're right. I don't know what I'm doing. I could say to myself that I'm overdoing it and that I can quit whenever but you going out of patient-doctor mode and getting that pissed with me... just a person... that made it very real. No one else has done that."" I look up from the floor and at him after saying that and his expression doesn't change until he looks me directly in the eyes and sees that I mean it. He does. Doctor [much longer conversation paraphrased]: ""Good. I felt the need to be stern with you because you need to be serious about this. This [looks at my chart].. this is just sad. Your solution isn't a sleeping pill. I don't care if it's AA, SMART, a counselor. Do something. I'll prescribe you 30 days worth of valium to get over the withdrawals, but if you start drinking with that, along with the anxiety pill, you're brain chemistry will beyond my tolerance to treat and we will be done. Get yourself healthy. I'll see you in a month."" It's funny, I have a saying I've picked up from socializing over the years, and it's ""eyes never lie"". Never thought I could so thoroughly piss off a doctor. He was genuinely furious, but also wanting to help if I meant it. The terms weren't mine to negotiate anymore. A lot of people won't have that perfect storm of coincidences to get another person to yell at you about your condition. If you share my (former) drinking habits, I'll offer up this story as a hopeful boot in your ass. You're destroying yourself and you can do better. You just need to mean it. Your life begins again when you refuse to keep digging that hole and plunging into numbness. I'm only 5 days in, and it's scary as shit, but damn do I never want to go back. That way lies only darkness. Hope this can motivate someone like it did me. Looking forward the 7 day mark and beyond."
204,vulnerability,stopdrinking,A ramble about vulnerability.,7,3ti1ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3ti1ia/a_ramble_about_vulnerability/,2015-11-20 10:46:12,"Lately, I've had a revelation. I've always struggled with feeling comfortable being myself. I can be shy, timid, and have a tendency to let people walk all over me. I don't like hugs, and I don't like I love yous. I am always doubting myself. I always believed that alcohol gave me the strength and courage to be my ""true"" self. I had believed that alcohol made me the person I wanted to be. My guard was down. I kinda just thought that was how it worked, and that's how I'll always be. I never really knew why, or hell, didn't even necessarily realize, I was so scared to be myself. With my year sober, I've spent a lot of time analyzing my past and dealing with wounds. It occurred to me that a series of events throughout my life have led me to believe that the people I love will always hurt me. Starting from early childhood, some circumstances I had no control over, some I allowed to continue. I have become a professional at hiding behind stone walls. I am horrified of letting people in and letting people love me. I can't say that I would have realized this if I hadn't gotten sober. Drinking, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, I was much too busy running away from every thought and feeling that came my way. It's not going to be an easy road, but even the little progress I've made has shown me that it's going to be okay. Everyone isn't the monster under the bed. Vulnerability is a beautiful piece of life that I shouldn't let my past take from me. As long as I stay sober I will continue to grow and move past this. I'll probably always be a little fucked up, but that's alright. I have days now where I wake up feeling perfectly comfortable with who I am. Who would have thought."

Every attempt I had made to moderate, had failed. Every promise I had made to myself to be the person I believed myself capable of being, Id broken. Just like every other morning after a binge, I felt regret and dismay, but something dawned on me that awful morning  I needed help. I needed to banish my ego to the corner and submit to the collective wisdom of people whod seen their way through to the other side. It took me a long time to come to accept that it was my failure to fully volunteer my will to the command of dedicated helpers that was keeping me from becoming, from blossoming. Why am I interrupted? Why this false start? Why that broken path? There were so many dedicated helpers along the way  people who came and went, hands trailing behind and hoping for that last minute grasp. A year ago today I woke up on the couch and reached for the invisible hand of virtual strangers and trusted with all my might that if I leapt, I would be caught. r/stopdrinking caught me. Caught me and raised me up (for real  I am not being poetic here, I had/have a lot of maturing to do). I have been learning a whole truck-load of self-awareness since I started posting and reading:  I sometimes fall into the trap of seeing myself as a victim instead of as a survivor.  I was a really shitty advice-giver, projecting all over people instead of asking questions and speaking from the I.  I have a poor sense of boundaries and have a hit-and-miss bullshit detector so I can be easily taken advantage of and manipulated.  I like to lose myself in the troubles of others and drain my emotional well so that theres nothing left for me because this helps me avoid sitting with my own feelings and discomfort.  I hate asking for help because I dont trust people enough to reveal my vulnerability because traditionally, I have only opened up to people I am afraid of or to people I dont respect. I am working on my resilience. I have survived childhood sexual abuse, alternating neglect and smothering by a mostly single mother, multiple rapes by a boyfriend, the deaths of my parents at young ages, and a marriage to someone who gaslighted me into believing I was broken beyond repair. Well I am not broken beyond repair, but my half-assed attempts at holding together the parts of my personal narrative that pointed towards the horizon were made impotent by alcohol. I was afraid to look. I wanted to turn off the world, but silencing the world revealed the sound of my voice screaming. A year of sitting and being, of thinking, and talking, and listening, and respecting the nuances of my heart and my body has completely changed the quality of my life. I feel capable. I can choose to respond instead of reacting, I like who I am. I KNOW who I am. I am someone who can handle the regret that comes with a decade and a half of heavy binge drinking. I am someone who cares about the people around me and is present when she is needed. I am someone who feels hope and who actively enjoys the successive rewards of living a contemplative life. I am someone who deserves dignity and self-respect. I am a person of integrity. Is this your first day? Your first hour? Your first month? Your third week? I believe in you. Everything you need to get to tomorrow is inside of you. All the courage you need to do the work is in your heart. This community is here to help you with the how, and I can say from personal experience that if you bring the work ethic, and you are resigned to open your mind to new ways of thinking, you will get the help you seek. I am profoundly thankful to the people here who have helped me, and to the moderators who work so tirelessly to maintain order. As hard as its been, this has been the best year I can remember since I was five years old. Im not happy yet, but Im whole now. Thank you for reading. tldr; One year ago on August 29th, 2014 I found this sub and stopped drinking and its the best thing I have ever done.

But first I will describe a little self-analysis story (skip to the bottom for the video.) Having watched this video, I think a root cause for my drinking has been vulnerability. And by that I mean, I have wanted to feel invincible, to bury and obliterate my imperfections, and hide all the uncomfortable truths about myself. To just say to myself I am ""fine,"" things may not be great, I am not happy but it is fine. Not addressing painful issues has been holding me back. A reoccurring word I had used to justify my drinking during the times I was trying to quit was I was using alcohol to ""numb"" myself to give myself a break from my own feelings. I am at day 210 and thought: I haven't achieved much, I am almost as miserable as I was when drinking. I need to find out what to do next make some changes. I have spent a lifetime building up walls and isolating myself. I have spent a lifetime building up walls and isolating myself. What I think I might want to do is the exact opposite. I will expand beyond those walls and connect with people. I won't use the word suck, too negative; so I will say this process will be uncomfortable.

""We are the most in-debt, obese, addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle."" This basically sums up why I drank. I always knew that drinking numbed all the scary emotions, but it never clicked that it numbed the positive ones too. "

It may be that something thematic starts some place and then spreads, it may just be coincidence. Over the last few days there is a theme about drinking connected to support or a lack of support from family, SOs, and friends. A very positive example of how we might approach this comes from the fantastic [1-Year Sobriety post of my pal Mouse.](URL Here is a young woman who struggling through not only all the psychological mess we all deal with--and underlying issues that differ from person-to-person; but, early in her recovery her husband becomes very ill and then hovers near death before recovering.

And she shared on /r/stopdrinking abundantly of her pain, her suffering, her vulnerability, her fears, and her daily commitment to sobriety. When I was an active alcoholic I was a supremely selfish person--I am, still. But in my alcoholic phase I lied, cheated, provoked arguments and fights, withheld love and affection, manipulated, stole--all so I could pour beer, wine, booze down my pie hole and gratify my wants, needs and desires. Today, I have learned another way and it's a paradox: by choosing the disciplined choice of a daily resolution not to drink, by doggedly persisting in that daily commitment, and by sharing this part of myself--I am free, I am frequently happy, and in my surrender, I win."

I no longer desire to use alcohol except when I allow myself to imagine a world where I want self-destruction. This new life that I've taken for myself is far preferable. Any drink I take will lead to countless more, and nothing about the reality of alcohol addiction is worth the pain. I've put myself on an upward trajectory where there are no limitations, excepting the ones that I choose to impose upon myself. I've reached a point in recovery where I need to learn, once again, how to open myself up to vulnerability. I need to hit a pseudo-reset button and reinforce the chips and cracks that have appeared in the foundation that I built, before I am able to continue shaping this dwelling of mine. That is all.

So a big thank you to SD. Someone recommended taking a period of abstinence. So I decided to do a 60 day challenge. Its the longest Ive been without alcohol since I finished high school. How do I feel? Well nothing too major has changed. But I do I feel much healthier, I am clear headed, I have lost a bit of weight and I am moving towards my goals faster. I feel like a drastic change is imminent. My favourite SD saying is *Not drinking is like life on easy mode.* I had the intention to go back to drinking after 60 days but I find myself wanting to do another 30 days, maybe more. I think I like this whole not drinking thing ;) Im not going to lie. There is this voice that comes back convincing me of all the good times I had with alcohol. In particular I think back to a local bar when I did an exchange program abroad. The voice says *you had such a great time, made all these awesome friends and memories.* I heard someone mention here alcohol is romanticised by hollywood, but I think alcohol is also romanticised in our memories. Like those awesome nights out were because of friends and good times, it just so happened that alcohol was involved too. But I have no doubt that the experience would have been the same, if not better without alcohol. So about me, I binge drink once and sometimes twice a week when I go out clubbing with my buddy. So I told my buddy at the gym after I decided to do the 60 day challenge: *Hey man im just going to take a little break from drinking. His response: Thats totally cool man, any particular reason?* then proceeded to say *Man if you want to take a break from alcohol, thats awesome and I support that.* So I still went out clubbing but didn't drink. I dont mean to brag, and I hope this doesnt offend anyone because Im saying this with the utmost respect and gratitude towards the SD community. I read an angry SD post about someone ranting about people who still go to bars while being sober. In the SD chat room link on the side bar this girl repeatedly told me I would fail and said she was very angry with what I had said. In my defence I am in my 20s and I enjoy going out. I found myself having just as much fun going out sober than when I did drinking. Going out to clubs sober made me see things in a totally new light. I believe alcohol takes more than it gives. I see young people just utterly confused. Going over to the bar to get another drink on autopilot. Everything was clearer, and I felt that these young people were just seeking cheap thrills but werent mature enough to understand deep happiness. I was driving back from the club with my friend. He was so wasted to the point where what he was saying didnt make much sense. I really felt sorry for him, like his vulnerability was exposed, and I can see he is having a tough time in general and alcohol is his escape. I felt soo sad for him. You have no idea. Sometimes he goes out 4 nights a week and binges each night. Alcohol is his medicine but also his poison. I feel like telling him he wont find happiness there. Going out and drinking is a distraction, but its not that deep happiness that you get from the attainment of goals. I found that by clubbing and socialising sober my social skills sky rocketed. Like I find that when you drink alcohol the confidence and social skills are anchored to the alcohol. But when you dont drink the social skills get anchored to you. I LOVE coming back from a club, putting on my pyjamas and hopping into bed sober on a Saturday night. It feels fantastic! Not to mention waking up. So anyway I just want to say thank you to the SD community. If anyone has any advice for me, perhaps any self development books that have changed their life for the better please comment. Finally when people ask you why you dont drink, what do you usually say? "

I don't have 100% faith in myself today, and wasn't given enough time to plan this out. For a moment, I thought about offerring to DD, but this whole idea just seems like too vulnerable of a position to be in. I used work and early sobriety vulnerability as my excuse. I worked until 8, and (truth be told) could have gone. He told me to come out anyway... said he'd have a soda with me. I'll try to set something up with him tomorrow, if he's functioning in the A.M. I vented to my sober coworker. He's been sober since like 1989. He didn't realize I'm in recovery. Before he knew, he told me to go out and enjoy myself... that 5 hours of notice would have been acceptable for him at my age. After I outed myself, he said stay sober then.

If you can feel it, I have felt it in the past 4 weeks... And thru it all, I've been able to share and reach out to this community. And for that, today, I am feeling grateful. I've been totally open and honest to a couple of friends who are totally supportive, but I've noticed that the text messages are slowing/stopping and the conversations at work have become dry and I'm no longer involved in swapping drunken stories from the night before. I have a SO who is extremely distant and whom I haven't had a real conversation with, in let's say, about 4 weeks. So obviously, loneliness has definitely filled my heart on more days than not. But I'm grateful. I'm grateful that I have not lost it all. I'm grateful that I still hang out with friends after work... But I find these friends across the street at a late night AA meeting. I'm grateful that my 4 yo daughter will never know the ""drunk mom"" and I'm grateful that I experienced all that I have in my drunkeness. It's forced me to do a personal assessment and emotional inventory... And not let my emotions run me. Emotions are just feelings.. For way too long, I have let them define and guide me. I'm getting back to my roots. My higher power is myself... The biggest, best ME. And I'm grateful for this community. For my SD friends who have been raw and honest and supporting and uplifting.

Alcohol wasn't the problem. It wasn't helping, but it wasn't the problem. The problem is me. The problem will always be me. From puberty I've been nothing but trouble, a source of embarrassment and a waste of resources. The talent or ambition I thought might give me a purpose or direction or open doors has done none of those things. The ambition was predicated on a belief in my talent, of which so little has been made that a person examining my trajectory in life would find no evidence that any talent existed. If i felt like I had value, garnered some accolade, or attracted a good looking woman, there was never a shortage of people telling me that I don't deserve any of that, that something must be wrong, that my value outside of the occasional joke must be some mistake. Yeah he's a funny guy, but that? No. Yeah, he's pretty smart, sure, but he surely could not have done *that,""* and if he did, then it wasn't that impressive to begin with. He's ugly, he isn't good enough, something must be wrong. He's not supposed to have those things. He's not supposed to do well. He's not supposed to be good. Something must be wrong. Something doesn't add up. Something isn't making sense. I've done terrible things to my body and my life and it all seemed like a good idea at the time. Every decision I have made has been the wrong one. Getting help for depression was a mistake. Going to school was a mistake. Doing poorly in school was a mistake. Doing well in school was a mistake. Changing schools was a mistake. Not going to school was a mistake. Trusting people was a mistake. Being wary of people was a mistake. Changing my appearance was a mistake. Laziness was a mistake. Working hard was a mistake. Diligence was a mistake. Getting married was a mistake. Neglecting my marriage was a mistake. Trying to save my marriage was a mistake. Making friends was a mistake. Losing friends was a mistake. Moving was a mistake. Staying was a mistake. Asking for help was a mistake. Going it alone was a mistake. Attempts at meaningful intimacy were a mistake. Constant watchfulness and hard-heartedness were a mistake. Stoicism was a mistake. Expressing vulnerability was a mistake. Being hopeless was a mistake. Entertaining the idea that things aren't so bad was a mistake. Not drinking was a mistake. Drinking was a mistake. How could sobriety be anything but just another mistake? If I haven't been worthless, I've been a fraud, and if I wasn't a fraud, the qualification in terms is meaningless because the outcome is the same. I've seen mental health professionals since I was 14 and not a single one has a good idea what is wrong with me, or why the treatment doesn't work, or why my life is the way it is, or why I seem to hate myself, or why nothing has ever worked out, or why people seem to single me out for ridicule, or why trying to improve my circumstances or correct an error seems to make everything worse. I don't know why I seem to have such difficulty, or why certain things hurt so much, or why I can never seem to get anywhere. Every day is the same and attempts at changing the pattern only create what I will charitably describe as further complications. When people ask what I want to do, I say I don't know. When people ask what I'm doing, I say I don't know. When people ask what I've done, I say I don't know. When I ask myself why I'm bothering to post this, I say I don't know. I'm nearly 36 and my life has amounted to so little that I cannot think in meaningful ways about things I've done, am doing, or might do. I cannot construct a narrative. There is no context. There is no continuity. It's all just some shit that happened before everything that came afterward. Just to be clear, I'm not thinking of hurting myself or anything like that, I've just been wrong about so much that I don't even know if feeling like this is real or just another thing I've somehow gotten wrong. I feel like I can no longer trust my perceptions or judgment, like I've been gas-lighting myself for decades. "

Turns out, the further back I went the easier it was to see how I eventually ended up here. I know it's not good to dwell, but my wife and I have twins on the way and I want to remember the chain of events I went through so I can (hopefully) help prevent it from happening to them. I had a tough adolescence, but not in a way that would seem outwardly obvious to anyone (even myself until recently). I was born in Detroit and lived my young childhood there. At that time, most of my family also lived there (Before the crash) and all the adults were somewhere on the alcoholic spectrum. I grew up going to my cousin's house (he was the COOLEST) and his parents were in bad shape. He slept on a mattress on the floor in a FILTHY house in a shady neighborhood. My aunt and uncle were co-dependent alcoholics. There were always empty vodka bottles lining every shelf, window sill, and surface... paper towels in the bathroom instead of TP... rarely any food... you know the drill. Regardless, my parents weren't like that and I lived a comfortable, average suburban life. Lots of friends in the neighborhood, parents provided a good support system... my Dad always drank but rarely to excess. We moved from Detroit to the NW as a family when I was 10 or so, and I was put in a school that was VERY clicky. My mother always tells me that if she had things to do over again, she would have taken me out of that school and put me somewhere else. One of her great regrets... I didn't really make any friends, got teased alot, generally kind of an outcast until I hit junior high. Once in junior high I found some kids I could hang out with, but I was still awkward. About the time I was 13 or so, I made a friend who was friends with some of the ""cool"" kids. I got a chance to hang out with them, and they had 2 18 racks of Milwaulkies Best Ice beer. The stuff was rancid and warm because they had to hide it in the closet, but after choking down 1 or 2 of them I was in LOVE. What is this magical elixir? All of a sudden I'm part of the group! I'm cracking jokes, horsing around... just like one of the guys. I had such a great time that night, definitely puked in the backyard and felt like shit the next morning but whatever... fun kids stuff. My parents were hard-liners. Instead of having my first drink with my parents, they insisted I wait until I was 21... like that was going to happen. Going into high school I began to seek out this feeling... my ""Friends"" and I would do grocery store runs where a bunch of us would tear into a grocery store all at once causing chaos while 2 or 3 of us would grab as many 24 packs as we could carry. We would walk the neighborhoods at night looking for garages with open side doors to grab beer (or liquor if we were really lucky) from. We would pay adults to buy booze for us, steal bottles from our parents... whatever we could do to get ahold of it. About this time I also learned that if I was the guy who had the booze, I didn't have to try to make people like me... they would just want to hang out with me because of what I had. I began to be known as the guy who had the booze, which made me feel cool for the first time. This concept I learned I could expand if I started to have drugs too. I started selling weed as soon as I got a car (16). It was great, everybody was always paging me (this was the 90's), I got invited to EVERY party, everyone happy to see me.... I felt even cooler. I didn't get good grades in high school AT ALL... I think I graduated with a 2.6 GPA. I always told my parents that I had trouble focusing when I would study, my mind would wander and the time would just get away from me. This was always chalked up to too much TV, video games... general lack of interest in my studies, which wasn't the case at all. By the time I was 17 I was a very prolific writer and musician, but I just couldn't power through the other stuff. Thankfully I scored well on my SAT's so I was able to get into a good state school. My parents ""hoped beyond hope"" that I would change in college, and I was SURE I was going to be able to pull it off. Ha... right. When I was 19 my mom scheduled me a psychologist appointment for the first time to see if I did in fact have ADD. The doctor diagnosed me with ADHD so severe, I was prescribed 3 STRONG doses per day. At the time, there weren't any restrictions on how much could be prescribed... so I ended up with 360 pills all at once. 360 pills, guy with low self esteem in college craving attention... can you guess what I did with them? All the while. my drinking was continuing to increase. My sophomore year I joined a fraternity, and it was a party house. I was always the supplier (coke, exctacy, weed... you name it), and I had the Rolodex of girls and guys who like to party to call any night of the week. Any chance I had of graduating college vaporized the 2nd semester of my 2nd year.. but MAN it was fun. Cracks in my armor were starting to show though. By the time I was 19 I had 3 minor in possession tickets (MIP) for booze-related incidents. I wrecked my car in a DUI accident (no one was hurt) when I was 20 coming home from a party.... actually had a bag of coke in my pocket when they booked me at the station. I had just gotten my tongue pierced (yes, a tongue ring) and I told the cop it was sea salt to make sure it didn't get infected. I'm sure he knew what it was, but I think he was so impressed with my ability to pull something like that out of my ass with my BAC as high as it was, he just threw it away. Ruined my family thanksgiving the next day tho. I eventually got kicked out of my fraternity because they were getting tired of my shit. Yep, I had gotten so bad even a rowdy fraternity didn't want me anymore. Thankfully I had met a girl and she let me move in with her and her roommates. She had a cocaine problem in high school (she was a rich girl) and I was selling it at the time... codependent match made in hell. That tumultuous relationship lasted way longer than it should have. Eventually I got a job at a cybersecurity startup in LA (lied my way through my interview) with a toxic substance abusing office culture, and I was off to the races again. In that company at that time, there were bottles of vodka in the office an nobody looked at you sideways for day drinking. Aside from the drinking, that job helped me build the career I have today, as well as take me to Europe where I met my wife. She was always wary of how much I drank, but she had never met a real alcoholic and wasn't really aware of how to handle it at the time. I put her through some pretty tough times, and during the 2 years we were apart trying to do her visa legally, I fell into a deep depression and the drinking really got out of control. By the time we were finally reunited, she barely even recognized me. I slowed down for awhile, but eventually it crept back up as it always does. With a few breaks, this cycle lasted up until last month when I finally quit. Looking back, I think I finally pushed myself over the edge in mid 2014 while we were apart... but I was destined to get here eventually anyways by the events that preceded it. So, what have I learned and what will I change with my kids? 1. I was groomed from a young age to see drinking as ""cool"". Everybody I loved and respected were heavy drinkers. This will not be an early memory for my kids, they will not see me with a bottle in my hand. 2. I was introduced to drinking at a very vulnerable time. I was vulnerable because my family loved the fact that I was ""such a nice boy"", but as a result I never really built any character. I didn't have any opinions or values and as a result I was very malleable. I will make sure to instill strong values in my kids. Booze isn't just ""illegal and dangerous"", it's poison. 3. I was in a ""no tolerance"" house, so my views on drinking and drugs became part of the drug itself. In my house, my kids will be introduced to wine at a young age so they can build up a rapport with it. My wife is Italian, no one in her family has a drinking problem and they were all introduces to wine by the family when they were very young. 4. I was always just told to ""study harder"", without ever getting formerly evaluated. My kids will speak to a therapist regardless of whether or not I notice anything. Being able to be open and honest with an impartial 3rd party is SO important for mental health. Sometimes there are things you just don't feel you can tell your parents."

I see a pattern but I'm not sure what to do. I *am* going to AA tonight. I *will* power through this day while trying to be kind to myself. But something fundamental needs to change. It's like I have 9 out of 10 things figured out, but you need all 10 to be right and good. And that 10th thing, I think, is socialization. I work from home and am cripplingly isolated. My therapist brings this up first thing in pretty much every session. I have two friends in my small town, and two friends who live far away. But no real social circle. I haven't been to a real social gathering in years. My most recent screw-up, which brings me to this morning and this 3-alarm hangover, has no rhyme or reason to it, which is so very frustrating. I just finished my first two classes in Computer Info. Tech on the path toward becoming a cybersecurity person. I love the material and aced both classes. Now I'm studying for the A+ exam. All these are good things -- and yet I'm jeopardizing them hugely. The dragon in my just wants a scorched life, or so it seems. I sincerely appreciate any ideas for how I can become a whole person. If I'm honest, I don't really *want* to go to the meeting tonight -- but often, resistance is a sign that you really *should* do a thing, so I'm doing it. We'll see how it goes. "
