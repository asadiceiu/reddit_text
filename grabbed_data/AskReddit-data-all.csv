0,vulnerability,AskReddit,Reddit how would you deal in my situation?,1,e59jiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e59jiu/reddit_how_would_you_deal_in_my_situation/,2019-12-03 12:47:30,"Psychologically crippled.. I want to let out - before I visit a doc. My last post here. I have an approaching exam, I am in jitters. I have prepared and not prepared - I just don't know what I did. I can't recall anything - only in fragments of my studies. I didn't go outside, hang out, or watched movies or did anything that interested me. Only for a once in a while I was out - on my best friends birthday celebration. I have emotional episodes of anger outbursts, uncontrollable crying, and feelings like going mad. This cycle repeats once I am triggered with something which stresses me out. Life seems unfair to me, the urge to do something fades in and out after few good days. Cycle repeats. It has been 1 year to my abuse 1) Was sexually harassed by my Boss (he played on my vulnerability) 2) I was abused molested by my Dad's Sisters' husband (Uncle) at their home. As I was staying there, he would come into my room when I was asleep, he would touch my privates. He would play porn loudly when my aunt is outside - and masturbate in other room. All while knowing I am there. I made every effort to escape and protect myself. I did. I was helpless in my situation. Psychologically crippled. 3) In Office - I was in need of a job - friends became my manipulators - I was doing their work, extra hours of work on and off. A friend became a stalker. 4) All while everyone was pressing me for my marriage - I didn't date anyone in my life. So, I was introduced to a guy - only in social media platform I talked with him for 1 month and till today he has managed to rob me of my sanity. His constant threats, emotional manipulation, playing on my vulnerability, and getting in touch my parents and other known relatives - he has made me look like a failure. I had quiet job after everything. This fucking man - pulled all strings knowing me in and out - he used my naive nature to his advantage just in 1 month. His messages were in contrast to my partner in future. Everything conflicted, emotional blackmailing - his messages were so structually curated regarding every aspect of my life. He portrayed relationship as such - that everything were taken care of. Imagine, a guy telling he loves you, he has everything, he would do this and do that - all facade but perfect. It all would seem like - why I am saying NO to him. He is perfect and I am not. His messages were all sexual innuendoes - he views are sick regarding women. He is empty in his views regarding life. He doesn't know anything - no interests nothing. He messaged my best friend's, my cousins and everyone - to seek their approval. My parents still think he is a good guy, my relatives too - my best friend's trust me. This mayhem he managed to create in my life has shaken me with belief that I am helpless. I am in control of him. I am that bird that is caged under his manipulation. I feel sick - mad. It has been more than 1 year I said NO to him, but other people in my extended family thinks he is absolutely good guy. They are in touch with him. Their answer was to him - this girl said No, we can't do anything. But they haven't cut off being in touch with him. Which encourages him - he knows everything about me - knowing I am still unmarried - He fucking things he owns me. He is obsessive narcissist manipulator. His guilt trippings, his threats - don't stop. He still lives in the hope that he will marry me because I am unmarried. He had called my father out of the Blue - my father doesn't reply to him. He had called saying, ""I want to confess something"" along the lines which my father blurted out in dinner table with a laugh. This triggered my mood - I am reliving everything again after a months gap. I am tired. I have got proposals many time - I have politely refused earlier. I always waited for the man, right man in my life. After these things - I have given up on everything that things will ever get better in my life. I grew up reading to be good, have principles, and values in life. Have character in life - all for these? I let myself abused, exploited, drained for others - their family members, cousins. This is what I get in return. It is bitter place outside - I never grew up with thick skin. I am in late mid twenties now - and this is my state of my mind. I had job offers - very good ones, I didn't take a chance. Now I am left with eroded self-esteem, confusion and hopelessness. I just want to sleep forever. I feel like a failure, at loss with life, no interests, passion - just like nothing will ever turn up good in my life. Same cycle repeats again. I wish to start afresh, all over again. I try and return to square one. A single bad episode makes me unstable, angry, and in uncontrollable outbursts. Just a failure and drowned in guilt an empty shell. I want to start working again, I just feel anxious that I won't be able to answer in an Interview. I will get anxious and go numb. I had so much potential, I am just drowning deep into the darkness where my mind keeps on playing I won't. No self-esteem nothing.... It is frustrating to see what I was and what I am now. I am stuck. I don't have confidence to even recall or remember a page answer - I feel as if my mind shuts down previous days memories. Please help me - where do I start? This cycle is repeating - have highs and lows days - feel like I am getting mad, not suicidal. I just want to sleep now. I am feeling empty and heavy."

I can do calm and anger quite well but happiness and sadness are ones I struggle with revealing even to my wife. For example: we had to put our cat to sleep recently. I loved that cat. She was at an age where the end was not a surprise, but it still hurt like cactus buggery to lose her. The day it happened, I cried in front of my wife. I allowed myself that one. The day after, I cried again. I then proceeded to mentally beat myself up for it. The thing is, I know I am being silly. Its not a problem to cry in front of my wife. She appreciates emotion as a part of life and wants me to be OK expressing it, so how do I get to be OK with it? I dont want to be one of those guys that holds it all in and kills themselves at 38 but I can feel myself going that way. I cant afford a therapist by the way so that route is out. I just want to be able to open some of the doors and windows in my brain."

4,vulnerability,AskReddit,"Why does it seem like society always attempts to downplay, ignore, or stigmatize the male orgasm or male sexual pleasure?",0,ay4bgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ay4bgr/why_does_it_seem_like_society_always_attempts_to/,2019-03-07 08:36:52,"Is it because prostate play has a stigma attached to it, because society still stigmatizes gay men? Is it because being the stronger sex means youre taking the active role and acting as the pleasure giver instead? Straight sex just seems like its all about the woman to me. No offense. Im a gay man, and I always thought straight sex looked unappealing because 1) Im not attracted to women 2) Theres less dynamism and dexterity involved, as far as roles in the bedroom 3) It seems like its more riddled with taboo areas 4) A man is shamed if he cant bring his partner to orgasm 5) They dont know anything about male erogenous zones as a result and therefore 6) The pleasure a man can experience seems limited from my perspective...just plain penile orgasms. It also made me think about circumcision, and how its normalized for men, even though it has no proven health benefits and blunts some of the sexual pleasure felt when you stroke it. Why do we, as a society, seem to want to downplay, ignore, or outright take away sexual pleasure for men? Its sort of sad and irritating. It creates the line of thought I men that sex is what youre doing to a woman, rather than something youre doing together. I started having sex with men and enjoying it much more because I got more pleasure out of it, less was taboo, and it was far more mutual and reciprocal. Maybe its because we intrinsically link sexual pleasure to vulnerability and submission, in most cases? And its always been tough for men to be seen as vulnerable and submissive? Does anybody get what I mean or realize this as well? "
5,vulnerability,AskReddit,"[Serious] How have people dealt with depression and anxiety, and what are your stories?",1,a5ajkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a5ajkq/serious_how_have_people_dealt_with_depression_and/,2018-12-12 07:18:37,"I find that discussing these stories with other people helps make me feel like I'm not alone, so if this goes for you too, feel free to post here. However, if the subject is too uncomfortable to discuss, do not feel any obligation to share. With a mother who has depression and anxiety to a father with diagnosed with PTSD who doesn't believe in depression and anxiety, my bout with depression has been interesting. I have an overwhelming sense of obligation, which often means that 'no' isn't an answer, even if I recognize that I should say it. At the beginning of the year, a new chapter in my life began when I got a job and began volunteering regularly. Not out of my own needs, mind you, but to complete a social quota which I believed everyone I know had given me. Working 20 hours a week on top of school and my volunteering, on top of things I had already begun previously, can really do a number on you. Other events before this had caused my emotions to swell, but nothing pushed me over more than conflict. Considering my house is constantly a warzone, it's difficult to avoid it. When I found myself with not time to tend to my own needs, having to quell other people's arguments wasn't really something I wanted to do, but of course, I felt as if it was as important as my job. So, as a sort of twisted motivator, I would often retrieve my personal rifle and look upon it. At this point it was either appeasement or death. I began to make a habit of this over a few months, and one night after a particularly heated argument with my mother over moving her desk, I decided it was time. It wasn't the argument itself that angered me, it was the fact that it was an argument at all. How crazy would one have to be to get so heated over moving a desk? I was hospitalized after I described to my school counselor an attempt on my own life, wherein I forgot to load the gun I had planned to use in a flurry of emotions and scared myself into sharing with them. Though I'm glad I did, I've still not gotten over these feelings of dread that lead me to feel as if the only option was to die. However now they've mellowed, and I desire nothing more than to leave my town and continue my life plans elsewhere. There's a certain vulnerability with being labeled with depression that I feel can only be escaped through leaving everything behind. However I press on, hoping college can usher in my own personal golden age. I have a lot of things I still want to do. Hopefully this wall of text isn't too daunting. And, hopefully, you have had more success than I have. "
