0,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,QM- Tanks and healers should be preferentially matched together,1,eytuez,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/eytuez/qm_tanks_and_healers_should_be_preferentially/,2020-02-05 04:47:33,"Basically title. There will never be a lack of DPS players, so I think the best improvement for QM would focus on the game experience of tanks and healers. If someone is playing tank, the matchmaker should prioritize matching them with a healer (or vice versa if healer is less common). The two roles benefit disproportionately from each other, and the two are the least common. Dont dumpster their queue times for it, just do it when reasonable. A tanks HP pool is very much a resource for them, vs ranged DPS whos HP pool is generally a vulnerability. Tanks can make more plays with a healer backing them up. Their role necessitates being in a more dangerous position. The lower a tanks HP gets, the less it can perform its role. Its true for every hero to an extent, but Jaina only needs to step forward for a second. A tank needs to create space/ward/engage for everyone else, typically for more than the time it takes to mash all buttons. I figure everyone understands why a healer would want a tank, so I wont bore you with the explanation. Both roles would be a lot more rewarding if they were paired together, which might encourage more people to play those roles. Like I said, dont dumpster their queue times. There will always be a shortage of them, so this will never work for 100% of the matches. I think making the experience generally better for those roles would help retain them, and encourage people to try out the roles they dont often play."
1,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,New Samuro - Issues and possible solutions,1,eckcd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/eckcd7/new_samuro_issues_and_possible_solutions/,2019-12-19 10:16:05,"Alright, so the new Samuro has been out for a while and we've had now time to test and draw some conclusions. My opinion over the overall design of the rework being solid stands. Samuro saw an overall move from macro/burst to PvP, which is good and fits his fantasy. But here's the first problem: #1. He lost *too* much macro power *TL;DR: His macro didn't get nuked, it got deleted. Too much delete, some Ctrl+Z needed* He's now is now closer to the likes of Genji - he has little to no macro input, as both his bruiser and giant camp capturing takes a lot longer and is extremely risky given you have to trade ~50% of your own HP for it. Sure his siege damage isn't bad but it's not nearly as good as before (due to base damage nerf which *was uncalled for*), and he also has little to no wave clear, which before was not an issue due to the instant rotations he now no longer has. He can't even double soak now. So his macro input is now: - Taking timed camps, while also being slower at them than before - Opportunistic siege on a pushed wave For a melee assassin that fills the offlane role, Samuro's macro input is now worse than that of Illidan or Greymane (he can't even compare, they both can doublesoak and clear waves much faster than him while having comparable if not better siege damage). As of right now, his macro identity and playstyle didn't get the nerf it needed, it just got completely killed off. # 2. His kit is now built for sustained damage, yet he's still easily kited *TL;DR: He's meant to kill backlines now in a similar fashion to Illidan -with sustain damage-, but these same backlines can use mobility skills to pretty effortlessly kite him and nullify his damage output* This is the bigger issue right now. Samuro has always been easy to kite - his chase is linear and does not last long enough to be able to chase after mobility skills are used. Before this was something Samuro could adapt to, as he both had the option to macro and the option to spec into burst to be able to deal his damage quickly. But now there's a little problem, his macro got *deleted* and his burst (accounting for base damage nerf and Phantom Pain nerf) ate a ~30% damage nerf (it lost it's viability now, at all) This is an issue because if you are picking a melee hero that deals sustained damage (example - Illidan) they *need* to have basic tools that allow them to deal with mobility. Sure, Samuro has a mobility talent at level 1 that allows him to deal with this, doesn't he? This is the problem: Way of the Wind is a talent that forces a loss/loss situation on you. Because it is the only level 1 talent that doesn't give damage, and due to the nerfing of Samuro's base damage and the buffing of Way of the Blade (a talent that competes) the difference in damage output between a Samuro that picked Way of the Blade versus one that picked Way of the Wind is around 20%. ***ON A HERO SOLELY BASED AROUND DEALING DAMAGE*** So you either have the means to hit the mobile squishy, but can't actually deal meaningful damage to them, or you can't even hit them in the first place. Also, before people bring up the Bladestorm argument, not only are you going to get stunned and killed if you use that anywhere near a tank, but also Samuro's talentless DPS is superior to Bladestorm, so even if it still were unstoppable, the damage is still negligible (nice waveclear it gives though). ---------- So now that we have detailed and explained the two big issues at hand, let's get into how to possibly solve them # 3. Possible solutions *TL;DR Make Way of the Wind baseline, move Harsh Winds to level 1, make a Burning Rage E talent at 16* The possible solution consists of three steps, it goes like this: - 1. Make Way of the Wind baseline The first change to address Samuro's extreme vulnerability to kite is make Way of the Wind baseline. This talent not only fixes the issue in a way that is fun, but also helps Samuro better roam and rotate in the early game. And because it's not a passive buff like Advancing Strikes, it can be played around and thus generates interaction and skill play. But most importantly, it gives Samuro a tool to play around the mobility of the targets he's supposed to be assassinating in team fights, while also giving him a clear threat window for tanks and healers to look out for. I hope i made Donald proud with this wall, because i sure put effort in it - 2. Move Harsh Winds to level 1 *(AKA the new Way of the Wind)* Making Way of the Wind baseline means that he's left without a third level 1. Harsh Winds is a level 16 talent that currently suffers from no viability due to Samuro's rebalance. However, it would work perfectly as a level 1 talent: - It's a distinct choice from the other two talents. One increases Samuro's base damage which betters his macro output, the other increases Samuro's sustain damage output, there's a clear third option that increases burst missing. ""But it's a level 16 talent, it'd be broken at level 1..."" Harsh Wind's power level comes from Samuro scaling his damage through level 1 and level 7 talents. Since it's now moved to level 1 the talent's overall power level is now lowered significantly due to no longer having a level 1 talent to boost it's damage with. Still if it becomes problematic, the talent can easily be balanced by tweaking the damage bonus it provides. - 3. New level 16! Now the vacancy is at level 16, which now needs a new talent. Still i believe i have come up with a thematic, fun option that wouldn't be too hard to implement - \*new* Harsh Winds - Whenever Wind Walk breaks, Samuro gains a Burning Rage effect that deals a moderate amount of damage per second for 3s, Critical Strikes against heroes increase the damage dealt by 15% and the duration by 1s You may quickly realize this is inspired by Leoric's Burning Despair talent. For me it would be a very fun talent to get and try to ""chase the dream"" of stacking it as high as possible to deal loads of damage. It's also a distinct niche from Press the Attack's sustain style and Merciless Strikes' CC style while also having synergy with the other Wind Walk talents These changes would also give Samuro's macro some help, both with rotation times *(c'mon he's a Blademaster, him rotating gigafast is fitting to say the least)* and with a minimal amount of added waveclear from that new version of Harsh Winds. And before people come screaming at me for wanting what in essence are buffs for him, don't forget that last rework was a Tsar Bomb level of a nerf (he was a macro hero that lost pretty much all of his macro, and gained some small PvP buffs in return, he's very weak right now"
2,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Hero Concept: Queen Azshara,15,dl0x2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/dl0x2h/hero_concept_queen_azshara/,2019-10-22 00:56:26,"With her recent release in WoW, complete with a bunch of cool spells and animations, I wanted to have a go at making a HotS version of Queen Azshara. &amp;#x200B; **Design Philosophy** Azshara is, naturally, going to be a pretty aggressive mage-style assassin. Thematically, all of her abilities are derived from her (mythic) WoW encounter, which were easy to organically export to a MOBA setting. But I wanted to give her a unique mechanic to separate her a bit more from other mages without making her too homogenized. Thus, the idea of *Drain Power* was born -- her D trait which can only be activated near primary objectives\*, granting her lots of mana and spell power. The idea is simple; Azshara is a mage who excels at fighting near objectives and both teams can play around her large spell power buff. But it doesn't last too long, Similar to Mephisto, she excels at applying high continuous pressure to enemy teams who are packed near main objectives, but at the drawback of potentially reduced waveclear/PvE. Also in the spirit of magi, she doesn't really have much baseline mobility or defensives, making her a fairly high risk / high reward mage. In terms of her actual abilities, her central mechanic is Arcane Vulnerability, which applies a stacking debuff that increases the damage enemies take from her other abilities. This plays into her strengths of applying continuous pressure, before finishing off her enemies with her ultimates, Arcane Bomb / Divide &amp; Conquer. Lastly, she also has access to special Decrees at level 7 which slightly improves her ST damage. Overall, I hope the stuff I've written here fits cohesively into a kit that looks relatively fun. I've also avoided assigning specific damage / range numbers to anything, and with talent trees being so large it's possible a few talents are a bit unrealistic. Enjoy! &amp;#x200B; \*Primary objectives are based on the map, and the activation area for Drain Power would have to be coded as some radius centered on the objective(s) **which are active**. For example, the Angels in BoE, towers in ToD, or even moving objectives like Hamamura. &amp;#x200B; **Abilities** *D - Drain Power* \[2 sec channel, 80s CD\] Azshara drains power from a nearby primary objective, restoring 30% of her mana and granting 30% spell power for 12 seconds. Passive - Arcane Vulnerability Arcane Jolt, Arcane Missiles, Arcane Bomb and Divide &amp; Conquer applies stacks of Arcane Vulnerability to enemies, increasing damage they take from these abilities by 4% for 8 seconds. Stacks indefinitely. Quest: Arcane Mastery Apply 100 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability to enemies. Reward: reduce the mana cost of all spells by 40%. &amp;#x200B; *Q - Arcane Jolt* \[Line skillshot, 3s CD, \~50 mana\] Fire a jolt of arcane energy, dealing X damage to the first target hit and slowing for 35%. Applies 2 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; *W - Arcane Missiles* \[PBAOE centered on Azshara, 3s CD, \~50 mana\] Blast up to 6 nearby enemies with Arcane Missiles for X damage. Applies 1 stack of Arcane Vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; *E - Beckon* \[Targeted, 15s CD, \~40 mana\] Beckons a Heroic target, pacifying them and causing them to run towards Azshara for 1 second. &amp;#x200B; *R1 - Arcane Bomb* \[PBAOE centered on Azshara, 100s CD, \~100 mana\] After Channeling for 3 seconds, blast all **visible\*** enemies within a large radius for X damage. Applies 3 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability. \*Basically, this ultimate is easily dodgeable if you just hide in the fog or around the corner. &amp;#x200B; *R2 - Divide and Conquer* \[Vector-targeted wall, 80s CD, \~100 mana\] Create a wall of Arcane Energy for 4 seconds, dealing massive damage to enemies who walk through it. Applies 3 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; **Talents** \[1\] - Playstyle tier. Helps shift focus into PvE, skirmishing, or pushing more power into bursts of CDs every 2 minutes. *Queen of Everything* Arcane Missiles deals 100% increased damage to non-heroic and non-structural targets. &amp;#x200B; *Reverberating Jolt* Arcane Jolt bounces to up to two nearby Heroes if it hits a Heroic target. These extra Jolts slow for 15%. &amp;#x200B; *Ward of Power* \[120s CD\] Summon a Ward of Power near Azshara, allowing her to cast Drain Power. &amp;#x200B; \[4\] - Defensive tier. Either spec into sustained healing, burst healing, or movespeed. *Arcane Sustenance* For each stack of Arcane Vulnerability suffered by heroes, heal for X health per second, stacking up to 10 times. *Grace of the Queen* Hitting enemies with Arcane Jolt increases Azshara's Movespeed by 20% for 2.5 seconds. *Drain Vitality* Drain Power also heals Azshara for 30% of her maximum health, and grants 15 Armor for its duration. &amp;#x200B; \[7\] - Added ability. These help her apply more ST pressure, with pseudo-control. *Queen's Decree: Stand Alone!* \[Targeted, 45 sec CD\] Order targeted Hero to Stand Alone for 4 seconds. For each second the hero is not within Z yards of an ally, suffer X damage and gain 1 stack of Arcane Vulnerability. *Queen's Decree: Stand Together!* As above, but targeted Hero needs to stand within Z yards of an ally to avoid the damage. *Queen's Decree: Stay!* \[Targeted, 60s CD\] As above, but target Hero needs to stand still for **2.5** seconds to avoid the damage. \[10\] - Heroics. \[13\] - Beckon tier. Improves her control further. I shifted damage talents into later tiers to shift her power into lategame. *Ultimate Seduction* Beckoned Targets receive 60% reduced healing during and for 2 seconds after they are Charmed. *Brilliant Machinations* Striking a Hero with Arcane Jolt while they are Beckoned applies 4 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability. *Treachery* If Azshara's beckoned target reaches her, stun them for 1.5 seconds. &amp;#x200B; \[16\] - New playstyle tier. *Anu-Azshara* Azshara's autoattacks apply 2 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability and reduce the cooldown of Beckon by 1.5 seconds. *Piercing Bolt* Arcane Jolt now pierces through all enemies, applying 2 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability. *Indomitable* \[80s CD\] Summon a Naga commander, who slowly walks to the nearest primary objective. Upon reaching it, it sacrifices itself, causing Azshara's next Drain Power to increase Spell Power by 50% and cast instantly. If the Indomitable is killed before it reaches the objective, nothing happens. &amp;#x200B; \[20\] *Might of the Naga* Increases Azshara's attack range by 1.5 and her Attack Speed by 30%. Her attacks also heal for 3% of her maximum health. *Terror of N'Zoth* Divide and Conquer now summons Eyes of N'zoth, forming a perpendicular beam to her summoned wall. Reduces the Cooldown of Divide and Conquer to 45 seconds. *Arcane Obliteration* Arcane Burst now applies 12 stacks of Arcane Vulnerability. *Lady Venomtongue* \[80s CD\] Summons one of Azshara's most trusted maidens, Lady Venomtongue. Lady Venomtongue channels Power Transfusion, pausing the duration of Azshara's currently active Drain Power buff and increased cooldown rate by 100% while Azshara is within X yards of her, or until she dies."

5,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,The Tank Problem,146,co1zlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/co1zlh/the_tank_problem/,2019-08-09 22:55:23,"**Note:** Throughout this post I will be removing Cho'Gall from the ecuasion since they're the only heroes conditioned by someone else's pick. This means the effective Hero Pool I'll be talking about is 85. If you asked what role is underrepresented 2 years ago, many people (myself included) would have said Healer. That started to change (arguably) with Stukov. Ana and Alexstrasza came soon after him, followed by Deckard and Whitemane in quick succession a while later. With the recent addition of Anduin and some significant reworks (Tyrande being arguably the most impactful one) the number of Healers was brought to 16, which is almost 20% of the Hero pool. In the meantime, the meta has also solidified into a steady Tank-Healer-Ranged Damage-Solo Laner-Flex team composition, which means that each of these slots should have roughly 20% of the hero pool dedicated to filling it. The Healer role now roughly achieves that. There are 20-25+ Ranged Damage dealers that can function as the only ranged damage of their team, which means that slot is fine as well. With 14 Bruisers dedicated to the solo lane, as well as 11 Melee Assassins (4 of which, again, almost exclusively taking the solo labe) and upwards of 5 Ranged Assassins and 5 tanks apiece who can cover it, the Solo Laner slot is also well represented. Flex is out of the question by definition, arguably any of the 85 heroes can fill the Flex slot in a team composition. That leaves us with the Tank slot. There are 11 Heroes currently in the Tank role. You can also fit Uther, Taunt Varian or Imperius in this slot in certain cases. That brings the total up to 14. That is 16% of the total hero pool. But that isn't the whole story. Diablo, Garrosh, E.T.C. and Muradin currently perfectly fit the crowd control meta. They are sturdy and provide plenty displacement/stuns to be viable, while also having their weaknesses. Anub'arak has dominated for quite a while for the same reason but seems to have dropped off recently. Johanna comes as an answer to this due to her Unstoppable trait. She is viable not because of her CC but because of her resistance to enemy CC. Next we have Tyrael, Mal'ganis and Stitches who are strong, but very niche because their mechanics require team coordination (no hard CC for Tyrael, not waking up targets for Mal'ganis' setup and low Hook cooldown that can miss). I will add that Tyrael is in fact a top tier tank, but he is also very difficult to play which is why he isn't as impactful on average and thus not seen as often. Finally, Arthas and Blaze are just as potent and have as many drawbacks as Imperius and Taunt Varian when played as main tanks. Which is why we often see them on the solo lane. Why is that? Their main drawback is their vulnerability to enemy lockdown. Diablo, E.T.C., Anub'arak and Muradin have ways to push themselves out of danger, while Garrosh and Johanna can simply unstoppable at the press of a button. That means the slot is filled by one of 6 to 7 Heroes in the vast majority of games, compared to at least 10-12 Healers that you wouldn't be mad to have in any given game. The solution seems simple: add more tanks to the game. But it's not like the devs haven't tried. Yrel and Blaze were both advertised as capable of tanking. Blaze needed several changes to eventually get there while Yrel was consolidated as a bruiser. Following them were Mal'ganis and Imperius whose issues I already explored. This means that the last tank who undeniably only fits this slot was Garrosh, released exactly two years and one day ago, ironically. Diablo, Garrosh and Anub'arak have also been nerfed several times seeing how much they were dominating. But the way they were nerfed never addressed the strength of their lockdown. Diablo and Garrosh had their cooldowns increased, while Anub'arak received nerfs to his Cocoon, damage, and trait, but their effectiveness in locking targets down never changed. Meanwhile Muradin and E.T.C. have only been buffed recently. In comparison, Arthas' CC lasts just as long, but is only a root instead of a stun. Blaze's has a windup that can be interrupted. Mal'ganis' and Yrel's stuns last 0.75s as opposed to 1s or 1.25s. Imperius' stun is a very narrow skillshot, similar to Stitches'. And on top of this, their Heroics are simply not playmakers in the way Apocalypse, Warlord's Challenge, Cocoon, Blessed Shield or Mosh Pit are. **TL; DR:** This is, in my opinion, the Tank Problem, in HotS: the Tanks at the top of the food chain have 1) survivability, 2) lockdown, 3) a way to escape enemy lockdown and 4) Game-changing heroics. If any of these four categroies are skipped, the Tank is lower grade. Add to that the low number of tanks we even have, you realise the role is very constrictive. As a self-plug, I will be posting hero concepts for Lady Liadrin and Executor Selendis as potent main tanks as soon as I get to my PC (Sunday or later). Until then, I will gladly join the discussion in the comments and am interested to see other people's opinions on the issue."

I love him as a hero and i really like playing him as a maintank ofc (offlane he is capable too) but i have to say, nearby the rest of the meta tanks (anub, jojo, ETC) he has a lot of diving issues, more i feel than the rest of their fellow tanks. Im a tank main btw, currentlyy Diamond 2-3 and i watch a ton of DivisionS games from HerousLounge and i kinda feel the same for the other pros playing the hero in relation to the tanks named above, in that sense that they are incredibly more carerful when they play him and less aggressive than with the other tanks. &amp;#x200B; Its like he dives just abit to deep with his Q, cause hitting properly with all 3. Q's are not as easy as it looks, even if it seems, that your allies are nearby, one wrong palced Q and you are so ugly out of postion or surrounded by the opponent that you just cant get out, and when you try to sleep them (E) if the ppl are abit cautious they interrupt you instantly, as it happens to me often, also the E takes to long for me appear so the ppl have enough tinme to stunlock you down or run away from you., imo. Well im pretty aware, that i need also to adapt my playstyle with him, that for sure, but i still feel he could deserve some changes/buffs to his kit and talent trees, IMHO. I m also aware that some ppl find he is ok how he is now and I also dont wanna make him a firstpick rage-instalock xD but he is currently a too special tank which is I think bound by the incredible low playrate and winrate, which i feel corelates to what i mentioned before . I just think he could be a BIT more flexible/viable in his kit, that he is not that easy kitable/stunlockable as he is now. &amp;#x200B; It would also lead to a maybe higher pickrate/winrate with him cause he is not that kind of a tank who is only taken in super special draftcases anymore and can be taken as atleast a highrated Tier2 tank, which will have still the wanted issues vs CC but not that super-vulnerability anymore as it just now. With all that said, i have made an excel -reworksheet for him and i want to mention now that there are some buffs / changes which are abit overkill maybe in ur opinion but i still would love to have you guys take a look into it and maybe tell,""hey this and that could be something and the other is to much"" or the like \^\^ I would also highly appreciate any highlvl / professional tank-player if he sees this comment, to have a look into the excelsheet and spread his opinion on it :-) &amp;#x200B; PS: if you guys find all changes ridiculous or out of my mind or whatever, pls feel free to leave the comment and dont start blaming/bothering me or smth the along these lines, im just wanting to open some room for discussions about him, thats all :-D &amp;#x200B; (here the link to the file, have fun :-D) [URL"
7,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Help with Grom Hellscream concept.,9,bq6877,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/bq6877/help_with_grom_hellscream_concept/,2019-05-19 03:05:42,"Hey Reddit, &amp;#x200B; One of my favourite characters from Warcraft has to be Grom Hellscream, i've made a small hero concept of his abilities but i'd love to get some feedback! Grom represents the orc berserker for me, I want that to shine in his abilities/playstyle. I also wanted to add an intresting mechanic, instead of mana Grom's abilities cost HP. &amp;#x200B; I'll start with his ultimates, R1=The Hellscream, Grom is known for his hellish scream that strikes fear into his enemies. Grom fears all enemies in a cone infront of him. (This puts him into contrast with garrosh who has taunt and has some similitaries to another orc ultimate, gul'dan) At level 20 you could add a slow/minus armor when the fear ends R2=Blood Curse/pact. Grom accepts the blood curse and becomes a chaos/fel orc. He gains attack speed and ignores enemy armor(Like in warcraft 3, chaos damage ignores armor typing) OR Grom applies a debuff/vulnerability on the targets he attacks, stacking with each hit to a maximum. (Was also toying wth the idea of going chaos orc would self-silence him for the duration of the ultimate) &amp;#x200B; Q=Ravager. Grom throws his weapon at the target location that inflicts damage to all enemies. If Gorehowl reaches the end of its path or hits an enemy hero that hero is stunned and Gorehowl is stuck to that location/the enemy hero. Grom is able to leap towards gorehowl by pressing Q again(when in range). Leaping towards a hero heals grom for x% of his hp. &amp;#x200B; W= Execute: Grom loses 10% of his current hp, but his other abilities and auto attacks deal more damage for the next 5 secconds. For each auto attack that grom deals in those 5 secconds, he applies a mini-stun(0.5 secconds) and heals 2% of his maximum HP. E= Warsong's Fury/Frenzy. This ability costs x% hp of your maximum hp for each x% hp you miss, you will deal AoE damage around you(unsure if this ability could kill yourself or not). &amp;#x200B; Trait= Enrage. Grom is able to toggle this ability on. His auto attacks deal bonus damage(50%?) versus heroes, but Grom takes increased damage from all sources. When toggled off Grom becomes lethargic, his auto attacks deal less damage versus heroes(50%?), but grant him some lifesteal with each attack.(Inspired by berserkers/After the seccond war some orcs lost their battle spirit) [URL"

10,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,(Serious) Why I left HotS but I still want it to succeed w/ poss. suggestions (Also very long w/TL;DR),1,a5f40e,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/a5f40e/serious_why_i_left_hots_but_i_still_want_it_to/,2018-12-12 16:16:35,"*I want to preface this that my intention is to be constructive; not to rage, bait, or flame. This won't be a laundry list of individual complaints as that solves nothing, but more examples of broader issues. And if you love the game for what it is, if you enjoy playing it, it's completely alright and I'm not saying you're wrong for liking it. But deep down, as much as I WANT to love this game, I love the concept of it, but has slowly lost it's luster and how the direction of it has driven me, and like minded players like myself away.* ________________________________________________ ##Presenting my Nerd License, registration, and proof of No-Life-surance Ok, so first off, I want to at least show my ""credibility"" on my grounds to speak. Just to make it clear that I loved this game and was incredibly involved. Feel free to skip if not interested. - [I've been playing since the Alpha around Blizzcon 2014.](URL - Not only that, but I was a very active user on the subreddit. Mainly guides; some jokes and memes: URL - And I played this game a lot. In fact, before the Heroes 2.0 update, I had 30+ Master skins. This was my profile with games played on Dec 2016: URL This isn't me trying to get in a dick measuring contest or gate keeping; but to hopefully show that my critique is coming from. And how I played 3500+ games in the first two years and just 200 or so in the following 2. Here's the thing though: early on, playing this game was the most fun I've ever had. I loved the gameplay, I loved the characters as a huge Blizzard fan boy, the focus on map objectives instead of last hit for 20 minutes. and giving all the kills to the ADC. And I've been trying so hard to recapture that magic. And I know people change, and tastes adjust, but I'm still filled with that anxious excitement when I launch the game, the difference is, instead of KNOWING I'll have a good time, I just kinda hope and am let down. And again, if you enjoy the game now in it's current state; more power to you. You keep on keeping on. Ultimately, this is just my own personal opinion, but seeing as most of my friends and groups, and content creators, and diminished interest of the game at the higher up (HGC) kinda shows that people are losing interest and faith. _______________________________________________ ##TL;DR: Yes, I'm putting this in that early to spare you reading 10 more paragraphs of me whining. *Also putting in ""possible solutions."" I'm not saying I have the right answer for any or to implement all. I'm just ""armchair quarterbacking."" This game is a complex creature, and I'm not qualified to do surgery on it.* - My main issue with the game is the lack of focused direction of the game. The game feels almost as if there are several different conflicting ideas at once, and makes it a jumbled mess. I did see a correlation with Dustin Browder leaving the HotS team to work on another project within Blizzard. - *Possible Solution: Treat 3.0 as an ""Expansion"" pack. Overhaul from the top down. Maps, then Roles, then Heroes. Do it all at once to prevent the ""tail chasing"" we're currently in. Let the past die, kill it if you have to. - The emphasis on balancing damage dealing characters has led to a snowball where tanks need to be balanced on account of the DPS, and Healers need to be strong enough to heal the DPS quickly, but not too strong to heal the tanks who are tailored against the opposing team's DPS. (Ergo: We have carries, protect the carry, draft against the carry) - *Possible Solution: Nerf to all heroes damage output to OTHER heroes, but keep it the damage done same for objectives (Not a lot, maybe 10-20%). This puts pressure back on the map and objectives and prevents the arms race of burst or having the lone ""hero killer."" Fights are more drawn out, meaning more cooldowns used. but also emphasizes ""playing the map"" such as Zoning the objective instead of chasing kills. Less ""Solo Kill potential means more reliance on ALL teammates.* - The constant ""reworks"" to individual heroes shoves them further down a niche removing customization. And if you enjoyed playing the generalist character before, well, too bad, but make sure to buy the new skin for the relaunch. This happened to Kael'thas, Tyrande, Tassadar, Kael'Thas, Rexxar, Kael'thas, Artanis, and Kael'thas. - *Possible solution: Instead of forcing down a single path of syngery, promote experimentation, possibly through static buffs. Example: Abathur is going Hat build, picks Assualt Strain at 13, or goes Locust, but picks Soma transferrence at 13/ Game recognizes you put a ""point"" into something different than the first 3 and gives you a shorter CD on Deep tunnel.* - This whack-a-mole of only focusing on ""popular heroes"" causes other heroes to feel perpetually overlooked, or almost relics that serve less and less of a purpose, and the specialists heavily suffer: Abathur, TLV, and Gazlowe come to mind; and older tanks such as Chen. - *Possible solution: Use the Ben Brode Hearthstone solution. Instead of focusing on the problem, CREATE a solution. E.G. Mages and Tanks wave clear in a single spell. Instead of nerfing AOE damage of the top mages or buffing the minions that makes""weaker"" characters harder to clear, what if you made player pets (Turret, Locusts, Xul's skeletons) take 90% reduced AOE damage? This slows down Mages rotation and clear, makes pets that can target an effective zoning and harassing tool. Mages fall out of the meta without being directly touched.* - ""Anti-Toxicity"" has gone full Templar. Where speaking up at any time could lead to a report. Trying ""LEGITIMATELY"" to shot-call (not flaming)l will be met at best with being ignored or could be instant report because it also mutes. This further drives down the ""organic learning"" of players because people were too scared how to teach and what's left doesn't know how. - *Possible Solution: DOTA 2 solution. Limited amount of reports a player can GIVE (Maybe weekly) If verified the guy was being a douche, the Douche is reprimanded, you get a message saying ""Thanks for making the community a better place"" and get the report refunded. Instead of hitting a threshold by a bot and easily dodged by just not playing, or people being punished too harshly for saying ""Illidan, please, Objective!"" *Another Possible Solution: LoL Commendations and Honor Crests/Rewards for being helpful, for being the shot caller, for keeping everyone calm in the face of adversity, or just filling in as the healer* And again, if you love the changes, more power to you, but I feel that there was a shift in a ""soul"" of the game that's hurting retention of older players, and new players may have felt is ""false advertising."" **NOTE:** *I know people have been listing stock prices falling, but that's across almost all major developers. I'm really not considering macroeconomics in the game's direction even though it may have a ripple effect in philosophy and design. That's above my paygrade and I'm not dipping my toe in that.* ______________________________________ ##**Want to use this space to mention, that above is the gist of it. You don't have to read the rest, as it's me going really in-depth on how I see the certain issues, what may be causing them, and explaining the ""WHY"" of my proposed solutions in detail** ________________________________ ##Fast Paced Brawler or Methodical RTS? HotS was advertised as a very fast pace team brawler that eschews traditional MOBA cornerstones (No laning, no last hitting, no items, constant action and planning, map objectives have the most weight no carries, succeed as a team or fail as individuals.,) And that's what drew me to it. But it seems as the devs want the game to ""slow down"" with the removal of ammo, the now reverted XP changes, Map objectives being more and more spaced out. But at the same time, map objectives are becoming less meaningful and impactful as the rubberband XP keeps you on the same level almost through out the game. (Outside of places like Towers of Doom.) I mentioned Dustin Browder stepping down from the head of the HotS Team. This was around the time Heroes 2.0 rolled out. Alan Dabiri took over from Browder in early 2017. This led to a lot more drastic hero reworks in between Hero launches, and the ones that were recently reworked a few months prior, were built for a different game. Now, Dabiri is stepping down (Still working at Blizzard) and Kaeo Miller is taking the reins leading to the new major overhaul in gameplay such as EXP, stacking armor, and the long discussed rework of the hero classification system. All these people are incredibly talented and poured so much of themselves into this game. But that's the thing, each had their own vision of the game, and is constantly getting pulled in a different direction. That's all I'm really saying. They pour themselves into it, but each is a different person. Do you honor the original vision, do you steer it in something more fitting of personal preferences, and what about the next person? Do you try to preserve the first two, or keep attaching parts like a Chimera? I say, complete overhaul. This would mean the game would be ""in maintenance"" mode for several months. You can still play, ranked may be disabled, but balance patches and hero releases would be far fewer. This may sound like ""suicide"" to a game, but It worked AMAZINGLY for FFXIV and it's relaunch as well as ""For Honor."" Admit it's been nothing more than a band-aid on another at this point, thank loyalty, tell people they can continue playing but for a while, no ""new"" content. Rotate the maps and game modes to keep attention to the dedicated. _________________________________________ ##All Players are Equal, but some are more equal than others. Before, this was on of the few games where it was incredibly satisfying to play a healer, support, or split pusher. I played LoL, TF2, Smite, MMOs and usually the healer was at the mercy of their team, and supports were balanced around having zero items or output mid-late game. And split pushing was heavily punished but kinda dicking over your team. But when I first started playing, when I did well, the entire team contributed and it was noticeable. When I kept teammates alive, or ""secured"" a kill, we got the level advantage, we got the map objective. We could lose the fight 4 deaths to 1, but if I stalled enough time for the objective, it felt great. A fantastic example is (was) Abathur. I did ZERO direct combat (Slapthur was never a good plan A-through-Y, but worked for Z) But I was still contributing soaking double XP, pushing locusts, draining ammo, giving vision, mining an objective, and giving a hat in critical times. What changed? The team became ""carry focused"" By ""carry focused"" with a team needing to build around that one person who gets resets or constant strong damage, and I think that promotes a very ""selfish"" mindset in a team based game. This leads to other people being ""selfish"" and saying screw team dynamic. It creates a sort of anitpathy within each other making a 5v5 into a 1v9. This means if I do anything but Abathur hat build, I'm a troll or throwing the game. This also led to substantial power and mobility creep. You need enough damage to blow up said carries, but need the tanks to survive (Armor) Well, now what if you want to blow up tanks in case, well, Armor reduction (Vulnerability, used to be an ability exclusive to Tyrande and very few other heroes at level 16) But it works so much better if used on the carry. Well, what if your carry needs to survive burst? Have supports give them armor. Now we need to kill the supports to prevent armor on the carry who gets a vulnerability; so make really mobile assassins that ignore terrain. Now, this leads me to my next section, Talents: ____________________________________________ ##So you think you got Talents, or how Blizz stopped worrying and made everyone specialized (except the specialists.) Before this current shift, DPS took a talent at 4 or 7 for extra survivability (Vamp Attacks or First Aid) Melee DPS had a built in Sustain (Illidan's Trait, Kerrigan's Shield, Thrall's Trait, Butcher's brand) and Ranged DPS had to talent for it, usually in terms of Vamp Assualt (Valla, Tychus, Jaina with Frost Shield, Kael with Mana Barrier or the Verdant Orb healing) Raynor and Zeratul being the inverse exceptions. That was really it. If I had, let's say an Illidan constantly casting Hunt on me, I would take a defensive (Sustain, mitigation, mobility, or CC) option at any of the several talent tiers. HOWEVER, now it feels that you need to invest in an exact ability at every tier to be anywhere near useful. Alarak is Lighting Build, Falstad is Hammer build, Nazeebo goes spider build. Tanks were filled with generics talents as well. Almost all had Regen Master, (Sonya being the Exception) All had a level 7 Sustain/Bigger Shield, All had a CC and Damage choices at level 10, Spell Shield 13, Stoneskin 16. This is why my first post that really blew up was defending on how all tanks had the ability of Main Tanking, including Sonya because of the generics. But now because of the changes of talents and constant overhauls, you have AA tanks, Spell Tanks, Peel tanks, Bruisers who are tanks that if you build anything but DPS you're useless. Well, what if I don't know how to play a certain ""Spell tank?"" I can't build my AA/Bruiser into a tank anymore. Hence reintroducing Generalist-Training wheels sort of talents. they won't be as powerful as the specialization, but it allows accessibility by familiarity as well as being a path. In WoW for instance, almost every Talent Tier has a passive talent. A stat buff or a bonus effect. It's never ""as good"" or ""as flashy"" as others but it allows you to ""ease"" into something as you're learning, or if you're a Paladin who's never Tanked, but you guys really need one, you can do a passable job ___________________________________________ ##Whatever Happened to Baby Chen? OK, so this is going to contradict what I said earlier about ""Chasing your tail"" with perpetual hero reworks, but it'll make sense. First, people need to accept the game will never be ""balanced"" where everyone has a 50% winrate and a 1/84th of a pick rate. And that ""balance patches"" are just meant to change things up a bit. Breath of fresh air, but still the same game. Also, that the Devs can and do play a role in steering the game. If they want someone to not play a certain class or spec (Like Demo Locks at the end of WoD because they were making Demon Hunter) they will do that. Ok, that's out of the way. I honestly don't know what the meta is right now, HotsLogs tells me Mal'ganis, Diablo, Django Coffin Girl, Azmo, and... Kael'thas, of fucking course. But the least played heroes with a sub 50% winrate are TLV, Chen, Rexxar, and Tass. If most people were to balance the game, they would say ""Nerf the strong ones, buff the weak ones."" But what if instead, you buff a counter to the current strong ones that a weaker ones counter (or introduce a mechanic on the weaker one, that will eventually be used as a counter.) What I'm seeing is a lot of health on the enemy team and peel for the squishy, delicate, dress-wearing girl and Orphea. So why not, Buff Tychus. He's a tank shredder. Have his minigun trait ignore armor, decrease CD on his Grenade or the wind-up on his grenade to stop Diablo charge and Malganis claws. At the same time, let's make Chen immune to ""Displacements"" (Not Stuns while drinking, make it a talent call it ""Fortified and Stout."" The Chen Buff does nothing for Diablo and Kael who have a ""hard stun"" and him just drinking is going to make Oprhea's ult go off indefinitely. But when Tychus shows the tanks what ""Heaven's Devils"" style is, Kael and Orphea lose their protection, now you need to deal with Tychus who's pretty tanky, shreds health, has a dash, and a disengage. So CD based mage can't burst him down, Assassins can't stick to him, and tanks melt like the wicked witch. Well, now Chen who has an on-demand shield to negate the health shred, has a slow, can stick or zone a target has that new talent that makes him immune to knock backs. Oh man, Chen is so oppressive (A guy can dream), if only there was a tank that could safely CC him from a range or take advantage of his shield. Well Rexxar has Misha stun and Leoric can constantly heal if Chen is stationary., Oh, Both of them have a pretty low pick rate. Can you dig it? _________________________________________ ##Snitching and Non-GMO, Fair Trade, Certified ""Organic"" learning! OK, so this is two fold. But second part first, current report system just encourages mass reporting. I said the DOTA2 solution or the LoL/OW solution of commendations. It really is the best way. Now, if some guy says ""Sorry team, I'm a fucking idiot and threw that"" people report him for Negative attitude, or feeding, the system will flag the language, but upon closer inspection, player was blaming themselves and felt bad. What happens? Nothing. The Reporting Player doesn't get the report ""refunded"" but isn't punished. They believed a player was doing something wrong, they just lost a chance to report something more egregious. The Reported Player is safe because it's one report of one instance of foul language where he was blaming himself. But having those limited reports means each report has SIGNIFICANT more weight, and because of that people will be more frugal with them. And those that are doing a good job policing the community still have the report function. It could be a stupidly high number like 50 a week, but by putting a ""limit"" on how many you have, people will treat them better. It's the same concept of not wnating to use one of your 34 ethers and 27 mega-elixirs against Jenova Synthesis. Because you might need them for the ACTUAL final boss. This also means that more people are willing to talk, respond, communicate, and offer ideas, suggestions, and criticisms. Because saying ""That's a dumb plan XD"" won't knee jerk into a report And this is what I mean by ""Organic learning."" They learn by playing the game, seeing the results. (EgoRaptor's vid on Megaman and Megaman X are great examples if you want to go in depth.) Now, you could say this is mentoring or teaching, but communication and cooperation with teammates is a cornerstone of the game. As people ""learn"" to talk, discuss ideas in a brief and to the point, it becomes more common place. This means more people will speak up and won't be afraid to disagree because that fear of report is so miniscule. This means there is more exchange of ideas, people learn from others and see the reasoning, and apply that. Then people need to counter that strategy through committee of the team. This keeps people learning and the game fresh, And for an extreme example: LoL. Yeah, LoL was toxic AF, it's gotten a lot better though. But go back and watch high level YTers (or even pros) from S1 and S2, and watch video from S4-S5 of just some middle Gold ""want to get to plat"" person. The entry level of knowledge has increased so dramatically that ""high end strats"" a few years ago are now considered the minimum at that level. Summoner's spent, predicting Jungler routes based on the jungler and leash, knowing power spikes of levels. And because of that, it allows the Devs to get more creative to see which can be mastered. It keeps the game growing and the playerbase constantly engaged. __________________________________ ##This is way too Long The TL;DR is in the second section. I got nothing else to say. But feel free to leave any comments or feedback (Or why you think I'm an idiot for writing this, that's cool too.) I do read all of them, but I'll reply to what I can. Thank you again, and (Hopefully) I'll see you in the Nexus soon."
11,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Don't give fort XP...capture them instead?,1,a3icl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/a3icl8/dont_give_fort_xpcapture_them_instead/,2018-12-06 11:10:15,"Hey all, long-time lurker, first-time poster, here to offer a possibly radical suggestion for this ongoing debate on the XP changes. See, I *like* the changes that were suggested; having played HotS fairly regularly since the open beta, I have seen many instances of snowballing and its negative impacts from both sides of the scenario. Think about how many times a team in a fairly even match in terms of comp and skills managed to win an early objective, which let them take a fort and get an XP lead, which made it easier for them to win the next objective, furthering the lead, and the only thing they really did to secure that lead was to play it safe and not make any big mistakes. I've seen it both in my games and the HCG, and I think it comes down to a fundamental problem that the dev team themselves noticed when they proposed these changes: **agency**. **Why Snowballing is bad** When a team is losing by two or more levels, particularly with a talent tier in the way, there isn't really much they can do to get back into the game aside from passively soaking/defending and waiting for the winning team to make a mistake, like splitting up or overextending or just getting complacent in a teamfight, things that a good, coordinated team won't often do. What do I mean by that? Well, when a team is down multiple levels and they've been pushed back to their keeps, any kind of proactive move they could make puts them at a lot of risk which the winning team can easily punish. Try to go out and grab a merc camp? Without much vision, they could easily get invaded by the winning team, and even if they do take the mercs, the winning team can clear them quite quickly. Hunt for picks? If the winning team stays as 5, that isn't likely to happen, and actually securing the kill on the straggler is harder than normal due to level disadvantage. Dying or getting counter-ganked in the attempt is also likely. Try to take a teamfight/objective? If the losing team has been losing teamfights for most of the game due to level disadvantage, and the winning team does the exact same thing as in all the previous teamfights, what makes you think things are going to change when the winners have 20 and the losers are still 16-17? Heroes with lategame power spikes can only do so much. At that point, soaking and wave clearing is really the only thing the losing team *can* do. **Why the XP changes were good...on paper** So that's why I was intrigued by the experience changes when they were announced: it made defending lanes and clearing waves more important (because of earlier catapults) while preventing the team who secures the early lead from getting an *insurmountable* lead. It also allowed the defending team to catch up more quickly just through soaking, shortening the time needed for them to have interesting tactical decisions again. Of course, as we have seen from many threads here over the past few days, that hasn't quite worked out as intended; the team who is losing early now has *too much* agency, able to now stay in the game by *just* sitting back and soaking, while it is now much riskier for the initially-winning team to soak. That has also brought to light another fundamental issue: the ability for a team that's been losing the whole game to take a late-game teamfight and win *only* off of that. Many discussions have leaned heavily on comparisons to traditional sports, where it is a) easier to tell which team is in the lead, b) never impossible for the losing team to make a comeback if they bust their asses to make up the point deficit, and c) also impossible for that losing team to win one play and win the game solely off of that, after spending the entire match up to that point getting their asses handed to them. These are fair comparisons to make, and after a lot of thought, I might have a solution to all of these problems: Towers of Doom. **Map Control = Capturing Territory** Towers of Doom is a rather unique map among MOBAs, isn't it? Out of all the maps in Heroes, it is notable for meeting all the same above requirements as traditional sports: a) you can always tell which team is closest to winning, b) a team with 1 HP left on their core can still make a comeback by denying any further altar or merc captures, and c) if the winning team still has over 30 HP left on their core, one lategame team wipe will not lose them the game, depending on timing. Know what else that map has which helps facilitate this? **Capturable buildings**. This gives the losing team the agency they need to get out of a losing situation: they can recapture forts they've lost to gain XP and regain map control, while also rewarding the winning team for taking them with more tangible map control and giving them a buffer to protect their own forts. Now, take the XP changes on the PTR (forts don't give experience, catapults added to minion waves, defenders can soak closer to home while attackers must put themselves at more risk to even keep up in soak) and add in: **""Destroyed Forts will now rebuild over time under the control of the team that destroyed it.""** as well as **""Captured forts now count as keeps when determining Core vulnerability""**. What does this accomplish? A lot, actually: \-Attackers who take an early fort are still able to soak that lane in relative safety, as they can now escape from gank attempts by running back to that captured fort, instead of having a lot of empty space between their forts and where the minions are now. This also means they can't just ""sneak"" forts and then just always have that advantage: if they want that map control, they'll need to show up to protect it if the defending team or the lane minions move to reclaim the fort. \-Defenders now have an incentive to push out and reclaim lost territory. Not only will it allow them to regain map control, but retaking their fort will stop catapult spawns (unless they've also lost the keep, in which case catapults will go back to the ""every third wave"" rule) and give them a better chance to contest objectives in that lane. \-A team that's losing can now work themselves back into the game not just by soaking or winning teamfights, but by reclaiming map control. \-By the same token, that losing team cannot also turn one good teamfight into a core rush; if the winning team has taken the time to capture multiple forts, the defenders will need to devote time to retaking those forts before they can think about going core. A relatively easy thing to do over 16, but it means the initially-winning team has time to respawn and regroup from a wipe; if the losing team took one teamfight, they'll need to show it wasn't a fluke and take at least one more before they can attempt to end. \-Also gives more strategic depth to a team that's winning: instead of pushing only one lane and largely ignoring the others, as is meta on some maps like Dragon Shire and Blackheart's Bay, there will now be incentive to at least take the forts on every lane and give themselves more of a buffer from a lategame teamwipe. \-Makes the game easier to follow for spectators, like in HGC! Which team is winning? The one that has more buildings. Levels might be even, objective might be obscure, but all you'd have to do is look at the map and see that one team has all the forts and you can tell that they're winning...for the moment. \-A simpler solution than some others might be since the technology for capturing buildings is *already in the game*. Towers of Doom already does this. Just extend it out to Forts on all the other maps. Some caveats: \-Keeps cannot be recaptured. Those are much harder to take down early and much easier to defend, so losing one should have some lasting consequences. \-Towers and Healing Wells do not also rebuild, only the Fort itself. Thus, recapturing it doesn't regain you everything you lost, so that early loss does still have some consequences, but the Fort itself does still provide some protection from pushes/ganks (the slowing attack, provides a physical body that blocks skillshots, detection, minions and most objectives will stop to destroy it before moving on, etc). Also does not further the attacker's advantage by giving them a well in ""enemy territory"". \-The fort capturing should be automatic. I debated between this and requiring an attacker to remain near it to capture, but decided that the latter left the opportunity for attackers to *not* capture the forts, thus either preventing defenders from ever retaking it (because it didn't rebuild) or making it too easy for defenders to retake it (since they could just back up, let it get destroyed, then move in and retake it as soon as the coast is clear). **TL;DR:** \-Snowballing is bad, m'kay? Defenders don't get any options to get back in the game but soaking until the attackers make some kind of mistake. \-Keep the XP changes from the PTR but also make it so Forts are captured by the team who destroys them. This gives attackers more incentive to push in and capture them, gives defenders more incentive to push out and retake them, and provides more tangible map control. \-??? \-Profit. Thoughts?"
12,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Several damage mitigation abilities &amp; healing abilities don't give credit where credit is due - what it takes for these issues to be fixed.,1,9s2jm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/9s2jm5/several_damage_mitigation_abilities_healing/,2018-10-28 22:37:46,"Some of you might have seen [this post from last month](URL where I went into detail about a whole bunch of Heals, shields, and a few other things that currently don't track any statistics, or track them improperly. One thing you'll note in that list is that for every thing that I talked about, I mentioned a 'data name', and the type of entry it was. I did this to simplify matters if Blizzard decided to have someone look through that list. Some people might be wondering just how difficult it is to actually fix the issues in that list, so I decided I'd do a brief follow-up that shows what is involved in fixing the issues showcased there. The most complicated thing to track is Blinds &amp; Defense Matrix. These two are technically applied &amp; handled in the same way, in that they are Attacker-based DamageResponse behaviors. As far as I am aware, those two are the only two that use this - I think Vulnerability used to, but it now uses the Armor system. Rather than explain it in some jargon, [I've made a short 1-minute video showing what is involved](URL ""Defense Matrix has that whole ExcludeEffectAlias, I wonder if that bugs out... it shouldn't. I know that the tracker would absolutely break, but it's already pretty broken, so not that big of a deal.""), Next up is Defender-based DamageResponse behaviors, like Zarya's Shield Ally or Kerrigan's Assimilation. Lots of things use this, like Evasion, Anti-Magic Shell, Shields, Counter-Strike, Parry, Ardent Defender and a whole bunch more. As before, [here is a video demonstrating what is needed, using Zarya's Shield Ally and Gain Train as examples, where the amount prevented is meant to increase Healing, and it does, but for Shield Ally twice the value that it actually prevents, and for Gain Train it increases both Healing and SelfHealing](URL ""I originally was only going to do one, but Gain Train was right there"") The next thing is effect-based healers, like Kharazim's Spirit Ally or Alexstrasza's Fire Within. Just as with Blinds, [here is a video demonstrating what is needed to be changed, using Whitemane's Self Righteous as an example, where the heal is meant to increase SelfHealing because it can only heal Whitemane, but it instead increases Healing](URL ""I wonder if it's worth bringing up the idea that all Healing and Shielding should add to Healing, even if you are the target... I think that makes stuff like the Blinds and Defense Matrix difficult though, because they'd need to be split up into even more behaviors..."") Next is behavior-based leeches, like Ana's Nano Infusion or Mal'Ganis' Vampiric Aura, [as shown here](URL with Nano Infusion. Then there are damage-based leeches, like Xul's Harvest Vitality or Kerrigan's damage effects, both of which either shouldn't add to SelfHealing or are adding more than they should, [which you can see here](URL The last one to talk about isn't something that can be demonstrated in the Starcraft 2 editor, as to fix it requires tech that doesn't actually exist in SC2, and didn't exist in Heroes until recently - the ability to ignore the ModifyLimit on a shield, and set the strength to a value based off of an accumulator, so instead, [here's simply the XML for it](URL the only thing that uses this is Kerrigan, and prior to her rework she used a completely different method to gain shields. And simply because this thread is as relevant as any, here [is a custom scoreboard observer interface](URL to install on Windows, press Windows Key + R, type in ""documents/Heroes of the Storm/"" without the quotation marks, and if there is an Interfaces folder, open it, if not, create one, and extract the contents of that into that folder, [it should look something like this](URL Assuming you read or just watched the videos above, do you think that fixing the issues listed in [this thread](URL would be worth Blizzard setting aside a developer a couple of days to fix? I will mention a one additional thing - D.Va's Defense Matrix damage prevented tracker would cease to function properly, as it would only be tracking the damage prevented by one of the two behaviors. As far as I can think, Blinds should function properly, because TargetFilters are used elsewhere in the game(Giant Killer, Diablo Soul Shield CDR, Deckard's Horadric Staff), but Attacker-based DamageResponse behaviors don't increase the score elsewhere in the game, but they do work in SC2 There are also a few bugs that are similarly rather straight forward to resolve that have been around for quite a while, [which you can see some here](URL"
13,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,The easy rework for BHB is to turn some or all of the Merc camps into item camps.,0,9842jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/9842jc/the_easy_rework_for_bhb_is_to_turn_some_or_all_of/,2018-08-18 03:10:43,"This is because the biggest problem with the map is that teams with a lead have the option of choosing when to engage, whereas the team that's behind is usually forced to split, increasing their vulnerability as well as their opponents' choices. Item camps would limit the ability of one team to simply wait for the other team to split-off and deal with merc pushes and then turn in with numbers advantage. Items also incentivize hero engagements because a hero must be present in order to use them, unlike autonomous mercs. Other possibilities for the items: I would put a 2-minute time limit on the activation of items so that teams cannot simply grab them all up and activate five items at the turn-in. Stealing an idea from Mario Kart: The team with fewer structures remaining could have an increased chance to roll better/stronger items. "
14,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Ana's Trait: Shrike Max Doses should slow enemy heroes,0,99yf7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/99yf7b/anas_trait_shrike_max_doses_should_slow_enemy/,2018-08-25 01:35:22,"I think that Ana's trait should be buffed by making max doses (5 stacks) cause affected enemy Heroes to have their movement speed slowed by at least 20%. My reasoning is that it would improve her ability to protect herself and self-peel from enemy aggro a little better than currently. **Theory Crafting** Ana's Achilles' Heel as a support is her own vulnerability to being blown up - even after the buffs to her self-healing from [[Shrike]] she is very fragile, with almost no mobility options or panic buttons other than Sleep Dart, a cooldown which if saved for purely panic self-defense can't then be used offensively. This is compounded by her Ults being purely offense, with no real way to use them to benefit Ana herself - a unique weakness for a support. I'm aware this is intentional - Ana is purposefully designed as a ""best defense is a good offense"" support; she is meant to keep herself as far away from opponents as possible to stay alive, with this positional passivity outweighed by high heal output and utility provided to teammates. I think that this one change would still remain in character for Ana, being a debuff to opponents rather than a buff to herslef, while still providing her a much-needed self-saving tool to help her disengage from an enemy trying to get up in her grill.

15,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Greymane's Cursed Bullet rework idea.,0,9ewp76,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/9ewp76/greymanes_cursed_bullet_rework_idea/,2018-09-11 21:30:00,"Today I was looking at greymane's talent tree and noticed that on top of the low pick rate, his second ultimate has an abismal win rate and even considering hotslog's data might be a bit off the mark there's no doubt the ability is very bad, sub par in its niche situation at best. As of now, Cursed Bullet more or less states: **Greymane shapeshifts into human form and fires a bullet, dealing 35% of their current health to the first enemy hero hit.** As most of you will remember, the ability used to give the hero hit vulnerability and allowed you to recast it to jump to the target in worgen form, which I think is much more fitting thematically and leaves a lot of room for crazy micro plays. My idea is to make the ability kind of a mix of the two versions, along the lines of (numbers are not arbitrary of course, it's more about the way it works): **Greymane shapeshifts into human form and fires a bullet, dealing damage equal to 10% of their current health to the first hero hit and decreasing their armour by 10 for 6 seconds. The ability can be recast within 6 seconds to shift into worgen form and jump at the enemy location, dealing 40 damage.** The idea here is to add some extra functionality to the old Cursed Bullet, which was underpowered, while not allowing you to 100-0 heroes. It could be somewhat neat to make the lv 20 talent increase the % damage and refresh the cooldown of W. I'd like to know what you think, also keep in mind that CD, debuff amount and status, damage etc. are just an example and obviously up for debate. "
16,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,50+ Game Analysis of Yrel,18,8ritsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8ritsd/50_game_analysis_of_yrel/,2018-06-16 21:38:45,"Salutations assorted community people! I purchased Yrel on release and to this point I've played 51 games with her and am sitting at a win rate of around 63&amp;#37;. So now that I've gotten that out of the way, I've seen a lot of threads purely decrying Yrel as completely underpowered and largely useless. A lot of Hyperbole to be sure. In playing her as much as I have, I've come to appreciate how useful Yrel can be, particularly when you build her in certain ways. For instance, the traits around her E, to make the cast 1 sec if you hit fully charged, and the added slow and duration can essentially make Yrel into a glowing goat-woman Mario, goomba stomping people to death while they helplessly try to run away. It can be pretty fun! But if you build her with Light of Karabor, Sacred Ground, and Aldor Peacekeeper, you can also essentially be an unmovable pillar on an objective, even if it's a bit limited by the space, the 40 sec cooldown means you can keep using it to more or less your heart's content. Yrel's survivability does feel like it's in a pretty good place, I just find her charging mechanic to be a little lackluster for the effort put in versus the results. However that's not to say she definitely isn't without her issues. I agree that her damage is pretty low, especially for the time and risk you have to dedicate to charging up her abilities. Of all the heroes out there, I don't think any are quite so susceptible to being shut down with little effort like Yrel is. One stun, displacement, root, silence, or sleep, and Yrel is totally off balance, and can't do the things she is supposed to anymore. Which does lead into the situation where the enemy team can largely just ignore you while they murder your team, while you try helplessly to get into a better position to stop it. To that end there are a couple of changes I feel would benefit Yrel. First, give her fully charged leap unstoppable. So that you have to actually put effort and forethought into using it. It makes little sense anyway that a root on the ground will be able to stop Yrel mid-flight. Second, speaking of Avenging Wrath, make it so that her trait can be used mid-flight, so you can better queue up abilities for when you land. I'd also like to see her ultimates be useable mid-flight. It's frustrating to try to furiously pop Ardent Defender when you're using your E to escape, but you can't and just end up dying. There are already enough traps and ways to screw yourself over in Yrel's kit, I feel like this would be a good way to alleviate a few issues without going too crazy. Additionally, I think for how painfully susceptible Yrel is to CC of pretty much all forms, her Ardent Defender should be able to be popped while stunned or otherwise during a loss of control. It is, after all, so dependent on you getting hit by the enemy team. If they decide to just stop and switch to your teammates so you don't regain any health, then you might as well have not used it at all. Maybe some additional function could be added to AD where it explodes after it expires? Something to give Yrel a bit more use if the enemy completely ignores her. Whatever they do, I think there has to be at least SOMETHING a Yrel player can do to negate the massive amount of CC vulnerability outside of waiting to get her unstoppable trait at 20. Moving onto traits, there's a few things that I think ought to be looked at. Obviously her level 4 traits need to be reworked, since pretty much every time, Gift of the Naaru is the vastly superior talent. It's pretty satisfying to get into a game with no healer, hit level 4, then go around topping people off. Makes me think of that meme: ""Look at me, I am the captain now."", except it's me as the healer. They may as well just bake Gift of the Naaru into her passive, even if at a reduced heal. Maybe make a trait in that tier a more selfish kind of trait? Every one of those traits works on her allies, not her. I'd like for Dauntless to actually show the armour indicator over her model instead of just in the bar below her health/mana. My only other complaint in regard to her traits is Bubble Hearth. It's cool, don't get me wrong. But... it's kind of a joke as a 20 talent. Chromie gets her super-hearth at like... 4? 7? I don't know, I don't play Chromie. Point is, BH is very out of place. I haven't even taken it in all the games I've played. Though I do wonder if it might be able to be used in combat to just make yourself invulnerable while the enemy tries to beat you up on a point, if you can get the shield to trigger. Maybe someone who's tried it out can tell me. All in all, I think Yrel is in a... decent place. She certainly has some fun aspects to her and I believe with a little tweaking, she could be even better, but still not completely breaking everyone's fun and enjoyment. I really wanted to put this thread out so I could put together my thoughts. No idea if the HotS team will see this but I figure what the hell, it's worth seeing what the community thinks as well. So go ahead and rip me a new one if you feel like it!"
17,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Yrel Thoughts and Proposed Patch Notes,22,8s4mi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8s4mi4/yrel_thoughts_and_proposed_patch_notes/,2018-06-19 10:40:58,"I am the solo laner and captain for the division A NGS team Heroic Difficulty and a mid diamond HL player. I'll start with my thoughts on where she belongs in a team comp and then how blizzard can make some changes to better enable that place. When I first saw the release video for yrel there was some discussion amongst my team as to whether or not we would run yrel in the solo lane or as a main tank due to her distinct lack of reliable and/or consistent hard crowd control (only form being a fully charged or trait enabled W) but also her similar lack of threatening team fight damage that you would expect from a Sonya or thrall. After some thought, I believe she will thrive in a tyrael like position as either an off tank or main tank depending on what your team needs where she can enable dive heroes on your team. **Solo Laner** If you take 3132212 you can double soak lanes with divine steed and out trade any solo laner that doesn't have percentage damage including Sonya. This build enables your dive hero to engage, follow up with yrel armor then trait into an aoe stun that provides vulnerability and if that hero is say, greymane, then he would be getting executioner worgen form procs (from the slow and stun) on vulnerable targets while maintaining 35 armor(+10 from worgen form). I know most people see Yrel as a main tank but the raw healing from maraads insight let her win most 1v1s and she can match dehaka in waveclear if she Es the wave then D+Q the wave its about 5-600 aoe damage and some auto attack last hits. Ive been able to effectively keep up with a blaze double soaking until 7 when i can start winning the matchup from faster rotations. In teamfights Yrel is very similar to tyrael in playstyle shes going to often look to jump in along side the main tank/dive character to give them armor then either instant heal if you took aldor peacekeeper or instant stun to try to isolate for kills **Main tank** For more of a main tank dive enabler you could go 1131121. I would recommend the later build if your dive is potentially an offlaner like Sonya or blaze or in general some secondary front liner that can help peel and also set up kills. Yrel, like Tyrael, isn't going to be able blessed shield or moshpit to setup great team fights. Instead she has to rely on excellent positioning to be able to isolate the right targets with hammer and deny kills, on the fly decision making about whether its better to avenging wrath for ally armor or to slow enemies and in general properly force the enemy team to deal with and focus her, because if there is one thing Yrel is good at its surviving situations no one else could. The level 16 is important on Yrel if youre main tanking even if you don't go with the light of the naaru simply because all of your abilities can be powerful defensive tools and having them up more frequently through your trait is an invaluable tanking aid. **Potential Patch Notes:** Here are the things that as a Yrel player i would like to see Blizzard change about Yrel to bring her win rate from the abysmal 40.9&amp;#37; on hoslogs at the time of this post to hopefully closer to the 50&amp;#37; range **Abilities** Decrease the channel time for basic abilities from 1.5 seconds to 1.25 seconds \-this is a small number change that for an individual ability has a low impact but as a whole makes her entire kit flow together much more smoothly and allows less risky channeling of her high impact skills like hammer. When Vindication is interrupted it heals for the amount channeled up until that point. \-its channeled damage too would be nice but I'm trying be as realistic as possible to what blizzard would actually change. I understand that her deliberate, paced out play style is something central to her character and interrupting her channels is meant to be both punishing and rewarding but assuming you don't take Maraads insight at level 1, she has no sustain outside of her Q and her Heroics Decrease the channel slow on her abilities from 25&amp;#37; to 20&amp;#37; \-this makes not using Yrels trait much punishing and allows for greater capitalization of great positioning on her. Weve seen that movement speed on tank characters can be vitally important to how well that tank can perform in team-fights that why talents like Johannas Fanaticism, Deaths Advance on Arthas, Speed Metal, Hungry for More, Swift Retribution, etc. **Talents** Upon taking light of the naaru at level 4 provide an indicator as to whom the heal will target like LiLis targeting indicator Righteous Momentum movement speed while channeling decreased to 40&amp;#37; Samaaras Light movement speed decreased to 10&amp;#37; \-these changes are to compensate for the decreased slow from channeling abilities but i think there is room to leave these talents untouched and not break the character Holy Wrath now deals spell damage instead of physical \-this is a small and potentially unnecessary change that allows Yrel to bypass tank block charges and also allows scaling from the level 13 Velens Chosen Seraphim at level 20 cooldown increased to 20 seconds \-this puts Yrels self cleanse in line with johanna trait and has room to be increased further and still be a pickable talent Collectively Im not sure all of these changes are necessary but i know that all of them are relatively small things that would greatly increase the quality of life for Yrel players and make her much better at doing what she already does"
18,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Vulnerability/Healing reduced vs. Percentage DMG ???,0,8ujprr,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8ujprr/vulnerabilityhealing_reduced_vs_percentage_dmg/,2018-06-29 00:05:07,"Hey there! I have some questions I'm not sure about... 1. Does ""Healing reduced"" also influence the percentage based heal of alextrasza (W abilities) like Deckards \[\[Smaragd\]\] or Malthaels \[\[Touch of Death\]\]? I know that Anas Grenade reduces the healing but I'm not sure if the mentioned talents do the same. 2. Does vulnerability increase the percentage based damage? E.g. Tyrande puts her Mark on an enemy and Malthael attacks the target. If the percentage based damage is 80 will it deal 100 in the end? Thanks for the answers!"

This is going to assume that the Malthael player: 1) is looking at the map to prevent ganks 2) took Fear the Reaper at lvl 1 if there is a high potential for dying to ganks (such as if against a CC solo laner with a high mobility ganker) 3) Q talent for lvl 4 Before reading this, check out ""Freezing the Wave"" mechanic by MichaelUdall, vs another solo laner - URL by Glaurung, Minion Mechanics - URL At the very start of the game, you will have an idea of what you will need to do if you are up against Malthael in the solo lane, and what you will need to do exactly from the moment you meet Malthael in Lane. It is also important to note, that you can win the solo lane, but if your solo laner sucks in teamfight, it can be a disaster lategame. Malthael performs the worst vs triple backline comps. WARRIORS ----------------- vs Arthas - slightly disadvantaged - In Lane: Arthas will lose the lane, but can freeze the lane near the fort and zone out Malthael starting at lvl 4. Malthael cannot do the same to Arthas. - Control Pt: Malthael will lose the point. Starting at lvl 4, Malthael will be in danger of being killed if he steps on the control point. - In Teamfight: depends on the ranged dps of each team. vs Rexxar - slightly disadvangaged - In Lane: Malthael will Win the lane while taking HP damage each wave. How much damage Malthael takes will depend on the zoning between the bear, Malthael, and Rexxar. - Control Pt: Malthael will win some control percentage with his lvl 4 talent Die Alone, but Bear will ressurect and Malthael will have run out of mana. He will also be losing soak while he is fighting the bear because Rexxar is in lane. Lose/lose situation. - In Teamfight: Malthael's team will have the advantage since the bear will be dead of the time. vs Leoric - favored - In Lane: Leoric will flat out lose the lane until lvl 4, at which point he will lose the lane less - but lose it nonetheless. Malthael can freeze the lane infront of his fort and prevent soak experience. - Control Pt: Leoric will lose the control point, how much HP malthael loses depends on whether he dodged Leoric's W with his own W. - In Teamfight: equal starting at lvl 13. vs Chen - disadvantaged - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane but cannot opt to freeze it. - Control Pt: This is a skill match up at lvl 4 slightly favoring Chen, but Chen will easily win at lvl 7 ""Bolden Flavor"" and Malthael will run out of mana. - In Teamfight: Chen's team will have the initiative in teamfight due to barrel isolating either Malthael or other non-tank characters. vs Varian - highly disadvantaged - In Lane: Varian will lose hard until lvl 4, at which point Varian can freeze the lane infront of his fort and zone out Malthael. Hard to do but possible. At lvl 7, Malthael will get destroyed in the lane. - Control Pt: Skill matchup on the control pt at lvl 4 vs smash varian, but Varian will absolutely destroy Malthael at lvl 7. In Teamfight: Varian's team will have a massive advantage provided the talent selection is good from Varian. vs Sonya - equal - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane. Can freeze the lane infront of fort but harder to out-trade to zone out Sonya. - Control Pt: Skill matchup starting at lvl 4 and highly dependent on how good the kiting was by Malthael and dodging of the spear. Before lvl 4, he can opt to annihilate the lane asap to force sonya back. In Teamfight: Sonya's team will have the initiative and the offense. But as soon as the skills go on cooldown for both teams, should Sonya overstay the welcome its instant death. vs Dehaka - slightly favored - In Lane: Dehaka will lose the lane but will not lose gate/tower health due to the threat of tongue drag. Malthael can freeze the lane infront of his fort and prevent soak experience. - Control Pt: Malthael will win at lvl 4. Skill matchup at lvl 7 at which point Dehaka might win with tongue drag CD reduction and maximum essence. Still slightly favors Malthael if he is defending the control point and landed his E onto the incoming Dehaka. - In Teamfight: highly dependent on whether or not Dehaka can land the isolation and drag on Malthael. He can dodge the Last Rites with burrow, but overstaying the welcome will still means death. vs Artanis - slightly favored - In Lane: Malthael will destroy the lane. Malthael can freeze the lane infront of his fort and prevent soak experience. - Control Pt: Artanis will win the control point. Even worse should Artanis land the prism at lvl 7 ""Chrono Surge"" talent. - In Teamfight: Malthael's team will have a big advantage unless Artanis can get the magical swaps. vs Blaze - favored - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane but harder to freeze it. - Control Pt: Malthael will win the control pt most of the time. In Teamfight: Blaze can dodge the Last Rites with Bunker, but as is with Dehaka and Sonya, overstaying welcome is death. Will need a good CC combo as Malthael will most likely out trade both Blaze and his team's main tank. vs Yrel - highly favored - In Lane: Malthael will destroy the lane. Malthael can freeze the lane infront of his fort and prevent soak experience. - Control Pt: Malthael will win the control point. His W's make it very difficult for Yrel. - In Teamfight: Malthael's team has the advantage, holding Last Rites until Ardent Defender is used. ASSASSINS ---------------------- vs Thrall - favored - In Lane: Malthael will destroy the lane, and can opt to Freeze it. Thrall might be able to freeze it starting at lvl 7 with a stack of Ancestral Wrath. - Control Pt: Malthael will win until lvl 7 at which point it becomes difficult, especially when Malthael misses the E. - In Teamfight: Malthael's team will have the advantage, esp at lvl 13 with Ethereal Existence. vs Greymane - equal in early game but in early-mid game highly favored. - In Lane: Malthael can opt to go for ""Massacre"" at lvl 7 and destroy the lane. Even if not chosen, Greymane can attempt to fight Malthael in lane which often results in Malthael coming out on top after the (kiting by Grey and diving by Grey and kiting by Malthael) and Malthael can just heal off the minions while Grey cannot. - Control Pt: Malthael will destroy Greymane on the Control Pt with the Q talent at lvl 7 making it infinitely easier to kite Greymane. - In Teamfight: Malthael's team will have the advantage, esp at lvl 13 with Ethereal Existence. vs Ragnaros/Alarak - advantaged mostly, but highly depends on how much combos are landed by the Rag/Ala - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane. Might take some HP damage, but Malthael's heal will triumph in the end. - Control Pt: This is a skill-based matchup that favors Malthael having control point most of the time. Alarak will need to land 2+ combos to force Malthael off the point, which can sometimes be difficult due to Malthael's W. Ragnaros has a good chance of beating Malthael at lvl 7, with the Meteor build synergizing with Blistering Attacks lvl 7. - In Teamfight: depends on comps. vs Illidan/Samuro - highly advantaged - In Lane: Malthael will destroy the lane - Control Pt: Requires kiting by Malthael, but Samuro will lose hard and Illidan will do a bit better but still lose in the end, as long as Malthael player knows how Illidan's skills work. - In Teamfight: Malthael's team has a great advangage. vs Zuljin - disadvantaged - In Lane: Malthael will kill the minions faster but take HP damage each wave. This is due to Voodoo Shuffle at lvl 4 from ZJ which gives ridiculous sustain. Malthael will eventually lose the lane. - Control Pt: Q build Zuljin with Armani Rage destroys many solo laners on the control point. Malthael Thrall Fenix are such. - In Teamfight: Zuljin's team will have a massive advantage. vs Tychus - disadvantaged - In Lane: Malthael might be killing minions faster but will get chunked by Tychus each minion wave. - Control Pt: Malthael will lose at lvl 4. Combat Tactician lvl 1 and Concussion Grenade lvl 7 make it hard. - In Teamfight: Tychus' team will have the advantage. vs Fenix - slightly disadvantaged - In Lane: Same case as vs Zuljin. - Control Pt: Fenix can E out whenever he wishes but Malthael cannot, giving Fenix a massive advantage in kill potential. However, Fenix can flat out lose if he misplaces the Q and Malthael sticks to Fenix like a glue. In Teamfight: Fenix's team will have the advantage. vs Falstad - disadvantaged - In Lane: Falstad can be a nightmare to deal with as Malthael esp if he took the Lightning build. You could be in real trouble if he obtains enough stacks for mercenaries and pushes your lane. Misjudging the damage trade when diving Falstad can result in death. Will need the lvl 7 Massacre to land hits on Falstad. - Control Pt: Same case. If the Falstad kites properly, no way to win. However, if Falstad gets jumped by Malthael from a bush or on the Pale Horse mount, then he risks death if he tries to fight. - In Teamfight - depends on comps, but mostly favors Falstad. SPECIALISTS ------------------------ vs Zagara - slightly disadvantaged - In Lane: Early game will mean that Malthael will take HP damage each wave. lvl 7 Massacre will make sure that the HP damage is both ways. - Control Pt: This is going to be alot of kiting by Zagara, but unlike against Falstad/Valla/Lunara you have minions to heal off of. Also if you manage to get close with either Fear the Reaper or Pale Horse mount, you can dodge most of the baneling damage with your W. There will be times where Malthael will lose the point, but if Zagara does not play it right she can be killed, even by heroes like Leoric. - In Teamfight: depends on comps and the game strategy by the enemy team. vs Sgt Hammer - highly disadvantaged - In Lane: This guy is so oppressive against melee solo laners that even heroes like Yrel can do nothing but sit in her base while Hammer is going ham on the towers. Malthael unfortunately has less healthpool than Yrel or Sonya, and will lose the lane hard. - Control Pt: any smart hammer will start either with vision around the control pt and stay sieged, or start unsieged and dodge your E. Both of which will mean you will lose the fight. You will have almost no chance of taking the control point against the mine talent at lvl 7. - In Teamfight: highly favors the Hammer's team. vs Gazlowe - disadvantaged - In lane: Gazlowe can go toe to toe with your rate of clearing minions even without auto attacks. He will start to stack turrets near the control point in a row of turrets one leading some distance back-to-back during the laning phase. Really try to prevent Gazlowe from autoattacking minions starting at lvl 4, due to a talent of his called ""Clockwerk Steam Fists."" - Control Pt: You will get some control percentage for sure since you can heal off the turrets. But eventually your health and mana will run out. Its a losing fight on the control point. - In Teamfight: depends on the comps and the plays vs Probius - advantaged - In Lane: Probius will outclear you in terms of minions, and his cannon will make it real annoying to approach the little bugger. But you will not take any gate/tower damage. - Control Pt: Against probius, you MUST take lvl 1 talent called Death's Reach, which extends the range of your W by alot. It will be a game of you stepping on the control point, Probius moving forward to set Rifts and send pulses, and you throwing out your E. Clear the Photon cannon asap, Q heals you off of it. Dont run around trying to kill the Pilons, as these are often in bushes and bushes often contain 3 Rifts which can kill you instantly. As soon as you land your E, W in and get that kill. Lvl 7 should be the Q talent, not massacre. - In Teamfight: depends on the comp and the plays OTHER UNUSUAL SOLO LANE HEROES ------------------------- vs Guldan Drain Life Build - This build utterly annihilates some solo lane heroes, especially Zagara and Gazlowe. - In Lane: Malthael will lose the lane at lvl 4 but will not take gate/tower damage. - Control Pt: Malthael will be able to easily zone out Guldan by dodging his skills, but at lvl 7 the Guldan can easily win by landing a good combo which does massive damage due to ""Curse of Exhaustion"" and the big range from lvl 1 talent. - In Teamfight: depends on comps vs Xul - some choose Xul as their solo laner and he can be highly effective against certain physical heroes. His W talents lvl 4 and 7 can make it a nightmare for certain heroes, and against certain solo laner heroes that focus on the 1v1 and not much the wave clear, his trait can be of high value. - In lane: Malthael can actually die if not careful here 1v1. The only times malthael can be extremely aggressive (like in the other side of the lane) is when Xul's armor is on cooldown. Otherwise Xul will deal severe damage to Malthael. But other than that, Malthael can easily match Xul's double soak ability. Starting at lvl 4, Malthael can be more aggressive. - Control Pt: Malthael can fake an engage, run back as soon as the root and armor come down. Then reengage and Die Alone will do all the work. - In Teamfight: favors Malthael's, unless your 4 members of your team are melee heroes. vs Kharazim/LiLi/Tyrande - Believe it or not, some people choose these solo laners against certain heroes. It works against certain heroes. - In Lane: Malthael destroys - Control Pt: Malthael destroys - In Teamfight: this can go sideways if Malthael is not careful. Malthael requires the healthpool of a certain hero to fall to a certain level for that Last Rites, but double healer can make that difficult. Kharazim can also land the 7-sided which can be dangerous to an isolated Malthael. LiLi's blind prevents Malthael's sustain in teamfights, and Tyrande's vulnerability combined with a burst of damage from her team can kill Malthael quickly. vs Genji/Tracer - niche solo lane counters to Malthael and Zagara. Although Genji and Tracer at lvl 4 can 100-0 Zagara in one combo, questionable effectiveness vs Malthael. - In Lane: Genji can opt for dodge at lvl 7 and Tracer's mobility talents at lvl 4 make it difficult for Malthael to land hits on them. But at lvl 7, massacre by Malthael can put Genji and Tracer out of commission in lane. - Control Pt: Play the cat and mouse game of annihilating the minions and then going back to the control pt. Dont play the other game of getting kited eternally. Eventually you'll be able to land that E on the Genji/Tracer, at which point u can out trade damage. These are also skillshot heroes so dodging the pulse bomb or shrikens will help alot. Save that Fear the Reaper skill for the finisher. - In Teamfight: depends on comps. Of note, against Abathur comps containing Genji/Tracer, it is wise to go with Torrent of Souls, not the standard Last Rites. vs Valla/Lunara - niche solo lane counters to Malthael. Works most of the time. - In Lane: Malthael is disadvantaged and will need the lvl 7 Massacre. Valla's Hot Pursuit lvl 1 and Lunara's mobility mean that Malthael will lose much HP contesting each wave. - Control pt: Same case. Kiting Malthael will result in the ranged dps win, but can be a disaster if the squishy hero gets jumped from a bush by Malthael or gets too close to Malthael (sometimes Malthael can surprise these heroes with either Fear the Reaper or the mount talent at lvl 1). - In Teamfight: depends on comps. Valla/Lunara can be real squishy. vs D.va - not usually a solo laner but some pick this to try to counter Malthael. - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane but cannot freeze it. - Control Pt: Dva will win the control point for a brief period when she has the trait explosion, but when Malthael comes back with a fountain tap and commits 100% to near death, Dva will be dead in the end (bunny pistol hurts, but Die Alone hurts more) - In Teamfight: Malthael's team has the advantage, and a massive one should there be chain CC combos on Dva's mech to prevent explosion. vs Chromie - Requires excellent aim but can win the solo lane vs surprisingly many heroes. Highly dangerous to Probius but does not win vs Sgt Hammer. - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane but cannot opt to freeze the lane. - Control Pt: Skill matchup, but Chromie can easily kill Malthael at lvl 8 on the control point. - In Teamfight: You all know how this goes down vs Valeera - she actually counters some solo laners hard such as illidan. - In Lane: Malthael will win easily - Control Pt: Valeera can actually kill Malthael easily if not careful. If Malthael gets the E off on a shadow of Valeera, then Valeera might actually die here. - In Teamfight: depends on the plays. Games with Valeera can either be a slaughter or a disaster."

You will have almost no chance of taking the control point against the mine talent at lvl 7. - In Teamfight: highly favors the Hammer's team. vs Gazlowe - disadvantaged - In lane: Gazlowe can go toe to toe with your rate of clearing minions even without auto attacks. He will start to stack turrets near the control point in a row of turrets one leading some distance back-to-back during the laning phase. Really try to prevent Gazlowe from autoattacking minions starting at lvl 4, due to a talent of his called ""Clockwerk Steam Fists."" - Control Pt: You will get some control percentage for sure since you can heal off the turrets. But eventually your health and mana will run out. Its a losing fight on the control point. - In Teamfight: depends on the comps and the plays vs Probius - advantaged - In Lane: Probius will outclear you in terms of minions, and his cannon will make it real annoying to approach the little bugger. But you will not take any gate/tower damage. - Control Pt: Against probius, you MUST take lvl 1 talent called Death's Reach, which extends the range of your W by alot. It will be a game of you stepping on the control point, Probius moving forward to set Rifts and send pulses, and you throwing out your E. Clear the Photon cannon asap, Q heals you off of it. Dont run around trying to kill the Pilons, as these are often in bushes and bushes often contain 3 Rifts which can kill you instantly. As soon as you land your E, W in and get that kill. Lvl 7 should be the Q talent, not massacre. - In Teamfight: depends on the comp and the plays OTHER UNUSUAL SOLO LANE HEROES ------------------------- vs Guldan Drain Life Build - This build utterly annihilates some solo lane heroes, especially Zagara and Gazlowe. - In Lane: Malthael will lose the lane at lvl 4 but will not take gate/tower damage. - Control Pt: Malthael will be able to easily zone out Guldan by dodging his skills, but at lvl 7 the Guldan can easily win by landing a good combo which does massive damage due to ""Curse of Exhaustion"" and the big range from lvl 1 talent. - In Teamfight: depends on comps vs Xul - some choose Xul as their solo laner and he can be highly effective against certain physical heroes. His W talents lvl 4 and 7 can make it a nightmare for certain heroes, and against certain solo laner heroes that focus on the 1v1 and not much the wave clear, his trait can be of high value. - In lane: Malthael can actually die if not careful here 1v1. The only times malthael can be extremely aggressive (like in the other side of the lane) is when Xul's armor is on cooldown. Otherwise Xul will deal severe damage to Malthael. But other than that, Malthael can easily match Xul's double soak ability. Starting at lvl 4, Malthael can be more aggressive. - Control Pt: Malthael can fake an engage, run back as soon as the root and armor come down. Then reengage and Die Alone will do all the work. - In Teamfight: favors Malthael's, unless your 4 members of your team are melee heroes. vs Kharazim/LiLi/Tyrande - Believe it or not, some people choose these solo laners against certain heroes. It works against certain heroes. - In Lane: Malthael destroys - Control Pt: Malthael destroys - In Teamfight: this can go sideways if Malthael is not careful. Malthael requires the healthpool of a certain hero to fall to a certain level for that Last Rites, but double healer can make that difficult. Kharazim can also land the 7-sided which can be dangerous to an isolated Malthael. LiLi's blind prevents Malthael's sustain in teamfights, and Tyrande's vulnerability combined with a burst of damage from her team can kill Malthael quickly. vs Genji/Tracer - niche solo lane counters to Malthael and Zagara. Although Genji and Tracer at lvl 4 can 100-0 Zagara in one combo, questionable effectiveness vs Malthael. - In Lane: Genji can opt for dodge at lvl 7 and Tracer's mobility talents at lvl 4 make it difficult for Malthael to land hits on them. But at lvl 7, massacre by Malthael can put Genji and Tracer out of commission in lane. - Control Pt: Play the cat and mouse game of annihilating the minions and then going back to the control pt. Dont play the other game of getting kited eternally. Eventually you'll be able to land that E on the Genji/Tracer, at which point u can out trade damage. These are also skillshot heroes so dodging the pulse bomb or shrikens will help alot. Save that Fear the Reaper skill for the finisher. - In Teamfight: depends on comps. Of note, against Abathur comps containing Genji/Tracer, it is wise to go with Torrent of Souls, not the standard Last Rites. vs Valla/Lunara - niche solo lane counters to Malthael. Works most of the time. - In Lane: Malthael is disadvantaged and will need the lvl 7 Massacre. Valla's Hot Pursuit lvl 1 and Lunara's mobility mean that Malthael will lose much HP contesting each wave. - Control pt: Same case. Kiting Malthael will result in the ranged dps win, but can be a disaster if the squishy hero gets jumped from a bush by Malthael or gets too close to Malthael (sometimes Malthael can surprise these heroes with either Fear the Reaper or the mount talent at lvl 1). - In Teamfight: depends on comps. Valla/Lunara can be real squishy. vs D.va - not usually a solo laner but some pick this to try to counter Malthael. - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane but cannot freeze it. - Control Pt: Dva will win the control point for a brief period when she has the trait explosion, but when Malthael comes back with a fountain tap and commits 100% to near death, Dva will be dead in the end (bunny pistol hurts, but Die Alone hurts more) - In Teamfight: Malthael's team has the advantage, and a massive one should there be chain CC combos on Dva's mech to prevent explosion. vs Chromie - Requires excellent aim but can win the solo lane vs surprisingly many heroes. Highly dangerous to Probius but does not win vs Sgt Hammer. - In Lane: Malthael will win the lane but cannot opt to freeze the lane. - Control Pt: Skill matchup, but Chromie can easily kill Malthael at lvl 8 on the control point. - In Teamfight: You all know how this goes down vs Valeera - she actually counters some solo laners hard such as illidan. - In Lane: Malthael will win easily - Control Pt: Valeera can actually kill Malthael easily if not careful. If Malthael gets the E off on a shadow of Valeera, then Valeera might actually die here. - In Teamfight: depends on the plays. Games with Valeera can either be a slaughter or a disaster."
21,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,In the light of the recent AMA: save Tyrande as double support! Some analysis and suggestions inside.,0,8k7atq,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8k7atq/in_the_light_of_the_recent_ama_save_tyrande_as/,2018-05-18 06:06:37,"Hi guys! I am writing this post after reading the recent Dev AMA, where they our beloved devs have stated that they are experimenting with reworking Tyrande as a solo support. While some might not agree with this, I personally feel that remaking Tyrande into a full healer will remove part of her essence and gameplay, enforcing the 1 healer meta even more and killing the interest to have dual supp comps. I'd like to give some feedback on Tyrande and also my vision on why she isn't working now, when in certain point in the past she was considered a pick sometimes, and even a viable but very greedy solo support in the stunlock meta (with Diablo and so) which is a role where she should perform well, but hasn't been able to fill for a while, meta changes considered. I'd like to say that current Tyrande is quite fun and her double nature has always given a ton of flexibility; making her a full support will water down her kill potential and the essence of some of their builds, which bring a lot of fun in, and that's a pity. I'd advocate to keep Tyrande where she is, but obviously with readjustments. That leads to the following question: **What made Tyrande viable in the past, and why isn't she working now?** Despite all the limitations of the old talent tree, Tyrande got to shine as a pick, even as solo greedy heal, in snobally, insta-kill based compositions. The kit of the hero is basically designed for this: vulnerability, stun and a minor nuke. Her old talent tree granted her of some decent momentum if you snowballed too. However, 2 years have passed since that, the game has changed, she got a rework, and while the game has powercreeped up, and Tyrande got some nerfs from the support nerf despite not being a main support and being already unpopular. The baseline owl build, mana curve (related to base quest), level 1 quests (and inherent damage) and level 16 healing talents (very important too) make Tyrande a very lategame oriented hero, which is anticlimatic with her potential (and older) role and niche, which fitted quite well her nature of a gank-hybrid support.**Tyrandes rework and generalist support nerfs have basically killed Tyrande's old niche, as specially her rework completely killed the tempo potential of Tyrande, favoring lategame significantly in a meta where earlygame and snowball got more relevant since the minion changes. In short, Tyrande is now a weak assassin with support mechanics and almost no waveclarea with a weak heal with a typical assassin powercurve; in practice, picking another range assassin or a second warrior is just safer. *The Owl Quest Dilemma* Tyrandes baseline quest is something often discussed by the community. We can asume that the baseline quest is a mechanic introduced to limit the potential of the owl build and its talents; in practice, it only really conditions 2 talents: the damage quest and the owl cdr one, which are both interdependent. Specially the level 13 one is a completely useless talent without the previous one, something that should be looked at and we will consider later. Another implication of that quest is that Tyrande has a clear late-game favored mana curve due to the mana cost reduction, something that makes owl spam very strong lategame while hampering to her earlygame, where mana usage is harder. Finally, the lack of earlygame pierce can be seen as something that limits her potential scouting and the ability to finish 1 HP enemies in the backline earlygame.**In order to boost Tyrandes supportive strength without moving her to the healer role**, all the things above should be considered, so: - Sentinel has a fixed mana cost (65-&gt;35/40 f.e.) which helps her mana usage early, while balances out her infinite mana lategame. - The damage talent and the cdr talent of sentinel and their interdependence should be reviewed, especially the later one. Personally, Id suggest Empower (13) to give a second charge of sentinel and general/ultimate cdr on hit. This change boosts both support strength and scouting potential, and basically reintroduces her old Ranger-Empower-Rewind combo, at the cost of nerfing her damage potential lategame (something that is nice since offers room for other buffs) * Piercing sentinel should be considered as a baseline functionality, as it boosts scouting and teamfight contribution earlygame without adding anything late. In consequence of this change, Ranger should be evaluated too; something that already needs to happen. In my opinion, adding bonus vision and reveal duration while nerfing the impact of stacks (that should be capped too) is a good way to add utility to that build while keeping control on her damage output. **The owl build would not change much in essence and it will be closer to her pre-rework state, but both talents will have some inherent utility over farming damage**. *Tyrandes heal-talent tempo and other suggestions* Now again on the topic of her tempo and scaling, Id like to remark again that that Tyrandes overall tempo and quest scaling should be reviewed in order to give her a better progression. One of the most needed changes is, in my opinion, giving Tyrande access to her heal boost talents sooner (16 to 13 would be a good start). Level 16 is a big inflexion point in terms of supportive strength, so moving it to an earlier tier is a good way to buff Tyrande without really buffing her lategame again; moving those 1 or 2 tiers down, even with some rebalance, would be pretty significant. Adding an AoE active heal skill (with long cd) over one of the already existing talents (looking at elunes chosen) in that tier could be something interesting too. Finally, Id like to suggest that some of her talents should be reviewed and specially her level 1 quests should be capped and adjusted if we want to add some power into her base kit, like slightly higher attack range (which would be quite impactful, since it would allow trading hits against most ranged AA heroes) or slightly higher mark cast range or lunar flare damage, both things quite helpful to her ganker role. Id like to even add some personal suggestion for new talents, but that might come later. Thank you for reading this!"

23,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Small rant - Yrel in terms of tanks feels like Tyrande in terms of supports,855,8qtrtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8qtrtb/small_rant_yrel_in_terms_of_tanks_feels_like/,2018-06-14 02:25:45,"Just... no She cannot peel, isn't any danger to backliners, no playmaking ability, sure is tanky, sure have some cc, but she feels like a nice lady to watch at, not tank like Diablo who can fucking rekt , do 70-80% of assassins' damage, almost stunlock, slow with lightning breath her ults don't help her team like Blaze's bunker I don't understand her limitations - her slow when channeling, her vulnerability to disrupts - why does she have that? What does she have to compensate for that? It's like poor man's shaved and physically fit Muradin "
24,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,A way to give Tyrande a place in the game,12,8h7tzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8h7tzr/a_way_to_give_tyrande_a_place_in_the_game/,2018-05-06 00:25:52,"Right now Tyrande has some interesting things for utility she can: - clear stuns/silences/fear/taunt on a short cd or give 15sp armor to allies - grant vision with her W from a very safe distance - help focus down a target with her stun and hunters mark. - decrease the damage of her enemies by quite a lot (one talent with W and one at lvl 20) - increase allies damage with mark and lvl 7 trueshot aura She also has pretty good dueling capabilities, maybe even one of top 5 at lvl 20 (But dont know if that really matters at that point?). You would think this would be enough to make her a good pick but what she lacks is numbers really. Her damage and mobility is quite bad (it becomes ok with Shadowstalk but its not really a powerspike you would want from an heroic), her wave clear is *abysmal* and you cant pick her as an healer for the team, so in the end there is really no open spot in the team for picking her as she doesnt really fill any roles. What I would like to see in her kit is something she had before Armor was a thing in the game. So her Hunters Mark decreases the armor of a target by 25, causing them to take 25% more damage. Before this was quite a big thing to consider and it was quite dangerous too. But with Armor being added in the game (changed from vulnerability), most tanks have armor in their kit causing this effect to be quite lackluster. It does the same thing as always but reducing 75 armor to 50 or 50 armor to 25 doesnt really feel as powerful. Dont you think it would be pretty sweet if her Mark *set* targets armor to -25? Removing all armor and making them vulnerable for a duration. Even increasing the armor reduction to 50 would be a good start (remember that armor cant go under -25) to give her a place against heavy armor tanks and allow her team to take them down."
25,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Here we go again! Level 100 Chromie! (talent breakdown inside),34,8b6hoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8b6hoc/here_we_go_again_level_100_chromie_talent/,2018-04-10 20:06:08,"URL URL So first hero I've gotten to level 100, so I've decided to do a quick guide/talent breakdown for her. I regularly see Chromie's with builds that are just.... bad. Hopefully a few people get some value out of this. &amp;nbsp; There are 2 broad talent builds for Chromie. The first is the full-damage, late-game teamfight focused build. This build revolves around making your Sand Blasts do stupid amounts of damage, and, once you get Piercing Sands at level 18, simply deleting entire teams off the map in a few seconds. The second build revolves around building up Time Trap, and using it to disrupt the enemy, and consistently landing combos on individual targets. This guide is focused around the first build, as that is the build I strongly favor, but I will identify the talents that are used in the Time Trap build. &amp;nbsp; **When to pick Chromie:** Preferably late in the draft, *except* on Volskaya or Towers of Doom, where she is a fairly high priority pick. Even then, late in the draft is prefered if you can swing it, as Chromie is a somewhat counterable hero. Chromie doesn't have any super hard counters, but there are heroes that can dramatically reduce your ability to impact the game, by forcing you into more conservative positioning. Diablo and Genji can potentially punish you very hard. Tyrael and Tracer can also be problematic. As a rule of thumb, most dive heroes have to put themselves so far out of position in order to put pressure on you that they become easy pickings for the rest of your team. But you do need to be aware of the threat. Positioning on Chromie is absolutely crucial, and good positioning can turn her weakness (her vulnerability to dive) into a strength (she is giant juicy bait for overconfident divers). But ultimately, if you can avoid going against these heroes, it's ideal, as Chromie is a much bigger threat when she can position aggressively, near (but not in) the frontline. &amp;nbsp; **Talent Breakdown** Level 1: This tier has 2 talents that are very strong. **Mounting Sand:** This talent is very map and comp dependent, but has enormous late-game potential. You sort of lose your mid-game power spike, but you trade it for huge ramping damage if you are able to exploit the talent. Maps to pick it on include BoE, Braxis, Volskaya... anywhere where there is a 4 man lane you can chuck Sand Blast into consistently, or a long, prolonged objective zone. Ideally you want to pick this talent into a melee heavy team as well, preferably melee heroes with large hitboxes, and also heroes that have long duration self-roots. Diablo, ETC, Alarak, Stukov, Stitches, Sgt. Hammer, Samuro (clones count as Heroes and are easy to hit), Ragnaros, Malthael, Anubarak.... just as a few examples. If there are more than one or two of these types of heroes on a team, and it's a 4 lane map, Mounting Sand becomes incredibly powerful. **Deep Breathing:** You will pretty much never take this talent. It's strictly worse for damage than either of her other level 1 talents. In theory it gives you a slightly stronger combo off your ultimate than Timewalker's Pursuit, but the loss in damage on her Sand Blast is not even remotely worth it. Sand Blast is your bread and butter ability. You're casting it every 4 seconds or so for most of the game. Dragon's Breath has a 12 second cooldown, and you're going to be holding it a lot of the time so that you can secure kills. You just don't cast it anywhere near as often, so each point of damage on the ability is not worth anywhere near as much. To give you an idea, Mounting Sand passes Deep Breathing in DPS at ~13 additional stacks, which is a pretty trivial number. In a good Mounting Sand game you can hit that around 10 minutes trivially, and be north of 30 towards the end of the game (if it goes long enough). And unlike Deep Breathing, Mounting Sand just keeps scaling. **Timewalker's Persuit:** This is honestly the talent you should be taking 90% of the time. There's not much to say about it. Offers an easy to complete quest with a solid power-spike, as well as an activatable ability with *enormous* utility. Being able to see anywhere on the map, at any time, on a 25 second cooldown, is *incredibly* powerful. People bitch about Chromie being OP? Well, frankly, this talent is one of the reasons. The utility this talent brings to the team really cannot be understated. &amp;nbsp; **Level 2:** **Bronze Talons:** This talent is absolutely incredible. Adds 100s of points of damage to your combo, provides easy, reliable, poke damage. Oh, and it more than doubles your PvE DPS. It's just fantastic. **Enveloping Assault:** Do not take this talent. The other two talents on this tier are some of the strongest talents in the game. This one is not. **Timely Surprise:** This talent is used with the Time Trap build, and is a big part of what enables it. It can be competitive with Bronze Talons *if* you are able to reliably get resets off of Time Traps. It doesn't offer the same level 2 power spike as Bronze Talons does, but it starts providing value at level 5 with Chrono Sickness, and comes fully online at 18 with Andorhal Anomaly. If you are not going to take Chrono Sickness *and* Andorhal Anomaly do not touch this talent. It is strictly inferior to Bronze Talons without those two synergizing with it. &amp;nbsp; **Level 5:** **Mobius Loop:** This talent is useful when comboed with Slowing Sands. It lets you put out a ton of sustained damage. I would mostly recommend taking this combo of talents if your team is light on CC and the enemy team has lots of ways of nullifying your Temporal Loop combo. You will very rarely find yourself in this situation (typically, if you do, you would have been better off picking a different hero, frankly). **Dragon's Eye:** This is the talent you should be taking the vast majority of the time. Offers a huge boost to the damage of your Temporal Loop combo, and also just a big bump to your overall burst damage. **Chrono Sickness:** Required to enable the other 2 Time Trap talents. Not much else to say about it. Don't be tempted to take the slow in order to land your combo off of Time Trap more easily. You don't need it. &amp;nbsp; **Level 8:** **Slowing Sands:** This is, by and large, the talent you take when you don't think you can get value off of Temporal Loop. It's also *probably* what you should take most of the time when your are going Time Trap. I'm willing to be convinced otherwise though on that part. I think it's somewhat debatable. **Temporal Loop:** R-&gt;W-&gt;Q-&gt;AA. That's your bread and butter combo. It will kill most squishy assassins (Valla, Ming, Hanzo, Genji, etc) from 3/4ths or higher health. If you were able to effectively farm your Q, you can often just delete them outright. You can also combo it with vision from Timewalker's Pursuit to snipe people over walls. W will always land if you cast it when the timer is just slightly over halfway (like, literally just a smidge. Like 1 pixel past halfway). The timing to land Q is slightly harder. Generally you can just start mashing Q as soon as the animation for W fires off, but if you are too close this will cause it to miss, so you will have to wait just a fraction of a second to ensure the hit. Sometimes you will want to R even though W is on cooldown. In this case, you typically want to hold Q until about the last 1/3rd or so of the timer. Again, if you are close, you will have to delay it even more. Really, it just takes some practice. It's one of the easiest combos in the game to land. After awhile you wont even really need to look at the timer, you will pretty much be able to just do it off the audio cue. &amp;nbsp; **Level 11:** **Bye Bye:** Probably the most overpicked talent Chromie has. This talent is only viable on very small maps, where you can hearth and get back into the fight within a couple seconds. And even then, only if the other team is very light on CC. Like, ridiculously light. Like 2/3rds of the warriors in the game just straight up make this talent a dead pick. It's very rarely viable. The one niche situation I would consider it is if we are on BoE, or maaaaaaybe Braxis, against a comp something like, for example, Stitches, Hanzo, Tracer, Rehgar, Arthas. Dive heavy, with almost no way of interrupting your Hearth except for Stitches' hook. Against something like that, on those two maps, it becomes a viable pick. 99% of the time it is not. **Here and There:** I really really want this talent to be good. I really do. And it sort of is. It has huge playmaking capacity, and really rewards skillful play. But it really suffers from being on the same tier as Time Out. I understand why, being able to get both of them would make Chromie more or less unkillable... but it's very hard to justify taking Here and There while Time Out exists. **Time Out:** Just take this talent. Pretty much every game. It's just *good*. Being able to juke any ability in the game pretty much just by pressing 1 is a ludicrously powerful talent. See something nasty coming at you? Pyro? Stitches Hook? Tyrael Judgment? Press 1, and watch it do nothing. Also great for surviving things like Flamestrike, Blizzard, Planet Cracker.... and so on. Tracer Diving you? Press 1, watch your team collapse on her and kill her or force her to E, then continue on with what you were doing. **Shifting Sands:** This talent is amazing. Late game, it might as well read ""Increases your damage by 40% during all team fights"". It's fairly trivial to hit 5 stacks, and, well, that is *a lot* of damage. Combined with a healthy number of Q quest stacks, and Piercing Sands at 18, this is the talent that lets Chromie just remove entire teams from the map. **Fast Forward:** It's not good. You usually won't get the CD reduction consistently, and even when you do, the DPS increase is fairly negligible. **Quantum Overdrive:** This would be a solid talent if Shifting Sands didn't exist. But it does, and this talent is just flat out worse. It's very very easy to maintain 2-3 stacks of Shifting Sands for much better uptime than Quantum Overdrive, and as soon as you hit 4 stacks the damage bonus becomes much much more powerful. There's just no way to justify taking this talent over Shifting Sands. &amp;nbsp; **Level 18:** **Pocket of Time:** A valid pick, if you went this ultimate. You trade team-fight damage for utility. It really depends on whether or not you think you can rely on your team to execute and provide damage if you are able to place your ultimate effectively. If you think that you can land your ulti, and your team can follow up and kill them, then go this talent. If you think you need to prioritize damage because you don't think your team will be able to provide it, go Piercing Sands. **Stuck in a Loop:** This is not a good talent. Your base Temporal Loop should pretty much always be enough to secure a kill, particularly this late in the game. There's just not really any value to be had here. **Piercing Sands:** The ""I want your whole team to die now"" talent. Combos ludicrously hard with any kind of AoE CC ultimate. The amount of damage this does when you have 180+ stacks on your Q quest, and 5 stacks on Shifting Sands, is just absurd. It's also fantastic because it completely removes the ability of the enemy tanks to body block for their squishies. There are very few things more satisfying than throwing your Q *through* an enemy Diablo and 1-shotting the half-health Li Ming hiding behind him. **Andorhal Anomaly:** Time trap talent. It enables the other 2 Time Trap talents, Timely Surprise, and Chrono Sickness, by letting you have 3 traps out at a time. It's good. This build is viable. I don't enjoy playing it, but it's a build, and it works. &amp;nbsp; **Playing as Chromie:** Chromie is entirely a positioning based hero. Knowing exactly where to stand in a fight to maximize your impact, without putting yourself in danger, is absolutely crucial. Being able to land her abilities consistently is pretty secondary, and mostly just comes with practice. With Chromie, you want to position yourself as aggressively as possible *while staying safe* in order to maximize your zoning and poke power. If you are standing way in the backline, you are providing no zoning power, and very little poke. If you are standing just behind the tanks, you produce a massive ""no go"" zone, that enemy heroes simply can't stand in without being heavily punished. How aggressively you can position depends entirely on how much hard-engage power the enemy team has, and how effectively they are executing it. Playing too aggressively means you die, yes, but playing too conservatively means you provide little to no benefit to your team. Trying to snipe with your Q at max range constantly *seems* like what you are supposed to be doing, but in reality, is mostly an exercise in futility. Your damage will be low, and you won't be able to get many kills. I'm happy to answer any further questions about playing Chromie below! "
26,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Suggestion: Fix Alexstraza's Q,0,8bd4vx,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8bd4vx/suggestion_fix_alexstrazas_q/,2018-04-11 10:54:42,"So as has been discussed here before, Alex is a fun, flashy hero that is conceptually what a cool support should be but in reality is a bit weak because of her poor self-heal and the unreliability of her main heal being gated behind her health. I propose a very simple fix: give her Q a self-cast behavior - it costs 15% of her health, just as it does when cast on an ally, and heals 25% of her health back over let's say 3 seconds. This maintains her vulnerability to hard focus, as she can't heal herself from focus fire when the heal is slow and she's damaging herself first. It reduces, however, her vulnerability to poke. Poke can still be a problem if there's too much of it, as she's using the heal on herself instead of team, but it doesn't totally ruin her for the upcoming fight either. A talented Alex would be able to shark around the outside of the fight using her Q to heal herself and W to heal the team while she recovers, instead of saving the W for herself and having a more or less useless Q in the meantime. Thoughts?"

It then turns and returns to her. She can reactivate her E when it's out to teleport to its location. Watching that, it reminded me of Artanis's Q, which he has no control over once cast, and how a lot of the community thought he should be able to cancel it mid-dash when he was released. His lack of mobility was one of the major reasons why he wasn't contested at the highest levels of play (pre-rework), but I feel he made up for it by being able to hold his own late-game with those crazy shield burst resets against multiple enemy Heroes. Now that his kit's been reworked, he no longer gets that ridiculous burst sustain anymore, and he's much more vulnerable to being out of position and focus fire. Perhaps they can give his Q the Maiev E treatment, and actually give him some extra mobility? He will retain his vulnerability to focus fire, blinds, and cc, but at least now he won't (always) be a sitting duck when caught. **Disclaimer: I'm not saying he needs these changes. I think he's in a fairly good spot right now. The Maiev spotlight just kind of brought this idea back up again, and I thought it'd be interesting to explore it in this meta.**"
30,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,A New Status Effect: Immovable,6,7vwwmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/7vwwmx/a_new_status_effect_immovable/,2018-02-08 02:38:55,"This is an idea that recently occurred to me while thinking about how many ways there now are in the game to displace enemy heroes, and how this is a crippling disadvantage for several heroes that have channeled abilities or ults such as Chen. This is just a thought I had - what about a new status effect that isn't quite as strong as Unstoppable, simply called ""Immovable"" that certain abilities would grant to Heroes while using abilities that are quite vulnerable to interrupts, such as Ravenous Spirit or Chen's Drinking, or Hammer Seige Mode? **An alternative way of looking at it would be a ""ROOTED"" status that is basically ""self-inflicted"" but has the positive effect of being 1. self-cancellable 2. making you immune to displacements.** Immovable status would ONLY confer immunity to ""raw"" displacement, and NO OTHER CC EFFECTS such as Stuns, slows, silence, or time stop. So pull or grab effects that ALSO COUNT AS STUNS, such as Hook, Massive Shove, Haymaker, or Wrecking Ball would still work on an Immovable target. However abilities that ONLY DISPLACE such as Maiev's Umbral Bind, Warden's Cage, Zarya's Graviton Surge, ETC's Facemelt or Alarak's Telekenesis would not affect Immovable. I see this effect as rare, and only granted to certain Hero abilities or talents that are too easily interrupted or taken advantage of currently such as Hammer in Seige Mode, Cassia Fend, drinking Chen, or certain full-channeled ults like Ravenous Spirit or Rain of Destruction. Also I fully admit that this idea would be 1. confusing 2. or just downright broken - just an interesting thought I had when thinking about the problem certain heroes have because of their self-rooting abilities. Believe me, I get that such abilities are MEANT to have vulnerability, but I feel that right now a lot of self-root abilities are just death sentences, especially at high level play."
31,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"From Ranger General, to Warchief, to a pushing robot - a Sylvanas discussion",5,7o2s07,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/7o2s07/from_ranger_general_to_warchief_to_a_pushing/,2018-01-04 23:53:20,"First of let me say the following, I LOVE Sylvanas. Ive loved her ever since I started playing an undead in TBC. I have her at lvl 70, 680 games on her. Recently Ive seen many posts regarding her being too OP after the laning changes and that is understandable, the laning changes, and especially mercenary changes, were a huge benefit for most heroes that were proficient in not only wave clear but also jungling or enhancement of mercenaries (like with Mercenary Lord/Queen etc). This is not limited to just Sylvanas herself. Also, I dont think wave clear or focusing the PVE aspect is a bad thing too. Focusing on building a pushing or wave clear comp is a strategy to answer specific comps like an aggressive comp with little wave clear or to punish a very late game comp. And wave clear has always been important, not just now. However, today I want to focus on Sylvanas and not the laning as a whole. **Does Sylvanas need to change?** Yes, and for me there are two main reasons, which I will go into detail: **A)** Her trait is **limiting.** The developers themselves have said that they have to design their maps, objectives, and game mechanics around Sylvanas trait. Without a doubt this probably applies to some hero designs as well. Sylvanas is squishy, she needs her teams support, her damage is only sustain based (needs the lvl 4 Dagger talent), and she strongly depends on the meta. She can be countered pretty easily, but her trait is way too oppressive and a hindrance to game design. Shes not OP (if she was youd see her all over the pro scene), but her trait is not well thought out. **B)** Her talent tree is one-dimensional. Sylvs talent tree is essentially pure pushing with a few rare tech choices if the enemy team has something special. Her play style and kit actually shape her to act like the specialist version of Morales - stay behind the team and disable everything. Her ults I do like tho, although Arrow is definitely superior, I quite like the idea of Mind Control. The rest of her talents, however, are either pretty straight forward regarding her usual build or dont differ much from each other at all. **Then and now** When she came out some compared her to Valla, understandably, the game was still young and the variety in ranged dps was small (If you remember her wave clear and pushing power were even more formidable - mass vulnerability to structures even + Splinter Shot  *btw I loved that talent*). Now, in 2018, that comparison to Valla can no longer be made. Valla has several viable builds: Arrow build, W build, AA build. In comparison Sylvanas has 1 build  a hybrid build with Q and W talents and a Haunting Wave talent at 13 because it benefits her Q. Understand, Im **NOT** saying Sylvanas should be Vallas clone or to take her role or identity, no, but to me Valla is a pretty good example of how a heros talent tree should look like. Also Im not saying that Sylvs current build doesnt provide usefulness or power. Her meta build is pretty strong, useful and beneficial for the team, but its just that 1 viable build and the rest of her tree doesnt provide for a more diverse play style, a different benefit to the team (besides pushing) or a different approach to the hero. **Final words (TL;DL)** Finally, I honestly think she just needs to be reworked. Her trait needs to be reviewed and changed into one that doesnt limit the future development of the game and her talent tree needs to be updated so Sylvanas can be something more than a **pushbot**."
32,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Are people underestimating sylvanas' talent diversity?,5,7oosre,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/7oosre/are_people_underestimating_sylvanas_talent/,2018-01-07 16:23:46,"WALL OF TEXT ALERT. THIS POST HAS GOTTEN LONGER THAN EXPECTED SO IT MIGHT BE A CHORE TO READ. I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS. Alright so a bit of a disclaimer before i start this discussion. I AM IN NO WAY A PRO SYLVANAS PLAYER NOR AM I CLAIMING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT SYLVANAS IS ONE DIMENTIONAL ARE IDIOTS. Yes, i love sylvanas and have played an okay amount of games with her and have tested every single talent on her. But im only a level 16 sylvanas player with around a 60 percent win rate so you do not have to flaunt your superiority or anything. This is meant to be a constructive discussion so i will be happy to be proven wrong if it is done in an organized fashion. Im sorry that the disclaimer was so long. So to get to the point; i think that sylvanas is not a character that can only go for one build every single game. But it has come to my attension that a lot of people, better and worse than myself, have claimed that sylvanas is one of the heroes in a desparate need for a rework since she ""only has one build"". So first off lets get to what the build most people are going for these days. Level 1: Overflowing Quiver (basically a free q whenever a minion dies). 57 percent pickrate Level 4: Lost Soul (a massive cdr for w). 52 percent pickrate Level 7: Barbed Shot (triple pve dmg on her q). 81 percent pickrate Level 10: Wailing Arrow (skill shot damage and silence). 74 percent pickrate Level 13: Windrunner (e refills q charges and gets a recast). 52 percent pickrate Level 16: Cold Embrace (vulnerability on her w). 52 percent pickrate And level 20 seems to be split between player preferance so ill leave that out pf the equation. Now the data taken here are mostly from hotslogs so it is not completely acurate but its the most acurate one we have access to so ill be referencing this. So right off the bat, we can see that this build yields a higher pickrate than the dominant one most other heroes. But i feel like these numbers do her justice because if you type in ""sylvanas builds"" in google. You will most likely get this build as a result and a lot of people picking up this character will just brainlessly go for build and not try out anything else since, dont get me wrong, this is an amazingly solid build. So why do i think that she has more talent diversity than she seems? Well lets look at each talent tier individually to see if the talents shown in this build is the blatently clear winner. Level 1: Now i think that this talent tier is very one dimentional in the sense that the only time you dont pick up overflowing quiver is when the map you are playing on allows for a hard push with mercs such as warhead junction but thats still a consideration to make since merc queen will get you more value than oq in some situations so i feel like talent diversity exists here(dreadful wake is almost never bettet than oq imo) Level 4: Withering Barrage and With the Wind are both great talents that people are underestimating. wb is actually picked up an okay amount so ill be focusing on wtw. With the Wind is disregarded by most people while lookimg at the numbers and i, for the love of everything good, cannot figure out why except people not noticong the value this talent. Lost Soul is a great talent but the problem with it is that this talent makes you extremely mana hungry even though it can boost your damage. wtw has no drawbacks and allows sylvanas to move around very freely while dealing safe damage. This talents synergy with evasive fire definitely grants it at least the rating of useful and withering barrage's synergy with her barbed shot talent being very good i feel grants this tier being more versatile than what most people give it credit for. Level 7: Id say that this tier is the only one with almost no talent diversity to speak of since barbed shot can do everything that unstable poison is able to do but in most cases better and possesion is just doesnt provide enough value because of the removal of ammo and the influx of new heroes with better waveclear such as blaze, hanzo, alex, and many more. Level 10: I feel like icy veins explains this best; mind control is a great talent. The only reason mc is not picked very often is because it is a lot more situational. But in situations where the enemy team has high priority targets or lacks cleanse, it provides massive value. Plus 1 in talent diversity in my opinion. Level 13: Why do people think that windrunner is undebatably the best option here? Yes, it is the only talent that provides sylv with more damage. But this talent binds two survivability tools in one cooldown unlike the other three and makes her very vulnerable. Im not gonna go into detail for why this talent tier has diversity but long story short; windrunner provides the least amount of survivability so the other talents should be picked if you are having trouble. Pick based on what kind of damage or cc your opposing team has. Talent diversity can be seen here too imo. Level 16: Overwhelming affliction is a great tool for cc especially when paired up with characters with trouble keeping up to the enemy like arthas or the butcher. Evasive Fire makes sylv stronger against divers which is the bane of her existence. And remorseless is a good brawling talent of you find your team not grouping up at all in qm. Aside from remorseless, the other two can prove to be bettet than cold embrace in more situations than you might expect. Again, talent diversity. Well i will have to apologize again for the wall of text and the grammar mistakes i had probably made when typing this but pls let me hear your thoughts on this topic. tl;dr, i think that sylvanas has talent diversity and the only reason why people think otherwise is because some talents are applicable to more situation than others and ends up being picked the most.

33,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Everything is better with cheese; So here is a list of fine cheese you can enjoy in HotS and try with your friends,1219,7orqsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/7orqsw/everything_is_better_with_cheese_so_here_is_a/,2018-01-08 04:08:08,"With how many discussions we have about the meta, optimal picks and play. Its about time to shine some light upon the slightly more unorthodox playstyles. Strategies and playstyles that will leave you laughing your ass off with friends on discord while possibly sparking frustration and tilt on the enemy team. This list will involve commonly known cheese comps like Tracer+Tassadar but also several you may not have known to exist yet. We have tested all of these in high master/low grandmaster games either in team league or some, by sniping eachother in hero league queues with discord. **THE COMMON AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE CHEESE:** **Illidan + Abathur** One of the most known duo setups out there. Abathur is a -massive- force multiplier for Illidans power due to the attackspeed talent at level 4 paired with Illidan's CDR trait on auto attacks and the additional survivability provided by carapace and the level 13 W healing from Abathur makes Abathur+Illidan one of the deadliest duo setups. **Medivh + Stitches** The infamous get in the candy van combo. Once Stitches lands a hook + gorge, you just take your victim for a trip into your base with the help of Medivh's portal. What you can also do is offensively portal, gorge someone and take the portal back. **Tassadar + Tracer** Another really common duo setup. Tracer has a super tiny HP bar and deals massive auto attack damage. Tassadar removes Tracer's weaknesses by artifically increasing her HP pool with shields, making her safer from burst. Shields also provide lifesteal, making Tracer extremly tanky and allowing her to be much more greedy and safer. Tracer + Tass also requires a huge amount of counterpicks by the enemy team most of the time. **Li-Ming + Ana** With Ana we finally got the tools in HotS to have a mage hypercarry equivalent. Theres not much to be said about Nano Ming except that the calamity teleports are easily able to force teamwipes. **Medic + Hammer** Another very known and common setup, especially at lower ranks. As approaching this duo requires confidence, a comitted effort and the right setup. Sgt. Hammer zones out opponents from both of them while Medic can stay really far behind and be very safe, providing Hammer incredible sustain. The stimdrone ontop of all that is just the icing on the cake. **Cho'gall + Ana** Ana has dethroned Auriel as our Ogre's favorite healer. Not only can Ana keep up Cho'gall quite easily and from very safe distance. Nanoboost applies to **BOTH** Cho and Gall which is absolutely devastating as a 50 second cooldown. **THE LESS COMMON CHEESE:** **Tyrael + Uther** This one is quite under the radar as it is map dependant and involves this specific pairing of tank and support. If you play on Towers of Doom or even Cursed Hollow, this setup can singlehandedly win the game. Sanctification into Divine Shield or vice versa, guarantees you a free objective. The enemy team has no way of stopping this strategy beyond Void Prison and Ley Line Seal. Both of which aren't very common. And since you only need two people to get an entire objective, you can have three other players gaining advantages elsewhere on the map while Tyrael+Uther secure you the objective. **Butcher + Falstad** Another one that is very easy to execute. Once the Butcher chains up the kill target in a teamfight, your own team immedieatly collapses on this kill target. Falstad follows up instantly with a mighty gust so everyone but your kill target gets pushed away. **Uther + Garrosh** While this might not seem very obvious at first, throwing an Uther into the enemy backline is very lethal if you have a dive comp that can follow up on it. As soon as Uther gets dumped into the backline with a divine storm, destruction should ensue. It will also usually end with Uther dying first out of your team. Which is favourable with his trait and generally long ability cooldowns. **Abathur + Zagara** This is another one that is somewhat under the radar but also very strong. Abathur's main weakness is the early game. While Zagara's main weakness is the lategame. Normally Zagara's splitpush alone forces at least 1 person on the enemy team to babysit Zagara. However to now gank her, requires a large effort as she is easily capable of just killing her ganker with a symbiote. They provide massive map presence for one in map vision with creep tumors and toxic nests but also with mutalisks and locusts shoving lanes, constantly putting pressure. This results in the enemy team splitting apart, responding to Zag. This plays into Abathur's main strength, small skirmishes and duels all over the map instead of 5v5 teamfights. Ontop of that you get massive, global pushing power with Zag and a clone, able to appear at any fort on the map with Nydus and at level 20, even backdooring into your base to get keeps like they once used to be able to at level 10. **Abathur + Murky** This is essentially Illidan + Abathur but with a Murky. The shield and level 13 healing makes Murky incredibly more tanky and the spikes give him the slight edge he needs to become a dangerous and persistent bruiser that can easily pick apart your backline. They excel with a massive lategame powerspike and neither of them tends to actually die a lot which means they are always active on the map with no downtimes. This comp will net a lot of flames and upset teammates but is incredibly underrated and way more powerful than you might believe. **THE FINEST CHEESE:** **Ragnaros + Alexstrasza + D.Va + Sylvanas** This comp is limited to Infernal Shrines. The main weakness of Sylvanas is that she is a win more/snowball hero and she is very weak in actual teamfights or playing from behind. This setup guarantees you every single punisher in the game which means Sylvanas is a staple in this setup as her main weakness doesn't exist. Molten Core + Dragonqueen and D.Va Explosion are one of the biggest things you do **NOT** want to stay and fight against. By having all three and using them one by one to zone out the enemy team from the shrine objective, the only way to win for the enemy team is by pressuring the map itself and having better rotations. Sylvanas however puts such a force and importance behind the punisher that even the first objective can already secure you a keep or an early win. **Illidan + Tyrael + Sonya** If you happen to hate one particular person. This is the comp for you. Hunt + Judgement + Leap on a single target so the stuns line up with another. Chain stunning 1 target to death and having 3 melees connect onto it with burst damage. Its hard to win based off this initiation alone as you commit 3 ultimates for one kill but its definitely one of the most hilarious ones on this list. **Arthas + Rehgar + Tassadar** The OG Bloodlust comp. We used to play this way back in the old ranked system, when all three of these. Arthas, Rehgar and Tassadar were considered weak and hovered around 42-44% winrate, getting great success out of it. Now that all three are extremly strong and Tassadar has an innate slow on Archon attacks, its even stronger than it used to be. Arthas is the key to enabling this setup as Sindragosa prevents a disengage without Mighty Gust or similiar tools while also letting you dive carelessly right under keeps, forts and so on. Usually you want to get one melee assassin like a Thrall/Illidan and a ranged like Tracer or Greymane. Every initiate should start with a Sindragosa into Bloodlust and Archon. 9 out of 10 times you will win the teamfight just based on the massive surprise effect and power spike by the bloodlust while the entire enemy team is trying to crawl away with Sindra's slow. **Xul + Nova + Kel'thuzad** A secret favorite. This setup enables you to globally delete someone off the map every minute with a simple Xul root into Kel'thuzad and Nova ults. At level 16 when Xul gets the vulnerability, it becomes even more deadly and reliable. Often times Xul can just sit in a random bush between a rotation. Press E on someone and you got a kill. These three also cover each others weakness nicely. Providing a healthy mix of early and lategame. Lane presence. Melee to ranged ratio and ganking power. So its not like having these three in a team opens you up to major weaknesses beyond the lack of AA damage. **D.Va + Zarya + Medic** This comp is the essence of double support but more powerful. It takes all the strengths of what made double support so good and takes it further. All three characters do not have mana and can go practically forever. You do not end up with only raw healing or only shieldstacking but a healthy spread of damage reduction, peels, shielding and healing. Which means you are not open to being abused by things like shieldbreaker arrows from Hanzo or touch of death from Malthael. They all synergize incredibly with another. Each one making the other practically immortal. Good luck trying to kill Medic between defensive matrix and zarya shielding. Let alone the other two members in their teamcomp. You will have sustain that can not be outmatched paired with incredible boss control and pushing power. **Illidan + Tracer + Abathur + Zarya + Lucio** As you can see this comp has no tank. As there is no need for one. Abathur in this setup only plays the role of duo soaking on a large map like Sky Temple or Cursed Hollow. He has nothing else to do as the game normally ends around 10 minutes with this draft. You do not need to sit on Illidan or Tracer, just cover the other two lanes. Meanwhile you have a 4man lane with two of the most unforgiving divers in the game. Zarya here just plays the role of a more offensive Tassadar who can also tank a few hits and adds more overall damage and pushing power. Lucio enables the dive or forth and back dancing even harder while Tracer and Illidan just chase down the enemy team and dive, farming kills nonstop until you are at the core and end the game with a massive level advantage. Once you get to the core its usually game just by the fact that Illidan and Tracer on the core are near impossible to defend. **Zeratul + Abathur + Ragnaros** While there are many offensive cheeses out there. This one, just like the medic, dva and zarya one is more defensive of nature. But instead of preserving your heroes, you are preserving your structures. This functions best on Warhead Junction. Between Void Prison on your own buildings before nuke impact, Molten Core and Abathur's MULE, nukes essentially have zero value in getting structure damage for the enemy team. It will also be laughably easy to prevent those quad nuke situations on your core with a properly used VP and a Rag fort behind the enemy team. Ragnaros himself provides an acceptable off-lane and Abathur+Zeratul a strong map presence with huge kill potential. **Hanzo + Artanis + Tyrael + Brightwing** This is another exclusive setup that is restricted to Cursed Hollow but can also function on Warhead Junction. Simply abusing the raw DPS to secure bosses in spans of 10 seconds with Hanzo + Artanis and another high octane DPS like Greymane or Valla. Brightwing and Tyrael are merely there for the boss control in sanctification, holy ground and emerald wind. This setup allows you to boss anytime you want. You can kill bosses in record speed and so even just being gone for 15-20 seconds on the minimap can be a boss for you. Even if all five people on the enemy team are alive and in range to respond, the boss will still go to you 9/10 times. The raw power of being able to force and take a boss practically instantly whenever you feel like it, allows you to put great pressure during certain times and snowball with those advantages. **Tyrael + Artanis + Medic + Gul'dan + Raynor** Another spin on the raw racing potential but this time, you are trading mercenary damage for structure damage. This comp is most powerful on Warhead Junction but you can play it on every large map out there. The win condition is to medivac on the enemy core. From there on you have an Artanis going at it with Amateur Opponent. Raynor dropping a Hyperion on the core and providing attackspeed to the other 4 players. Gul'dan goes for the Rain of Destruction. (That other ult no one has ever seen) as it provides the highest core damage in the game next to Azmodan's demonic invasion at lvl 20. So now you have a Rain of Destruction, Amateur Opponent Artanis and a Hyperion + Raynor wailing at the core. When the enemy team responds you just drop a sanctification and keep going. Most of the time, the core is already destroyed before the sanctification even expires. The important thing to note here is that you need to take a Fort and a Keep in one lane first to make flying on the core even possible. These are most cheesy setups that came to mind when creating this post. Its highly possible theres a few ones I may have skipped, if you got any more. Do feel free to contribute. Its important to say that these strategies all function best with a group of friends and voice communication. Especially the ones that require more than two heroes or have tight timings like the Xul+Nova+KT one. "
34,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Let's Look at Supports Case by Case,60,7g628w,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/7g628w/lets_look_at_supports_case_by_case/,2017-11-29 05:05:25,"I won't argue with people claiming that the nerfs are going to disincentivize people from playing supports. Personally, I think most of the HL playerbase knows you need a support and this won't change their level of enthusiasm about playing them. The people who are most vulnerable to that feeling likely won't have read the patch notes. Still, I see the point and I think it's fair. That said, the notion that these nerfs are 'killing' supports is wildly unjustified. Blizz has slowly but surely added a lot utility to the kit of supports over the past year/2 years. Making them less survivable/able to do damage is not unreasonable in the context of everything they can do. Some people have claimed that if a support can't 1v1 anyone, they're useless, or that if they have reduced waveclear they're useless. Let's look at it on a case-by-case basis. Alexstrasza: Can turn into a dragon, offering incredible point control and power. Global heals with the ability to protect self by removing self from fight. Strong poke and dueling with E. Can turn into a dragon. *Ana:* Sleep dart is **amazing** crowd control. She can play safer than any other healer with the range on Q. She can reduce enemy healing by *100%*. Nanoboost is very strong on some heroes. *Auriel:* Manaless. Powerful Stun. Amazing save potential. Punishes melee compositions. Blind. Again, manaless. *Brightwing:* Global. Decent waveclear. Bribe. Reveal. Shielding. Polymorph for crippling single target CC. Disengage potential. Spell Armor/Speedboost. Global, again. Can't be overstated. *Kharazim:* Amazing save potential. Good single target damage. Enables dive. Very flexible. Pressures backline well, and potentially frontline with SSS. Super mobile, allowing for great escapes and engages. *Li-Li:* Strong blind counters AA hard. Good dueling. Above average damage. Lane bully. Speed allows her to chase/escape well. *Lucio:* Powerful teamwide speed boost. Huge AOE shield for saves. Slippery. Low CD displacement. Manaless heal for sustain. Heals whole team. *Malfurion:* Root. Silence. Mana restore and CDR. Amazing poke/interrupt potential. *Morales:* Best single-target throughput. AOE displacement. Armor allows for save potential. Manaless. Global mobility or Huge boost to AA hero. *Rehgar:* Above average waveclear and mercing (yes, still, even without lightning bond). High save potential. Decent CC. Pressures enemy frontline well. *Stukov:* Powerful disengage tools. Slows. Huge AOE infinite duration silence/zoning. Above average waveclear. Potential for teamwide ancestral healing. *Tassadar:* Can escape easily with E. Can shield anything, including structures. Enables AA carries well. Vision/Reveal. Serious threat in Archon. Decent waveclear (even after nerf). Poke potential. Playmaking with force walls. *Tyrande:* Amazing followup CC. Vulnerability. Scouting/Poke. Flexibility. Powerful threat to backline. AOE Zoning potential. Big lategame powerhouse. Frontline threat with darnassian. *Uther:* Tank-Level crowd control. High save potential. Provides armor to team, reducing incoming damage. Heals after death, allowing him to function as off-tank. Every support in the roster offers a lot of utility to the team. Some offer more than others because their throughput is lower, some offer less because they excel so much at healing. The thing about an across the board nerf is, it doesn't touch this utility, except in certain isolated cases that were arguably too strong. Rehgar, for example, has been top ban material for a while for his mercing, and Tass has been a safe pick in competitive for basically forever because of his waveclear and utility. I, for one, see no issues with migrating the power of supports into this utility. That's what distinguishes them from one another, and that's what makes them fun for me. As it stands, they can do all of this while healing a lot and putting out decent damage. Why wouldn't you take one over most sustained dps heroes? This way the power of each primary class is more codified: -Assassins: Damage, Waveclear -Tanks: Sustain, Control -Supports: Healing, Control And I think that's better for the game in the long run."

I am queueing as 5 mans (comms or no comms) , 2/3 carry parties , or solo queue (not so much). My winrate is a bit off in the screenshot due to intentional throws or having to remake. I had a few wins on an alternate account as well. [Screenshot](URL [Screenshot2](URL Here are the best heroes I have found for the Heroic mode. **** Greymane - Best assassin option. I build full Worgen. 1 - Viciousness to keep W up in Worgen/Human. 4 - Insatiable to ensure you keep full on mana for bullet at all times. You can go longer cocktail but you typically have other wave clear and worgen is your best clear anyway. 7 - Wizened Dualist, just learn how to not die. 10 - Cursed Bullet 13 - Visceral Attacks so your feral swipe is up all the time to clear zerg. 16 - Alpha Killer is best single target dps typically and especially now that the heroic heroes have larger HP. It also helps on the boss. 20 - Tooth and Claw - Worgen cleave for Hero Add spawn phase and general cleave. **** Lucio - Best healing option. Sustained healing with a strong ult to offset burst. Speed is good to help dodge on boss at times, pushback is nice to knock heroes or enemies off. Lucio's 16 Talent options are super impactful for the 2nd portion of the Brawl. I prefer his 45% increased healing if 2 allies are nearby as you are typically grouped. The 2.5% sounds good in theory but only if you have 3 Tanks/Bruisers. You should take Sound Barrier at 10 and the upgrade at 20. **** Varian - Victory Rush / Colossal Smash Build 1 - High King's Quest 4 - Shield Wall, To Soak DMG and banelings 7 - Victory Rush, This talent keeps you healed at all times in this mode, INSANELY OP. 10 - Colossal Smash, Applies Vulnerability for your team and you aren't usually at risk of dying without the Taunt HP buff. 13 - Juggernaut, Extra burst on heroes. 16 - Banner of Ironforge or Banner of Dalaran. Spell DMG helps your additional dmg, even greymane in worgen. If you need more survivability take the Armor banner. 20 - Glory to the Alliance for added healing **** Secondary Tank options Johanna - Heal at 1, Blind at 4, Blind at 7 to increase blind duration on heroes, Shield Throw at 10, Burning Rage 13, Imposing to slow Hero Attacks 16 (other options), Storm Shield at 20. **** Bruisers Sonya AA , If you need additional wave clear you can go slam build. Artanis - Seasoned at 1, Shield Surge 4, Follow Through 7, Suppression Pulse at 10, Shield Overload for Survival 13, Titan Killer 16, Shields at 20 for Survival or Nexus Blades. **** Healer / DPS Kharazim - I recommend : 1 - Healing Punches for mana free sustain/heals 4 - Armor Ward so a Varian can take a spell banner. Heal Ward if you are not with lucio. 7 - E Duration for more heal punches 10 - 7 Sided to blow up Heroes 13 - E cooldown refresh don't fall for dash builds 16 - Breath of Heaven (the secondary heal) , this helps cover bad play and adds extra healing for a lucio. 20 - Storm Shield if you need more sustain/soak. Transgression if you just want burn. **** Other Okay Healer Uther - He can provide built in armor on heals/devotion. I recommend 1 - Hammer Quest (E) at 1 for unlimited mana and stuns on heroes. 4 - Holy Fire (Free AOE) 7 - Whatever 10 - I think Divine Storm is best here to stun out Ultralisks/Heroes/Multiple Heroes. Divine Shield does have its uses. 13 - Well Met would be best for weakening enemy heroes damage so probably reocommended. 16 - Benediction Probably for double heals or stuns? 20 - Divine Hurricane for add phase on boss? Redemption? Not sure.. **** Best Sustain DPS Options / Waveclear (Outside of Greymane) Illidan - Self Sustain, good siege, good single target, high survivability, great boss burn / solo. SM at 1, Q dive 20% or friend at 4, Thirsting blade (W talent at 7), Meta at 10 for juking ults or baiting them, nimble defender at 13, Fiery Brand or whatever the AA talent on heroes is, Demonic form at 20. **** Guldan - Best Waveclear on low cooldowns, synergizes well with Lucio, can self heal and sustain mana. Recommended Build - Fel Flame Quest at 1 (stacks on ultralisks) Improved Life Tap at 4 (Don't fall for noob talent like life draining to kill a minion resets, Improved Life Tap works well with Lucio or sustain heals) Bound by Shadow 7 Fear or Rain (Peel vs AOE) Fel Armor 13 (helps a lot vs dmg) Rampant Hellfire 16 Portal 20 (may help save your ass on boss?) **** Other Good DPS Options (but best with guldan and greymane) Xul - Emphasize W build Valla - Okay Wave Clear and Somewhat Mana strained. Robo Gobo Gazlowe - You Mostly need mana or probably cd reduction, minions drop tons of scrap, Turrets XL, Robo Gobo, Additional Turret Charge and Ult Upgrade at 20. Turret madness. Raynor - He gets super stacked and can buff his team. Does heavy boss DPS at the end. Falstad - Seasoned Marksman + Boomerang and you can do a lot. Gust for Peel or Hinterlands for DPS. Azmodan - Has minions to tank for your team. Can deal moderate siege and hero dmg. **** So So DPS options Nazeebo is so so, enemies die fast so its hard to get stacked or get quests done. Jaina is okay but there are less cooldown dependent mages. Kael is okay as well, maybe better than Jaina because his Phoenix ult adds a lot of clear and dps. Double Flamestrikes change a lot with 16. **** Other Tips Save Nukes if you can for the Boss Nydus spawns, MAKE SURE you hit 2 Nydus Worms or its a waste. Use Psi-Emitters for peel and AOE clear. Adds are drawn to the middle and it explodes after so many seconds. Use Rejuvenation items if your healer is on CD or you guys really need heals/mana badly. Stim items should be saved for second phase of the boss if you can help it. It isn't the end of the world if you don't have any stims but it makes the burn phase take a lot longer and your team takes a lot more damage. **** That is my preferred set of heroes. If you need help add me ingame Kenwood#11161. "

Its not a video and requires reading, what a drag! Please be considerate and thank you in advance! I decided to write this because I do so love this crazy little dystopian hero! &amp;nbsp; **Author's Notes** I am only a level 10 Junkrat and account level 595 if that matters to you. I have a typically aggressive playstyle and use my own Q-build based off of that. Even against dodgy players and when firing into Fog of War I feel like a surgeon with grenade launcher; maybe Ive just been lucky but take your own accuracy into account when opting for a frag build. That being said, feedback and constructive criticism in all areas are welcome! **Background:** For amateur players and vets alike, this talent guide has league play taken into consideration but has not been utilized there. &amp;nbsp; **Guide** (S = Situational) Q-BUILD TYPE Talent Tier: 1 | 4 | 7 | 10 | 13 | 16 | 20 | Talent Pick: 1 | 1 | S | 2 | 2 | 2 | S | &amp;nbsp; **Put Some English On It:** Increases the travel range of Frag Launcher by 50% but does not increase the speed. Unless youre incredible at the bank pool, its best of the 3 in most maps as you will capitalize on range rather than skill shots based on billiards. Bouncy, which increases damage by 20% is completely viable in maps where you can capitalize on bank pool shots rather than range; Volkskaya Foundry and Garden of Terror come to mind. I still havent found a legitimate reason to use Extra-Wound Timers even on maps where you may want a 2 second delay on frag explosions, like Towers for instance. &amp;nbsp; **Taste For Explosions:** Hitting a hero increases the damage of Frag Launcher by 0.75, up to 150. Unless youre going with a mine/trap build I feel like this is the obvious choice without exception. &amp;nbsp; **Big As** (60% slow on a successful Concussion Mine) or **Sticky Wicket** (Steel Trap's root becomes a 90% slow). The conditional 15% movement from Tricky Shuffles wont give you any significant advantages over the other two. In the event that youre ever in a match where you think you would need the extra speed, like against high mobility heroes, think twice. I feel in most cases against heroes like Tracer or Genji, 15% move speed after making sure your frag launcher is empty and/or trying to capitalize on getting a good trap off on top of that, creates too many conditions vs. the flat reward from the other two talents. You rarely want to be caught so far out of position that you can't be saved by a simple trap or mine. &amp;nbsp; The extra slow from **Sticky Wicket** will be more advantageous for team fights *offensively*. It takes a second for Steel Trap to arm so you must use it perfectly for it to be effective. Common instances where you might use it like this would be wombo combo with any AoE crowd control or damage ability. Even without a dedicated Q-build, Big As will be more advantageous solely for pre-emptive, and sometimes reactive escape. Taking Big As creates a smaller room for error with Steel Trap, allowing you to be safer in using Concussion Mine on cool-down for offensive displacement, kills, and peels. &amp;nbsp; **Rocket Ride:** After 1.25 seconds, Junkrat launches into the air. While in the air, he can steer the landing location by moving. After 3.5 seconds, Junkrat lands, dealing 750 damage to nearby enemies and activating Total Mayhem. 5 seconds after landing, Junkrat reappears at the Altar and gains 150% additional Movement Speed until dismounted. For me, RIP-Tire doesnt even rate in the same league as Rocket Ride. Even with a 100 second cool-down Rocket Ride has been fantastic for an AoE damage boost; using it just after a frag volley and Concussion Mine into an initial push inserts decent damage and heavy displacement on your opponents and allows you to be back in the fight shortly after. Use it to escape a team fight gone wrong, or even as an emergency hearth/reposition. The utility of this ult has been a god-send and requires no state of vulnerability. I would recommend always using it at a range where you: 1.) Wont get the ult stuffed. 2.) You arent hovering around your target(s) hoping you dont get juked for 3 seconds. &amp;nbsp; Using it in close proximity provides your opponent too many opportunities to get out of it. If you have no choice other than proximity, use it with limited exits for your opponent and wait for the perfect time to move it over your target as opposed to trying to chase someone down. Force your target to guess in fear/reaction; dont let them predict or lead. Use it intelligently, out of view or from within FoW, where you can fly in, drop on your target, then get back in the fight. &amp;nbsp; After the level 20 CDR this is a BEAST of an ult and can be used on cool-down. A caveat to the range stipulation is that after level 13, with Endless Nades (1.5s Frag Launcher CDR per hero hit), you can frag volley into your opponent(s) until you dont catch a reset, throw Concussion Mine and/or Steel Trap for the crowd control, then immediately follow up with Rocket Ride and/or wombo combo with your teams ults. &amp;nbsp; **Before you choose your level 13 talent I think its very important to try to understand your effectiveness at this point in relation to your teams synergy and match flow. A few things to consider:** &amp;nbsp; - If you took Big As and you still cannot land Steel Traps effectively for any reason, dont double down with Chattering Teeth, take Bogged Down. Rely now on making concussion mines more effective. Respectively, if you cant be effective with Concussion Mines, take Chattering Teeth. - If you took Sticky Wicket and have issues landing traps, Chattering Teeth can be used as an enhancement if you need Steel Trap to be more effective. - If you took Sticky Wicket and your Steel Trap game is on point, taking Bogged Down can be an extremely effective playmaker; using Steel Trap ahead of opponents caught in Concussion Mine can provide a secondary slow for a total of 5 seconds of CC for you and your team to capitalize on. &amp;nbsp; More Notes on level 13: I personally think that using Ripper Air for extra mobility is the suckers-bet, I feel its very redundant to your already available pool of resources and provides no additional advantages over the other two talents at this tier. Youre already used to getting around the map, and getting around the map solo is very situational. The CDR might have been worth it if Junkrat didnt have to be hit. Seeing as that condition exists, most of the time I opt for the extra slow from Bogged Down. &amp;nbsp; Bogged Down tends to be a strategic choice that has been invaluable when getting stacks, setting up kills, pushing, and retreating. The other talents essentially abandon 2 seconds of 60% slow for a little bit of extra pressure from Steel Trap use and a little too much risk vs. reward with Ripper Air. Strategically Big As with Bogged Down will offer you and your team more strategic advantages, more survivability, and capitalization on successful Concussion Mine displacement. &amp;nbsp; **Endless Nades:** Hitting an enemy Hero with Frag Launcher reduces its cooldown by 1.5 seconds. In a team fight or otherwise, if you can land your frags with consistent accuracy against multiple opponents, EN enables you to have a constant stream of frags, hence the name. The other talents dont really compare unless youre going for something specific. Burst Fire might be interesting for a bank pool build in close environments with Bouncy! or against high-agility heroes but I havent used it yet. &amp;nbsp; **Puckish Scamp:** Reduce Rocket Ride's cooldown by 70 seconds. If youre using Rocket Ride, you cannot get any better than a 70 second CDR allowing you to use this on cooldown. I *will* add the caveat that I alternate between this and **Cannonball!:** Increase the radius and explosion radius of grenades from Basic Attacks and Frag Launcher by 50%. Hear me out, even with Rocket Ride taking Cannonball! can be extraordinary. The increased radius and explosions for both auto-attacks and Frag Launcher can clear minions and mercs near instantly while also obliterating infrastructure and turning team fights. I alternate between this and Puckish Scamp depending on whether I feel like the opponent comp has more siege, they cluster often, or our comp lacks macro late game and were getting our lanes pushed in. Using Cannonball! in situations like this can absolutely turn the game around. &amp;nbsp; **Conclusion and Opinion on his current meta:** I honestly feel like Junkrat is in an amazing way right now. On the opinion that Junkrat should not be drafted as an assassin and that he qualifies more as a specialist is at the very least inaccurate. In most cases when choosing Junkrat, follow Bruce Lees philosophy in that you can be formlessIf you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. If you play Junkrat like a specialist, he can be a specialist, play him like an assassin, he can be an assassin. Often I can make the plays for my team, top hero and siege damage while also competing for assists and kills because I play him aggressive, active, and always look to make the play. &amp;nbsp; I hope you all enjoy him as much as I have, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed my Junkrat guide.

38,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Blizzard is creating a double support meta - why?,0,79l27y,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/79l27y/blizzard_is_creating_a_double_support_meta_why/,2017-10-30 13:50:41,"Opening weekend clearly demonstrated that we are in a meta where double support is standard. This is despite Blizzard's stated intentions of moving away from it, since it is becoming ""too common"" (one only has to look at their recent patch notes). However, if Blizzard's intention is to move away from the double support meta, the current design direction of supports needs to change. I'm going to argue that healing numbers need to be, in general, buffed across the board in order to move towards double support being an option and not the standard. The primary function of supports is damage mitigation (note, I say damage mitigation and not healing). Healing is simply the most visible and easiest to understand form of damage mitigation. The reason this is necessary is to extend fights and hero presence on the map. Other forms of damage mitigation include, but are not limited to, damage reduction (armor), movement speed (reduces vulnerability to damage), and temporary health (shielding in HOTS). In general, there are two different ideologies you can follow when it comes to this sort of thing - low damage + low mitigation or high damage + high mitigation. Heroes has clearly chosen the latter. If you go into this sort of philosophy, putting lots of damage mitigation onto a smaller set of characters makes sense, thus creating the ""support"" class, whose primary function is to mitigate the damage coming out of the opposing team. Logically, if your job is simply to mitigate damage, you need to mitigate MORE damage than one player on the other team can deal, otherwise it becomes pointless to have someone whose primary role is damage mitigation. You might as well have a different character whose primary role is to provide crowd control, damage, stuns, or something of that nature. There are other sources of damage other than the opposing team, and therefore if a damage mitigator is not bringing more mitigation than a good damage dealer is bringing damage, it makes more sense to simply have more damage. This creates a division in how you design damage mitigators. You can have characters who bring strong damage mitigation alongside other things or characters who have damage mitigation as their primary function. In general, off-supports and main tanks bring damage mitigation along with other things, whereas main supports effectively have damage mitigation as their primary role. Why do I mention tanks here? Because it's important to understand that one of the main jobs of a tank is also damage mitigation, but it takes on a different form. Tanks exist to control space, engagements, as well as protect damage dealers. They do this through a variety of abilities, but generally have two properties that interact which allow them to mitigate much of the damage that they take - large health pools and self-sustain. Thus, the way a tank mitigates damage is simply to ""wear"" it. They take the damage instead of the character they are trying to protect, which is fine because they have a large health pool. Then, they have sustain abilities which allow them to be ready to take more damage in a much shorter window of time than most other characters. Muradin is the archetypal example of this. You take some damage, back out, use your trait, and go back in. But most of the other tanks bring this to the table as well. Whether it's Johanna's trait, Diablo's Devil's Due/Soul Feast talents, or Arthas's Q/ult, the vast majority of tanks provide damage mitigation as one of their benefits. This damage mitigation, however, is focused primarily on THEMSELVES. This means that a tank cannot mitigate damage that was dealt while they were not present. This is the purpose of healing, and why characters whose primary role is damage mitigation all have heals. If your primary role is damage mitigation you need to be able to mitigate damage that is dealt both when you are and are not present. This makes you a ""healer"" by default, because the only way to mitigate damage that was dealt when you aren't there is to heal it. Note that it is common right now to run a tank, an off-tank alongside two healers. Sonya is the most common offender in the off-tank role, but this fact indicates exactly how important damage mitigation is in this game. In many competitive games, four out of five characters have damage mitigation as one of their major benefits. The reason this is necessary is because the damage output in this game is generally high, especially from dedicated damage characters like Kel'Thuzad or Valla. Blizzard recently has been nerfing the healing numbers on supports, and they've been using the double support meta as justification to do this when, in fact, it justifies the exact opposite. The only reason you need to run two damage mitigators is because one cannot do the job adequately. The damage output of this game dictates that you need a certain amount of damage mitigation on your team. This is why, at a competitive level, you almost never see the triple squishy + solo tank + solo support team, whether we are in a double support or single support meta. At the end of the day, overall, you need a certain amount of damage mitigation to deal with the overall high damage output. If you do not have the ability to concentrate this damage mitigation (in general into a support), then you have to spread it out over the team. If I can't have one damage mitigator do enough, then I need to run a second one. This is where the double support meta comes from - simply put, a solo support generally doesn't have sufficient damage mitigation capabilities right now in this game. Therefore, you need to run a second support to cover that. There's nothing ultimately wrong with this idea. Many supports bring other benefits to the table, and spreading the responsibility among multiple players makes it so that a bad single support or simple lapses in judgment have a smaller impact. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this as a design decision, it just runs contrary to what Blizzard has been saying. If Blizzard wants double support to be the standard, then they should continue doing what they are doing - keeping the healing numbers of supports where they are and giving many of them something else - global presence, crowd control, wave clear, kill pressure, poke damage, whatever else they want to add. However, if Blizzard wants to make double support an OPTION and not the standard, they need a class of characters that 1) primarily are damage mitigators and really don't bring much else to the table (e.g. Morales) and 2) have the damage mitigation ability to back that up.

39,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Harassment in Gaming: Scholarly Evidence to inform the Voice Chat discussion,0,7bx27z,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/7bx27z/harassment_in_gaming_scholarly_evidence_to_inform/,2017-11-10 09:56:53,"Since there's been a lot of discussion re: voice chat and harassment, and a ton of rehashing of the same-old vitriol without evidence being presented on either side - [with one exception I've seen](URL - I decided to actually do some basic searching of academic databases. I don't really expect the evidence here to change the minds of the virulent ""I hate all SJWs"" crowd, nor do I necessarily think it provides easy solutions. But it is 100% needed: we need to base these discussions on actual studies, and to admit to ourselves that discrepancies in vulnerability to online toxicity are real (I say, as a cis-, hetero-, white, middle-class, highly educated male). Here are links and relevant portions of the abstracts. I am providing links to non-paywalled direct PDFs where possible. Where paywalls exist (a little under 50% of the articles), if you have access to an academic library/VPN to a campus library, there's a reasonable chance you have access. I have divided into three parts: problem-diagnosis/problem-demonstration, solution-focused/""what the alternative looks like"", and more theoretically extensive works (which also include evidence, but tend to be longer/more developed, especially the Gray (2012) book. Methodology varies from formal surveys to semi-structured interviews, both of which are common and well-respected techniques across the social sciences. I've also made sure the studies are relatively recent, to minimize any of the gaming-misconception issues that persisted into the early 2000s. One brief comment: anonymity is one of the causes identified, but it is **by no means the only one.** [Edit: Since I'm being flamed for TL;DR and not giving a synthesis... That was intentional. I posted the links and abstracts, and filtered out the irrelevant ones, because people asked if evidence existed. I have no intention of drawing conclusions for you, merely to indicate what scholarship is available. If you choose to read some of these, fine. Do so, draw your own conclusions. I won't provide a canned analysis for you to disagree with, without studying the material yourself.

Cyberbullying on Online Gaming Platforms for Children and Youth. Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal, 1-11.](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; Cyberbullying has been recognized as a serious social concern. Considering the varied contexts of online engagement by children and youth is increasingly necessary to adequately understand their experiences and the impact of their participation. An online context which requires further attention is gaming platforms, which are especially popular among boys. Methods: Using a theoretical approach of social dominance, this paper analyzed secondary data drawn from a mixed methods study of cyberbullying to investigate the prevalence and experience of gaming among a quantitative survey sample (n = 670) of 4th, 7th, and 10th grade students, as well as the experience and impact of gaming on a qualitative interview sub-sample (n = 57). Gaming prevalence rates are provided. Boys were significantly more likely to engage in internet gaming (though the effect size was small);  (1, n = 669) = 10.11, p = 0.001, phi = 0.123, 95% CI (0.207, 0.047). Qualitative content analysis (QCA) identified four themes: (1) aggression (exceeding what was required to achieve game objectives) characterized gaming culture and pervaded gaming platforms; (2) anonymity contributed to the culture of aggression; (3) participants often did not consider aggression cyberbullying, but rather just a part of the culture of gaming platforms; and (4) participants responses to aggressive behaviors. Certain behaviors on gaming platforms may not be appropriately recognized as cyberbullying. Implications for social work practice with children and youth are provided. [De Letter, J., van Rooij, T., &amp; Van Looy, J. (2017). Determinants of harassment in online multiplayer games. Presented at the 67th Annual ICA Conference: Interventions: Communication Research and Practice.](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; An online survey of online multiplayer gamers (N = 883) was conducted. Measures included harassment exposure, guardianship, and target suitability. These determinants were used to predict general and sexual harassment victimization in multiple regression analyses. Analyses controlled for social desirability responding. Results. Both sexual harassment victimization (R = 63%) and general harassment victimization (R = 57%) were successfully predicted using the determinants. The gender of the gamer is associated with the type of harassment received; women are more likely to encounter sexual harassment, while men are more likely to be harassed in the general sense. Gaming for fewer hours per week, with mostly or exclusively female avatars, and sharing personal information (e.g. gender) predicts sexual harassment victimization, whereas playing in Player-versus-Player game modes predicts general harassment victimization. Harassing other gamers and associating with harassers predicts both general and sexual harassment. [Fox, J., &amp; Tang, W. Y. (2014).

Womens experiences with general and sexual harassment in online video games: Rumination, organizational responsiveness, withdrawal, and coping strategies. new media &amp; society, 1461444816635778..](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; Online video games can be a toxic environment for women. A survey assessed womens (N = 293) experiences with general harassment and sexual harassment in online video games, including frequency of harassment, rumination about the harassment, perceptions of organizational responsiveness (i.e. efforts the gaming company made to address harassment), and withdrawal from the game. Women reported coping strategies to mitigate harassment, including gender bending or gender neutralization through screen name or avatar choice, avoiding communication with other players, and seeking help or social support inside and outside the game. Both general and sexual harassment predict womens withdrawal from online games. Sexual harassment, but not general harassment, leads to rumination and subsequent withdrawal. The path from sexual harassment to withdrawal was also mediated by organizational responsiveness, indicating the video game industry plays a key role in whether women continue to participate after harassment occurs. [Cote, A. C. (2017). I Can Defend Myself Womens Strategies for Coping With Harassment While Gaming Online. Games and Culture, 12(2), 136-155.](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; Although video game audiences have greatly diversified over recent years, players who are not the stereotypical straight, White, male gamer are still frequently viewed as outsiders to online gaming and face harassment because of this status. However, many choose to play games despite this and have developed specific coping strategies they employ to avoid or respond to harassment. Using grounded theory and in-depth interviews with female gamers, this gender-based case study explores womens strategies for coping with online game-related harassment. It shows that women are first and foremost an active audience, carefully managing their media environment to help ensure positive experiences. At the same time, their strategies come with limitations, such as hiding their contributions to gaming or provoking further harassment. Although women are capable media managers, their continued status as outsiders deeply affects their gaming experiences and demonstrates a need for cultural change in online environments. [Cotler, J. L., Fryling, M., &amp; Rivituso, J. (2017). Causes of cyberbullying in multi-player online gaming environments: Gamer perceptions. Journal of Information Systems Applied Research, 10(1), 4.](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; Cyberbullying has received much attention in recent years due to a variety of resulting tragic events, including cyberbully victim suicides. However, research on cyberbullying in online gaming environments is relatively new and limited. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on young adolescents, leaving research gaps for analyzing cyberbullying among older gamers. This is particularly important since it is estimated that 68% of gamers are 18 years of age or older. Finally, causes of aggressive behavior, such as cyberbullying, are still unclear and cannot simply be linked to violent video games. Therefore, in order to develop strategies to mitigate cyberbullying in online gaming environments, we need to better understand what the biggest causes of cyberbullying are in this environment. This exploratory research investigates gamer perceptions regarding the causes of cyberbullying in online multi-player gaming environments. A survey was developed for this study and 936 respondents answered several open ended questions related to causes of cyberbullying in gaming environments. Content analysis of these questions revealed that gamers perceive the biggest causes are: anonymity, the cyberbully not seeing the real life effects of their behaviors, and no fear of punishment. ----- **Solution-Diagnosis (and/or ""what a more supportive/inclusive community looks like"") - tend to be a little less quantitative survey-focused, and more in-depth exploration of individual communities.

Identity and Leadership in Virtual Communities: Establishing Credibility and Influence: Establishing Credibility and Influence, 170.](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; Scholars have highlighted the learning opportunities afforded by online gaming communities of practice, which include providing authentic and meaningful contexts for engaging in and learning 21st century skills and digital literacies. However, lesser attention has been paid to how these environments can be inequitable in including and supporting members across gender. This chapter highlights the importance of gender supportive online gaming communities and their role in increasing the visibility of and resiliency necessary for equitable online play and learning. The history of a gender-supportive community and its structures are explored. The chapter further provides recommendations for educators, based on the social structures of this gender-supportive community and related research on educational climates and equitable learning.

In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (pp. 451-458).](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; Online digital gaming environments have been proposed as an important form of computer-supported collaborative learning, but these environments have been shown to marginalize some learners, most notably women or girls, as well as ethnic or racial minorities. Furthermore, game-based competencies and identities have been shown to be important for digitally-mediated learning activities and trajectories in computer science and technology. In this paper we look at how supportive communities can improve resilience by mitigating stereotype threat, and thereby helping to protect vulnerable groups from the negative effects of implicit and explicit bias in gaming culture and game-based learning activities. Our findings demonstrate that a female-supportive gaming community can foster equitable gaming identification and self-concept, and we propose that similar models can be used with other marginalized groups (i.e., ethnic/racial minorities).

Specifically, this study explores the experiences of gamers in gaming clans, both explicitly gender supportive and not, to see if they can serve as protective spaces for vulnerable players. Ultimately, the goal is to inform the design of equitable gaming environments. ----- **The Theory-building plus evidence Book** [Gray, K. L. (2014). Race, gender, and deviance in Xbox live: Theoretical perspectives from the virtual margins. Routledge.](URL Summary from Abstract (Book Blurb): &gt; Race, Gender, and Deviance in Xbox Live provides a much-needed theoretical framework for examining deviant behavior and deviant bodies within one of the largest virtual gaming communitiesXbox Live. Previous research on video games has focused mostly on violence and examining violent behavior resulting from consuming this medium. This limited scope has skewed criminologists' understanding of video games and video game culture. Xbox Live has proven to be more than just a gaming platform for users. It has evolved into a multimedia entertainment outlet for more than 20 million users. This book examines the nature of social interactions within Xbox Live, which are often riddled with deviant behavior, including but not limited to racism and sexism. The text situates video games within a hegemonic framework deploying whiteness and masculinity as the norm. The experiences of the marginalized bodies are situated within the framework of deviance as they fail to conform to the hegemonic norm and become victims of racism, sexism, and other types of harassment. The book also has a summary article: [Gray, K. L. (2012). Deviant bodies, stigmatized identities, and racist acts: Examining the experiences of African-American gamers in Xbox Live. New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia, 18(4), 261-276.](URL Summary from Abstract: &gt; The purpose of this article is to illustrate how minority gamers, particularly African-American males, are subject to the label of deviant within the virtual gaming community of Xbox Live. They are labeled deviant based on the stigma of their physical identity  blackness, through a process of linguistic profiling. By employing virtual ethnography, the author identifies a process that leads to racism based on how the black gamer sounds within the space. The act of racism emerges through a process involving questioning, provoking, instigating, and ultimately racism. Many black gamers have normalized these racist experiences and have accepted the label of deviant placed upon their bodies. "

If you are attacking a single target, and that target is moving or will be moving, there is literally no reason to use siege mode, stay mobile and stutter step in tank mode. The majority of Sgt. Hammer players I see in QM (at diamond MMR still) absolutely insist on being permanently in siege mode even if they are against a team consisting of Li-Ming, Chromie and Nazeebo. If you are going to lose 75% of your hp by pressing E, don't press E. The only reason I can think of that leads people to trade 75% of their hp or their life for two auto attacks before they unsiege, is that they believe siege mode does more damage than tank mode. It doesn't. I play a fair bit of Hammer, being lvl 25. I spend probably close to 90% of the game in tank mode. I almost never siege pre 16, until that point, Hammer should be played essentially as a squishier Raynor with insane chase with Z and the added bonus of being able to siege structures if left alone in lane. The chase potential with Z however is completely wasted if you are using it every time to quickly unsiege to avoid getting killed. Siege mode completely removes your capacity to chase or flee and should be used sparingly or else you are severely hampering your effectiveness and forcing your healer to dedicate most of their efforts healing damage that could have easily been avoided by not rooting yourself to the ground at every opportunity. Press E only when it is safe to do so and I can guarantee you your games with Hammer will go better. **Edit: Forgot to mention siege mode does increase siege damage against minions and structures, but that is not worth trading massive chunks of HP or your life to deal that extra damage.**"
42,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Death by dwarf volleyball meta incoming.,10,75fbsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/75fbsx/death_by_dwarf_volleyball_meta_incoming/,2017-10-10 17:49:20,"As a Muradin main/fanatic since time in the Nexus began, I'm pretty hyped about these changes. He was already in a pretty decent spot, being a solid, well-rounded tank. While he's been pushed off his long-held Tank God throne by a variety of nerftrains and the introduction (and re-emergence) of other tanks into the meta, I think there's a good chance these upcoming changes will toss him to top tier once again. After taking an in-depth look at the patch notes, I think overall Blizzard did a great job at strengthening his strengths (high mobility, cc, brawling potential), and in compensation, taking away from some of his weaker points (waveclear, finishing damage). His in-combat sustain was also nerfed (with the removal of Iron-forged Momentum, he can no longer get off as many W's to heal himself during fights). However, I do think the additional cc he's received will make up for those losses in his role as a main Tank. Making Piercing Bolt as part of a baseline quest on Q is a really powerful change. It can now be used in tandem with the other level 7 talents, *and* it's got a stronger (individual) version of Iron-forged baked in, allowing Muradin to deal an insane amount of cc. This alone makes him a stronger Tank. Add this to Heavy Impact at level 7. LEVEL. SEVEN. Muradin was already a really strong Tank once he got the talent at 16, and for him to get this talent along with the Stormbolt changes so early in the game is going to make him a huge threat for most of the game, whereas one of his weaker aspects currently is his lack of cc (and impact in fights) before 13/16. He's going to be a monster during ganks, and he's going to be able to turn teamfights around much earlier in the game. *Hell, a while back I posted a thread suggesting they either make HI baseline or move it to an early-game tier to up his early-game impact, and they actually did it. They actually fookin' did it.* I do like that they moved Give 'em the Axe to 7 as well, but since his baseline aa damage received a nerf, along with a nerf to the talent itself, I really do think Heavy Impact is the go-to talent. It's simply too powerful to give up (as it already is in the current state of things). However, GetA can make for some all-in Muradin damage bruiser builds, which is another thing I like about this update, as it increases his build and playstyle diversity quite a bit. The new level 13 talent is really interesting as well, however I still think Healing Static will be the go-to talent (unless you're building purely for damage and you wish to go Stoneform at 16). Perhaps it'll make for some interesting hybrid builds or pure damage builds. Or maybe it'll become the go-to talent with the pretty decent amount of aoe it brings in fights, who knows. 16 is where things get insane. Muradin is now able to take Dwarf Launch, increasing the mobility provided by E to an amazing amount, **in tandem with the Heavy Impact stun**. It also lowers the cd by 3 seconds. This means, at 16, Muradin becomes a literal incarnation of a volleyball of death, allowing him to make plays and chain cc from halfway across the screen. He's also going to be able to literally leap away from anything unless he's stunned (again, upping his mobility/playmaking strengths, while keeping his vulnerability to cc in this regard). Finally, I really like the lvl 20 Avatar changes. The added Armor and the cdrs will probably make this talent a contender against Hardened Shield, allowing him to jump into any fight and keep fighting. Considering he can now double-stun with Q *and* on E (and then heal himself with W procs) on the even more insane cdrs provided by the talent's passive, his lvl 20 is going to be quite the sight to see. With so many high-impact Tanks now in the meta (e.g., Garrosh, ETC, Anub), I daresay we will be seeing alot more of the cannonballing, ale-guzzling, hammer-throwing, *fookin' legend* Bronzebeard. Blizzcon HYPE. [Edit: Apologies, it seems the Dwarf Launch cdr does *not stack per Hero*. You only get a 3s cdr, which is still a great improvement to his mobility]."
43,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Chen is Unplayable Now,224,6yiite,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6yiite/chen_is_unplayable_now/,2017-09-07 07:05:32,"The devs took a big, smelly, diarrhea shit right in Chen's brew keg. Between the nerf to his health and the reworks to jaina/leo. Chen is possibly the worst character in the game, and absolutely the worst warrior. All his builds are weak, one-dimensional, and don't even work effectively against what they're supposed to counter. He can't drink though damage or get to the back line, or really do much of anything anymore. Regen quest takes too long and doesn't compensate for his vulnerability to stun/burst. Damage quests don't do enough damage. Shield build forces you to stand in place and eat stuns, or simply take more damage than you can drink through. Elusive/RoF build only works against heavy AA comp and gets shut down by anything else. It is insane that they nerfed a hero with such a low pick-rate. Soon pandas will go from endangered to extinct. (This is just a rant to blow off steam, but if anyone wants to argue w/ me, or post suggestions on how to make Chen less shitty, or wants me to break down why Chen is bad, please comment.)"

The old art of Muradin on the end screen fro WC3 coming to life and an idea of Wildhammer Falstad after having a blast questing in Twillight Highlands in WoW really draw me into the game. Of course of the years critisism towards hots that talent system is flawed and items are superior in every way, poor kit desigs, non-existant macro play and most importantly low skill mechanical skill requirements made me to check out LoL and Smite. *Characters that have simple kits yet depth to it are rarity.* The thing I like most about games is exploring it from design perspective. Every character/rework I judge from perspective what developers tried to achieve, what lost what is gained and do changes condradict/support the goals of rework. Art, animations, voice, cohesive kit I care little for numbers tuning, high elo viability I am low Plastic League player that that has almost no relevance in my swamp but does not mean I can not reconise pattern, combos or get embarrassed and curse myslef if I make mistakes or bad play. I was very surprised that Smite has more characters I felt interested to try out than LoL. Agni, Nox, Anhur, Odin, Rama, Artemis, Thor, Ares, Anubis, Ymir. The thing I notice that heroes I enjoy the most are easy to play/execute. The main reason being they are **FAIR** to play and play against. If properly tuned they rarely require a specific kit to counter just proper positioning, timings. The reason I developed deep hatred towards summoner spells especially highly praised Flash same as our Blink. You was out of position you should have died yet you eliminated that mistake by a push of a button. Why there is an ability in the game that has 100% pickrate in pro scene is it healthy game design? *More tools for players and heroes promotes comp diversity or maybe it is other way around?* But insatible hunger to be special snowflake and have ""carries"" big risk big pay-up characters forces developers to shell out more overloaded kits with convoluted abilities. Trying to please the mob we are introduced heroes that have group crowdcontrol, high mobility, flexible defensives or outright damage, kill denials. People praise Invoker to the havens but everytime I see him in proplay I keep asking myself should one person have that much influence in the game? He can crowd control whole enemy team, zone control, get summons, go invisible, drain mana, call down meteors to damage whole team. Every pro on youtube and Blizzard interview praised Kelthuzad Pillar instead criticizing that it eliminates his weakness of 1v1 in the open not like his chains have small range or slow speed. But it is ""playmaker"" hots lacks so much cries the community/pro scene. And makes him easier to play. The tools avaliable to those characters hurt the identity of the game where each hero a fair share of influence on the game outcome now it is being skewed by ""playmakers"" demand. If game is in transition phase where such characters just being introduced older characters start to feel underpowered compared to new shiny toys. And whenever they get rework playerbase still cries unsatisfied even calling tyrande as more niche and less utility!! Community refusal to understand that characters not always need equal power distribution between abilities forces developers to buffs and if line is crossed heroes transcend their initial niche. Owl is just a decent poke with unlimited range and good vision spell yet community created the sniper Tyrande. Constant whines about underperformed Dehaka Agility talent buffed to the point that it eliminated his weakness of rotations between bushstalker cooldown. The ongoing complains about Chen stun vulnerability may make him completely oppressive as backliner diver if that weakness to be reduced. Also the complexity of certain mobas comes from simple base animation delays and spellcasts. Characters just bring variation and adjustment to it. In DOTA 2 good chunk of the characters have a passive or steroid in their kit. If Blizzard would introduce Sven, Tiny or Wraith King with their kits the outcry would be enourmous. Blizzard is lazy. WTF!? two steroid and a passive, a SINGLE castable ability. Are you out of your mind Blizz!! Even Earthshaker a resident visitor of highlight clips has a steroid and passive, Thralls Sundering big brother as core ability and a nuke centered around him. The truth is most of kits in dota are absolute bore from design perspective. If Blizzard would implement more severe animation canceling HotS would easily become hardest moba in the industry. Maybe that is the key of DOTA diversity success - heroes **lacking tools** within their kits? You need to itemize and build comps. And not pick Genji and you have easiest backline deletion, pick Malfurion, ETC easy group shut down, get KTZ easy waveclear, lanewide zoning, unlimited range nuke, self-sufficent cc setup. *The fallacy of ""hype""*. I dont watch pro plays from perspective of bronze player but a spectator who expects teams to have mastery over complex characters. But I can't bring myself despite the caster efforts be excited for LeBlanc, Fizz, Genji blowups and espcapes especially knowing that those character suppose to do that, They have the tools for it. I will be far more impressed by Raynor knocking Genji during his dash than DragonBlade cleaves. It is making things happen with limited resources what really impresses me and not abusing Flash noodling for doubling knockup area. But even artificail tag of complexity is not enough since it is purely a personal perception. There will be plenty of posts ""Blizzard stop making those braindead one trick ponies like Kelthuzad, Medivh, Garrosh, Genji, Chromie, Tassadar, Dva, Tracer....Nova, Tyrande, insert your personal hatred"". Once hard kits are mastered they become ""easy"" and completely opressive and frustrating to face. Maybe the game health and community attitude would have been in far better place if we would get more Raynors, Jainas, Arthas and less ""moah playmakers"" Blizzard. Simple strength, simple weakness. Get your basics right get your wins."
45,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Subjective list of ultimates that could be updated or reworked,4,6zne6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6zne6t/subjective_list_of_ultimates_that_could_be/,2017-09-13 00:44:44,"So there's a [post](URL about the worst ultimate in the game but what could be done to improve some of them ? Below i'll make list of heroics that **in my opinion** should be at least updated. * **Falstad** &gt; Hinterland Blast &gt;100 Mana Cooldown: 120 seconds &gt;After 1 second, deal 475 (+4.75% per level) damage to enemies within a long line. The cooldown is reduced by 25 seconds for every enemy Hero hit. I think that it isn't that bad but many people think that 120s cd is too much and gust provides more strategic value. Personally i like this one as it is because it rewards you for positioning and patience. On the other hand i saw a lot of players picking Mighty Gust and never using it (mostly in qm - i guess they wait for that boss steal so they can upload their replay on youtube) so maybe both initial cd and reduction per hit could be lowered for Hinterland Blast. Or cooldown reduction could be bigger for killing blows so sniping 1 person doesn't leave you with 100s until you can use it again. * **Nova** &gt;Triple Tap &gt;100 Mana Cooldown: 100 seconds &gt;Locks in on the target Hero, then fires 3 shots that hit the first Hero or Structure they come in contact with for 741 (352 + 4% per level) damage each. Please remove this from the game. I don't hate it, i hate players that decide to pick it. Seriously tho, Precision Strike is so much better that i'm shocked, amazed and scared at the same time when someone picks Triple Tap. Nova is a ghost so maybe it could be replaced with something with more psionic theme. Maybe something granting vision and giving a passive bonus to holo decoys to provide more flexibility in builds. But it's more of an option for hero remake than simply changing her heroic ability. * **Samuro** Honestly i didn't play him long enough to suggest something reasonable but i think he could use some love from developers. Topic open for suggestions. * **Gul'dan** &gt;Rain of Destruction &gt;90 Mana Cooldown: 100 seconds &gt;Channel to summon a rain of meteors in an area for 7 seconds. Each meteor deals 165 (+4% per level) damage in a small area. An obvious one. Mentioned multiple times and probably (hopefully) is on Blizzard's list of things to change. It's like a big, glowing sign **KILL ME** for enemies. RNG of the damage from it doesn't compensate for vulnerability. It's just plain bad ability. Some people suggested to make it similar to Kael's Phoenix by lowering area of effect and giving it guaranteed damage source. Another suggestion is to leave it as channeled ability but give it tracking similar to Purifier Beam (&gt;Target an enemy Hero with an orbital beam from the Spear of Adun, dealing 184 (+4% per level) damage per second for 8 seconds. The beam will chase the target as they move) Evertyhing that involves changing it's current status seems like a good idea. * **Kael'thas** &gt;Phoenix &gt;80 Mana Cooldown: 60 seconds &gt;Launch a Phoenix to an area, dealing 78 (+4% per level) damage to enemies along the way. The Phoenix persists for 7 seconds, attacking enemies for 78 (+4% per level) damage and splashing for 50%. I have nothing about this heroic but it's level 20 option could be a little bit different. While longer duration and ability to move it seems good enough it doesn't compete with other lvl 20 options. Maybe to fit into fantasy it could tranform into egg (similar to Kerrigan's Ultralisk) after initial duration. Phoenix would be reborn if the egg wasn't killed and shortly after rebirth it could be moved within a short range. It should have limited amount of reincarnations and if it's reborn for couple of times maybe it could disappear and the next one would be empowered (so enemies would actually want to kill instead of ignoring it) * **Kerrigan** Similar situation to Samuro. She could use overall rework tho. Open for suggestions. * **Raynor** On the same boat with Kerrigan (   ) * **Zeratul** &gt;Shadow Assault &gt;50 Mana Cooldown: 45 seconds &gt;Your Basic Attacks cause you to charge at enemies and have 20% increased Attack Speed. Lasts for 6 seconds. Void Prison is just too good. I doubt there will ever be an option to pick something over it but maybe replace it with *just for fun* option for QM. I don't have any ideas because i'm a Void Prison fanboy and it's imo the best heroic ability in the game. That's my opinion for some assasin's but i didn't want to make this thread too big so i'll make more if people will like this one. Again **this is my opinion** so i encourage you all to make both positive and negative comments about my observations. "
46,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Mei Concept (Overwatch Warrior),2,6oq9ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6oq9ol/mei_concept_overwatch_warrior/,2017-07-22 05:35:55,"*Hey, guys. I was brainstorming a Mei conversion kit and here's what I put together. I mostly try to stay as creative as I can in my hero concepts and while I do try to take balance into account I prioritize mechanics that I think are fun/interesting.* **DESIGN OBJECTIVES** - Make Mei a powerful duelist in solo situations. In this incarnation the bulk of her power is shifted towards defeating autoattackers while allowing mages a lot more wiggle room, which in turn synergizes with her vulnerability to burst damage. - Find a balance between powerful CC and counterplay. - - Provide a wealth of talent options for a variety of possible builds that can mix-and-match or seek power through talent synergy. - Differentiate Ice Wall from Force Wall. **NOTES** Mei is a Warrior hero who is difficult to fight in a 1v1 scenario and in teamfights draws fire by providing strong lockdown and disruption. While lacking the base stats of other Warriors, Mei has abilities that can extend her durability and a variety of talent options that can help her survive, deal damage, and/or bring additional CC to the fight. **ABILITIES** - D: *Endothermic Blaster*. Meis autoattacks have a range of 3.5 and affect all enemies between herself and the target in a thin area of effect. Autoattacks are very low damage but tick constantly. Each autoattack instance and damaging ability Mei uses applies a stack of Frost. The first stack reduces affected targets attack and movement speeds by 30%, with each subsequent stack of Frost increasing this by 10%. 4 seconds worth of Frost stacks to 100% slow. Stacks decay rapidly when not being refreshed, taking 1.5 seconds to go from maximum slow to zero. Does not affect structures. Mei can autoattack while moving. *Note: I believe this trait does not work if she cannot constantly apply it while moving, which is the only reason she has mobile autoattacks.* - Q: *Icicle* - 4 second cooldown. Short range, narrow skillshot that deals minor damage to the first enemy unit or structure hit. Can be charged for up to two seconds to double the range and damage. - W: *Cryo-freeze* - 12 second cooldown. Mei goes into stasis for up to 5 seconds or until cancelled. During stasis she heals 15% of her max HP per second. The block of ice can be damaged and destroyed to end the effect early. The ice block has low HP but is ignored by AI-controlled non-hero units. - E: *Ice Wall* - 10 second cooldown. Places an unpathable wall along a line for 4 seconds that blocks skillshots. The wall is composed of three individual, low-HP components that take full damage from autoattacks and abilities. Moreover they are coded as summons and so are prioritized by structures. Pressing the ability button again will remove the wall. - R1: *Blizzard* - 60 second cooldown. Medium-range skillshot with adjustable range. Launches a drone that begins to spread Frost in an area while dealing low damage at a rate identical to Meis autoattacks. Lasts 5 seconds. - R2: *Avalanche* - 90 second cooldown. Mei channels for up to 5 seconds, producing a wave of snow that knocks affected enemies back until the ability ends. The abilitys pathing is blocked by terrain and structures. Damage is taken when first hit by the ability and every .5 seconds while colliding with terrain or a structure. The avalanche follows Meis cursor direction but moves and rotates very slowly. Small AoE and deals low damage but with each enemy trapped in the avalanche the size, speed and damage increase indefinitely. Double-damage to structures. **TALENTS** *Level 1* - Blast-proof (W) - Meis ice block gains 40% extra HP but maximum duration reduced by 1 second. - Constant Stasis (W) - QUEST TALENT. Gathering Regen Globes increases your health regeneration by 1 per second, up to 30. Gathering 30 regen globes reduces Cryo-freeze cooldown to 8 seconds. - Hazard Suit (Passive) - Mei becomes permanently Unstoppable at the cost of 50% max HP. - Adaptable (Passive) - Taking ability damage gives Mei 15% spell armour for the next three seconds. Stacks thrice, each stack decaying individually. *Level 4* - Cold Snap (Q) - Icicle damage increased by 40% and cooldown reduced to 3 seconds but can no longer be charged for more damage or range. - Frostbite (Q) - Icicles reduce enemy armour by 30% for 1.5 seconds. - Brittle Ammo (Q) - Upon impact Icicle splits into pieces that hit the three closest enemies in an AoE for 30% damage. AoE is small but increases with charge, potentially doubling. Does not prioritize heroes. - Ice-cannon (NEW ACTIVE ABILITY ) (Q) - QUEST TALENT. 5 second cooldown. Replaces Icicle with the new ability Ice-cannon. Mei damages and applies Frost to all enemies in a short cone in front of her. Ability can charged for up to 1.5 seconds to increase AoE and damage by 60%. At 30 enemies hit mana cost is halved. At 45 enemies hit cooldown reduced to 4 seconds. At 60 enemies hit Ice-cannon leaves ice shards on the AoE for two seconds that apply stacks of Frost. At 120 enemies hit Meis basic attack AoE doubles. Choosing Ice-cannon permanently locks out future Icicle talents. *Level 7* - Heavy Snows (D) - While auto-attacking Mei builds Frost 30% faster but moves 20% slower. - Icy Winds (Q) - Icicle leaves a trail for 2 seconds that applies Frost and gives Mei a 20% movement speed boost while on the trail. - Cold Front (E) - Ice Wall applies a tick of Frost every .5 seconds in a small AoE around each part of the wall over the duration. - Local Weather (Passive) - Mei generates Frost around her in melee range. *Level 13* - Snow-blindness: Icicle blinds affected heroes for 2 seconds. Non-hero units are blinded for 8 seconds. - Thermal Transference (D) - Mei heals 1% of her max HP for every tick of Frost applied to enemies, from all sources. - Insulation (W) - Mei gains a shield worth 15% of her Max HP. Only refreshes at spawn and after using Cryo-freeze. - Survivalist (Passive) - 40 second cooldown. When Meis health is reduced to 15% all her basic ability cooldowns are refreshed. *Level 16* - Harpoon (Q) - At any time before the cooldown refreshes Mei can hold down the ability button to slowly drag the target enemy toward her position. Maximum duration of 4 seconds. Target is able to attack and cast spells but cannot move and is immune to all other forms of displacement. Cooldown timer is reset at the end of the duration. - Busting Out (W) - When Cryo-freeze ends (cancelled, destroyed or timed-out) Mei damages and applies Frost in an AoE. - The Big Melt (E) - Expiring Ice Walls (cancelled, destroyed or timed-out) leave behind pools of water that last for 4 seconds and increase enemy team basic ability cooldowns by 1 per second. - Sub-zero Conditions (D) - Stacks of Frost increase Meis basic attack damage against the target by 5%, to a maximum of 150% attack damage. *Level 20* - Ice Rink (R1): Blizzard allows Mei maximum movement speed in the area, decaying over 1.5 seconds after she leaves the AoE or the ability ends. - Glacial (R2): Avalanche is no longer a channeled ability. The ability lasts for 8 seconds, has double the starting width and deals 50% more damage (initial damage, per-unit damage and collision damage). However the ability moves half as fast, receives half the speed increments and its path can no longer be controlled over the duration. - Climatologists (NEW ACTIVE ABILITY): 20 second cooldown. For 6 seconds Mei gives a target ally the ability to apply Frost on their basic attacks. Relevant talents will affect Mei but not the ally (e.g. the ally will not receive any of Heavy Snows effects but their attacks will heal Mei through Thermal Transference.) - Death By Exposure (Q): Icicle Marks affected units. While Icicle is on cooldown Marked enemies lose 3% of their current HP per second. - Heat Death (D) - When a target receives maximum Frost stacks they will take heavy burst damage. - Let it Snow (Passive) - QUEST TALENT. If Mei has stacked Frost 800 times throughout the game she will slow all enemies by 15% in a large AoE that persists after her death and until she respawns."
47,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Some ideas for Raynor.,5,6po91c,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6po91c/some_ideas_for_raynor/,2017-07-27 00:05:21,"*I like Raynor and his simple playstyle, I tried here to make him a bit more diverse and fun.* **Q - [Penetrating Round]** Unchanged **W - [Inspire]** Unchanged *(Commentary: Both of the skills are pretty decent and I don't think they need some baseline buffs.)* **E - [Adrenaline Rush]** Passive: Automatically activates when below 35% HP, you gain bonus 250 health regen per second, armor +25%, movement speed +30% for 4 seconds. This effect has 35 sec CD. *(Commentary: I really like idea of passive activating of adrenaline rush, I think it add some uniquness to his playstyle, when you need to balance on the edge. I tried to make it more fitting SC marine style and somewhat similar to The Butcher's Enrage, I think it is very interesting mechanic of last stand.)* **D - [Advanced Optics]** Passive: +1 attack range and +5 vision radius. * ![Quest:] Every Minion killed near you grants 0.20 Attack Damage, and Takedowns grant 0.50 Attack Damage. * ![Reward:] Upon gaining 20 bonus Attack Damage, you can also activate Advanced Optics to increase your Attack Attack range by 30% for 3 seconds. 60 second cooldown. * ![Reward:] Upon gaining 40 bonus Attack Damage, you can also activate Advanced Optics to increase your Attack Speed by 30% for 3 seconds. 60 second cooldown. *(Commentary: Seasoned Marksman is the core of the Raynor's playstyle, without it he is very weak and useless, he needs to be able deal a lot of frontloaded Basic Attack damage, otherwise he is overshadowed by other AA damage dealers, this is why I made SM baseline, somewhat same as The Butcher's meat stacking and after completing quest you gain some fun bonuses and can keep stack it, same as old SM, a good old late game monster Jimmy.)* **TALENTS** **Level 1** * **Give me more [E]** - Adrenaline Rush heals for 30% more and give additional 15% movement speed. * **Scouting Drone [Active]** - Places a Scouting Drone at target location, granting vision and revealing a large area around it for 30 seconds. This drone cannot be hidden and is killed by enemies with 2 Basic Attacks. Raynor's Basic Attacks against heroes reduce cooldown by 0.5 sec. Stores up to 2 charges. Cooldown: 45 seconds. *(Commentary: I made small changes to make it more fun.)* * **Confident Aim [Q]** - Lowers the cooldown of Penetrating Round by 2 seconds for each hero hit. * ![Quest:] Hit enemy heroes with Penetrating Round. * ![Reward:] After hitting 20 heroes, Penetrating Round CD reduced by 4 seconds. * ![Reward:] After hitting 40 heroes, Penetraiting Round gains second charge and its mana cost reduced by 50%. *(Commentary: I replaced and merged some Q talents to make Q build more fun and viable.)* * **Fight or Flight [E]** - Adrenaline Rush can be manually activated, its duration increased by 1 sec, but its cooldown is increased by 20 seconds. Passive: Adrenalne Rush doesn't activate automatically anymore. *(Commentary: An option for those who doesn't like automatic activation of AR, since I changed baseline version, I think it would have been too strong, if you would be able to activate it manually without any drawback, so I added CD increase.)* **Level 4** * **Focused fire** - Every 3rd consecutive Basic Attack against the same target deals 50% more damage. *(Commentary: Raynor's version of Focused Attack, the old talent was strong and almost always mandatory pick, with overall talent changes I think he will have more talent diversity and will not lost any power, values can be changed for balance for sure.)* * **Vigorous Inspire [W]** - While Inspire is active your Basic Attacks heal for 25% of the damage dealt. *(Commentary: An option for healing, that can have synergy with later talents to make a build with more sustain for QM or when someone refuses to pick healer.)* * **Relentless Leader** - Being Stunned or Rooted knocks away nearby enemies and slow them by 30% for 2 seconds. This effect has a 8 seconds cooldown. *(Commentary: Almost unchanged talent, but with a small additon.)* **Level 7** * **Hamstring Shot [Q]** - Enemies hit by Penetrating Round have a 25% Movement Speed slow for 3 seconds and take X for every 1 in-game range unit (this measure equal of attack range units) they travel. *(Commentary: I tried to make a good option to counter these pesky high mobile heroes, I think we need more options like this at different heroes)* * **Revolution Overdrive [W]** - Passive: Gain 10% Movement Speed while affected by Inspire. Increase this bonus by 5% for each allied Hero nearby when Inspire is cast. This effect doesn't stack with Adrenaline Rush. * [!Quest:] Buff Heroes with Inspire. * [!Reward:] After buffing 50 Heroes, Allied Heroes affected by Inspire also gain 15% movement speed for a half of your Inspire duration. *(Commentary: A good old talent with some sweet bonus to compete with other talents in the tier.)* * **Puttin' On a Clinic** - Whenever an enemy Minion Raynor has recently damaged is destroyed, his Ability cooldowns are reduced by 1.5 seconds. * [!Quest:] Destroy minions. * [!Reward:] After destroying 75 minions, Basic Attacks reduce cooldowns of Basic Abilites by 0.5 sec. * [!Reward:] After destroying 150 minions, Basic Attacks reduce cooldowns of Heroic Abilites by 0.5sec. *(Commentary: A version of battle momentum with Raynor's spices.)* **Level 10** * **Hyperion** - Order the Hyperion to make a strafing run dealing X damage a second, hitting up to 5 enemies, prioritises Heroes. Also occasionally fires its Yamato Cannon on Structures for X damage. Lasts 12 seconds. *(Commentary: Amount of targets upped to 5 and it prioritises heroes over anything now.)* * **Raynor Raiders** - Summon two Stealthed Banshees that attack an enemy. Each Banshee deals X damage a second and lasts 22 seconds. Can reactivate the Ability to retarget the Banshees. Banshees have 50% Spell Armor. *(Commentary: Added spell armor to make them not die from any random spit, from any mage,instantly.)* **Level 13** * **Anti-Giant Shells [Active]** - Activate to make your Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes deal bonus damage equal to 2% of the Hero's maximum Health for 6 seconds. Cooldown 30 seconds. *(Commentary: Raynor's version of Giant Killer, it is hard to value the numbers, it needs in-game testing, but I think this variant is more fun than the old passive talent.)* * **Grenade Launcher [Q]** - Penetrating Round deals bonus damage equal of 8% of the Hero's maximum health to the first enemy hit by it. Passive: Penetrating Round Range increased by 20%. *(Commentary: One more option to kill high health targets or to just gain more damage on your Q build and provide, more options are always good.)* * **Steel Resolve [W]** - Increases Inspire's duration and range by 50% and causes Adrenaline Rush to also apply Inspire. *(Commentary: Almost uncganged, I think it is good as is, and have a good synergy with new Inspire talents, added range increase, to make it easier to gain value from Inspire.)* **Level 16** * **Hollow-point bullets** - Basic Attacks against slowed, silenced, rooted or stunned heroes deals 15% more damage and reduce target's physical armor by 10% for 2 seconds. *(Commentary: Executioner, with bonus Vulnerability inside.)* * **Cluster Round [Q]** - Penetrating Round damage is increased by 25% for each additional target hit up to 125%, and the width is increased by 50%. Passive: Penetrating Round deals 50% more damage to enemies in melee range. *(Commentary: Shotgun style Q. You want a piece of me, boy? I will take a piece of you, too. A good option for waveclear and to punish divers.)* * **Bullseye [Q]** - Unchanged **Level 20** * **Scorched Earth [R]** - An additional set of lasers blast the ground X times per second, dealing X damage in an area and leaves a trail of fire on the Hyperiong path. *(Commentary: Zoning and damage, do you need more? With changed Hyperion it is even better.)* * **Dusk Wings [R]** - Banshees remain Stealthed while attacking and fire 50% more frequently and gain 50% Physical armor. *(Commentary: Added Physical Armor to make them more survivable, maybe it is too OP, need more testing, but amount of armor can be reduced.)* * **A Card to Play** - Whenever a Hero (ally or enemy) is killed, the cooldown of Raynor's Heroic Ability is reduced by 25 seconds. *(Commentary: Increased from 15 to 25 seconds, a good synergy with Murky and Leorky :) )* * **Bayonet charge [Active]** - Raynor perform a short dash forward deals 300% of the Basic Attack damage to the first target hit and enter close-quarter combat, his Basic Attacks become melee range and deal 100% more damage. Duration 10 seconds. Cooldown 1 min. *(Commentary: He has the bayonet, but he never uses it, this is an option for risky plays, it's synergize with AA talents and with survivability talents. YOLO Option I think it fits Raynor, even tho some skins do not have a Bayonet, they can use butt of the rifle to attack.)* ***Thank you for reading!*** "
48,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Would changing Raynor Trait to Ignore Physical Armor give him a solid niche over other AA Assassins?,85,6qcd09,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6qcd09/would_changing_raynor_trait_to_ignore_physical/,2017-07-30 03:52:43,"**TL:DR** Basically the Title. With Garrosh kicking at our Door with his Armor Trait and the power of Uther as a Support I started thinking on what is the best counter play to Armor. * Hp% Dmg with Heroes Like Tychus, Malthael, Leoric and all the Giant killers. * Decreasing the Armor with Heroes like Tyrande, CS Varian, Nova and some others. * Ignoring Armor that only Cassia has, but as a LV 20 Talent that could be to late to change the Game. And this got me to think about Raynor, and that the only time I see him as a Good Assassins was when Hyperion was bugged, it also dont help that most think that Raynor is a worse Hammer. Armor is probably something that the new players have a hard time grasping in the game right now and hopefully the Icon change that is coming will help with that, but I really would like a Armor Tuturial and having this Trait at Jimmy could help with both the tutorial and the new players dealing with the Physical Armor Heroes. So more knowledgeable folks of Reddit, what would you think of Raynor with a Armor Ignoring Trait, would that give him a Spot among the top tier Assassins or at least a Niche? **EDIT:** I should have said that it Ignores any Armor above 0, or else he would not benefit from a ally that have Vulnerability like Tyrande."

50,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,The armor indicators issue and one way to go about it,4,6r337i,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6r337i/the_armor_indicators_issue_and_one_way_to_go/,2017-08-02 19:42:52,"#About Armor First of all, this needs to be clarified: There are two and only two types of armor in Heroes of the Storm: Physical armor and Spell armor. The highest amount of either type of armor a hero can have at any given time is +75 and the lowest is -25 (references later). **Armor (aka ""True"" armor), as a type, does not exist**. An effect that grants the same amount of physical and spell armor at the same time (the so called 'Armor' aka 'true armor') **is not a type of armor, it's a term**. For the sake of tooltips and whatnot, Blizzard coined the *term* ""Armor"" for an easier way to identify when an effect changes said hero's *physical and spell armors in the same amounts at the same time*. Remember this: `each and every instance of damage is either physical or spell damage, there's no in-between or combination`. *Sigh of relief* #The issue On the current PTR, the new armor indicator does not indicate any amounts type specific armor, it only indicates when a hero receives an effect that changes *the same amount of the two armors* of a given hero. I hope by now you've realized this is a little messed up. The vast majority of armor effects in the game are type specific (Johanna, Arthas, Anubarak, Tyrael, Cassia, all block talents, all spell shield talents, and many many other effects, ranging from hero baseline armor, hero abilities and talents). There is also a number of effects that do change a hero's physical and spell armors in the same amounts at the same time - mainly the previously called resistant effects (Uther, Safeguard, hardened shields, etc) and vulnerability effects (Tyrande's mark, Crippling Shot, Cold Embrace, etc) - but these do not constitute an armor type. With that in mind, I realized *if it is necessary to know the exact amount of the armors, in numbers, of any and every hero at any given time* than the current PTR armor indicator is flawed and has to see changes. Note that I wrote ""if it's necessary"" because this is a matter of opinion for many people. Some folks will not consider knowing a hero's armor in numbers important while others will judge it fundamental. Below I will present a suggestion that **assumes** the majority of Heroes players believe the following: ""Armor values should be represented in numbers, graphically, in-game, at all times"". If any part of this is not true to you then the issue in question is no longer ""*how* should armor numbers be indicated in-game?"" but ""*should* armor numbers even be indicated in game?"". Here I'll try to suggest the best way I could think of having indicators for armor in numbers (goal) that are clear in what they mean and represent (readability - second goal) while not overcluttering the screen (third goal). #The suggestion - Hero health bars split two separate armor indicators: To the left of the health bar is the **Physical Armor Indicator**, to the right of the health bar is the **Spell Armor Indicator**. - Each indicator is composed of a number (current amount of armor) and a colored circle ~~(box, hexagon, w/e)~~ that encases the number. - The circle is colored according to their relation to zero (and type): Type | Value | Color - | - | - Physical | > zero | Yellow/Gold Physical | < zero | Red Spell | > zero | Purple Spell | < zero | Red - Anytime the value of either armor type is equal to zero, that armor type's indicator will not show. - These colors would range from darker to lighter depending on the value they represent: the furthest from zero the number, the darker the color - +75 armor has darker yellow/purple than +15 armor (cap is +75 armor), -25 armor is a darker red than -5 (cap is -25). *Note: I suggested these colors based on some block talents effects (physical block talents have gold effects and spell block talents have purple effects). Blizzard is of course free to go with whatever colors they find best. Also note that negative armor colors could be different depending on armor type (I suggested all negative armor be red, but it's just an example).* #Examples Ex1: Chromie with Uther armor `+25 | Full | +25` and with Tyrande mark `Health bar` Ex2: Auriel with Tassadar's lvl 16 Phase disruption `-25 | health bar` Ex3: Johanna with lvl 1 Reinforce charges `+75 | health bar` Ex4: Murky with lvl 13 Fish tank and with BW's Pixie Dust `+75 | health bar | +30` Ex5: Cassia (active avoidance) with Tyrande mark `+40 | health bar | -25` Ex6: Tyrael with Stukov's lvl 4 Biotic armor `+50 | health bar | +15` and with lvl 20 Nullification shield `+50 | health bar | +75` Ex7: Nazeebo with lvl 13 Superstition `-30 | health bar | +40` and with Tyrande mark ` (?) | health bar | +15` There is a big question mark on Nazeebo. Blizzard had previously stated ([here](URL and [here](URL that the caps on armor are +75 and -25. How does superstition give him -30 physical armor then? Also, how does superstition work with a Tyrande mark? Does he really get to -55 physical armor? Wasn't the cap at -25? I don't know how this interaction works and if what they've said before is true, then superstition only gives Nazeebo -25 physical armor but in the case he receives an outside positive armor effect, say uther armor, then the extra -5 would show and the result would be: [-5 | health bar | +65]. But I cannot confirm this. Edit: /u/Martissimus [confirms](URL (I was right!) the extra -5 from superstion works like a ""bank, reserve"" armor , so he only goes to the cap of -25 Physical armor but any positive PA that he would get would consider superstition as -30 and do the math from there. Thanks for letting me know! Edit2: /u/ThornAernought [says it does go past the cap](URL ... Who do I believe, guys? :thinking:"
51,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,my Deckard Cain concept,0,6r8tw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6r8tw5/my_deckard_cain_concept/,2017-08-03 10:59:54,"This is my attempt at a Deckard Cain hero concept. I picture him as a frail quest-giver (utility specialist, vaguely similar to Abathur). He would have roughly the hp and basic attack damage of a mage, so it wouldn't be *quite* as silly for him to come to teamfights as for Abathur to do so, but since he doesn't have any combat abilities he's probably of more use split-soaking. All the numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. I haven't really tried to make him balanced, I've just tried to show off the fun kinds of things a quest-giver hero could have. ----- Abilities: * Q: Give Quest. Cast while standing near a friendly hero; target a map location. Places a beacon at that location on the hero's minimap. While the hero is in the general vicinity of the beacon, he gains 25% faster ability cooldowns and 25% lower mana costs; while he is not in the vicinity of the beacon, he gains 30% faster movement speed (including mounted movement speed) while facing toward it. * W: Call to Arms. Cast while standing near a friendly minion wave; target a map location. The minions in the wave gain 100% damage to heroes and 50% resistance to hero damage, and attack-move to the target location. After they get there they resume their normal behavior (while retaining their buffs), making their way back to the nearest lane and then traveling down it. (This ability has a lot of interesting uses: denying, at least temporarily, enemy soak and quest progress; stacking up waves for a big push; causing minion waves to show up unexpectedly at objectives.) * E: Detect Evil. Target a map location. Any enemies near this location who were not already visible are revealed and suffer 25% vulnerability for 10 seconds. Has no effect on enemies that are already visible to Cain or an ally. * D: Identification. Passive. If Deckard Cain is nearby when an allied hero receives a regen globe or uses a healing fountain, that ally gains a shield that can absorb ?? damage and does not expire (however, this ability does not stack with itself; if the hero still has a shield from a previous Identification, that shield is replaced by the new one). * Z: Use Waypoint. Cast while standing near a friendly fort/keep/core; target a friendly fort/keep/core. After a brief channel, Deckard Cain teleports to the target location. * R1: Stay Awhile and Listen. Channel for 5 seconds. Nearby allies regenerate 15% of their max and health and mana per second while it is channeled. Interrupted if Cain or any nearby allied hero takes damage. * R2: Horadric Scroll. Channel for 10 seconds (activate again to cancel). While it is being channeled, all enemy heroes are revealed, and merc camps and map objectives take 10x longer than usual for both teams. (That is: neutral mercs, the map-objective monsters in HM/IS/ST/GoT/BB, and the immortals during the combat phase of BoE, take and deal 10% as much damage as usual. Merc cap points, as well as the objective cap points in ST/DS/BH, change state 10% as fast as usual. Tributes in ToD/CH, turn-in points in TotSQ/BB, vehicles in DS/GoT, warheads in WJ, and items in Hanamura take 10x longer than usual to channel or collect. Payloads in Hana move at 10% of their usual speed, and temples in ST fire 10% as fast as usual.) ----- Talent Options: Tier 1 (improving the team's map control): * 1 - Whenever Cain captures a non-boss mercenary camp (or is nearby when his allies capture one), the mercenaries in question gain a permanent 50% bonus to their attack damage. * 1 - (W) Any mage minion affected by Call to Arms gains the ability to soak xp for your team. * 1 - (D) Whenever Identification activates, nearby friendly structures regenerate ?? ammo and heal for ?? hp over 10 seconds. Tier 4 (helping allies complete their own quest talents): * 4 - Each of Cain's allies gains a quest to kill (or be near when they die) 10 enemy or neutral mercenaries, after which all future damage that ally takes from minions, mercenaries, and monsters will be reduced by 10%. * 4 - (Q) If the target location of Give Quest is sufficiently far away from the location Cain is at when he casts it, the affected allied hero gains 1 stack of progress to all of his active quests when he first enters the vicinity of the beacon. * 4 - (E) For each enemy hero revealed by Detect Evil, spawn a friendly regen globe under that hero's feet. These globes last twice as long as usual before expiring. Tier 7 (helping get kills and prevent deaths): * 7 - (Q) While in the vicinity of the beacon, an allied hero under the influence of Give Quest also gains 100% increased health and mana regneration, and 15% increased movement speed. * 7 - (W) When targeting their attacks, any friendly minions near Deckard Cain and/or under the influence of Call to Arms will prioritize the lowest-health enemy hero within their range. Also, the mage minion will periodically cast a small healing spell on the lowest-health allied hero nearby. * 7 - (E) Any enemy hero revealed by Detect Evil is stunned for 0.5 seconds and then suffers 20% reduced movement speed for the remaining 9.75 seconds of its effect. Tier 13 (increasing the team's damage): * 13 - (Q) While in the vicinity of the beacon, an allied hero under the influence of Give Quest deals damage over time to all nearby enemies. * 13 - (W) While under the influence of Call to Arms, allied minions gains 50% increased movement and attack speed. * 13 - (D) Until the shield given to him by Identification is broken, your allied hero's basic attacks and abilities deal 20% increased damage. Tier 16 (giving Cain a reason to physically show up to teamfights): * 16 - Whenever Cain receives healing (including from a regen globe), he drops a regen globe at his feet. 15 second cooldown. * 16 - Cain's basic attacks now silence their targets. * 16 - (Q) When Cain casts Give Quest, he himself is also affected. Tier 20 (making Cain's abilities less location-dependent): * 20 - (R1) Stay Awhile and Listen is no longer nullified by you or your allies taking damage, and now silences any nearby enemies. * 20 - (R2) Horadric Scroll now also reduces all damage dealt to structures by 90%, and gives your allies 50% increased movement speed (including mounted movement speed). * 20 - (Q/W/E) Each of Cain's basic abilities gains a second charge. Also, Q and W can now be cast even if not near an allied hero/minion wave; they will affect whichever allied hero/minion wave is nearest, even if it is far away. * 20 - (Z) Use Waypoint can now be cast from and targeted at destroyed and/or enemy forts/keeps as well as living allied ones, and now carries any nearby allies (including allied minions and mercenaries) with Cain when he uses it."
52,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,New Armor UI is great but only the first step!,147,6slrba,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6slrba/new_armor_ui_is_great_but_only_the_first_step/,2017-08-10 00:17:51,"The new armor/vulnerability UI is absolutely amazing and what the game needs, but its only the first step! In the chaoticness of team fights (especially in solo que) seeing what heroes have lots of armor/vulnerabilities can help players know who to focus and can provide better focus fire for a team. However its not fully complete as they still need to add: * Armor UI for heroes with baseline armor (Johana/Arthas/Anubarak/Greymane worgen form) * Armor UI for talents (Tyrande level 4 Kaldeori Resistance, Diablo level 7 Soul shield) * Way to differentiate between spell armour/phyiscal armour/regular armour (this is a more complicated issue because how would they show that a hero has 35 physical armor + 25 spell armor with cluttering it too much) * Vulnerabilities on important PvE targets (-25 vulnerability from spells like Tyrande's hunter mark on immortals/punisher) Thoughts? And did I miss anything?"

54,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Hero Concept, Unknown hero with unique abilities.",2,6ti9qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6ti9qr/hero_concept_unknown_hero_with_unique_abilities/,2017-08-14 08:29:31,"I've been toying around with some really interesting abilities and thought they would make a very cool hero concept. I'm not sure who in the Blizzard universe would fit the kit so feel free to suggest a hero. Ability 1, Searing Light: Heal target unit for a fairly large amount, then deal damage over time to that unit for slightly more than the initial heal. Ability 2, Rest: Put a target in a lethargic state, reducing attack and movement speed to 50%, increasing to 200% over 12 seconds. Ability 3, Essence Shield: Shield target hero, after it expires, reduce the target's armor by 25% for 3 second. Heroic Ability 1: Lifeswap, put a target ally into stasis for 2 seconds, during that time, you may put a target enemy hero into stasis, once the initial 2 second is up, swap the percentage of health of the two target. So I don't have a trait or second heroic yet, but I thought these were all really cool ideas. As you can see, each basic ability can target an ally or an enemy, and has both a positive and negative effect. So you can do a large burst of healing to save someone, but then they will take all that damage and more if they don't get any more healing. Or you can shield someone in a pinch, but then they will be even more vulnerable. The downsides can be exploited when used on an enemy to ensure they suffer more for the vulnerability or damage over time. My favorite ability, Rest, could be used to prevent an enemy from chasing but if you don't get away quickly enough they will be even better at chasing, or you can use it on a friendly Butcher/Illidan before a fight starts and then they'll have a few second of super attack speed. The idea is that the spell lasts 12 second, so after 4 seconds the target will be back to normal, after 8 seconds they will be at 150% speed, and at the 12th second they will be at 200% speed. So let me know what you think, if this could work as a potential hero, who it could be, and maybe what the trait and/or second heroic could be. Also, just to get this out there, two of the abilities are heavily inspires by Dota abilities, particularly the hero Oracle, who is all about balancing positive and negative effects on his abilities."
55,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Leveled Malthael to 10 - My thoughts on how to balance him.,0,6i9r78,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6i9r78/leveled_malthael_to_10_my_thoughts_on_how_to/,2017-06-20 08:05:08,"Disclaimer: I realize that leveling a hero to 10 is by no means a benchmark for being able to offer legitimate criticism, but I've spent some time with his kit and feel that I have a handle on what makes him strong (in some cases too strong) and what could need some attention. I'll start by saying I've seen a lot of talk about Malthael being overtuned for map objectives and bosses, and to be blunt, this post is not going to cater to that argument at all. There have been plenty of figures and charts released that contradict any assertions that he destroys immortals and bosses too quickly. With that in mind, here is what I would adjust to improve and balance his kit: - Outright change the functionality of Black Harvest or remove it in favor of something new. This talent, in my opinion, is the biggest offender when it comes to his late-game spike in power. When it comes online, this talent significantly lowers the skill requirement of his kit and other talents that require his trait to remain active (2 seconds of armor and free damage from his later talents, in addition to enabling his heal and teleport for longer). Instead, I suggest a change that adds some functionality to an ability, like refunding 50% of the mana cost and cooldown of Wraith Strike when used on a non-hero. - Increase the cooldown of Soul Rip, and increase the damage and healing as well. Simply put, make this ability more about timing and less about holding down Q and hoping it keeps you alive. The increased cooldown and effect would make it feel more like a momentary and timely boost instead of a robotic ability that ticks like a clock. Honestly, in its current iteration it feels like Soul Rip could be a passive that ticks every 2 seconds on nearby marked units, and it'd feel the same. - Rebalance the heroics. The proposed change to Black Harvest might put a *small* dent in Tormented Souls, but it still wouldn't be enough to put his heroics on equal footing. The spread of his trait and ability to extend its duration on targets for its 4 seconds of uptime is reason enough to take it. The armor component removes risk from the ability and has too much synergy with his level 13 survival talents, so I would remove it altogether. For Last Rites, I would shorten the cooldown to 60 seconds baseline, not only making it more threatening as an available option to kill with, but also making the quest a little easier to stack. TL;DR: - Remove / change Black Harvest completely - Increase cooldown, damage, and healing of Soul Rip - Remove armor from Tormented Souls - Lower cooldown of Last Rites to 60 seconds. While I don't think this would fix all of his issues, it would push him in the right direction. He would have some moments of vulnerability that can be taken advantage of, and it would make him a more opportunistic killer instead of the all-in murder robot he is right now."
56,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Zergling Swarm Hero concept.,65,6dl6lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6dl6lk/zergling_swarm_hero_concept/,2017-05-27 12:01:02,"**Zergling Swarm** (inspired by the Lost Vikings and Samuro) Attacks per second: 1.82, (Same as Illidan) Range 1.2. (same as Illidan) 70 Damage. Visually, appears as 9 tightly clumped zerglings. I have reviewed other concepts (and enjoyed them!) and I felt the broods were not well represented, and I do enjoy the lore of Starcraft very much. Please note, I have not given much consideration for the raw numbers, but the concept I feel rather enthusiastic about! &amp;nbsp; **Trait:** Ravenous Swarm. The Zergling Swarm may attack in melee while moving. Movement speed increased by 8% for every second they have not struck an enemy, capped at 24%. &amp;nbsp; (EDITS MADE) **Q: Caustic Pustules.** Auto attacks splash. Consumes 20 mana/attack. Lunar Flare size. This is spell damage. **W: Burrow.** Burrow down and gain permanent stealth. 2x mana regen, 4x health regen. Toggle to unburrow. **E: Swarm:** Split into 3 groups of 3 zerglings. Divide health by 3 and split evenly between these 3 groups. Each can be controlled individually. You may reactivate ability when all are within range of 4 to add up all remaining groups health and become a single unit again. 8 Second cooldown. Mana is shared amongst all 3 groups. All other stats remain the same, and Zergling Swarm abilities affect all groups. If split and number of groups is reduced to 1, E goes on cooldown for 60 seconds. Trait applies to each group individually. *The hero dies and confers experience when the last group reaches 0 health.* &amp;nbsp; Regarding Talents: My generalized concept here is to emphasize evolution and adaptation. I'll admit I was stumped on talents for the most part and please consider these as very rough. **Level 1:** * Quest - Carapace Adaptation: For every 1000 damage taken by the Zergling Swarm, they gain 1% armor. After taking 10,000 damage, gain 10 additional armor. Capped at 20 total armor. * Quest - Claw Adaptation: Every 4000 damage dealt gives the Zergling Swarm an additional 1 auto attack damage. After dealing 40,000 damage, auto attacks deal an additional .5% of target Hero's current health. Capped at +20 auto attack damage. * Quest - Swarmling: Regeneration globes reduce death timer by 1 second. After gathering 30 regeneration globes, reduce death timer by an additional 15 seconds and activate to lay a spawning pool where the Zergling Swarm Respawns from. (Capped at 30 globes and seconds and has as much health as a fort tower) &amp;nbsp; **Level 4:** * Metabolic boost: Your movement speed conferred by your trait now increased by 15% per second to a maximum of 45%. * Adaptive Carapace: You now regenerate 25% of damage taken over 4 seconds. (EDITS MADE)* Expendable: You no longer provide experience to the enemy upon death. *60 Second cooldown.* &amp;nbsp; **Level 7:** * Adrenal glands: Increase attack speed by 40%. * Cellular Regeneration: Health globes restore 150% more health and 100% more mana. * Ocular enhancements: Increase line of sight by 30% &amp;nbsp; **Ultimates:** * Garm Brood: The swarm excells in guerilla tactics and enters stealth when in brush. They remain in stealth for .5 seconds after leaving the brush. They gain ability to move at 40% movement speed while burrowed. * Jormungand Brood: Your swarm excells in direct combat. Movement speed and auto attack damage increased by 20% for .5 seconds when damaged. Gain 10 armor. * Baelrog Brood: Your swarm becomes recklessly aggressive. You deal 50% more damage to non-heroes, 25% more damage to heroes but take 15% more damage. Your respawn timer is lowered by 15 seconds. &amp;nbsp; **Level 13:** * Caustic Acid: Caustic Pustules deal 25% more damage and consume 50% more mana. * Hibernation: If burrowed for over 3 seconds, gain 10% health and mana/second, but take 50% more damage while burrowed. &amp;nbsp; **Level 16:** * The Swarm Endures: Cooldown of Swarm reduced from 60 to 20 seconds if 2 of 3 groups are destroyed. * Hunting Pack: For every friendly swarm nearby, gain 10% additional auto attack damage. * Heart of the Swarm: When a single unit, gain 25% additional health and 30% additional damage. &amp;nbsp; **Level 20:** * Shredding claws: Auto attacks confer vulnerability for .5 seconds. * Zasz Strain: Activate to to deal 50% more damage for 2 seconds. 25 Sec cooldown. (Only if took Garm Brood) * Araq Strain: Activate to gain 25% health per second for 5 seconds. 100 Sec cooldown. (Only if took Jormungand Brood) * Gorn Strain: Activate to allow Zergling Swarm to leap at target, range 4. Cooldown 20 (Only if took Baelrog Brood) * Daggoth Strain - Devouring One: Zergling Swarm gains 5% movement speed and 10% lifesteal for each 10% health missing. (How you like my groove, Daggoth?) &amp;nbsp; Edit: I don't post often on Reddit so I need to figure out formatting! Please bear with me.

57,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,(Yet Another Hero Concept... Sorry) C'thun Concept,13,6f5v89,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6f5v89/yet_another_hero_concept_sorry_cthun_concept/,2017-06-04 15:45:03,"Okay, this is another hero concept. First time I've posted one of these things, mostly because I am under the impression that 90% of these things won't be read by anyone of the design team. But I thought I'd do it anyway, because I personally would love to see a core-replacement hero in the game. Before I get to the little I've come up with, I would like to address the issues with a core-replacement hero (from here on, the CR-hero): fundamentally the lack of interactivity in general. The enemy can't really do anything to the CR-hero and in general the CR-hero will be doing less/having less effect on the game. I've tried to address these, but I'm afraid that there is no real solution to the first problem. Anyway, to the concept, which I consider to be something of an anti-abathur (debuffs rather than buffs). +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ **C'thun** **Trait:** This has number of aspects to this, so bare with me. * C'thun replaces the friendly core. It remains alive while the core remains alive, etc, etc. * Furthermore, all enemy minions on the (visible) screen of the C'thun player suffer a minor debuff (think -10% damage, -5% health or something in that ballpark) and C'thun collects all xp from any enemy minions that die in view. * Every 15 seconds, a claw tentacle spawns on the (visible) screen of the C'thun player (up to a number. 3?). These tentacles have X amount of health and are only active while visible to the C'thun player. When the C'thun player moves their camera away, the tentacles become inactive 3 seconds later and are effected by the vulnerable condition. Awards a small amount of xp on death. * Maybe on the minimap, there is a visible indicator for both teams where C'thun is looking? **1^st Ability:** Maddening Whispers Acts like an Abathur hat, but is cast, and affects, an enemy hero in vision range instead. Abilities might have a resource cost, that is collected passively from eye-balling enemy heroes? Call it madness or something and colour it purple, who knows. During the affect, there is a visual effect on the enemy hero, and the player of said hero hears whispering sounds. * **Q:** Short range shove on modest cooldown. Think something like Gall's shove. * **W:** Short duration vulnerability state. * **E:** Short duration blindness. Turns the screen black, more or less, or at least obscures it with some sort of effect like when you are eaten by a stitches, etc. * **R:** Cancel effect. **2^nd Ability:** Tentacle Swipe Remember those tentacles from earlier? Well here they are to do things. Direct a vector on the ground, and any tentacles within range hit that vector as best they can. Short cooldown. **3^rd Ability:** Spawn Eye Tentacle Yeah, so this one allows C'thun to summon a number of (timed life) eye tentacles, which provide unobstucted vision, and provide a greater aoe in which the second ability above can be targeted/used (eye-lasers, yo!). They otherwise follow the same mechanics of the passive tentacles. **Heroic 1:** Summon Emperor So the level 10 version of this summons one the the twin emperors. Think something like Abathur's monstrosity. C'thun can take control of the emperor by casting their 1^st Ability on it. This creates an modestly sized aura in which all enemy heroes around the emperor are effected by the debuff when cast. At level 20, two emperors are spawned and are controlled as a single unit, while both providing the aforementioned aura (think something like Chen Ult). **Heroic 2:** Madness This is an instant cast AOE, with a timed duration. Enemy heroes effected see multiple illusions of the C'thun players allied heroes wandering out of the fog or war, etc, etc. These illusions are dispelled the moment they are hit, etc, but appear to cast their on abilities at the effected heroes. At level 20, the effect lasts longer and the illusions do a % of the originals damage with their abilities/autoattacks. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Okay. That's my awful idea. I doubt I will ever see it in game, but I thought I would write it down and post it just in case, so one day I can look back and appear to be some sort of prophet king :P. For the various leveling bonuses, I don't really have much of a plan/idea. Let me know what you think, but, because I am fundamentally an antisocial bastard, it is unlikely I will respond - though I will read every reply."

You don't know much armor a target has (if it's 15, 25, 50 or 75) and things get even more confusing when multiple armor values and types (magic and or physical, or simply armor) are currently in effect. Well, my suggestion is something like [this](URL This is Uther with 25% armor. If someone has 40% spell armor, and 15% physical armor, the small indicator (purple for spell, brown...ish for physical) would be drawn from right to left on the hero health bar one from the top of the health bar, the other from the bottom, for that specific amount. Only Physical Armor like Arthas' passive would simply be physical armor as shown [here](URL Of course some polishing should be done to make it a little more visible without adding to visual clutter, but with information like this one can tell who is under effect of armor and how much will he mitigate. This could also be used to measure vulnerability (decreases armor or is a red line in the middle of the health bar if no armor is present). Thoughts?"
59,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,D.Va Rework,0,6glrrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6glrrb/dva_rework/,2017-06-12 00:55:14,"Hello everyone. I'm a HotS player since 2 years, with a lot of games and experience. In my honest opinion, D.Va suffers of a bad design. She's strong and funny, but has a lots of problems and her talents are pretty bad. So i tried to think a rework for a D.Va Multiclass and with balanced talents. She can build like a tank, an off-tank or even a full dps. EDIT: Thanks to your feedbacks, i did some changes. Now D.Va is no more a multiclass; she still has some talents on Pilot Mode, but you can't build full dps. Check them out. **Warrior** **Q:** if you don't hit anything, CD is reduced by 5 seconds **W:** no changes **E:** no changes **R:** Bunny Hop CD reduced to 70 seconds **D:** no changes **Z:** after a 3 second stun and vulnerability, D.Va leave his mech. (Call Mech CD is doubled, 90 seconds) **Talents level 1:** *Hit the Nitrous:* old talent; initial speed of Boosters increased to 325%, then decays to normal speed over 0.5 seconds. During this time Boosters deals 100% bonus damage. *Pro Moves:* old talent; D.Va's Mech gains 2% Movement Speed for 1.25 second every time she takes damage, up to 30%. *Globe Quest:* new talent; for every globe gathered (up to 15) Mech life regen is increased by 1. After 15 globes, life regen is doubled (so, 30). *Passive:* every globe increase Self-Destruct's charge by 5%. **Talents level 4** *Diverting Power:* old talent; the area of Defense Matrix is 100% wider and 25% longer, but D.Va is rooted for the duration. *Get Through This!:* old talent reworked. Increase Defense Matrix duration by 3 seconds, and it can works against minions and mercenaries with half effectivness (so, 37% damage reduction). *Bring it On:* old talent; Self-Destruct's Charge amount gained from losing Mech Health increased by 30%. **Talents level 7** *Coming Though:* old talent; increase Boosters knockback distance by 100%. *Dazer Zone:* old talent; enemy Heroes affected by Defense Matrix are slowed by 20%. *Concussive Pulse:* previously at 20; D.Va Pilot gains the Concussive Pulse ability, allowing her to deal x damage to enemies in a cone and knock them back. **Talents level 13:** *Expensive Plating:* old talent; increase Mech health by 20%, but increase the cooldown of Call Mech by 15 seconds. *Nanoweave Suit:* previously at 16; for 4 seconds after ejecting from her Mech, D.Va gains 50 Armor and her Basic Attacks grant 50% more cooldown reduction for Call Mech. *Torpedo Dash:* previously at 16; D.Va Pilot gains the Torpedo Dash ability, allowing her to dash forward and pass through enemies. *Mech Boosters Talent:* heroes hit by Boosters lost 5% of their maximum life **Talents level 16** *Ablative Armor:* old talent reworked; previously at 13; damage against D.Va's Mech that would deal 4% or less of your max health are reduced by 50%. *Quest:* after X damage reduced by this way, D.Va gains Mekafall (previously a 20 level talent) *GG, WP:* old talent rebalanced; increase Pilot Mode Basic Attack damage by 30%. Participating in a Takedown while in Pilot Mode instantly refreshes the cooldown of Call Mech. *Mech Magic Shield:* new talent; like other magic shields, but with a lesser CD and just 20 magic armor. **Talents level 20** *Bunny Hop upgrade:* reworked; reduce Bunny Hop CD by 10 seconds and give 20% armor to D.Va when she's using the skill. *Bigh Shot upgrade:* no changes; instead of a single shot, Big Shot fires 3 shots over 0.5 seconds. Each shot deals 50% reduced damage. *Active talent:* new active talent with 2 seconds of CD; D.Va can redirect his Defense Matrix , but she suffers 10% more damage where is not protected (just while the skill is active). *Supressing Fire:* previously at 16; Pilot Mode Basic Attacks have 20% increased range and Slow enemy Movement Speed by 20% for 2.5 seconds."

Usually her trait is supposed to give a -25% armor debuff, and this causes a (spell) armor icon to appear above any hero affected (e.g. after taking the starfall talent at 20). Small note: Tyrande's Mark is supposed to apply 25% physical *and* spell armor afaik. I assume this is just because of something like the spell armor check being in the first `if` statement clause, e.g. if (hero.spell_armor != 0) { // display spell armor icon } else if (hero.physical_armor != 0) { // display physical armor icon } (Of course it could be many things; there could also be two individual `if` statements and the spell armor one comes second. This is all probably inside a foreach of all the heroes. *This is just an example okay.*) I'm (pretty) sure this is a simple case of checking for `armor != 0` instead of `armor &lt;= 0`, hopefully it gets patched out soon :) Or alternatively, have some other sort of icon for when armor is below 0 (that would also make sense from a UX standpoint). **Edit:** Turns out this icon actually just means vulnerability..."

The 20 talent is pretty optional, with prismatic link being really good, but if I am in a QM and a solo support, shield battery is also really good. And I don't see anything bad about spamming force walls, so it all depends. But QM is one thing, HL is another. When is Tassadar an appropriate pick?

62,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,How exactly do damage modifiers and damage scaling work?,1,6a2n1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6a2n1g/how_exactly_do_damage_modifiers_and_damage/,2017-05-09 12:10:52,"All damage dealing abilities have some base amount which is modified by level. +4% is standard for most abilities. So if you have an ability with a base damage of 100 and standard scaling, then it will deal 140 damage at level 10. That's simple enough, but what if we introduce a talent into the mix that increases the damage of that ability by 25%? There seem to be two possibilities: A) damage scaling from level changes the base damage which is then modified by the talent, or B) the talent is added to the level modifier which are then applied to the base. In this situation A would result in 175 damage at level 10 while B would result in 165. Additionally, how does percentage damage work with all of this? My assumption is that it is added only after all other modifiers have been applied, but is that correct and does percentage damage also bypass armor? For that matter, how exactly is armor applied in all of this? My assumption is that it is probably an additional multiplicative modifier that is applied only to the final damage calculation (probably before percentage damage) after all other modifiers have been accounted for. If that's correct, then vulnerability is way more powerful than I previously thought because it multiplies damage after damage bonuses have been applied. Rather than adding another +10% modifier to the pile it introduces an extra step in the calculation where you multiply your damage by 1.1, making that +25% function like +27.5% modifier. Any clarification would be much appreciated, but I'm interested in what is verifiable and not simply speculation (I have speculation in spades)."

I recently had the opportunity to attend a summit where Blizzard revealed [**Heroes 2.0**](URL This post will outline the biggest changes to the game that are now in Open Beta. I also took part in a Developer Q&amp;A session with Travis, Lead System Designer and Kent-Erik (/u/Centaurik), Lead Hero Designer. I will be making a later post that goes in-depth into the discussion during that session, but a short list of my key takeaways is at the bottom of this post. **The juiciest stuff from the summit is the Q&amp;A, so make sure to check that out at the bottom.** If you want to try out all the content you've been hearing about, jump into the PTR (now the Open Beta) for the new patch. Before we begin, remember that this post offers only a very high-level overview of the content and the perspective of only one person (me). For specific details, check out the announcement blog posts and videos from Blizzard. * [Developer Update - Heroes 2.0](URL * [Progression 2.0 Preview](URL * [Progression 2.0 Spotlight](URL * [Cassia Spotlight](URL ## Progression 2.0 The announcements for the new progression system look very much like what was teased at Blizzcon. * Level caps removed, player level is now the sum of hero levels. * Progression was made more consistent and frequent. * You receive loot chests every time you level up, with special quality loot chests being awarded at specific hero/player milestones. * Since progress transfers over, you will also receive loot boxes for your progression to date. *EDIT: I'm getting some info now (thanks /u/InVerum) that this caps out at something like 70. Unfortunate, but get your unboxing videos ready!* * **Your current hero levels will transfer to the new system.** * Accompanied by two new tabs in the game: *Collection* and *Loot*. * The Loot tab is for opening loot chests. The Collection tab replaces the shop and is also where you browse your items. ### Loot Chests * All items in the game, except for those tied to special events or limited edition items, will be available in loot chests. * This includes heroes! * These items are **NOT EXCLUSIVE TO LOOT CHESTS**. You can stilll buy stuff in the shop. *EDIT: To clarify, there is a rotation of featured items that you can buy with Gems. There's more about this in the Developer Summit Q&amp;A.* * Duplicate items become *Shards*, a new crafting currency. * You can use *Gold* to reroll loot chests if you don't like the contents. ### Currencies We will now have three ingame currencies. You will still earn **Gold** in the same ways you always have, like daily quests. Its main purpose moving forward will be to buy heroes and reroll loot chests. Real money is being replaced with **Gems**. You will be able to buy everything you used to be able to buy with money (heroes, stimpacks) using Gems, which are themselves bought with real money. You also use them to buy loot chests. They'll be a rare reward from the progression system too. Duplicate items from loot chests award **Shards**, which can be used to craft new cosmetic items in the Collection. ### New Item Types * **Banners**: Your equipped banner will drop onto the battlefield when you complete an objective, capture mercenaries, or last-hit a fort/keep. * **Sprays**: Press T to paint your spray onto the ground. Excellent BM tool, think of next-level b-stepping. * **Announcers**: Hero announcers replace the default map announcers for things like the setup countdown, killstreaks, and more. Definitely try out Murky and Brightwing! * **Voice Lines**: You can use a new action wheel to taunt the enemy with an equipped hero voice line. From my playtesting, you can only pick one to use during the game, but there are a variety you can choose from in your loadout. * **Emoji**: Absolutely the feature I am most excited for, each hero will get their own emoji pack, as well as some general ones for the game. You can use these during a game or in chats outside of a game. There are *so many* packs to choose from and they are all adorable! And some are off-the-charts wonderful. (I recall seeing a salt shaker and a potato, superb BM potential in custom games.) ### Loadouts With all these new items to equip, the dialog where you choose your hero's skin and mount has changed to the **Loadout** panel, where you can set all of these customizable items, including cosmetics. You can also save up to three presets per hero to load instantly. ## Cassia, Amazon Warmatron Cassia, a Diablo 2 Javazon, is a high-damage, anti-AA ranged assassin. Her trait gives her 65 Physical Armor as long as she is moving, which provides incredible damage mitigation against AA heroes like Raynor, Valla, and Zul'jin. Everybody had a blast playing Cassia on the player stations. Experimentation showed that she can reliably put out high damage numbers with her Q (Lightning Fury) build, but she I don't have much to say about her, but check out the [hero spotlight](URL and try her out on the Open Beta! ## Developer Q&amp;A This Q&amp;A was a lot of fun and very enlightening. Some key takeaways from this session as well as some other people's sessions are included here. * The Heroes team is very committed to delivering more statistics to players. * **An API (scope undisclosed) is currently in the works** and they're ""pretty close to wrapping it up."" * The team tentatively plans to **make MMR visible**. * The team prefers to introduce interesting mechanics to achieve balance rather than strictly throwing numbers (vulnerability, CDs, damage) that serve to complicate the game. * As a tangent, globals are hard to balance. **I will be making a post diving deeper into the Q&amp;A with accompanying video of the session at a later date.** --- Thank you to everybody for reading through the post.

Heroes should have their Armor percentage reflected in their hitpoint bar. Visually. Like shields; except orange instead of blue. So let's use Arthas as an example, with made up numbers because fun. * Arthas has Armor 10 * This means that 10% of his Hitpoints are considered Armored. * Armored hitpoints reduce incoming damage by 50%. So, Arthas has 2000/2000hp. His neat-o little health bar shows a 90% green bar. With the outmost 10% as orange, or reinforced, or armored. Or in number terms, 1800 of those hit points are considered normal. 200 of them however, are normal hitpoints' older, meaner, bigger brother. In Armor. If Arthas quickly eats 300 damage and loses all of his Armoured hitpoints then he is in a bit of a pickle - and we can all see this. Because it has nice **visual feedback** for player(s), observer(s), audience(s) etceteraaahh... Now? How does Arthas go about regaining those sweet, sweet Armored hitpoints? Well, after losing his Armor, any hitpoints he now gains through Regeneration, Globes, tapping a Healing Well or any Support rubbing on his desperately pixel-lacking skin... Up to 10% of his total HP pool can be considered armored. If he doesn't have his 10% Armor, any HP gained is considered Armored. **This adds an extremely cool benefit for Supports**... Your Tank just got poked, hard. In the eye. You don't need to heal him all the way to 100%. Just restore his Armor and he's good to go! ## But wait, what about Vulnerability? Or Anti-Armor?! Good question. And this is ultimately why we need **visual representation** of Armor as soon as possible. Preferably before more cows get diverted to the slaughterhouse. RIP ETC. RIP. So imagine our Arthas standing all shiny with his 17 pixel Frostmourne and what kinda resembles a helmet on his, uhh, head. A wild ~~booTy~~ Tyrande appears and traits him good! We have a kind of like ""sunder"" but ""bricks falling apart"" imagine a ""wall crumbling"" effect. All up in Arthas' little health bar. Alternatively this -25 Armor just applies a debuff to Arthas causing 25% of his maximum hitpoints to take increased damage. We can show this by coloring his bar red, or purple. **TL;DR** - Armor is shit. A hidden percentage is an extremely bad mechanic. You killed ETC and I am sad. Rework armor before knee-jerk patching this new balance commodity and hurting the game further. **Armor NEEDS visual feedback**. Discuss? Or downvote? Dunno really. Got it off my chest at least. edit 2: Bonus brownie points. * Armor should ONLY ever EVER apply to attacks. Physical. Armor. Makes sense. * Heroes who fill this supposed ""niche"" of Anti-Mage, or Spell-Resistant - should use Spell Shield. * Spell Shield already has **fan-fudging-tastic visual representation in game** * That big purple spherical shield. Yeah? Oh, If I pyroblast him it will hit like a wet ETC noodle. * Oh, look his purple thing is gone, nukes away boys! "
67,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Justice Rains From Above - Hero Concept: Overwatch's Pharah,0,647179,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/647179/justice_rains_from_above_hero_concept_overwatchs/,2017-04-08 23:33:16,"Pharah from Overwatch has very unique mechanics, and at first glance, you would think that her three-dimensional style of gameplay does not translate to the two-dimensional plane of HOTS. However, I think this opens up interesting opportunities not yet explored in the game. Here is a thought on what a HoTS-flavored Pharah might look like. **Intro:** Pharah is a ranged assassin that excels at punishing foes with area damage. She relies on her rocket launcher to damage foes from afar, but is fragile and does not have a large health pool. Strapped in her Jetpack, she can prove elusive and difficult to pin down. She has no mana pool and instead relies on cooldowns and an ammo system to regulate her skills. **Trait: Reload.** Pharah does not have a basic auto attack. Instead she relies on her Rocket Launcher (Q) to punish foes from range. Her rocket launcher has a capacity of 6 ammunition after which she must reload for 2 seconds. (Think Tracer trait) **Q: Rocket Launcher.** Pharah's primary attack. Two versions depending on her Jetpack (W) state. She can fire rockets quickly and for good damage, but within the bounds of the Reload trait. *Ground Version:* 1.5s cooldown, moderate damage and range. Fire a basic projectile skillshot. On contact with a target or geometry, do 50% splash damage to other enemies in a very small radius around the impact. *Air Version:* 1.5s cooldown, moderate damage and increased range. Direct a rocket projectile to a target ground location. After travel time, the rocket explodes, dealing damage in a small radius (Think Lunara Q) with targets in the center taking bonus damage. **W: Jetpack.** After a 1 second travel time and temporary speed boost, Pharah asends skyward to the ""bird plane"" that Medivh inhabits. This gives Pharah a 25% range bonus to all abilities, and a 25% armor bonus against melee attacks but also a 25% armor penalty against ranged attacks. This flight ability is roughly analogous to Sgt. Hammer's hover siege mode, offering offensive bonuses but at risk of her safety. She is still bound by solid terrain, because ranged attacks over solid terrain would probably be abusive and a logistical nightmare. After her initial boost, she can hover in the air indefinitely, but gradually loses move speed down to 75% over 6 seconds. Toggling the button a second time causes Pharah to land and puts the ability on cooldown for 4 seconds. **E: Concussive Blast:** Like her Q ability, this skill behaves differently depending whether Pharah is airborne or on the ground. (W) *Ground Version:* Q Ranged, 15 second cooldown. Pharah fires a skillshot projectile that detonates on impact with enemies and terrain. Targets near the impact are knocked back and take light damage. (Think old medic grenade) *Air version:* Enhanced range. Pharah fires a projectile at a specific ground location, knocking back targets from the center and doing light damage. **Ultimate Abilities:** Both ultimate abilities require Pharah to be airborne to activate. **R: Rocket Barrage:** Pharah channels for several seconds, unleashing rockets in a large, cone-shaped area. Heavy damage, but at a risk of high vulnerability while channelling. **R: Dive Bomb:** Moderate Range. Pharah charges at a target location on the ground and crashes like a meteor. Enemies around the impact are briefly stunned and take moderate damage. (Roughly analogous to the Barbarian's Leap ability) In closing, this has gone on entirely too long. I hope you enjoyed the concept. "

Most of these warriors are finding themselves in more defined roles - some warriors are looking up at their brethren and sistren, wondering how they will stand next to and against these behemoths. One hero is not so bothered by any of this. He already knows the way. That's why he's patiently sitting back, drinking deep from his favored Keg, waiting for his opportunity, like he always does. Chen can take a tremendous amount of punishment while drinking, at one great cost: he stands where he drinks. When in the face of unmitigable force he faces a choice: run away, revealing his vulnerability, or stand, and drink; and inevitably die alone. There is always an ace in the hole with tricksters like these - alas, where does all that brew go? It's somewhere - floating around in Chen's bloodstream! Credit goes to the Brewmasters and all of the Chens of reddit. ======== **Talent Tier 1/7/...:** - **New Talent - Shuffle:** Damage taken over the next 3 seconds will not be received directly, but as an accumulating damage-over-time effect lasting 10 seconds. 40 second cooldown. Stores 2 charges. - **Flying Serpent Kick** can now be used on allies. So give in to your creative side, explore the possibilities of S-tier Chen. Small tweaks with such a troublesome hero? Don't pander. Make a mess. Now we can have some fun."
70,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Given Uther's rework, wouldn't it be cool if Holy Shock reduced an enemy's armor by 25?",3,661rci,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/661rci/given_uthers_rework_wouldnt_it_be_cool_if_holy/,2017-04-18 19:19:59,"If his new trait gives armour to the target of the heal (including himself), it would make sense for him to reduce the armor of the enemy when he 'reverse-heals' them to death in Battle-Uther-Mode. It might also add in some interesting reasons to pick that talent - more than just an added nuke (+mana-refund and cdr). I can imagine that a 25% vulnerability may be OP on a 6 sec cd - maybe a 10-15% armor reduction would be worthwhile? I'm by no means an Uther main - I'm just spitballing here."

73,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,I would be lying if I said I wasn't worried about the direction of HOTS.,74,5y24ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5y24ec/i_would_be_lying_if_i_said_i_wasnt_worried_about/,2017-03-08 04:55:13,"Let me preface this with I don't know how anything will play out. It could be fine, it could be terrible, I don't know. But what I do know, is that the direction concerns me. The main concern is that it seems to me that the team is focusing very much, possibly too much, on the pro/competitive scene or the meta and less on Hots original philosophy of ease of entry and fun. It seems to me that if you don't draft meta, you lose, or at least that's what the aim seems to be. Secondly, forcing Heroes to fill a niche seems counter-intuitive to the entire idea of the Talent System. Basic kits alone should be the driving force for which hero counters others, not an Armor number. It goes without saying that Anub'arak works well against mages, his beetles can block skill shots and his ability to dive, life steal, and CC is perfect for backline harassment. **But forcing a hero to fill ONLY that role seems backwards for the entire Talent System, allowing one to adapt to the game.** Again, I don't know how this will all work out, it might all be fine, but that's my two cents of the evolution of the game. EDIT: I should also say I think that the Arthas 'rework' is very good (a little overtuned from what I've experienced). He fills his niche of anti-AA very well while also giving him a wide variety of talent choices and a 20 to make up for his mage vulnerability."
74,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Probius Talent Review,16,5y3ocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5y3ocs/probius_talent_review/,2017-03-08 08:44:22,"**Level 1 Talents:** **Echo Pulse:** Disruption Pulse now returns to Probius 1.25 seconds after reaching its target, dealing 75% damage on the return trip * **Powerful.** At first I thought this talent was weak since it is usually unlikely you will hit the same target on the return. But you have 2 charges of warp rift and being able to quickly detonate both with just 1 Q has some serious potential. This combo of W, delay, Q, then set up a 2nd W allows you to do a lot of burst and leave yourself out of position for the least amount of time. **Warp Resonance:**  Quest: Hit Heroes with Warp Rift explosions.  Reward: After hitting 10 Heroes with Warp Rift explosions, increase the explosion damage by 100.  Reward: After hitting 20 Heroes with Warp Rift explosions, Warp Rift gains 1 additional charge. * **Situational.** The power of more charges is not to be underestimated. Thrall gets a 2nd charge on his Q as a 16 talent. This level 1 quest talent also comes with more burst. I see its value but it takes more time to pay off and the short cooldown on warp rift makes me think it isn't as valuable as the synergy from Echo Pulse. **Gather Minerals:**  Quest: Enemy Heroes and Minions drop Minerals when killed. Collect them to increase the Health of Photon Cannons by 8, up to 560.  Reward: After collecting 70 Minerals, Photon Cannons deal 25% more damage, can see over obstacles, and reveal nearby Cloaked units. * **Situational, Mostly Weak.** Photon canons are terribly weak since their damage is comparable to Gazlowe turrets and you usually only have 1 up due to their long cooldown. The level 7 talent feels like a trap since they also do not priortize heroes making investment into cannons feel bad. I could see taking this for detection against stealthies. **Level 4 Talents:** **Photon Barrier:** While a Photon Cannon is alive and powered, Probius gains 30 Spell Armor. * **Situational.** It is no doubt situationally a good talent, but the biggest threats I have found are diving heroes with usually quite strong auto attacks. Chromie or Li Ming trying to blow you up is still quite scary given their much higher range. **Turbo Charged:** Worker Rush grants an additional 10% passive Movement Speed while in a Power Field, and its cooldown is reduced by 20 seconds. * **Powerful.** This helps avoid the dangerous divers best along with spells that you may fear. As a bonus, being more mobile in escapes, catching enemies and moving between lanes with Worker Rush off cooldown is huge. **Shield Capacitator:** Probius gains permanent Shields equal to 10% of his max Health. Shields regenerate quickly as long as he hasn't taken damage recently. * **Situational, Mostly Weak.** Probius's health is pretty small to start with (about the same as Li Ming) so 10% of that is nothing even in the lategame, 1 - 2 auto attacks. So it could be nice if you didn't have a healer, but I prefer the mobility to avoid damage entirely. **Level 7 Talents:** **Particle Accelerator:** Disruption Pulse deals 10% more damage for each enemy or Warp Rift hit, up to 40%. * **Weak.** It can be a nice increase in burst damage, but I do not think its reliable to gain more than 20% buff from hitting the enemy and a warp rift. **Rift Shock:** Hitting an enemy Hero with Warp Rift explosion increases Probius's damage against them by 20% for 10 seconds. * **Powerful.** 10 seconds is a lot of time and its quite easy to reset that. This is even more valuable when using Pylon Overcharge ultimate. This is especially powerful when you try out the W, Q, W combo. **Tower Defense:** When Photon Cannon damages an enemy Hero, its cooldown is reduced by 1.25 seconds. * **Weak.** How could Probius be a real hero without a trap talent. Here it is, the canons that don't even focus enemy heroes and usually get blown up may have a slightly reduced cooldown that you can get 2 of them up. **Heroics:** **Pylon Overcharge:** Cooldown: 80 seconds. Increase the size of Pylon power fields and allow them to attack enemies within it for 110 damage per second. Lasts 10 seconds. Passive: Pylons gain permanent Shields equal to 50% of their max Health. * **Powerful.** The range and damage are both quite strong and with good pylon placement I would definitely see this being a solid choice with most compositions. It is especially great with Rift Shock which will increase the damage further. **Null Gate:** Cooldown: 40 seconds. Project a barrier of negative energy in the target direction that lasts 4 seconds. Enemies who touch the barrier take 64 damage per second and are slowed by 80% for as long as they remain in contact with it. * **Situationally powerful.** The cooldown is relatively short but not enough to get more than 1 in most team fights so that is disappointing. The slow is strong but escape abilities and smaller models make its effectiveness highly varied. It has a slight delay so its easier to use it as followup to another hero's CC. And the gates surrounding it are purely decorative, enemies can walk albeit slowly, through it. **Level 13 Talents:** **Aggressive Matrix:** Pylon's Power Field grants allied Heroes 20% increased Attack Damage. * **Situationally powerful** when supporting ranged AA damage dealers like Hammer, Valla or Raynor. You don't benefit from this, but it can be decently powerful. **Power Overflowing:** Pylon's Power Field grants allied Heroes 10% increased Spell Power and 2 Mana per second. * **Powerful.** You benefit nicely and other spellcasters and any hero who has some mana sustain issues will love it. I'd call it standard pretty easily. **Shield Battery:** Pylon's Power Field grants allied Heroes 30 Shields per second, up to 120. Shields persist for 4 seconds after exiting a Pylon Power Field * **Weak.** This one grants too little shields and too slowly for its position on the tier. It could be very strong, but it also has the design flaw of placing pylons out of position to shield your frontline and they tend to blow up then. **Level 16 Talents:** **Quantum Entanglement:** Enemies continue to be slowed for 3.5 seconds after their last contact with a Warp Rift. * **Powerful.** Usually you want to detonate the Warp Rifts, so this allows the CC to linger for a while afterwards. Makes landing a second Warp Rift with the W, Q, W combo much easier. **Gravity Well:** Enemies are slowed more the closer they are to the center of the Warp Rift, up to a maximum slow of 60%. * **Weak.** Enemies tend to avoid the center of Warp Rifts. So it feels rather weak since this so rarely comes into play. **Repulsor:** Enemies hit by a Warp Rift explosion are knocked away from the center. * **Weak.** The delay between placing Warp Rift and detonating makes this unpredictable. Furthermore it screws up landing the second warp rift detonation. **Interference:** Enemy Heroes hit by Warp Rift detonations have their Spell Power reduced by 35% for 3 seconds. * **Situational.** The range is relatively short on Probius, so unless you are going against melee mages like Alarak and Kerrigan, this won't be the most effective. **Storm Talents:** **Construct Additional Pylons:** Probius can now have up to 3 active Pylons, and increase the damage of Pylon Overcharge by 25%. * **Situational.** 3 Pylons means 50% more damage on top of the 25%, but the prep time is way to high for this to be effective except in maps you can time REALLY well. Still this can be insane when you gain the vulnerability. **Gate Keeper:** Null Gate lasts indefinitely if either end is within a Power Field. Only one Null Gate may be active at a time. * **Situational.** Null Gate is amazing lockdown of an area, this allows you to really lock down an area. So its almost as good as Slowing Sands now but a much smaller area... **Shoot 'Em Up:** Hitting a Warp Rift with Disruption Pulse causes 4 additional pulses that deal 50% damage to be fired from the impact location in different directions. Additional Pulses do not benefit from Echo Pulse or Particle Accelerator. * **Powerful.** When timed right, you can hit the enemy with all the pulses or at least a lot of them. It doesn't benefit from particle accelerator, but does gain the 20% from Rift Shock. This can chunk enemies and adds a ton of damage in the W, Q, W combo. Also these pulses launched out can detonate more Warp Rifts you have laying around hilariously, so careful with placement. **Probius Loop:** Whenever a Rift explosion hits 2 or more enemy Heroes, create a new Warp Rift in the same location. * **Situational.** Against melee heavy teams, I have found it not TOO hard to hit 2 enemies. This can make the W, Q, W combo more powerful with an additional Warp Rift detonated by the return of the Echo pulse. Let me know what your opinions on Probius are as far as talents go. And of course take this with a grain of salt since its only Day 2."
75,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,A couple of odd Holo Decoy bugs I was finally able to notice,11,5zph75,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5zph75/a_couple_of_odd_holo_decoy_bugs_i_was_finally/,2017-03-16 19:49:48,"* On a map where a currency is shown above your character (like Tomb of the Spider Queen) deploying 2 Holo Decoys (such as through Rewind) will suddenly double the displayed currency of the first Decoy. I tried this two different times and it happened both times. URL URL I'm not actually sure if this happens with other similar events, like owning coins on Blackheart's Bay or warheads on Warhead Junction due to not having an opportunity to play there with these talents at lv20, but I would presume it does. * Holo Decoy will never apply the slow effect of Pinning Shot, even if Lethal Decoy is chosen as a talent. I remember from the big ""Nova patch"" a year ago that they prevented the Decoy from applying vulnerability from Crippling Shot unless Lethal Decoy was chosen (though those talents were put on the same tier so /shrug). According to players I've asked, it definitely used to apply the slow when it used Pinning Shot which prompted me to find this old replay URL . Indeed, the slow is applied to Kael'thas when the Lethal Decoy uses Pinning Shot on him at 10:10. A non-Lethal Decoy also applies the slowing effect/graphic to Kharazim at 8:13 within that replay but it's hard to notice since he was stuck in Mosh Pit at the time. I figured this information would be of interest to both Nova mains out there or any bug fixers."
76,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,So I had this idea over a month ago...,0,5zqyjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5zqyjx/so_i_had_this_idea_over_a_month_ago/,2017-03-17 01:42:17,"URL ...and it was well before I knew Probius would be coming to the Nexus. I was goofing around one day and figured I would try to come up with some ideas for a probe type hero that would be a ranged specialist/lane pusher. While I only really fleshed out the main abilities and level 1 talents, I still felt like it was a good start and decently true to the hero. Eventually one of the ability talents for the Observer skill would be an extremely long reveal and vulnerability debuff to enemies revealed. His Pylon skills would have talents very similar to the ones they have now, granting specific things to heroes/minions/buildings while in the power field. Also that cooldown on mount is ridiculous and any number representation on a talent's description should be taken with a grain of salt, except maybe the supply numbers. The main stuff here is the idea of the abilities and talents. The level 10 Forge would create an ability for Photon Cannon, but would not be the pushover skill we have now, dealing decent targetable single point damage with mild splash, automatic reveals, and two charges. The other Heroic would allow the Probe to instantly transport any newly spawn minion waves from the Core to his Pylons, allowing him to create a monster wave with his Warp-In ability or even just warping in minions to make the enemy miss out on soak experience, since the ability would allow him to negate timed rotations on maps where you can wait the full 30 seconds between waves while you slaughter the other team. I think I'd love to have some warp in/lane pushing abilities rather than Q+W spam bot but there's always hope I suppose. Don't get me wrong though, I love that he is added to the game. I was just hoping for something a little closer to what I had in mind, sine the probe was more or less an extension of the player while playing Starcraft. What do you guys think of this extremely early and initial draft as compared to what we have now?"

78,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Not a fan of Tassadar rework,14,5q008b,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5q008b/not_a_fan_of_tassadar_rework/,2017-01-25 11:32:40,"Blizzard usually does decently with reworks, but I am not very satisfied with this one. I did read the Tassadar Sentry thread, and that has probably biased me rather heavily against this rework, however, I have some major gripes: Tassadar's life leach inherent is nice, but the quest does *not* work synergistically with it. I found that I have to rotate and globe hunt to be able to get even HALF permashield in a timely fashion such that it's actually useful. It took me a 38 minute game to get 40 globes, and even then it was just Win Harder. The added shields didn't feel like they did anything for how much time it took to attain them, because we were level 24. Sorry, but that's not the point that the full shields really feel useful. But why not pick one of the other level 1 talents? Honestly? Because increasing the size of Psi Storm isn't really that useful. The 20% damage increase is cool, but having to trigger 1000 hits is kind of tedious. It took me a fair while in Try Mode, and that's without the verisimilitude of QM or HL. Realistically, the Psi Storm damage won't come until level 16+, more than likely. All that work for 20% damage boost just doesn't DO much. Templar's will SEEMS cool, but Tass is just too squishy to really take advantage of it. Level 4 talents: No gripes here, honestly They all seem fair and have a use. Level 7L It just doesn't make sense to take anything but Psionic Projection. Resonation (should be resonance) has the same problem as Templar's Will insomuch that you have to get close enough to basic, which is usually bad for Tass. Mental Acuity - Never had a need to take it...but if you're against two stealthies, I could see the usefulness, I suppose. But it's hard to argue with that insane range on your two basic abilities. Level 10: Tried force wall, it's ""okay"". I used to prefer it to Archon. It still is nice to be able to block off mofos with, but the passive is just...bleh. Once again, basic attacking is not something Tassadar does very safely, and safety is the name of the game as a support. Archon is cool, but it just doesn't feel like you become very assassin-y. It feels like you get a slight attack buff but with utility attached. I just don't jive terribly well with it. I don't ""FEEL"" like an Archon when I activate it. Level 13: Good tier, actually. I have used both Deep Shift and Nullfication. I'm sure Adun's Wisdom is useful too, but if you have even half-permashield here, it's less an issue. Level 16: Phase Disruption seems to be the only useful one here. Vulnerable is great, as always, and it's a decent AoE vulnerability. The other two seem mostly forgettable. Level 20: Twilight Archon seems decent. Same with Force Barrier, but Shield Battery seems to be the clear victor. If you have any kind of perma-shield, giving your entire party plasma shields saves a lot of casting and...you know...does your job as a support. Other thoughts: I spent too much time just basic attacking because I had nothing better to do. And even then, it just didn't feel like I was doing much because my shields were on an 8 second cooldown. Before permashields, it was a liability to have my ""heal"" be offline that long. All the enemy had to do was target swap and my ""heals"" were essentially ineffectual. Psi Storm after damage nerf is just a minor annoyance that people often didn't even have to move out of because it didn't do a significant amount of damage. tl;dr - Not digging the new Tass rework."
79,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,My Idea for Infested Stukov,0,5r8wp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5r8wp6/my_idea_for_infested_stukov/,2017-02-01 02:44:57,"I have SC2 and I can assure you that fans would love a Support Stukov. The one mission you play with him, he seemed like the infested general commanding the swarm and buffing them with high hp regen and supporting with corrosive bile type abilities. Then he spawned infested terrans. Support doesn't have to simply be point and click healing. It can be passing around buffs/debuffs (which Stukov has in his base kit). Also, because he is 2nd only to Kerrigan, his physique should be that he has high HP and sustain (he's more terran than zerg and terrans are known for their resilience and tenacity). Since he is terran, he also has powerful latent psionic potential. I can think of his base kit like this: Q: Corrosive Bile (damage + vulnerability) W: Spawn Infested Terran. Low cooldown ability to bolster the lane. E: Infested Bunker. **Infested Terrans and Stukov himself can enter this bunker. The Bunker has timed life, its own HP and can be upgraded to move and increase duration** R1: Aleksander (this is from his Terran heritage) R2: Broodling Strike (this is from his psionic potential able to control Zerg with the Hivemind) Ability (passive and active): All units in range have an increase to their armour. Activate to massively boost HP regen for a set time. Yeah I get that even now he looks more specialist than support, but hell, I just want him in the game!"
80,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"I hope that Blizzard ignores all the whining about stuns. I know that if I got stun-trained 100-0, I was MISPOSITIONED.",1485,5srm1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5srm1k/i_hope_that_blizzard_ignores_all_the_whining/,2017-02-08 19:57:28,"And I'm absolutely NOT looking forward to hypermobility characters like Tracer, Illidan and Li-Ming dominating the meta once again if reddit had their will. I get that it's fashionable to whine about heroes that counter the extremely popular hypermobility characters such as Li-Ming, and it's also fashionable to whine whenever a stealth hero is released, but can we just tone it down a notch? Tyrande and Raynor stun durations were nerfed because they're ranged and safe to use, putting the user at no risk. Tyrande's is also potentially an AoE stun and Raynor's is a self-peel with knockback. Muradin was too strong in every aspect back then and he could potentially stun 2 people with the same Q. Same with ETC, Powerslide usually stuns 2 or more people. Uther was an unfortunate kneejerk reaction. You'll always have stun trains. It's part of every MOBA out there. Even if you nerf every hero's stun to 0.5 sec, they'll still find ways to chain CC you, CC is essential to every MOBA. And **the more heroes release, the harder it is to prevent 100-0 chain CC without making the CC-heroes feel like absolute shit**. All you're accomplishing is making the individual heroes' skills feel weak and bad. To make single-CC absolutely worthless. Here's to all of you who complain about **Varian**: * His stun is bound to a CHARGE, that means he will be moving next to the target. There's no way around it. That puts him in a vulnerable position if your own team is positioned correctly. Learn to have your frontline in the front and your backline in the back. Stop overextending on your squishy Valla into Varian's range and then complaining that the enemy team capitalized on that and stunned and killed you. E.g. a Johanna doesn't give a crap about being charged by Varian. Here's to all of you who complain about **Valeera**: * Her stun is only usable in MELEE, from STEALTH. There are metric tons of ways to reveal Valeera before she can close the gap to use her skill. Spot. the. shimmer. If you can't do that in the first place, you have no right to complain at all. Nova can give you instant slow + vulnerability + 1-2k damage from the edge of your screen, yet no one complains about her anymore because she's not Whine of the Month. * Next up: Move away from the shimmer if you have no way to reveal her. At +10% MS, it will take quite a few seconds and a lot of distance for her to close the gap if you're moving away from her. Your teammates should knock her out of stealth as she moves through your entire damn team to reach you. **Valeera doesn't have range like Nova or blink like Zeratul**. * ""Oh but she can just use Vanish and then use the 1 sec unrevealable to use her stun"" you say? What the hell kind of business does a Valeera have just \*walking up\* to your backline without getting blown up? This should never be happening ever, it's a sign of serious misplays. Did your tank sleep? * ""Valeera bursts me 100-0 from stun all by herself all game! OP!"" First off, this is straight up fabrication. Valeera can't 100-0 anyone before level 20 and Cold Blood, and even then only the squishiest of heroes like Tracer. Cheap shot does next to no damage for this exact reason. Valeera already has to choose between damage and CC with her opener, more so now that Garrote will be nerfed damage-wise. What more likely happened was that you were massively overextended, believing that you're about to 1v1 this other guy, and then Valeera came from behind and stunned you and the 2v1 got you killed. Yes, I got blown up by Valeera myself a fair share of times. It was annoying. But I realized that every time it happened, it was because I was super overextended. Now bring on the downvotes for speaking the uncomfortable truth. EDIT: I apologize if this post came across as snarky, I was in a bad mood after reading nerf thread after nerf thread where people were stating completely false things to justify their anger at Varian/Valeera. Thank you kind anonymous redditor for the gold!"
81,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Valeera Build w/ follow up burst (looking at you Li-Ming),1,5toz91,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5toz91/valeera_build_w_follow_up_burst_looking_at_you/,2017-02-13 09:47:07,"This build should be opt'd for if you have follow up burst. Vigor or Combat Readiness --&gt; Initiative --&gt; Slice and Dice --&gt; Smoke Bomb or Cloak of Shadows --&gt; Elusiveness or Blind --&gt; Expose Armor --&gt; Cold Blood The ideal rotation is D~W~W~E~(Q) Right after using Eviscerate, your follow up burst should land and the target is deleted. **Lv 1** With **Vigor** at lv 1 you can use Q right after using your ideal rotation, Vanish-Cheap Shot-Blade Flurry-Eviscerate-AAs and/or Sinister Strike. Tho Q can only be used immediately if completed the globe quest. You can use Q to pursue the target or dash away accordingly without waiting a single second for energy. If **Combat Readiness**, you are more tanky versus AAs, more points gained equals to more tankiness, also charges gained are permanent until his by hero AA. I personally prefer this talent more, even if there is little AAs. **Lv 4** **Initiative** allows you to get 3 combo points without having to wait for energy regain. This talent allows you to get full instant value of Combat Readiness before you get 2 charges before running out of energy, now you get maximum 3 charges before running out of energy. **Lv 7** **Slice and Dice** works well with Initiative, as Initiative is the core talent that brings all the other talents together with this build. Using Eviscerate with 3 combo points to have your next AA be a flurry of AAs for more damage. **Lv 10** Both Ultimates are fine IMO, tho I personally think Cloak of Shadows is better because it scales with skill level. **Lv 13** More speed on Vanish allows you to not fall too behind in rotations in stealth with **Elusiveness**. Think Lunara speed. (Drawback is the first Vanish will not get value from first second makes Valeera unrevealable/passing thru units, the 2nd time you vanish in a team fight will probably get value from passing thru.) Because you are initiating with your stun almost all the time, **Blind** will get value even if there is little AAs. (If the coordination is on point, the target should be bursted down in no more than 1.5 sec of stun, maybe even 1.0 sec of stun) **Lv 16** **Expose Armor**; you get Vulnerability on target after using Eviscerate with 3 combo points, the lv 7 talent flurry of AAs is empowered by the Vunerbility from Expose Armor, with good follow up the target should be 100-0 if the target is deleted fast enough before any heals/peels come by. **Lv 20** **Cold Blood** doubles your Eviscerate damage, and with this build you will be using Eviscerate at 3 points without waiting on energy regain. Well coordinated follow up can even burst down toughest warriors in the game. Thanks !"
82,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Stat analysis from the first weeks of HGC and discussion on some heroes in the competitive meta,44,5tu2hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5tu2hs/stat_analysis_from_the_first_weeks_of_hgc_and/,2017-02-14 04:10:30,"After 4 weeks of HGC (2 weeks for Korea) I think it's time to have a discussion about the competitive meta. Before HGC started, there was a long time with not many professional games with led to some mystery on which heroes were good and which were not. I think now we have a much clearer view of what needs to change. This post is made for discussion, please comment if you disagree with me. All stats are from masterleague.net. ### The heroes that we see too much. These heroes have a popularity higher than 80%, so they see almost every drafts. The meta revolve mostly around these heroes. **Malfurion** (97%) : Out of the 248 games played so far this season, do you know how many did not feature a Malfurion in the draft ? 5. Since the Valeera patch, he has a 100% popularity and he is also the most first-picked hero. Basically you can't go wrong when you pick him. And since he is not game-changing, his ban rate is not too high (14%). It means that we saw him in 83% of games. Malfurion meta. *Verdict* : He obviously needs a nerf. **Ragnaros** (91%) : Ragnaros was OP. He got significantly nerfed, and now... He is still one of the very best heroes in the game. His pick priority has gone down a bit (he was the most first picked hero on the Zul'Jin patch, he is 5th on the Valeera patch), but he still sees about 90% of drafts. Molten Core is still way too impactful in competitive. I don't want him to become useless but he needs to be turned down a bit, right now he is better than every single bruiser / melee assassin (except Zera who has a totally different role), in almost every single situation (only exception I see is Kerrigan on Shrines). He has great sustain, great damage, waveclear, combo potential, cc, one of the most impactful trait in the game... That's a lot of strengths for almost no weakness. He went 32-13 this week-end. *Verdict* : Nerf Molten core. **ETC** (90%) : remember when ETC was not meta ? No ? Me neither. It seems like the meta changes but the cow stays. His best enemy Muradin has left his spot for Varian, but ETC has so much cc and peel, he is just too strong on a coordinated team. If you check all competitive games since Auriel release, ETC is by far the most popular hero with a 83% popularity (next is Malf at 69%). A hero should not see more than 80% of drafts over such a long period. *Verdict* : needs a nerf, fair and simple. He should be where Muradin is now (33% popularity). **Tassadar** (89%) : More than his popularity, what is impressive with Tassadar is his banrate. He was banned in 62% of games, 56% on the Valeera patch (post rework). Teams HATE to deal with him. He allows heroes like Valla, Illidan or Tracer to go ham and destroy entire teams by themselves. But even without those heroes he provides so much vision, survivability, waveclear and shield that he will always work out and be a pain in the ass to the enemy. His winrate doesn't lie : 63% over 68 games. *Verdict* : It's still very early so I would wait a bit. In Korea, since the patch, his popularity is only 46%. I think in the end he will need to be tuned down, probably slightly less shield ? **Tychus** (80%) : I can't be the only one to be so bored to see Tychus every game. He is the default damage dealer right now, because he works is absolutely every situation. He is not the best (actually, his winrate is only 44%), but he will work against single or multiple warrior comp and if you have a bit of cc (which you probably have in the current meta), he can melt anyone. Best thing ? His relative tankiness makes him less vulnerable to cc / burst than his alternatives. His ults are also both very impactful. He needs to become a meaningful pick, not a ""I know I will face at least one tank"" pick. *Verdict* : He needs to be a less safe pick. Less HP, less single target damage ? ### The heroes that we see probably too much too These heroes have around 50-60% popularity. That's more than half the drafts and you're never surprised to see them in a game. **Falstad** (61%) : Global + gust. That's why Falstad is so consistently picked in competitive. He is prioritized very differently in different regions, but he is still pretty good everywhere. In Korea, his popularity goes up to 84% while in NA it goes down to 44% (who needs a global when you have swaps right ?). He has some of the most powerful tools for competitive, it's expected to see him a lot. The meta is very macro centered which helps him. *Verdict* : I think he's fine. Let's see if the Hinterland Blast change will have an impact. **Zarya** (58%) : Curiously, Zarya has at the same time one of the highest ban rate (31%, second to Tassadar) and lowest winrate : only 40% over 67 games. What does that tell us ? That even if she's not so powerful, players hate to deal with this shield meta. I really don't think she's OP right now but the shields enable the Valla meta which is becoming pretty boring (double support + double warrior are good once in a while, but it's not the most entertaining meta). She promotes very defensive play. *Verdict* : maybe make her less like a support and more like a warrior ? **Rehgar** (57%) : Second best support now, he is not significantly better than his viable counterparts (Kharazim, Brightwing, Auriel, Medic) like Malf can be. He is pretty much exactly where you would want your supports to be imo. *Verdict* : don't change him, he's great. **Li-Ming** (54%) : Ok, I have some news for you : Li-Ming is now actually a high skill cap hero. It took some time but she's not a meme anymore. To get value from your Li-Ming, you need to land most of your spells. This is pretty hard against pro players. Some of the best plays in HGC so far featured a Li-Ming getting crazy value thanks to mechanical outplays and good support ([my favorite](URL *Verdict* : I don't think she needs further nerfs. What she needs is viable alternatives other than Gul'Dan and Jaina : like Lunara, Kael'Thas or even Guillotine Zul'Jin ? **Zeratul** (53%) : Zeratul has something very special, he has the best ult in the game for competitive, but a pretty average one for unorganized play. He relies entirely on his team following up on his set up. If the team does, he is insanely powerful. If not, there is very little he can do (even the best Zera players agree that he is not the best carry right now if your team can't follow up on your VPs). Right now he has a 60% winrate over 80 games and the corner stone of the wombo combo meta. The shorter range on VP hurt him but with his rework he is so mobile that he has no problem getting in the heart of the enemy team to trap them all. One fun stat tho. He was first-picked 10 times this week-end (second most after Malf) but only won one of those games. He still has solid counters. *Verdict* : His Void Prison is just way too impactful, I think it deserves a very small nerf. Maybe radius, maybe cooldown, maybe duration... On the other hand, he is one of the most entertaining hero to watch, so I wouldn't mind him staying like that as long as it's not out of control. **Varian** (50%) : Varian on Zul'Jin patch ? 34% popularity. On Valeera patch ? 85%. He is even the third most first-picked hero and has a solid 58% winrate overall. His problem, you know it, is how powerful Taunt is. 2.25 point and click stun ? He's the leader with ETC of the current cc meta and many people are getting annoyed already even if he has only been meta for 3 days. Varian biggest strength should be his flexibility and the fact that you can completely change your hero at lvl 10 depending on the situation. Right now there is only one build, and he relies entirely on deleting heroes with a point and click stun. *Verdict* : nerf his cc, and make his other builds viable. ### The heroes that we don't see enough These heroes saw play, but not much. They all have been picked or banned less than 8 times (out of 248 games). Number of games played in parenthesis. I won't talk about heroes that have never been meta (except because of bugs) and are not designed to fit in competitive : Nova, Gazlowe and Raynor. Also won't talk about Abathur and Valeera who get buffed next patch. Also won't talk about Sonya since it's too early to make any conclusion. Note that TLV, Alarak, Chen, Azmodan, Li Li, Stitches, The Butcher, Zagara and Cho'Gall all have a 0% winrate in HGC so far. **Tyrande** (8) : Remember one year ago, when Tyrande could do everything from healing to damage including cc, vulnerability and great vision ? Now it seems that she can't do anything right. There isn't really anything she does better than other heroes. What I would like for her is to become the first support - assassin multiclass hero in the game. One possibility would be to chose her Q as lvl 1, between her current one and something like her current trait, so either heal or damage. Then some passive buffs at lvl 10 to further accentuate your decision (like +20% ability damage, +20% AA damage and +20% healing output). Her trait could become a version of trueshot aura baseline (I don't really like traits that feel exactly like an ability). Then you would have three builds : auto-attack, stun / burst damage and healing (which could work as a solo healer, like Varian can work as solo tank) with some utility here and there. She should not be a bottom tier pick in a chain stun meta. *Verdict* : She needs some love. She would probably fit way more as a multiclass hero. **The Lost Vikings** (4) : 4 games in HGC (3 from Synergy), 4 losses : The Lost Vikings are not working currently. However, the playstyle is so different and impactful on the way the game is played that you definitely don't want them to become meta. I think they stay relevant as a cheesy pick. One way to make them come back in a non-cheesy fashion would be to rework their talent tree so they have a viable playstyle where they are grouped from lvl 1. That would need to change them completely. *Verdict* : They're pretty much where they belong unless they get a major rework. **Alarak** (3) : 3 defeats in 3 games. From one of the most entertaining heroes to watch, that's definitely disappointing. Alarak should be competing with Zeratul as one of the best enabler in the game. His design is perfect for competitive, both for players and viewers (I mean look at [this](URL He's just clearly underpowered right now and miles away from the meta. His talent tree is pretty terrible. Verdict : He needs love. Please make him viable again and give him proper talents that you actually want to pick. **Chen** (3) : In this world of stuns and double warriors, our panda struggles to stay alive and harass the backline (what is a backline anyway ? A Tychus, a Malf and a Zarya ? Good luck harassing that). I think he should have the weapons to be less susceptible to cc. Right now he's just a desperate pick (3 losses in 3 games). *Verdict* : Give him some armor while drinking (that stays for like 1-2s afterward) or just wait that the meta switches to something more fitting for him. That could take a long time. **Kael'Thas** (2) : You know who should love a good old stun chain meta ? A mage with a stun as a basic ability. The problem is that Kael'Thas in team fights now relies almost exclusively on enemies' blatant positioning mistakes to spread bombs and stay in your aoe. That obviously won't work in competitive. If players like Mene and Lockdown don't pick him, it means that he's not good enough. Obviously I don't want to come back to a Kael'Thas first pick meta but since Auriel release he has a 4% popularity and 40% winrate. He should be a hard counter to Auriel. *Verdict* : Give him some burst damage back. Make him able to make plays even if the enemy team is not making huge mistakes. **Lunara** (2) : 12 games played since Varian release while Malfurion was picked or banned more than 500 times. Honestly, I feel like if she was removed from the game I wouldn't really notice it. She's very rarely played in HL or competitive, very rarely talked about, just forgotten by most people. Please Blizzard, give her a third basic ability. On this sub she was elected third most boring assassin after Raynor and Nova (and Gall who is very special), two heroes that are completely unfit for competitive. Lunara completely lacks that ""fun factor"". *Verdict* : Replace Wisp with something actually good. Give her an impactful ult. Make her fun. **Azmodan** (2) : He's getting changes often, but he's still pretty much absent from the competitive scene. 2 games in HGC, 2 defeats. It seems like Blizzard has not given up on him but honestly I'm not sure there is a solution. Once again, I could see him becoming a specialist - assassin multiclass hero. [This thread](URL is pretty good about some of his problems. I think having only one impactful ability (depending on which build you go) is not a good design. *Verdict* : I don't know what would be the solution for him. I just hope Blizzard will keep trying so he can find a niche big enough for his fat ass. **Li Li** (2) : I don't know if you noticed, but Li Li is absolutely terrible right now. I mean, she was never a strong pick in competitive, but she usually had that 54% winrate in HL that made people say ""hey, maybe she is alright in lower leagues and for new players"". She was even picked many times as an Illidan counter (usually with success). But now ? She is at 46% winrate in HL, the lowest of any healer. This shouldn't be the case for such an easy hero that gets value no matter what. I would love if she was a strong second support against AA heavy teams (like you know, double warrior double support + Valla teams). Verdict : regardless the fact that she doesn't really fit into competitive, she needs a buff. **Stitches** (2) : A little bit of armor was nowhere near enough for him to become viable. He still can't really fulfill his role and hooks are too unreliable to compensate that. Maybe it's time to give an actual real buff to Stitches, get him out of his 40-45% winrate in HL and see what happens then ? Stitches still wants to play ! *Verdict* : give slam a slow effect. Accept that hook is not as impactful as it once was when most heroes have mobility / invulnerability and other tools to survive. **The Butcher** (1) : Where to start ? Since his rework (Alarak patch), there has been 771 games played according to masterleague. Stitches was picked 6 times... All of them by TBD / Team expert (5 of them in the ZOTAC cup, not a very important competition for them). If you remove adrd creative mind from the equation, The Butcher has not been picked once in an official game since his rework. Not. Once. He is arguably the most one-dimensional hero in the game and he has so many drawbacks (terrible early game, no survivability, no escape, easily counterable damage, sustain countered by simply walking) I don't see how he would fit in any meta. Even Team expert almost always picks him with Medivh so he gets some needed mobility. Verdict : rework him from the start to make him less one-dimensional, or give up on him being ever competitively viable. Blizzard seems to be going for the latter. **Zagara** (1) : Yes, Zagara is still in the game. I know, I was surprised too. She is a beautiful case of overnerf that effectively made her go from OP to incredibly bad. The design is still good but she has practically no value whatsoever anymore. Supreme Mixtape, down 2-0 against MVP Black, decided to remind some people that she indeed existed. MVP Black won with a 5 level lead and 15 kills to zero. Thanks Zagara. Verdict : reverse some of the nerfs. It's just a number issue, pretty easy to solve. **Cho'Gall** : It has been said again and again, Cho'Gall is terrible and needs a lot of love. He is one of the most interesting heroes in the game, but he just feels like a marketing tool right now since you never ever see him in a game (even in Brawls !). Verdict : Give Cho a trait so he is resistant to percentage-based damage. Blizzard needs to accept that he is a hero in the game and that it should be possible to play him. ###Some winrates out of the ordinary Here are some heroes with surprising winrates in HGC. Even if the sample size is small (and therefore winrates are not as meaningful as pickrates), it's still interesting. **Tracer** (14-4, 77%) : Tracer is not played that much but when she is, she usually wins. Even Naventic won two games with her ! The Tracer - Tassadar combo is currently 9-2 in HGC (7-1 before Tassadar rework). She is the definition of carry in the current meta (even more so than Valla), she can kill an entire team with good support and mechanical outplays. *Verdict* : Need to wait the effects of Tassadar changes to see if it was what made her so good. She seems to be in a good spot and is very entertaining to watch. **Leoric** (16-9, 64%) : Leoric works well in a warrior heavy meta. Good for him. Maybe he is a bit underrated ? Verdict : Good job Leo. Keep spooking skeleton king. **Anub'Arak** (3-14, 17%) : Anub has only been played on HGC EU so far, and he didn't show great things. He was mostly played by the weaker team against a stronger one, which explains his winrate. He seems to be a desperate EU pick. *Verdict* : EU loves to try new things. This one is not working. **Uther** (2-7, 22%) : Until yesterday, Uther was at 0-7 but MVP Miracle and Dignitas decided both to win one game with him and save his abysmal winrate. Uther has been a bottom tier healer for a while now, the recent armor addition hinted to some bigger changes. Let's hope they'll come soon. *Verdict* : Uther is terrible right now, let's just wait for the rework. **Illidan** (5-13, 27%) : Like Chen, he suffers a lot in the current meta. Even with Tassadar or Tyrael, he gets countered way too easily by the stun chains. Maybe the Abathur buffs and Uther rework will help him. *Verdict* : Illidan balance is so subtle that I wouldn't touch him at all. Buff his friends, he'll come back in ten thousand years with a lot of hatred. **Artanis** (13-32, 28%) : popularity in Korea : 10%. Popularity in EU : 18%. Popularity in NA : 71%. Artanis is a beautiful representation of the NA scene : flashy, but widely ineffective. The fact that he's picked so much only in NA, and that he struggles so much to win tells a lot about NA approach to the games (the ""I need to make plays and carry the game"" mentality) and EU and Korean one (""I need that my teammates and I stay alive while we constantly put pressure on the opponent""). Fortunately, it seems that NA is quickly learning that Artanis is nowhere as good as they thought he was. Don't go into the clash against EU with Artanis picks, that won't work. Verdict : NA please. You're embarrassing yourself. TL;DR : nerf Malf, ETC, Ragnaros, Tychus and Varian (Tass and Zera are a maybe). Buff Uther, Tyrande, Chen, Alarak, Li Li, Stitches, Lunara, Cho'Gall and Zagara. Pray for Azmodan and Butcher."
83,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Some questions to other Greyman mains out there,0,5tz9sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5tz9sn/some_questions_to_other_greyman_mains_out_there/,2017-02-14 20:26:47,"Hello there, So, Greyman is getting his other ult, you know, the one you can't remember the name because you never picked it, ever. Oh yes ! Marked for the Kill ! Reminder of the spell : Shapeshift into a Human and fire a bullet that hits the first enemy Hero in its path for 190 (+4% per level) damage. For 5 seconds, they are Vulnerable, taking 25% more damage. Each time you deal damage to the Vulnerable Hero, the duration is refreshed. In the next patch, this heroic is getting renamed and changed : Marked for the Kill (R) Renamed to Cursed Bullet New Functionality: Fires a bullet that hits the first Hero in its path, dealing 35% of their current Health as damage. Cannot hit Vehicles. 30 second cooldown, costs 50 Mana. - A quick question : It's shown as new functionality, so we'll still have the 25% vulnerability ? - If so, another more general question : It nerfs the armor for 25, so it's about physical damages not magical, am I right ? The debuff only helps for the AA ? A stupid question now : Are all the basic abilities magic damages ? I mean, they're all shown as purple damages, and I would like to know if lowing for 25 the armor of an ennemy allowed a mage, or just our basic abilities to deal 25% more damages as well ?

84,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,I have an Idea for a (set) of Varian changes to bring his 3 ults more in line in value with one another,0,5um7v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5um7v1/i_have_an_idea_for_a_set_of_varian_changes_to/,2017-02-18 00:55:12,"So as many people are currently aware, Taunt Varian is a bit overbearing right now and the other Varian playstyles are vastly under-performing. A large part of why this is, is because of the buffs to the overpower talent at level one that allows Taunt Varian to get insane burst damage off from his combo via resetting heroic strikes. Another reason is because in a recent patch they removed the ""downside"" of picking taunt which was the reduced attack speed Varian got in exchange for the bonus health. Yet Colossal Smash and Twin Blades of Fury still have their downsides that were written in. I propose to blizzard that they remove the downsides on his Assassin Ultimates, yet to balance this outthey reduce the damage of Heroic Strike. This way Taunt is no longer doing more burst damage than Colossal Smash, yet its still doing its job of hard single target lock down. Colossal Smash isnt getting deleted as immediately, however due to the nature of colossal smash causing vulnerability on the target, heroic strike will still get a lot of bonus damage done. Twin Blades will now be doing his normal damage on his autos but the ""crit"" damage every third attack will be lowered, thus making him more consistent (this in turn will also buff Second Wind in tandem with TBoF because of overall increased healing) All in all I think these changes will make his Assassin Heroics more viable (I still dream of seeing a Warbringer/Twin Blade Varian do well in Professional Games) All the while making Taunt still do its job effectively, without making it too overbearing. Also let Taunt Varian see his damage taken stat please. "

How does the Varian look like? +50% Health, +50% Attack damage with +115% auto-attack speed. Oh, he also has a strong ranged slow that affects you for 2 seconds, a stun on a low CD and a stun + a vulnerability effect. His W protects him, and destroys auto-attackers as well. His AAs grant him a lot of sustain. His charge owns you, he also lowers your healing, and destroys shields. He has the three banners on a low CD, and can reduce your damage by 25%. Oh, and to avoid stunlocks, he's unstoppable, *at least immune to stun and silences*. (otherwise fight would be pretty meh for varian player) I don't know if it's winnable, but it looks at least fun enough to try. xD"
86,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Sylvanas Talent Tree Ideas,10,5k7g7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5k7g7e/sylvanas_talent_tree_ideas/,2016-12-25 18:32:48,"Right now I find Sylvanas talent tree to be a random collection of buffs that dont seem to have any synergy or theme. While I know there are other heroes that probably deserve a look before her, I play Sylvanas more than any other champion and would like to put out my ideas on how to improve the feel of her talent tree and make the whole thing less cookie cutter. Right now there are a few talents that dominate each talent tier for Sylvanas. My main goal with this rework is to promote synergies and buff/nerf certain talents so that each talent in each tier has their own specific reason to be chosen. What Ive found is if two talents on the same tier do the same thing in different ways, one will always be better. To help with this, Ive thought of three main builds that are promoted within the talent tree. Each path uses synergizing talents to become stronger, but the individual talents are still decent by themselves. So even if you start building one direction in the beginning of the game, it might still help to stray from the main build and pick and choose talents from another path. The three main builds that I tried to create are: 1.) An aggressive single target burst path that utilizes Withering Fire and the reset provided by Haunted Wave to barrage your enemy with damage quickly until you run out of cooldowns. 2.) A defensive poke build that utilizes Shadow Dagger to stay back on the edge of the fight and deal AoE damage to a group of enemies. 3.) A split push build that buffs up Black Arrow to make it easier to consistently keep Structures locked down and adds extra value when pushing with mercenaries and map objectives. To start, the only thing I would like to change with Sylvanas base kit is: **Haunted Wave  Send forth a wave of banshees dealing moderated damage to all targets. Reactivate to teleport to the banshees location and recharge all stacks of Withering Fire.** - Right now Sylvanas feels like an entirely new hero before and after level 13. The ability to use Haunting Wave as both an offensive and defensive ability is both fun and allows for more quick decision making. Wrapping this effect into the base kit will eliminate the huge change in playstyle at level 13 and end the boring wait for the talent in the early game. **Level 1** **Overflowing Quiver  When a nearby enemy dies, regain an additional charge of Withering Fire.** **Shadow Dagger Reach  Increase the range from which shadow dagger can spread by 100%.** Paralysis  Increases duration of Black Arrows by 75%. - Currently Paralysis dominates the first tier of Sylvanas because that buffs up Black Arrow, which is usually the reason shes chosen to begin with. So I buffed up Overflowing Quiver by allowing it to be used against enemy heroes to put it on the same level and created an option that will allow Shadow Dagger to very consistently spread between a more spread out group of people. **Level 4** Withering Barrage  Increase Withering Fire charges by 1. Charges can be fired 33% faster. Lost Soul  Reduce Shadow Daggers cooldown by 1.25 seconds each time it spreads to a Hero. **Mercenary Queen  Friendly non-Boss Mercenaries near you deal 50% more damage and you deal 100% increased damage to enemy Mercenaries.** - The level 4 talents already mostly fit into the builds I wanted to create, With the Wind was removed because as having the 25% increase in range only helps with random poke because of how the auto-aim functions, and having Lost Soul on the same tree gave you absolutely no reason to want With the Wind. Mercenary Queen was moved down to level 4 and buffed to allow Sylvanas to kill camps by herself in a timely fashion. **Level 7** Unstable Poison  Minions and Mercenaries that die under the effects of Black Arrow Explode, dealing (121 + 4% per level) damage to nearby enemies. Does not damage Heroes of Structures. **Possession  Force an enemy Minion to fight for you. 3 charges. Global range.** **Crumbling Shadow  Friendly minions and monsters deal 50% increased damage to structures inflicted with Black Arrow.** - Right now all level 7 talents only effect PvE and Barbed Shot is the clear winner. It allows for faster takedown of waves, mercenaries, and structures. I tried to keep with Blizzards line of thinking and keep this tier all PvE, but made each talent specialize in a different way. Unstable Poison is basic wave clear. Possession is a weaker wave clear, but with global range I think it might see play on large maps, and Crumbling Shadow is a talent that will further push Sylvanas role as a hero that can back up map mechanics that push and be the chosen talent if wave clear is not needed. **Level 13** Windrunner  After you teleport from Haunted Wave, you can cast a second one for free within 2 seconds. **Evasive Dagger  Shadow Dagger increases your movement speed by 10% for 3 seconds each time it spreads to a new enemy hero, stacking up to 5 times.** Will of the Forsaken  Activate to become Unstoppable and gain 30% Movement Speed for 3 seconds. Spell Shield  Upon taking Ability Damage, reduce that damage and further Ability Damage by 50% for 3 seconds. Can only trigger once every 30 seconds. - Windrunner is nerfed to no longer include the reset on Withering Fire, so Will of the Forsaken and Spell Shield will feel less punishing to take if needed to counter then enemy team. I also created a new talent to replace Life Drain to allow for more evasion of damage than straight up healing through it. Life Drain always felt weird and out of place to me and I dont think Sylvanas needs sustain like that with such premium escape available. **Level 16** **Withering Barrage  Withering Fire deals an additional 10% damage if you hit the same target in a row, up to an additional 50% damage.** **Overwhelming Affliction  Withering Fire slows enemies by 6% for 1 second, stacking up to 5 times. Upon reaching 5 stacks the enemy is rooted for 1 second. Stacks are reset when root ends.** **Cold Embrace  Shadow Dagger makes all targets it inflicts Vulnerable, taking 10% more damage, for 2 seconds.** **Black Arrow Spread  Refreshing Black Arrows on a target already inflicted causes the effect to jump to the nearest enemy.** - Cold Embraces vulnerability was made to inflict all targets with a smaller vulnerability to better work with the AoE poke build. Overwhelming Affliction was made to be more impactful crowd control and another option was made to also increase single target burst damage. The last talent is supposed to create a continuous Shadow Dagger type spread effect of Black Arrow. This is to create easier and safer positioning while constantly locking down multiple towers or forts. **Level 20** Deafening Blast  Enemies at the center of Wailing Arrows explosion take 50% more damage and are silenced for twice as long. Dark Ladys Call  Mind Controlled enemies gain 100% Movement Speed for the duration. **Black Arrow Plague  Black Arrow deals (154 + 4% per level) damage every second.** Bolt of the Storm  Activate to teleport to a nearby location. - Its hard to beat Bolt of the Storm in terms of talent power, but I think replacing Fury of the Storm with something that stays with Sylvanas theme is more of a personal preference and honestly isn't a priority cause I'd probably still be picking bolt. TL;DR; : Sylvanas' talent tree doesn't have very many synergies and feels more like a collection of random buffs with no theme and a clear winner each tier. I propose reworking talents to showcase three main builds that will help variety: A Withering Fire single target burst, a Shadow Dagger AoE poke, and a Black Dagger split pushing build."

He has moderate healing, peel, ability to save allies, and tools to mitigate damage for his team.* # *In exchange for this; to CC he needs to put himself in harms way, and to mitigate, he transfers the damage onto himself. He has incredibly low mobility and offensive potential to emphasize the role of Protector first and foremost.* # *He is best with an Allied Hero at his side making the world a safer place; but is able to hold his own in battle, locking down and punishing any monstrous creature which should make foes think twice about diving or focusing him* ____________________________________________________________________ ##[Who is Kormac?](URL [Kormac is a follower in Diablo 3.](URL He is a ""Templar"" very similar to the crusader, [BUT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME!](URL He's a holy meat shield that taunts enemies, heals your character and has incredibly over the top voice acting that chews the scenery while adding some humor to what is a very depressing game. And if you ever get into his lore, it's even more depressing as he was conscripted and brainwashed into blindly following his order as they beat him every day to remove the taint of joy and sin. So yeah. His full Wiki page here: URL [**Why Kormac?**](URL because he's [GLORIOUS! And he won't give in, no, he won't give in until he's VICTORIOUS! And he will defend, HE WILL DEFEND!](URL Ok, kidding aside, there seems to be a lack of supports. Not only that, but there seems to be a lack of ""tanky supports."" I understand supports need to have a weakness to prevent them from being overpowered and being easy to focus is the best way to balance them. However, I think sacrificing a bit of healing output and a lot of offensive power can free up the power budget for a lot of CC and damage mitigation to allies. I guess you can even call him a ""multiclass"" but I won't because I think it's a silly idea, and [I don't want to play 850 games with only two characters.](URL Also, with the lack of Diablo Heroes, the devs can pretty much kill 3 birds with one stone. A Support, which is Tanky, and from Diablo. ___________________________________________________ ##Abilities These are just proposed abilities, I really didn't think of numbers, so some may look weak, others may seem OP, but just look at the idea instead of raw numbers. Also, I want to emphasize ""looking out for your allies"" really paying attention to your teammates, down to what buffs and debuffs they have. I think this can be a core idea and focus to him. He is a COMPANION first and foremost; he is not the hero of the story, but helps the hero in anyway he can. - **Trait: Loyalty** - *Every 20 seconds, Kormac can grant resistant to an Ally, reducing incoming damage by 50% for four seconds. When of the effect ends, Half of the damage prevented is transferred to Kormac over 4 seconds* What does this mean? OK, let's say a 1K MingLee ball is about to crash into an ally; you cast loyalty, negate 500 damage from resistant, but 250 of that damage is transferred to you. If your ally has any vulnerabilities, you still reduce some damage, but you take more as well. It's also a Damage over time effect, meaning he can cast it and channel something without breaking the channel when the effect ends, also allows him to B back, find a way to heal up, or, with a Medivh/Uther, can negate the damage entirely. Another Idea is that it costs max health to put resistant, but doesn't transfer damage. I thought of that, but it feels more ""Blood Mage"" than Holy Protector. The numbers for this example may be underwhelming for what I proposed, either him taking too much damage, or not preventing enough; but what I mean is more of the ""Share you pain"" mechanic. He defends you, and instead, has a portion of the damage passed on to him. If you make the transfer too high, you risk killing Kormac or only being able to pull it off once. Too low, has no impact. So someone who's better with numbers can figure out how to make it effective. No matter what the numbers end up being, this is kind of core. - **Q: Inspire** - *Kormach Heals an Ally for X Amount, and increasing their Health and Mana regeneration by 50% for 3 seconds. Kormac also heals for 50% of the amount if used on an Allied Hero* Bread and butter heal. The little bonus to regen is not a ""Heal over time."" If your ally has a talent to increase their regen, such as Chen with Brewmaster's Balance, Li Ming's Astral Presence or Johanna with Laws of Hope, it helps them out as well. Also, he cannot heal himself directly. He needs a companion to heal for him to benefit which emphasizes being close to allies.. This will balance him to make sure he's not a self-healing frontliner or able to solo merc camps, which combined with his kit could be very troubling. The Cooldown will be about 6-10 seconds. I want a shorter CD to be able to be cast multiple times in a fight to make up for it being his only healing spell, and shores up the lower single target output for CD (Balance and what not) by having that regen boost attached. - **W: Intimidate** - *Area of effect: Kormac lets out a mighty roar, slowing enemies around him attack speed is reduced by 25% and Movement speed by 75% that decays over 2 seconds* This initially deals no damage, (Or very minor damage to just interrupt channels and reveal stealthies, I mean like 5 damage) but it can with talents. This is a form of peel and protection for your allies. I think about it as if an ally is being dove hard by a Melee assassin or chased by an AA assassin, you can pop Initimidate to not only give them an opening to escape but also mitigate some oncoming damage. - **E: Onslaught** - *Passive: Every 4 consecutive attacks on an enemy hero stuns them for .75 second* - *Active: Activate to increase your Attack speed by 100% and damage by 50% for 4 seconds but no longer stunning enemies* OK, so another form of peel if you're ignored, meaning another reason for them to focus or at least push you out of the fight. But he does need some offensive utility in case you may be too slow to get the stun off. So Activating it means you're giving up the stun, but instead gives Kormac a lot of damage in a window to either dissuade attackers into chasing or have them fight you. Also, I should mention, he's may either be weilding a spear or a sword and board (As most art depicts him as such) so his AS will be pretty slow, probably 1.0 or lower just to make sure Uther doesn't feel power creeped. So if you get hit 4 times in a row by him, you kinda have it coming. - **HEROIC 1: Guardian** - *Kormac becomes unstoppable and charges to an ally; cleansing them, preventing the reapplication of Crowd control and granting 40% move speed for 1 second while knocking back enemies, effectively stunning them for .25 seconds* Reverse Tyrael Charge. This is meant to save an ally from being collapsed upon. The mini-stun isn't really meant for set up to wombo combo, but just to stop channeling abilities such as a Valla's Strafe or Tychus's Minigun so your ally can get away and not be mowed down in the process. The Unstoppable isn't as much as an escape but just to make sure you're not interrupted if you're saving an ally. The Unstoppable ends when you make contact and cleanse the ally. So think of the immunity being passed from you to them. But if you can weave it in to make it an escape, that would be a nice little way to add mechanical complexity to a pretty straight forward Hero. For a level 20 upgrade; I'm thinking a lower CD and a heal attached. - **HEROIC 2: Intervene** - ~~*Kormac charges an enemy stunning them for 1.25 seconds and taunts all other nearby enemies for 1.25 second, gaining 25% resistance for the duration*~~ - *Kormac becomes Unstoppable and charges towards an enemy Hero, knocking it away, and Taunt all other surrounding enemy Heroes for 1.25 seconds. If the enemy Hero collides with terrain, he takes 300 damage and is stunned for 1.25 seconds.* (Thanks to /u/Misfiring for polishing it up a bit and adding a new mechanic) Another Peel. While Guardian is more of a Backline protection tool, this is more frontline protection. If your tank is taking a bit too much damage, you can pop this to give them a small reprieve. But since you may not have the needed kit to survive such focus, it probably shouldn't be used as an engage tool. The Taunt means you can have up to 4 people beating on you, so if they're at full strength, even though Kormac might like it (Kinky.) it may do more harm than good. Other warriors may be more apt to handle the retaliation at the start of the fight, but you can save them if they stay in too long or take more damage than anticipation. For a level 20 upgrade, you can heal nearby allies for 50% of the damage you take. ___________________________________________________ ##Talent Ideas Ok, so, I'm not going to put level tiers or whatever, since I haven't thought it that far ahead of synergies and what might be broken, so instead, I'll put in ideas based on abilities they augment. Some may seem contridictory (Such as increasing damage he takes, but healing damage he takes as well) but that doesn't mean they're going to be on different tiers to make another one useless. Also, all of these are based on his quotes. - **Loyalty talents** - *I do not fear pain!* Lowering CD to 10 seconds, but increases damage taken by 100% (Meaning, looking at our Li Ming example, you would reduce 50% but take the full 500 damage instead) - *The Will of a Templar*: Heals all Nearby Heroes for 50% of the damage Kormac takes after the effect ends - *I feel like a new man!:* No longer transfers damage to Kormac - *I will not stand down!:* Kormac gains movement speed and Attack damage while using Loyalty on an allied hero - *Betrayal can never be forgiven!* Loyalty can now be cast on enemy heroes, transferring 25% of the damage Kormac receives to the target. - **Inspire Talents** - *Within me, the Light grows stronger!* Increases initial heal and adds a Second Charge but increases CD - *The Light grows stronger within you!*: Increases the regen after effect by 100% and lasts for an extra 1 second - *Lead the way to glory!*: Gives Ally Attack Damage or Ability power for 3 seconds after they are healed. - *By all that is holy!* Increases self-healing to Kormac by 50% and also gains the baseline regeneration bonus - *Let us seek honor together.* 30% Damage done by your Inspire target heals Kormac for 3 seconds. - **Intimidate talents** - *Give me a real battle!:* Deals 5% max health damage to enemies afflicted - *A worthy opponent!*: Adds Vulnerability to the enemy closest to Kormac increasing the damage they take by 25% - *Always wanted to fight some of these!*: Movement Speed Slow no longer decays. - *A well-deserved death!*: Intimidate cooldown is reset on enemy takedowns. - *Grossly Incandescent!*: (OK, this quote is actually from Dark Souls, but I couldn't pass it up) Now blinds enemies instead of reducing their attack speed for the duration - **Onslaught talents** - *May the battles never end!:* Basic Attacks on enemy heroes refresh the duration of Onslaught - *Stronger than my shield* During the Active duration on Onslaught, attacks to enemy heroes deal 1.5% of their max health as damage and Kormac heals for 1.5% of his max health - *Tis but a scratch!*: Gains Resistant during the Active Duration of Onslaught - *We'll rip these brutes to shreds!*: Now Stuns every 3 attacks instead of 4 and increases active duration by 2 seconds - *Do you see that enemy!?* Basic attacks during the Active portion of Onslaught reveal the enemy for 4 seconds - *Just a skirmish* Reduces duration by 1 second, but lowers the CD by 50% and removes resource cost. - **Unique Level 20 talents** - *Warrior of the Templar Order:* Loyalty now affects all allies in a large area. If Kormac takes fatal damage during this time; the effect prematurely ends and he is restored to 35% of his max health. (In theory he can heal 35% of his max health every 20 seconds, but he'll be at a low enough HP that he can't really scrap on the front lines, turning him more into a backline damage sponge) - *Initiation of the Templar Order:* Chains an enemy hero to the ground for 4 seconds and making them vulnerable for the duration so you and your allies may purge their sin. The chain can be targeted and destroyed by enemies (Think of a Butcher's Lamb, but no silence and can break free with damage. This allows you to recreate just a small portion of what Kormac went through to become a Templar.) ___________________________________________________________ **Conclusion:** I like the idea of a Warrior Priest; A support really focused on their allies and being a team player, but also doesn't crumble in the face battle. [He fights for Glory, For Honor, and For the Light!](URL As you can see from the proposed abilities, he really doesn't have skill shots or complexity. He's definitely an ""introductory"" Hero, that focuses more on paying attention to your allies and combo-ing your abilities than crazy amount of mechanical depth. His Skill Ceiling comes more from knowledge, awareness to allies, and using abilities with a purpose. He may not be great in solo queue, but I think he can shine in organized play. I think more defensive focused players, like myself, would enjoy this sort of hero. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, feel free to post in the comments. Also, silly vid in case you got sad from reading his wiki: URL"

I think the class has fantastic potential in HotS. I enjoy thinking up mechanical functions but I'm not really a number-smith. That's for the dev teams. This is just 1 draft of an idea that could 'potentially' function probably a dozen different ways...so here goes. Trait: Gain a different passive based on form... Bear: Gain a permanent resistance buff, something like 10%? Cat: Gain 20% attack speed, normal stealth(3 seconds rule) Caster: Mana regen Shapeshifting breaks movement debuffs Z: Travel form. 4-5 second cooldown, regular mounted speed. Q:Bear form. Shapeshift into a bear, costs mana, 4s cooldown Reactivate to use Bash-damage and 1 second stun, costs mana, medium coldown. W: Cat form. Shapeshift into a cat, costs mana, 4s cooldown Reactivate to use Shred, deals bonus damage behind enemy. Causes 1 second vulnerability if used from stealth, applies to its own damage E: Druid form. Shapeshift back into humanoid form, no mana cost, 2 second cooldown(lower CD seems mechanically appropriate somehow) Reactivate to cast Thorns/Barkskin or something on self or ally, or cyclone/sleep/entangling roots on an enemy(Not sure which options would work out best) for a (shared) high mana cost/cooldown. So a flex ability to be used on enemy or friendly with differing effects... Ult ideas... Mangle: costs mana, 20 second cooldown Deals moderate-high damage, causes subsequent attacks/abilities from you to cause .75~ seconds of vulnerability for the next 4 seconds~ Useable in Cat or Bear form Feral Charge: costs mana, 30 second shared cooldown Bear form: Charge an enemy dealing low-moderate damage and rooting them in place for 1 second Cat form: Leap behind an enemy and increase the damage of the next ability by 20% for 3 seconds, does not break stealth. Ferocious Spirit (Passive) 6 second cooldown Basic attacks heal you for 5% of your maximum health. So basically rip a bunch of WoW Feral druid abilities and talents and quantify them into a HotS format. Above ults could also just be talent picks. It could totally work. You could build for Bear, or for Cat, and have a few abilities tossed in that could be used in either form, like Faerie Fire for instance. Not sure what an E build would look like though... This would be hella fun and be what I always wanted feral druid to be when I played WoW in BC. Me: ""I'm a shapeshifter, I should be shapeshifting all the time not building for 1 or the other!!! Curse these talent choices!!!"" Thoughts?"
91,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,The new Armor/Resistance system and how it works,353,5m0avs,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5m0avs/the_new_armorresistance_system_and_how_it_works/,2017-01-05 04:07:53,"The latest patch gives some heroes 'Armor'. What is it and what does it do? Here we go: Armor and how it works: - X% armor = X% dmg reduction, 10 armor means that if something does 100 damage, it will only deal 90 to you and so on - Physical armor reduces damage from auto attacks (both heroes and minions do auto attacks, most likely also including buildings since you can evade/parry those cannonballs too) - Magical armor reduces damage from abilities - If its just 'Armor' it means its both physical and magical so a flat out damage reduction for all damage recieved - Armor damage reduction will stack with other damage reduction effects, example: Arthas has 15 armor, and Morales her Safeguard gives you 25% reduced damage, if you cast it on Arthas he will take 15+25 = 40% less damage from all sources (because they are added, not multiplied) - Edit: turns out the previous example is not entirely correct, since Arthas only has physical armor. The correct example then means that if Arthas gets hit by an auto attack while safeguarded, he would recieve 40% less damage if he gets hit by an auto attack, but if he gets hit by ability damage, he will only take 25% less damage (since his passive physical armor won't reduce ability damage, so only Safeguard resistance works) - Vulnerable effects will also stack in the same way - There is a hard cap of 75% damage reduction, no matter how many things you stack on a hero you will never get more than 75% damage reduction (so no 'completely immune 100% damage reduction shennannigans are possible) - There is a hard cap for vulnerability effects as well, that one is 25%, so stacking both Tyrande's Hunters Mark and Sylvanas's Shadow dagger with the level 16 talent will still only result in 25% more damage recieved, rather than 50%. You can also read all of this [here](URL where Matt Cooper explains why they're doing it and what they're doing. In short: they're trying to make warriors tankier but just flat out buffing their health isn't always a good idea. Resistance and vulnerable effects will now stack instead of just applying the biggest one, with the hard caps of 75% resistance and 25% vulnerability as I mentioned earlier. The idea is that in the future they can add different % of resistance/vulnerable to balance things out better and easier without having to tune health up or damage down. Edit: Testing might be required to figure out exactly what is and isn't blocked by what type of armor but if things are consistent then everything that has a purple damage number is ability damage and will not be reduced by physical armor (this would include things like Li Mings Cannoneer auto attack (which is ability damage, despite being an auto attack, and maybe bonus damage from things like Giant Killer or Tychus' trait)"
92,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Armor: Generic Talents, Buffs and Debuffs.",1,5m0tx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5m0tx6/armor_generic_talents_buffs_and_debuffs/,2017-01-05 05:32:56,"Just some thoughts on this promising new mechanic. First, generics. Seven heroes with Block. Eleven with Spell Shield. Five with Imposing Presence. And three heroes have them all: Muradin, Sonya and Leoric! On every one of those three, and many others, Spell Shield and Imposing Presence are **by far the worst**. Spell Shield is fine for some assassins. Block is a pretty good talent, but it's made rather redundant by Tracer, Tychus or Zarya, a situational issue but then again they're all autoattack heroes, so why not pick that against them? Point is... all of those need a good look, especially since generic talents are gradually replaced or removed, this new mechanic can help a lot, in decently creative and more fun, less passive ways. Another thing. If things aren't getting too complicated (hard to tell early on), armor could offer more *detailed* interactions... For instance, buffs and debuffs adding or removing as little as 1 armor at a time, where resistance/vulnerability alone would sound a bit weird with ""increase autoattack damage taken by 1% per time your X hits, up to Y"". Just some personal thoughts. ... And some (very rough) ideas for generic replacements and a couple other talents! **Zagara (Spell Shield):** If three Banelings damage heroes within 3 seconds, gain 30 Spell Armor for 3 seconds. Additional Banelings refresh the effect. **Muradin (Block):** Gain 25 Physical Armor for 5 seconds when damaged. Cooldowns 200% faster while Second Wind is active. **Arthas (Block):** You gain 5 Physical Armor for every enemy hero affected by Frozen Tempest, up to 15. **Leoric (Mana Thirst):** Skeletal Swing restores 10 Mana per enemy hit. If it hits at least two enemy heroes, also gain 25 Spell Armor for 2.5 seconds. **Zeratul (Spell Shield):** Gain 10 Spell Armor for 3 seconds when using an ability. Stacks up to 5 times. **Sonya (Spell Shield):** Whirlwind grants 20 Spell Armor and reduces Spell Armor of enemy heroes by 10 while damaged. **Sylvanas (Spell Shield):** Haunting Wave grants 10 Spell Armor for 5 seconds per enemy hero hit. **E.T.C. (Show Stopper):** Gain 10 Armor per enemy hero hit for 5 seconds. **Anub'Arak (Assault Scarab):** Beetles gain 30 Spell Armor. Reward: After attacking heroes 100 times, Beetles also gain 30% attack damage."
93,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Undocumented Changes: Arthas Base HP/Regen reduced by 7%.

Base HP: reduced from 2582 (+4% PL) to 2400 (4% PL) Base Regen: reduced from 5.367 (4% PL) to 5.002 (4% PL) Compared to pre-patch, now Arthas takes 7% more Spell Damage than before but takes 8% less damage from Physical Damage. He is the opposite of Anub'arak who takes 25% less Spell Damage and 10% more Physical Damage than in pre-patch. [Net Balance] Arthas: +15% Physical Armor, -7% HP/Regen | Anub'arak: +25% Spell Armor, -10% HP/Regen It looks like the Arthas buffs were not straight up buffs sadly. However both heroes still have more effective HP than before because of their baseline resistance which means healing them has a greater effect. &gt; ""Personally I think an easier way to look at the maths is: &gt; Before he could take 2226 basic damage or 2226 ability damage. &gt; Now he can take 2003 basic damage or 2670 ability damage."" ~ (*tharrison4815*)  Greymane's Marked for the Kill was not applying vulnerability in pre-patch.

Sylvanas's Mercenary Queen Talent (Lvl1) merc damage increased from 50% to 60%.  Azmodan's All Shall Burn no longer gets interrupted by Daze effects, ex.

I mean it's called armor, and maybe there's more to it than just a different name. Has anyone tested this? Because if it doesn't, vulnerability stacking on armored warriors would not be a thing to worry about (and hardened shield would be pretty broken)"
95,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Is the new Armour System leading to a revamps Artifacts system from Alpha?,0,5m5ics,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5m5ics/is_the_new_armour_system_leading_to_a_revamps/,2017-01-05 20:37:49,"I have been enjoying all of the discussion on Amour and it's potential effects on the game. As I read through the Patch notes, it got me thinking about everything they have said over the last few months, and I suspect that Armour is going to be the first step in the revamped [Artifacts system](URL they tested out in Alpha but removed after a backlash from the community. When they removed the [Artifacts](URL (after only two weeks) they said: *""As a result, we have decided to remove the artifact system from Heroes of the Storm with a patch scheduled for later today. We will explore different ways to give you fun and compelling options for spending gold, while avoiding the problems that the initial artifact system created. We don't have any updates on what our future systems may be, but we'll be sure to keep you informed and look forward to getting your feedback on alternate systems.""* Since then, they have stayed very far away from any progression system in this way, but I suspect we are about to see the reintroduction of a similar system but better tuned. In the [Varian Patch](URL they introduced that Armor and Vulnerability stacking up to 75%/25% respectively. I suspect that the stacking, and the caps are a first step in making sure any re-introduction of Artifacts... loot... or anything wearable can have effects, but that they do not get out of hand. Breaking Armor down between Spell and Physical Armor gives them more ways to create and differentiate any loot coming in. I suspect there will be more categories. Lastly, I suspect that the any loot that confers armor, or vulnerability will be finite resources, like, you get 5 games per item until it is worn out. However, I don't have any proof of that. With the promise of a new progression system, I think Amor is the first peice to see how we adjust to it in the game. thoughts? "

I have over 3100 games played and average Master/Diamond MMR. My Zeratul is at level 11 but I literally can't perform worth a shit on him after the re-work he got. Pre-rework I enjoyed the cleave build a lot and have had some success with it now but the real damage comes from Combo Slash/Master Warp-Blade and I just can't seem to pin down this style of play. I guess part of it is Nova is my highest hero and I have similar expectations from the 2 stealth heroes. A good played Nova with 2x Pinning Shot /w Vulnerability can still delete most non-warrior heroes from the game. I used to be able to do the same as Zeratul but feel like now I can't target someone at 100% at all with the exception of a quick wormhole poke. Even a li-ming that's off by herself at 100% seems to just molest me if I try to take her out. Do I need to just wait for lower health targets? Do I need to focus on poking more vs. trying to go for the kill? Can't figure out for the life of me where I'm fucking this up so hopefully someone can give me a little insight on how to git gud with him again :-/

Is that -30% to physical armor capped at -25% like all other vulnerability effects? I.e. does it actually results in 25% more physical damage, not 30%, and that extra 5% reduction only comes into play if a resistant effect is applied to Nazeebo? Or is it a special kind of vulnerability that actually applies 30% bonus damage as baseline, more than the supposed 25% cap on vulnerable effects? If the latter, does it stack with other vulnerable talents? I ask this question because AFAIK, Superstition is the only vulnerable/resistant effect in the game that is outside the 75% resistant to -25% vulnerable range, so perhaps it functions differently from other effects."

101,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Another Support Thread about a Fallen Support,0,5oj7lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5oj7lq/another_support_thread_about_a_fallen_support/,2017-01-18 04:01:42,"A long time ago back in Alpha and beta, Uther was undoubtedly my go to hero. A friend of mine just would not stop queuing as Nova so to augment his selection I ended up choosing a hero I felt synergized with Nova at the time. Setting up critical snipes + pins (and sometimes even his non-negotiable triple taps) with Judgements was a lot of fun. I was able to make saves if he was ever caught out of position, I could buy him an escape with Divine Shield, or further his onslaught with Divine Storm. I played Uther so much that I quickly got him to level 12 and ended up buying his master skin  not because I loved it, but because it seemed silly to be playing him so much without sporting some flair. Along came the Judgement skin and I of course purchased it day one. Fast forward through a myriad of nerfs, various meta shifts through hero releases and a novel attempt at reworking his talents and here we are with a shell of the Burly Support he once sported as his epithet. We are in an age where supports have remained stale with no change in sight. Rehgar managed to find his way into the meta while Malf, Brightwing, Auriel, &amp; Morales remain stable selections. Li Li can work as a second support quite successfully, but can struggle in higher leagues as a solo support vs non AA teams. This would be fine if double support compositions werent often frowned upon. Tyrande often receives this similar outlook on non-Battlefield maps. Other second support dubbed heroes include Tassadar &amp; depending who you ask, Kharazim. This narrow paragraph encloses all support characters in the game which feels consistently disappointing. But back to business: Uther was designed with the concept of a tanky support. One who can handle a lot of punishment where others like Li Li and Malf cannot. I feel Rehgar is now successfully fulfilling his layout as a brawling support so we need to push Blizzard to fulfill their Uther concept. Currently in only 5% of games heres my proposition to bring him back to respectable glory: Uthers basic attack damage has been increased by 10% and he now has 10 armor. Lvl 1: Hammer of the Lightbringer  basic attacks now also reduce targets armor by 5 for 3 seconds. *An interesting interaction as it provides a minor, but not oppressive vulnerability right at the start of the game.* Lvl 1: Fist of Justice  now also causes each basic attack to reduce the mana cost of your next Judgement by 1. The cost of Judgement is reset after each use. *This provides Uther with an incentive to actually endanger himself and attack people as well as a means for him to manage his mana given the enormous costs to his spells.* Lvl 4: Boundless Conviction  now also causes Holy Radiance to slow enemies by 15% for 2 seconds if an ally was also healed. *With Uther being a tanky warrior this provides him with some niche CC if hes using his W optimally. 15% isnt a lot, but its enough to offer situational peel or to stall a fleeing target.* Lvl 7: Burden of Guilt  now also passively reduces targets armor by 5 for 3 seconds. This effect can stack with Hammer of the Lightbringer if it was selected. *This talent is already decent on paper because it provides Uther with a tinge more CC.* Lvl 10: Divine Shield  now also increases the targets armor by 10 for 3 seconds after the effect ends. Lvl 10: Divine Storm  now also increases Uthers armor by 10 for 3 seconds. Lvl 13: Holy Shock  now also reduces the cooldown by 6 seconds when used to damage an enemy. *Uthers Q is still a mana bomb. Spamming this would cause him to go OOM quite quickly and using it offensively prevents his healing output immensely. Even with this change it likely wouldnt be as dominant as Shrink Ray.* No changes needed at 16 &amp; 20. All talents have at least some value and situations where their selection makes sense. These proposed changes may sound like a lot, and perhaps they are, but numbers can always be tinkered with. I.e. reducing the boundless conviction slow to 10% or Hammer of the Lightbringer reducing armor for only 2 seconds. As the community, its up to use to express to Blizzard our desire for shaking up the support situation. I for one think drafts would be a lot more interesting if I was seeing more than 4 support characters consistently as well as seeing more compositions comprising of two support heroes. Both of these desires are resolved with deep talent selections that ensure the support class is engaging to play. "
102,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,My Valeera Build,3,5omwn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5omwn2/my_valeera_build/,2017-01-18 14:16:57,"As a Level 20 grandmaster Valeera main with over 4k games on her, I feel certified to share my build. Haha, in all seriousness, after playing with her a bit this definitely feels like the best build, at least to me. Globes/Sinister Strike/Ambush/Smoke Bomb/Ambush/Vulnerable/Cold Blood More energy is always great and the max cap is best since it means you can spam your abilities in one quick burst. The extra combo points also has potential at level 4, but I do like the Sinister Strike energy decrease to make your most spammable ability more spammable. The Ambush talent at 7 is where this build begins taking off, it can start doing some ridiculous burst to targets isolated. At level 10, after trying both, it's my firm belief the Smoke Bomb is the way to go. It's extremely powerful, practically makes you invulnerable while still attacking (almost like Taz'dingo or Divine Shield), and only on a 60 sec cd. At 13 this build hits a huge powerspike, with the teleport on Ambush you have great mobility and insane burst any time you need. At 16 nothing stands out too much but I like the vulnerability just for extra damage. At 20 I always really want to go reduced stealth cd because it looks cool, but cold blood is way too good. It offers insane burst, albeit on a slightly long cd. (Do note that currently it is bugged on the PTR where it has a 0 second cd, which is nuts.) Early game you want to mostly use garrote and stun out of stealth to lockdown squishies, when you hit 7 and especially 13 you then almost always start using Ambush for the crazy damage. Thoughts? Also note that Valeera has a lot of situational talents that you can adjust to counter the enemy team, this just seems like the best general choice to me."

Nitpicking: - Monk Ironfist auto crits are no longer red. - Misha stun (Rexxar's W) no longer benefits from Bestial Wrath. In the current version, Bestial wrath also buffs the stun dmg from Misha. Cool stuff: Alarak Pure malice has a new indicator, Tychus trait also got a indicator. A few tooltips of talents that change the range of auto attack are now explained in numbers instead of %: Nova and Raynor's trait, Lunara's lv16 W, Nexus Frenzy and similar talents, Nova's Long shot, Tychus' lv1 E, Greymane's lv7... Chromie's lv2 Bronze Talons remains in % though. Valeera's lv7 Q talent is also the 1st ability range modifier explained in number instead of percentage.

However, on some Warriors and Supports it still feels almost mandatory to AFK in a lane and farm up globes. And as an enabler for my team, either by CC or heals, I don't want to be away from fights or objectives. I want to assist my team, but I know I'll be penalized in the mid and late game if I don't get that power spike from hitting a certain threshold of orbs. Either, I ignore my team for the first half of the game to farm up globes and hope they can handle themselves (Spoiler: They can't) or Assist them and a very powerful talent to survive the level 16/20 talents (Particulary those that give reduced healing and vulnerability) is underfarmed and never hit's that ""Power spike."" ##Suggestion: So how about, have takedowns count for 1 or .5 of a regen globe to offset the fact that I can't be in a lane most of the time, and instead sticking with the team. Outside the really one sided games or Murky Suicide Spam (Just because you can die, doesn't mean you should!) most take downs are around the 15-20 mark, so takedowns alone won't be enough to complete the quest and would still need globes, but it would lessen the strain and boredom of sitting in a lane or diving to get every single flickering globe (or alternatively getting very upset when a teammate doesn't wait for when you're in range to pick up the globe.)"

Then hop on the PTR and Try Mode Valeera (don't have to buy her to use Try Mode). You will not get close to these damage numbers without multiple rotations of your skills and at least two rotations of your Trait. It'll take 12-14 seconds to even come NEAR these numbers.** Zera does ~5400 damage in about ~4 seconds. Using the only real viable build which is; Vorpal Blade - Combo Slash - Seeker in the Dark (need this for the other W talent) - VP - Mending Strikes - Sentenced to Death - Rewind. So at 20+ you do (if not already in melee range W twice like this) W&gt;W&gt;Attack&gt;Q&gt;Attack&gt;E&gt;Attack&gt;Rewind (Vorpal if necessary) and repeat that combo again sans Rewind. W is giving you ~50% damage to your Attacks and your Q (talent does not affect the W itself) Numbers below assume level 20 and the W talents. Also Combo Slash. So your base attack of 276 gets +40% + 50% giving your attacks between spells that are on a marked target 580 damage. 1st Attack: 580 Q:(base is 438) 658 2nd Attack: 580 3rd Attack (After E): 580 W detonates: 500 2898 Rewind, do it again. 2898 + 2898 = 5796. ------------------------------------- Granted actually weaving every single auto after every spell; specifically after Q (hard to consistently cancel the end of the Q animation) when people are trying to run from you or you're getting your ass whooped while you're assassinating someone isn't easy. And frankly most people aren't going to get it perfect even half the time. But you can easily get 5K-5.4K damage every time rewind is up. And that **straight up deletes 7/10 of all HotS characters** who don't have a shield or a spell-shield talent active; and even some of them will still get fucked. ___________________________________________________ Nova is even more ridiculous than this, and it's easier and more reliable to pull off; it takes almost no mechanical skill and you don't even always have to do the right order (you can fuck up liberally) and still beat Zeratul in damage. Build is Long Shot - Bribe - One In The Chamber - Precision Strike - Double Tab - Crippling Shot - Rewind The only exception to this build, ever, is getting double Precision Strike at 20; but this is VERY map specific. **Otherwise this is essentially the only good Nova build.** Her base auto at 20 is 230; 414 after OitC, and 518 when you hit someone who's vulnerable from your Pinning Shot. Also I'm putting this here, 90% of the time the first W debuff will degrade as the second W hits, so you likely will not take advantage of that debuff with your second W (it is possible, though). The 3rd W after your Precision Strike WILL be in time to use the debuff (from the second), however. W: 241 1st Attack: 518 Q(Base of 680): 850 2nd Attack : 518 3rd Attack (after E): 518 W: 241 4th Attack: 518 Precision Strike: Animation 5th Attack: 518 PS Hits: 1250 Rewind W: 301 6th Attack: 518 Q: 850 7th Attack: 518 8th Attack (after E): 518 = 7877 damage. ---- And like I said, you can fuck this up and still get WAY WAY WAY more damage than Valeera can put out. You can regularly and easily get 6.6k+ with Nova's combo. Even if you miss your fucking ult, or don't time it with the deubff and fuck up attack rotations you're STILL doing more than Zeratul who STILL does more than Valeera. Also you have to consider Nova is at a range, Nova's burst is high as soon as she gets OitC, her Vulnerability can be used at range and helps her whole team, and she gets two (3 with Rewind) uses out of it. Zeratul has one of the best ults in the game when you're playing with people who have brains. He's the safest assassin and the only person who bursts harder than him is Nova. He has massive outplay potential and is extremely mobile. _________________________________________ Valeera isn't going to be a Nova or a Zeratul. She's going to be a disruptor where her job is to set her team up for success. #TL;DR: Valeera will not be OP late game because ""burst damage""; she doesn't even do a lot of damage in general compared to other assassins; specifically Nova and Zeratul. Valeera has TWO limiters Energy AND Combo Points. Not to mention in order to have enough Combo Points and Energy *to actually do the rotations to do your burst; you can't take the talents that make your burst stronger* (because they actually balanced Valeera's talents lol). She's fucking melee with terrible escapes, and her skill floor is probably going to be relatively high(ish) and the ceiling will likely be pretty up there too. #Valeera is going to be really, really good, but she will not be OP because of ""Burst Damage""."

Then I thought making a complete rework! Please note these mechanics and names etc are just rough ideas, numbers can be OP or trash and so on. Point is to remove generic talents, enhance the worse-performing ones, tidy up the talent tiers and introduce a full Undying build that will theoretically be very annoying lategame and focus on Leoric's unique mechanic in helping his allies while dead. ##Level 1 - Quest + Undying Tier## * **Mana Thirst:** Skeletal Swing restores 20 mana per Enemy Hero hit. *Reward:* After hitting 50 enemy heroes, Skeletal Swing and Ghastly Swing reduce Ability Power by 25% for 2.5 seconds. * **Hopelessness:** Increases the range of Drain Hope by 20%. *Reward:* After being active for 50 seconds, Drain Hope and Drain Essence reduce Basic Attack damage by 25% while active. * **Reanimation:** Same. ##Level 4 - Sustain Tier## * **Fealty Unto Death:** When a nearby Hero or Minion dies, you restore 1% of your maximum Health and 5 Mana. Half as effective while Undying. * **Willing Vessel:** Same. * **Royal Focus:** During Wraith Walk, gain 25 Armor, taking 25% less damage. If your body takes no damage during Wraith Walk's duration, the cooldown is reduced to 6 seconds. * **Ossein Renewal:** Same. ##Level 7 - Movement Tier## * **Paralyzing Rage:** Increases the Movement Speed slow of Skeletal Swing to 60%, and it now stuns Minions and Mercenaries for the duration. * **Drain Momentum:** While Drain Hope is active, gain 30% movement speed over 2 seconds. * **Run for your Lives:** The movement speed bonus of Wraith Walk fades over 2.5 seconds after it finishes. You gain 10% movement speed and 50% vision radius while Undying. ##Level 13 - Sustain Tier## * **Consume Vitality:** Same * **Madness:** When Wraith Walk finishes, gain 50% Spell Armor for 2.5 seconds. * **Imposing Death:** Activate to reduce the Attack Speed of nearby Enemy Heroes by 50% for 3 seconds. Can be used while Undying. Passive: Heroes and Summons that attack your Hero have their Attack Speed slowed by 20% for 2.5 seconds. ##Level 16 - Damage/Ability Tier## * **Ghastly Reach:** Increases the range of Skeletal Swing by 25% and reduces its cooldown by 2 seconds if at least two Heroes are hit. * **Crushing Hope:** If Drain Hope lasts its full duration, its cooldown is reduced by 3 seconds and it deals bonus damage equal to 10% of the victims Maximum Health. This damage does not heal you. * **Lingering Apparition:** Wraith Walk lasts 100% longer. Your next Skeletal Swing deals 50% to 200% bonus damage, increasing the longer you channeled. * **Black Kings Rage:** Deal X damage per second to nearby enemies. While Undying deal X/2 damage to enemy Minions and Mercenaries that are above 25% health. ##Level 20 - Storm Tier## * **Buried Alive:** Enemies inside Entomb take X damage per second and deal 25% less damage to Leoric. * **Death March:** Same. * **Spectral Leech:** Same. * **The Skeleton King:** While Undying, your Abilities recharge 50% faster and nearby Enemy Heroes have their Armor lowered by 25%. **Edit:** On second thought, would be better if vulnerability only applied with your Q and/or W. * **Hardened Bones:** Activate to gain 50 armor for 5 seconds. Applies automatically when you respawn. ##Notes## Not much on numbers here, design suggestions rather than ones about balance. Like, Mana Thirst could restore 10 mana for any enemy hit, but doesn't matter much here. Spell Shield on tanks and Imposing Presence in general perform pretty poorly, so they got buffed here. *Run for your Lives* (told you, names are rough!) could instead allow using E to grant temporary speed and vision while Undying. Most important I consider level 1, so give your thoughts on that. Hopelessness also substitutes for Block, and Mana Thirst is something nobody took, so why not give it anti-mage properties? And in every case, you can't avoid empowering Undying Leoric, further highlighting that aspect of him. I had kept Lingering Apparition in tier 3 with less damage, but each ability being represented on level 16 is nice. The replacement for Burning Rage is what made to me the most sense considering Leoric's kit. Hard to tell how this would work, but essentially, he can weaken but not finish and soak enemy minions. Surprisingly, Buried Alive and Death March compete nicely with Spectral Leech, but Buried Alive could still improve just a tad. Since he's a skeleton etc, those buried (alive) with him could deal a bit less damage to him."

Probably, most of us here at Reddit know the answers, but the general population of players lacks knowledge of the small, sometimes hidden, mechanics. I believe this game could use a knowledge base inside the client, accessible in the player's preferred language in a few clicks. Nothing over complicated, just a list of topics, organized by subject. With this, the new players, if interested, don't need to dive in old blog posts with confusing information and become better players faster. Do you think this would be good?"
109,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Why does percentage damage doesn't add up with vulnerability but is mitigated by Resistance ?,2,5epaba,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5epaba/why_does_percentage_damage_doesnt_add_up_with/,2016-11-25 05:56:08,"Linked to the Titan Grenade ""bug"". I've done the experience with Varian for exemple, Juggernaut's percentage damage doesn't synergise with his vulnerability ult. But it's pretty clear and full of sense that it should be affected by any effect of resistance. So why not with Vulnerability ?"

I think everyone remembers the brief period of getting deleted instantly by Tyrande + Kael/Diablo/Jaina. And nobody enjoys being on the receiving end either. Here are the issues: - Warbringer: a point and click stun is very powerful with the cooldown reduction tied into it. HOWEVER, without a reliable stun other than Taunt, Tank Varian will never ever be competitive with Muradin, and ETC, and that is a big problem. Without proper hard cc, Tank Varian simply will not be as viable as a main tank. - Vulnerability is about to become more powerful with the announced upcoming changes where the net damage amplification is the ""vector"" sum of its components. This makes things like Tyrande's mark much more enticing, and also makes stacking vulnerabilities much more powerful also. As a result, picking burst heroes is also more important, especially heroes such as Jaina, a hero with both massive burst, and also a vulnerability talent. At the moment, only three real counters that I can think off the top of my head exist: Cleanse, Tassadar/Zarya shields, and Medivh. The problem with Cleanse is that yes, it removes and prevents cc, but it does nothing against the stacked up vulnerability. The only thing that is somewhat effective versus burst right now is Medivh's Force of Will. While spell shield is ok, some of those talents reside on burst heavy heroes, the most important being Li Ming, who is a very powerful addition to any burst comp. Tassadar and Zarya shields are pretty good vs burst, but then Varian gets shattering throw, and completely negates the shielding. The only thing I can see holding back the stunlock comp a little bit is that Diablo is not that strong at the moment. However, Varian has essentially taken his place as the the stun machine as of late. Solutions: - Nerf Tyrande's mark. I personally don't like this, as Tyrande is basically a victim of the resulting meta born from warbringer. - Nerf Warbringer. But how? The only real nerf I can personally see is create another talent on the tier which grants cooldown reduction with maybe some Resistant, and make Warbringer increase the cooldown, as well as stun for 0.5 seconds. Even this may not be enough. Overall, it is very difficult to balance Varian, as without a stun, he is basically subpar to Muradin and ETC. That being said, his warbringer talent is very powerful combined with Tyrande and the upcoming changes. Feel free to discuss, I am very interested in your opinions :D "

And now they have the thread on Blizz forums talking about the changes to Vulnerability and Buffs, saying that they wanna buff warriors by adding in damage mitigation baseline. Whether or not this is gonna soon or not I have no idea, but still something to look forward to."

OP or even just great. But right now, while checking some stats on hotslogs, I couldn't help but notice **how low Greymane was**. **Greymane is now the 5th worst hero in the game in terms of winrate. His best winrate is 49% on Sky Temple, and he has only around 50% winrate when played by Lv12+.** Along that, Marked for the Kill still didn't hit off. It's **still at 2.3% pickrate, which is still amazingly bad.** That is also bad **considering Colossal Strike is just an outright better version of it. It's point and click, gets you to the target, and applies vulnerability, on a 20 sec CD on top of that.** Why has Greymane known such a fall? - The nerfs. Like, we all know it, Greymane got super hard nerfed. His burst got gutted for him to be more of a sustain assassin, but in the end his AA damage also got nerfed, which means we ended up with a mix of a poker and melee, which is arguably easier to do for Thrall. - The heroes rising due to the new changes. Zarya feeds on Greymane's damage. Malf's roots completely negate him. BW's polymorph just erases him. Butcher and Varian destroy him in fights. Greymane's situation is so bad right now that there are only **11 heroes** he has 50%+ winrate on! Greymane needs some power back. Marked for the Kill is still bad and outclassed by the new Varian ult, even if they're for different heroes. **Make of it a point and click or reduce the damn CD to 15/20 seconds.** Greymane's base stats are still lackluster due to all the nerfs. **Health or Auto-attack changes are probably the best he could hope for.** **Go for the Throat's range nerf should be removed due to the change in meta. There is so much CC and Knockback available right now that it's gotten difficult to get kills.** I think those should be guidelines for Greymane to get back in the fight, though I'd let people more able to discuss about this express themselves. Just wanted the stats to be known, here. Greymane needs your help. Gilneas shall rise again! "
113,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Regarding upcoming warrior changes  what's the difference between baseline resistance and just more HP?,5,5ez921,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5ez921/regarding_upcoming_warrior_changes_whats_the/,2016-11-26 23:26:03,"Blizzard wrote about intent to nerf support healing and to buff playmaking. In order maintain balance, they have to make frontline harder to kill. So they are giving warriors (and maybe melee assassins) baseline resistance. There's also changes to resistance and vulnerability - now they will be able to stack. Max 75% resistance and max 25% vulnerability. Differences that resistance brings: 1. Hero with more resistance is more affected by multiple stacked vulnerabilities. 2. Hero with less HP is easier for supports to heal back to full life. 3. Hero with more HP is vulnerable to percentage damage. 4. Another knob for balancers to tweak. What's unclear to me is why add another layer of complication instead of simple HP buff? Most of the time there won't be a difference in tankiness between hero A with 2000 HP / 25% resistance and hero B with 2500 HP / 0% resistance. If a hero was too tanky, would you nerf HP or resistance? Why? Different heroes will have different resistances, all this making stat reading needlessly complicated. It doesn't make sense to me."
114,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,AnubArak Talent Rework Suggestion,34,5ezr7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5ezr7k/anubarak_talent_rework_suggestion/,2016-11-27 01:49:17,"#**MAJOR WALL OF TEXT** (most of it is just some insights and explanations of talents in Quotes.) **Who?** So AnubArak, Squishy CC Warrior extraordinaire and so forth is the topic on hand. As everyone knows he is the niche warrior, supporting a Max Health lower than the more aggressive supports and a good amount of CC in his base kit. I have made a rework especially for him as he is currently quite weak, to the point where even the pro players greatly shy away from him. (He may also be my favourite character and so I may be slightly biasd and some of the talents may be slightly OP, but each Ive listed will at least have great food for thought so I kept them.) --- **Why?** I have made this rework suggestion as he has only one place in the game: Beginning of team fights. AnubArak can stun multiple people for 1 second and isolate a backline character for a while with his ult, creating a very favorable engage for the allied team. Also his beetles give some vision and he can peel a bit. That is about it. He cannot front for his team, he has almost no sustain or damage mitigation compared to other tanks, his wave clear is amongst worst in the game as is his overall damage, his Heroic ability cooldowns are long and to top it off he is one of the most mana starving Heroes in the game. Everyone all depressed and ready? Good, I thought I was the only one. --- **How?** The following reworks are talent changes and implementations only, mostly to show what our favourite bug is capable of, and because specific number changes are pretty hard to do in a definite way without rigorous testing work. This rework is made with Blizzards rework style/policy in mind where the Heros base style of gameplay is not changed, but the possible talent and build diversity can be increased. The rework has ways to promote his unique position as the squishy CC-off-tank, ways to be more of a main tank and even a hint of split pushing and explanations for all the changes. All of this while getting rid of most the generic talents that Blizzard is currently trying to eliminate. It also has answers to make the notorious Beetle Build that is known for being too boring or simple in the eyes of a veteran player, while not making it too hard for the (A)noobies! --- ##**Level 1:** Regeneration Master (Passive) -Removed Persistent Carapace (W) - If Harden Carapace shield is not destroyed by the end of its duration, cast an untalented version of Harden Carapace. &gt;Anub had a similar talent at this tier and it helped the newer players to learn the game, but it didnt help anyone else. This version refreshes the shield and gives an extra beetle, helping in tanking and beetle generation as well as early laning. Extended Spikes (Q) - Increases Impale range by 25%. - !Quest: Every time Impale hits a Hero, its damage is increased by 1.5% up to 30%. - !Reward: After hitting 20 Heroes, increase the width of the added range of Impale by 50%. &gt;This change is mostly to so that you can hit the backline targets easier, and due to its synergies with other talents. The overall change is quite small compared to the current situation and thus I made the Quest rather easy to do. Assault Scarab (Trait) - !Quest: Increase the attack damage of spawned beetles when enemies die within 3 seconds after being damaged by a beetle. Minion kills increase the damage by 0.4% and Takedowns increase the damage by 1%, to a maximum of 30%. - !Reward: Upon reaching 30% extra damage, spawned beetle attacks will cleave. &gt;As mentioned above Beetle Build is too easy in the eyes of many, thus this gives the player something to do in the early game. Also the split pushing capabilities are very interesting and highlight Anubs more unique mechanics. New Talent: Nerubian Recovery (Trait) - !Quest: Gathering a Regeneration Globe increases your Health Regeneration by 1 per second, up to 30. - !Reward: Increase your self-healing by 50%, double the effects of Regeneration Globes and upon being healed your beetles gain half that healing. &gt;Because the no to generics! slogan that Blizz has been waving for a while now. Also this makes him more a sustain oriented tank as the Reward buffs not only his Health Regeneration, but talented regeneration, making him the sustain tank Blizz originally claimed him to be. ##**Level 4** Locust Needles (Passive) -Removed Legion of Beetles (Trait) - Moved to level 7. - Every time you hit a Hero with a basic ability, you gain a stack up to 10 stacks. Automatically spawns a beetle every 10 seconds, and if you have 10 stacks, two extra beetles will be spawned. Can be toggled on and off. &gt;This is another change to make Beetle Build more intelligent, as you can now release the triple beetles when you need them most in a teamfight opposed to the previous way of just letting them spawn constantly without a reason to think about it at all. New Talent: Seasonal Shedding (W) - Increase Harden Carapace shield amount by 100%, cooldown by 2 seconds, mana cost by 10 and duration by 1 second. &gt;I believe I stated that Anub had trouble tanking, yes? NOT ANYMORE! With such a steep increase to his shield amount Anub is able to tank a lot more, but this comes with a price, as a 100% increase is huge especially at level 4. Since his trait summons a beetle every time you use an ability, this choice means less beatles as your most spammable ability is not so spammable anymore. ##**Level 7** Shed Exoskeleton (W) - Using Harden Carapace increases your Movement Speed by 30% for the total duration of Harden Carapace. &gt;This is just to make it gain that extra second of duration in case you picked Seasonal Shedding at level 4. Nothing interesting here, move along! Leeching Scarabs (Trait) - Moved to level 4. - Added functionality: Now causes Regeneration Globes to refresh the duration of your beetles by 6 seconds. &gt;Everyone playing Anub knows level 7 is too far for some sustain to be of worth in the lane. (Did I just rhyme?) Also the added functionality is there to keep your beetles alive longer for a bit of Beetle Build reasons and split push reasons. Youll see it in the synergy. New Talent: Excessive Tunneling (E) - Burrow Charge gains an additional charge, but Burrow Charge cooldown regenerates 25% slower while you have 1 charge and you are Vulnerable while you have over 6 seconds of cooldown left and you have 0 charges left. &gt;Two charges of Burrow Charge. One to get in and one to get out. Like Zeratul, yeah? And as we saw in Zeras case, such a thing at level 7 requires sacrifice. So to keep in line with Anubs squishy tank style I decided a conditional Vulnerability would be most fitting. This way you have more options, but carelessly using the charges can end you. This still keeps your normal way out as a possibility as the pain only comes if you are near the enemy when you use up all your shots. ##**Level 10** Web Blast (R) - Added functionality: Now gives an active ability to cancel Web Blast early. &gt;Because this should have been in his kit already at alfa. ##**Level 16** Blood for Blood (Active) - Removed Beetle, Juiced (Trait) ^[Version 1] - Added functionality: Now increases the maximum health and duration of spawned beetles by 1% for each beetle you have spawned this match. &gt;So a level 16 talent for beetles, eh? Well lets make it something actually useful, by letting it buff the health and duration of the beetles, thus making them like Samuro clones, lasting long and forcing enemies to deal with them. Also split push. Beetle, Juiced (Trait) ^[Version 2] - New functionality: Every 5 seconds your next Basic Attack against a Hero spawns a beetle. Basic Attacks reduce this cooldown by 1 second. &gt;Version number two is basically just a slight buff that makes it easier to use by using already existing mechanics in the game. This way your first Basic Attack in the teamfight is always spawning a beetle. New Talent: Its Under Your Skin! (Active) - Cooldown 60 seconds. - Activate to deal 3% of enemy Heroes Max Health to each enemy Hero for the amount of times your beetles have attacked them during the last 3 seconds and heal equal to the sum of damage dealt. &gt;Well this couldnt be a proper rework if I left Blood for Blood where it stands so, tadah! ...Seriously though this is a tank counter and survival talent mostly, but can actually do some terrifying single target damage in teamfights if someone just sits there and trades into you. Also able to do team wide damage and heal an alarmingly large amount. Still cant believe I began with 5% on this thing. Although as the beetles are slower than Heroes it is not able to secure kills on already weak heroes as its generic counterpart did sooo, balanced? (I have no bloody clue.) New Talent: Second Volley (Q) - If Impale hits two or more Heroes, then Impale will hit the same area again after 2 seconds. &gt;He is the CC warrior after all. The talent exists to stunlock multiple enemies for an extended periods of time. Just hitting two Heroes on both waves of Impale means 4 seconds of stun! With this Anub can shine in bottleneck maps where tight teamfights happen often. But it is mostly useless if any of the enemies can walk off of the AOE of the skill shot, and they have ample time of a second to walk off the smallest line in the world. ##**Level 20** Cryptweave (R) - Added functionality: Now slows enemy Heroes Attack Speed and Movement Speed by 20% for 1 second stacking up to 60% and 3 seconds, when they attack Cocoon while you are channeling. Attacking the Cocoon will refresh the debuff duration. &gt;Mostly to give this talent SOME viability and make it a b*tch against Tracers and other mobile high Attack Speed Heroes. New Talent: Traitor Kings Web (Passive) - All of your abilities stun enemy Heroes for 0.25 longer on the initial hit and all of your non-Basic Attack damage have a 30% slow added to them for 0.25 seconds. &gt;So a ministun to your Heroics and a slightly longer stun on your stuns and if you went for the damage dealing on your shield then it is giving you a third basic ability stun. Also beetles slow enemies, and the slow is applied only after any and all possible stuns that you provide. So the total time of CC in each ability becomes: Impale-&gt;1.5 seconds; Burrow Charge-&gt;0.75 seconds; Locust Swarm has a ministun in the beginning and then a slow for the whole duration and Cocoon just has an added 0.5 seconds of CC. --- ##**Anub'Arak Talents** | Level |||||||| Talent | | Level (Tier) |||||| |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |1|*Persistent Carapace* | (!)Extended Spikes | Dampen Magic | (!)Assault Scarab| (!)Nerubian Recovery| |4| Underking | *Seasonal Shedding* | **Leeching Scarabs** |-|-| |7| *Exessive Tunneling* | Shed Exoskeleton | Chitinous Plating | **Legion of Beetles** |-| |10| Locust Swarm | Web Blast |-|-|-| |13| Burning Rage | Urticating Spines | Bed of Barbs |-|-| |16| Epicenter | *Second Volley* | Beetle, Juiced | *It's Under Your Skin!*|-| |20| Hive Master | Cryptweave | Hardened Shield | Rewind | *Traitor Kings Web*| - (!) indicates a Questing Talent. - *Italic text* indicates a **NEW** Talent. - **Bold text** indicates a **MOVED** Talent. --- Please Keep in mind that the rework Ive posted has some things that may be blatantly over-powerd, although most are seriously there to be a part of a serious rework. As you keep that in mind do not shy away of harsher forms of feedback and please discuss the small idea Ive generated for my favourite bug over the last year. Any and all suggestions and thoughts on how to improve Anub are appreciated! TLDR: Anub has kinda fallen out of the game. He can start a teamfight and run away from it and thats all he can do. Above is a talent rework that opens him up for more build diversity and playstyles. Edit1: Added a Talent table that works in the same way as official rework talent-tables do."

116,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Another Shot at Fixing Nova,0,5fxpuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5fxpuj/another_shot_at_fixing_nova/,2016-12-02 04:08:25,"Now, before I start- just some constructive criticism to Blizzard about their game. You need to make it easier for players to find the numbers on the Heroes. I shouldn't have to load a try map, and then write down every single stat of every single level. There should be a Stat button next to the Skins/Mounts/Talents/Abilities buttons in the Bottom Left area with a slider to let me select which level I want to look at for the stats in question that also allows me to do the same for quests. Come on. It's logical, it's user friendly, its a good idea. Now on to Nova. Instead of a full rework- time consuming, takes money, probably will be annoying to do in general- why not just a look at what Nova lost in her *ahem* rework. She lost Gathering Power, 10% damage on Snipe to all targets, Lethal Decoy and Crippling Shot being on different tiers, and Overdrive. Now I am sure there are more- but those are the biggest. Anti Armor Shells was also considerably more pick friendly than it is now but its still alive. Now she has: No damage at level one (REALLY big deal for an assassin) and one talent that is just downright garbage (mana in stealth), Decoy talents so bad that putting in Bribe was the best solution, OITC/AAS/SM all fighting and SM only works on Heroes, no change to Triple Tap (among the worst heroics in the game), good diversity in 13, terrible diversity in 16 (no one in their right mind picks the snipe talent, and the other two are a checklist of if your team already has vulnerability or not), and 20 is just...double Prec or Rewind. So she lost diversity and damage and intuitive talent picks. What if we moved some of the old stuff into the new stuff and adjusted Nova to be Higher Risk for HIGHER Reward? Because at the moment she is medium risk for no reward. Compare her damage and health pool to other Assassins (or even supports, Kharazim and Brightwing take a dump all over her any day of the week). And no ""She has stealth"" is an invalid argument- most Heroes have enormous hard to miss aoe nowadays that knocks me out of stealth if they aren't bronze. And balancing around Bronze or QM is how you kill a Moba. At the moment her Lethal Decoy and her Crippling Shot are fighting for picks. Make them not anymore. Merge the Snipe talents at 13 and put LD there. Make a new Auto Attack talent that works like Giant Killer for Nova- Marked Target (Auto Attack, Passive): Targets hit by Crippling Shot take 2.5% of their maximum hp every time Nova hits them for 3 seconds after the shot lands. So now we have a nice curve, and some good choices. Minus that Snipe Talent at 16- maybe make it reduce Snipe's cooldown AND boost it's power per consecutive landed Snipe? Now it has a good reason to be picked? Having it match the stealth timer is pretty bad. Nova doesn't want to sit around, she has to use guerilla tactics. Now Triple Tap. Make it more reactive and faster use. Make it new. Make it Overdrive yet buffer, or multiple charges of Snipe with an Internal Cooldown. That's all it takes. And do something about that stupid Mana talent at level 1 while cloaked. It's not going to be picked by anyone who knows what Nova does. And give Nova 10% more damage with 10% less health. :D Now she does what she does- single target ambusher who is extraordinarily squishy. Numbers could ofc be adjusted, I'm just trying to get the diversity and talent picks back into the correct order. Note I know she would be probably busted, so read the lines I just typed. Edit: Another idea is that Snipe can do 50-150% damage based on DISTANCE. So if you melee someone with your snipe, it does half damage. If you long range tip of hit somebody then you get 50% more damage. Thoughts? Maybe more like 75-125?"
117,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Dehaka CC/Solo Tank Build/Discussion [PTR],33,5h2low,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5h2low/dehaka_ccsolo_tank_builddiscussion_ptr/,2016-12-08 08:16:49,"Hey all, just thought I'd share some thoughts on a Dehaka CC build (to up his solo-tank capabilities) and get some thoughts and discussion going on one of my favorite heroes! *Build Goal* - Improve Dehaka's CC - Improve Dehaka's Initiation - Maintain most of Dehaka's Survivability - Possibly allow Dehaka to really be a Solo-Tank Level One Talents: *Primal Aggression* Dark Swarm duration increased by 0.5 seconds and it deals 100% bonus damage to Minions and Mercenaries. OR *Enduring Swarm* Dehaka takes 40% less damage from Abilities while Dark Swarm is active - These are the two best talents on Dehaka's Tier 1. Primal Aggression turns his already 'decent' wave clear into excellent wave clear, allowing him to stack minion-essence quicker than before, as well as push lanes reliably. It of course also increases Dark Swarm length, which is actually going to be real important. - Enduring Swarm gives you increased resistance to abilities, on a near constant uptime, increasing your ability to simply tank the stupid amounts of damage that will likely be coming your way. Level Four Talents: *Lurker Strain* Emerging from Burrow knocks away enemies and slows their Movement Speed by 30% for 2 seconds, as well as granting you stealth. - This is one of the key talents, adding the ability to knock back enemies, slow them, and grant you stealth to either engage or escape after you do this. This allows you to easier save your squish when Drag is on cooldown, as well as giving you an escape when you're forced to burrow in the middle of an enemy team. Essentially it gives you another reliable CC that you can activate at will, which Dehaka desperately needs. And also, unlike Drag, it affects all Heroes in the radius, it does not require you to remain attached to the hero(s) you are CCing, and/or pull the hero back into your own team. (I am aware that this removes Hero Swarm, the current go-to-must-have talent from the build, we'll talk about this later) Level 7 Talents: *Symbiosis* Every time Dark Swarm damages an enemy Hero, reduce its cooldown by 0.5 seconds. - This was already an excellent talent on this tier, giving you constant AOE, but it's effectiveness in combination with Enduring Swarm (if taken) and Primal Swarm at 13, this will be utterly devastating to the enemy team. All you have to do is wander in there, hit this, and watch the parts fly. Level 10 Talents: *Isolation* Launch biomass that hits the first enemy Hero dealing 439 (208 + 4% per level) damage, silencing and slowing them 30% for 3 seconds. Only allows them to see a very short distance for 6 seconds. OR *Adaption* After 5 seconds, heal for 100% of the damage you took over this period. - This one is going to be up to the player. Take Isolation for a whole other set of CC to add to your kit (And with the level twenty upgrade, toss it at a stacked enemy team for a full team silence and watch the chaos). However, a marked drawback of this build is the lessened Self-Regen, so if you can time Adaption well enough, take it to compensate for your reduced Essence-gathering. Have a full fifty essence before a team fight and adaption, and watch the pure frustration as the enemy team tries to kill you and fails. Level 13 Talents: *Primal Swarm* Enemies affected by Dark Swarm take 15% increased damage from all sources - This is massive. Your now Constant AOE applies a massive debuff to all enemies within it's reach, allowing your team to effectively burst the enemy team down much faster, lessening your need for more regen. (If they're dead, they can't hurt you, right?) This also enables you to be a more effective tank, all the way around. Level 16 Talents: *Tunneling Claws* Dehaka can now move while Burrowed - In combination with Lurker's strain stealth, knock back, and slow, this allows you to initiate into the team. Simply stasis, burrow towards the team, and pop up to toss them all back and slow them. Or use it to safe a squish that's behind you, simply stasis, burrow towards the enemies chasing them, and pop up to knock them back and slow them, while using your own stealth to still escape. Or, just use this as a straight disengage. Made a mistake? Just stasis, run the opposite direction, and use your stealth to haul ass outta there, amigo. (A quick note on the increased drag length: I would argue that the disengage and initiation of tunneling claws in combo with Lurker strain far outweighs the benefits of increased Drag length. Frankly, the increased Drag length isn't all that much, and if you're grabbing someone by the tip of it anyway, you probably shouldn't be trying to drag them. Use the slow from lurker strain to land more reliable drags) Level 20 Talents: Honestly, not sure what to pick here. Apex Predator negates the cooldown on our global, allowing us to be wherever we want. Isolation, if you took it, gives us a whole *other* massive CC to annihilate the enemy team with. Someone tell me if Essence Claws (With the slow and Essence regen) Is amazing as I think it might be. **OVERVIEW** *Pros* CC: Stun, Slow, Knockback, allowing you to save your squishes or just mess up the enemy team's day far easier. IF Isolation is taken, you now also have a Silence. Engage/Disenage: Move around in your stasis (while immune to damage) to pop up and engage the enemy team at full health or flee the battlefield, or possibly save a squish. Use Stealth to further improve your ability to leave or sneak up and engage on them. Vulnerability: Just by walking through them, the enemy team is now suffering massive amounts of damage. Possibly burrow in, activate dark swarm, and then bust out to cause some chaos. IF Primal Agression: Excellent Wave Clear: Those minions and mercs are nothing to you now. IF Enduring Swarm: Increased tankiness and survivability on a near-constant uptime. *Cons* Self-Regen: ...Is now pretty meh, I'll admit. A possible way to compensate for this is to use Primal Aggression (if you took it) improved wave clear to stack more Essence before a team fight, preferably getting fifty, and don't use your Trait before said team fights, unless absolutely necessary. This allows you to still wander in with a full heal. If you have adaption, this improves upon this draw-back even more. And of course, if you have Enduring Swarm, you hopefully won't be taking as much damage in the first place. Drag: Is still a super-bitch to land. Without taking the cool-down per basic attack *and* without the extended length, if you are shit at landing drags, this build is really going to highlight that. Stasis: Now is so important for CC and Disengage/Engage, it is damn near a waste to use it for dodging skillshots now, and if you use it for your CC/Engage/Disengage, if an Ult comes your way, you are now out of a dodge. OVERALL: I think this improves Dehaka a great deal, despite the drawbacks to his trait being 'meh' now instead of amazing with Hero Stalker. I'd really love to have people try this out and tell me what you think! "
118,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Greymane Rework Concept,10,5hn288,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5hn288/greymane_rework_concept/,2016-12-11 10:32:25,"Greymane is in a pretty bad state right now, and while he does have a niche and a meta, I think he's been hit with the nerf bat too hard and his talent pool was never all that diverse to begin with, so here's my attempt at brainstorming changes to bring him to glory. #Baseline Changes **Gilnean Cocktail**: Range increased by 20%. Projectile speed reduced by 20%. &gt; The loss of the explosion at the end of its range reduced the effective range of Gilnean Cocktail. It's a very difficult skill to use now, so I think it could use more safety. **Inner Beast**: Cooldown reduced to 13 seconds. &gt; One of Greymane's significant weaknesses is the punishing cooldown if he fails to upkeep Inner Beast, and Wolfheart's dominance is because it can alleviate that weakness. For the sake of talent diversity, its cooldown should be decreased. **Marked For The Kill**: Target is marked, making them Vulnerable, taking 25% more damage for 5 seconds. Greymane gains 25% move speed for 2.5 seconds after dealing damage to a marked target. &gt; If MftK is everything Go For The Throat is not, then it should encourage a more traditional ranged DPS playstyle of kiting and consistent fire, rather than trying to mimic the burst of a burst ult. #Level 1 Talents **Insatiable:** Gain 15% lifesteal while Inner Beast is active. **Viciousness**: Gain 20% ability power while Inner Beast is active. **On The Prowl**: Gain 15% move speed while Inner Beast is active. #Level 4 Talents **Eyes in the Dark:** Become stealthed and gain True Sight for 3 seconds after using Disengage. **Perfect Aim**: Gilnean Cocktail's cooldown and mana cost are refunded by 40% if the explosion hits an enemy Hero. **Wolfheart**: Unchanged. &gt; Perfect Aim becomes significantly more rewarding, as an incentive to use Gilnean Cocktail properly. Wolfheart was moved to this tier to present more competitive options as well as synergizing with his level 1 talent branches. #Level 7 Talents **Thick Skin**: Gain 20% damage reduction while in Worgen form. **Quicksilver Bullets**: Unchanged. **Wizened Duelist**: Darkflight/Disnengage's cooldown are reduced by 1 second, and your next basic attack after casting Disengage/Darkflight deals 20% more damage. &gt; You can choose between bruiser qualities, top-tier attack range, or more flexibility in his mobility. I don't think snowball talents fit Greymane all too well, nor should they. #Level 13 Talents **Running Wild:** Unchanged. **Unfettered Assault:** Razor Swipe travels 60% further and breaks free of roots, slows, and debuffs. **Draught Overflow:** Gilnean Cocktail's explosion radius and width are increased by 40%, and deals 75% more impact damage. &gt; Unfettered Assault gets a niche, while Draught Overflow gives you more reliable poke and waveclear. It's also a bigger flask, so it hits harder. #Level 16 Talents **Eager Wolf**: Activating Inner Beast grants 50% additional attack speed for 3 seconds. **Visceral Attacks**: Razor Swipe deals 50% more damage. **Incendiary Elixer**: Gilnean Cocktail's explosion ignites targets, revealing them and dealing 150 damage over 3 seconds. **Alpha Killer**: Unchanged. #Level 20 Talents **Unleashed:** You gain 25% attack damage for ten seconds after getting a kill with Go For The Throat and its cooldown is entirely refunded. **Gilnean Roulette:** Vulnerability duration increased to 6 seconds. If the target of Marked For The Kill does not die, its cooldown is reduced to 6 seconds. **Exposed Prey (alt MftK upgrade):** Vulnerability increased to 35%, and marked targets are slowed by 35% for 2.5 seconds upon taking damage from any source. **Tooth and Claw:** Damage dealt to secondary targets do not benefit from on-hit effects. **Hunter's Blunderbuss**: Damage dealt to secondary targets do not benefit from on-hit effects. &gt; Splash damage changes are so that Greymane can't regenerate half his health bar from hitting a minion wave with lifesteal. Unleashed rewards successful assassinations while the other upgrades help you get there. Edit: Reduced Insatiable's lifesteal to 15%. Edit 2: Draught Overflow's explode-at-end-of-range was removed, and replaced with direct damage boost."
119,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Quick'n'Dirty Design: Alleria, the last Ranger",8,5i40oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5i40oj/quickndirty_design_alleria_the_last_ranger/,2016-12-14 02:02:45,"Yes, another one. Alleria is a ranged assassin. While I'm not spending a lot of time on her, I do have the following goals: * Make her 'like' a petless Hunter from WoW but not in a rigid sense. * Alleria's only been seen in Hearthstone since Warcraft 2, so make some decent HS references. * Distinctive kit from Tyrande and Sylvanas. * Not a clone of a character from another MOBA.. although admittedly I pretty much only know LoL and DOTA 2 and that not so much. * Has similarities to Sylvanas, since they are sisters. So, without much further ado: **Trait: Cobra Strikes:** Alleria can activate this trait to channel for a second. If she does, at the end she autoattacks, but her autoattack fires a second shot that hits the nearest target to her autoattack target. So, basically, ""if Alleria channels between her autoattacks she autoattacks two targets at the same time."" **Q: Arcane Arrows:** Over time this ability stores up to 5 charges (more with talents). She uses this power as a skillshot (thin, straight line). Each shot expends one charge. If she hits a target with the skillshot, however, she will begin channelling. She can move while channelling Arcane Arrows. While Channelling, every 0.75 seconds she will expend a charge to shoot a new shot. This shot will automatically target (and even home in on) the original target. Moving out of range, using another power, or being interrupted will break the channel. **W: Trap:** Alleria hunkers down and drops a trap on her location. The trap is invisible. If a target steps on the trap, they take damage and are immobilized for half a second. Trap would have a lot of talent choices. Alleria could take slowing AOE frost traps, silencing arcane traps, burning fire traps, etc. At a high tier, she should also be able to take ""Trap Launcher"", which would fire a trap out as a ranged attack. *Note: In my head her Level 4 talents would be Frost Trap, Arcane Trap, Burning Trap, and ""Cloaked Huntress"" which would give her stealth when in bushes and for 4 seconds after leaving them. Trap Launcher would be level 16.* **E: Evasive Shot:** Fires a shot at an enemy. At the same time as the shot, Alleria does a little hop and becomes Unstoppable. During the hop, however, Alleria *maintains her minumum distance from* the target. If the target moves towards you, Alleria hops back just a little bit. If the target is diving on you, Alleria will stay out of range by hopping back a long way. Obv. this does not let her hop walls (unless talents) so if she hops against a back wall she'll still be caught. But this is intended to be a high-skill use where you screw over Illidan or another melee diver if you have perfect reflexes. **Heroic 1: Wyvern Sting:** This is basically Bone Prison's big brother? It's an old Hunter ability from WoW. What happens is she shoots a skillshot out that deals a significant amount of poison over 2 seconds to the target. Once the 2 seconds is up and the poison gone, the target falls asleep for up to 5 seconds. Direct/AOE damage (but not other poisons) done to the target will wake it up, although it will have vulnerability to the shot that wakes it up. At level 20 ~~I dunno~~ it shoots out at the target and one nearby other target, like Cobra Strikes. **Heroic 2: Misdirect:** This misdirect is a lot like the one from hearthstone and not as much like the one from WoW. Alleria picks a friendly target and gives them an (invisible) buff for 8 seconds. If an enemy attacks the misdirect target, they will be immediately taunted by another Nearby target (priority order: Enemy Hero, enemy Merc, enemy minion, friendly minion, friendly merc, friendly hero; random on enemies but prefers high-health friends) for like 1 second or something. What's important with this ability is that the ability that triggers Misdirect also gets magically redirected. So like, Illidan will suddenly dive the wrong target, or Xul bone prison a friend. Does not affect Heroics (until level 20!!) Level 20 version has a longer duration (3 seconds?) and affects Heroic abilities (haha Wailing Arrowed your own healer feelsbadman) and such. Anyhow, I know to a certain extent she's a lower difficulty character but I think she's fun. Also if you're the guy who requested Alleria at Blizzcon, thanks for the inspiration. This one's for you."
120,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Really surprised Greymane isn't popular in blizzcon group stage,6,5a21kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5a21kp/really_surprised_greymane_isnt_popular_in/,2016-10-30 06:08:40,"A lot of the times when I see a team drafted Valla or Tychus, I feel like picking Greymane would've been a better choice. I know there are lots of other factors like nobody in team is familiar with Greymane, but in here I will give arguments about why Greymane would've been a better pick than Valla or Tychus. First is when enemy team drafted Malfurion. Malf is arguably the current best support but Greymane kits counter him. Malf is a HoT support and Greymane is a burst assassin. Greymane can delete a backline faster than Malf can heal them up. Twilight Dream doesn't really scares Greymane apart from the raw damage, since after he dives his Disengage is on a 5s cd (TD is 3s), and his damage is mostly AA after dive. If he fails to kill Malf (eg Ice Block) he can Disengage, assuming warrior and support are able to peel for him to survive. Next is his synergy with current popular warriors and supports. Both ETC and Tyrael has great peels and can dive along with him, and Zarya can shield him. ETC can even gives him attack speed. Rehgar can dive alongside Greymane, Uther can give Divine Shield, and Tassadar can give normal Shields. Malf can pre-heal him and give him cd reduction before diving. Brightwing can give shield, movespeed and spell shield. Auriel can Crystal Aegis but that's not too ideal. Third is Mark for the Kill. I see lots of team drafting Tychus just for the 'tank killer' but it takes a long time for Tychus to get value out of it, and usually lost the teamfight before that. For those who don't know MFTK has been super buffed and has a relatively low 40s cd. If you can maintain stacks as Valla during teamfight you shouldn't have much problem maintaining Vulnerability on the warrior. The worst thing to happen is they disengage for 5s then reengage but that's extra 5s for your team to reposition and regroup. Last but not least, with the right talents, Greymane is like a better Valla. With L13 On The Prowl (after 3s in Inner Beast mode, gain 30% movespeed), you are basically AAing while mounted. Valla can do 120% max only in full hatred stack. Greymane can even pick up L7 Quicksilver Bullets (increase human AA range by 20%) to more easily maintain his Inner Beast. Sorry for the long rant but I just had to get this out of my chest. Thanks for reading! Edit: It seems like the general consensus is that Greymane nerfs really hurt him a lot. Thanks everybody who shared their insight!"

Refining her Role, Adding Optional Complexity While Preserving Simplicity.",0,5cpkg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5cpkg4/some_li_li_rework_ideas_refining_her_role_adding/,2016-11-13 22:27:19,"The little panda is strong, if underestimated, with her Serpent build being OP due to Serpent Sidekick that straight up doubles the ability &amp; talents. Coming up with a full and sensible rework always proves hard (maybe I need a comfier armchair?), so Id like to just make some notes instead. Keep the simple positional kit and some simple talents, but add options to allow for more varied and skill-based gameplay. Feel free to discuss. First of all, Id love for a talent named after a Pandaria Herb (Green Tea Leaves!) replace Conjurers Pursuit for flavor. Pro Toss, I don't like on an aggressive positional hero. How about the opposite? For instance, *Windwalker Training: Reduces the range of your basic abilities by 10%, but grants a permanent 5% movement speed, attack speed and ability power.* Simple talents like Timeless Creature are elegant design-wise, and crucial to exist on such a simple hero. Level 4 could be pure sustain. For instance, Mending Serpent, Herbal Cleanse giving 10% movement speed and healing cc'ed allies more, and The Good Stuff healing a percentage of health on consecutive brews only, great with a warrior that consistently absorbs damage. Speaking of that, a combo with Brew and Serpents would reward being smart about who you cast it on. For instance, heal an ally with a Serpent on, he and the Serpent gain attack speed. This and the warrior-friendly talent reward your team playing to your heals, same way you should play around Malf's slow healing, Uther's high cds, or Morales' vulnerability. I thought Blinding Wind could have a way to reduce vision radius, but that could be annoying in a bad way Surging Wind could be removed or altered, its rather odd as it is. Level 16 could be a doubling tier. Safety Sprint, Two for One and Serpent Sidekick are there already. Shake It Off is a cool talent so Id like it to move for the sake of themed tiers (which are all the rage lately!), replaced with an empowered Mass Vortex that also doubles the damage. Safety Sprint looks fine, but could also double the duration of her trait. Serpent Sidekick increase cd, or make it last less? Removing the talent synergy would be the easy solution and it wouldnt be dependent on a Serpent build, but talent synergy is always fun and empowering. Level 20 without Bolt is perfect. Still, I have an issue with the awesome, if overrated, Kung Fu Hustle though. Here we see heroics doubled, why have this reduce their cd too? I think rolling (a nerfed) Shake it Off into it, or having it reduce mana, would see it balanced in just affecting basic abilities. Just a thought. That's all. Do share your ideas and feedback."

Someone said it earlier(/u/ottersRneat) that maybe Varian should have his level 4 talent Warbringer removed and merged into his ult decisions. That way it doesn't become too powerful at level 4 and gives more viable options to his tank and 2H build. Instead of making it a stun *and* giving cooldown reduction maybe when you choose DW you get the CD reduction without a stun. If you choose the tank build you get a smaller cooldown reduction(5s?) *and* the stun. Then, maybe for 2H it could slow the enemy and then give them vulnerability for 2s? That's what I think his biggest issue is, anyway. Charge is too strong at level 4. While I'm here, I think his tank build shouldn't lose attack speed at all and his 2H build should hit harder than it does."

The problem with Varian seems to be that his Tanky build is far too weak, TBOF is way too strong with Second Wind, Warbringer is a talent too strong for it's tier. --------------------------- **Second Wind** First of all, I believe it's the synergy between Second Wind and Twin Blades of Fury which makes it so powerful. Second Wind scales with 3 things. **Attack Speed** (as it's on-hit), **maximum health** (as it is a % of your maximum health) and lastly, 50% of your **attack damage** when you are low on health. Funnily enough, each one of things scalings change depending on the heroic you choose with Varian, so in comparison to his ""base form"" before choosing a heroic: * Twin Blades of Fury grants **100%** attack speed, effectively doubling the RATE of healing. However, due to a 25% attack damage loss, the rate of healing from basic attacks when below 50% health ignoring the passive 1% regen, is reduced by 25% (50% of basic attack damage minus 25% for TBOF) * Taunt grants 50% more maximum health, BUT 25% less attack speed. So the AMOUNT of healing is increased by 50%, but the RATE of healing is reduced by 25%. * Colossus Smash grants 75% more attack damage, but 10% less health. So the AMOUNT of healing is decreased by 10%, the RATE of healing stays the same as attack speed has not been changed, BUT when below 50% health, your attacks are healing for 75% more (50% of damage dealt * 1.75). So how much healing does each build give? ------------------------------------------------- **Stats At level 10** **Attack Damage** Base Varian Attack Damage: 123 TBOF Attack Damage: 92 Taunt Varian Attack Damage: 123 ColSMA Varian Attack Damage: 215 **Health Pool** Base Varian Health Pool: 2889 TBOF Health Pool: 2889 Taunt Varian Health Pool: 4334 ColSMA Varian Health Pool: 2600 **Attack Speed** Base Varian Attack Speed: 1.25 TBOF Varian Attack Speed: 2.5 Taunt Varian Attack Speed: 0.9375 ColSMA Varian Attack Speed: 1.25 ------------------------------------------- *note: Healing is 1.17% of maximum health on hit to be exact* *note: Heroic Strike's bonus damage/healing listed below further* Twin Blades of Fury + Second Wind = 84.52 Health per second (+ 115.05 When below 50% health = 199.57 Healing Per Second) we can round that to 200. Taunt + Second Wind = 47.54 Health per second (+ 57.53 When below 50% health = 105.07 Healing Per Second) Colossus Smash + Second Wind = 38.03 Health per second (+134.23 When below 50% health = 172.26 Healing Per Second) **SO** When healthy (above 50% health), Twin Blades of Fury takes the lead by a strong 84.52 health per second, almost double Taunt's and more than double Colossus Smash. When not healthy (below 50% health), Colossus Smash actually gets the most healing at 134ish, due to the high attack damage, where Twin Blades of Fury is almost caught up at 115.05, and Taunt coming last in this regard at a small 57.53. HOWEVER. These stats do not include Heroic Strike. As Second Wind clearly states, when below 50% health, also heal for 50% of the **damage dealt**. Heroic Strike counts as an empowered basic attack and thus the bonus damage will heal as well. With TBOF's fast attack speed, it should be no surprise that it grants an ADDITIONAL 82.28 healing (to the above number of 199.57) per second for a total of a rounded **282 healing per second**. For context, Uther's Q at level 10 heals for 623 health. So Varian pretty much gets a free Uther heal every 2.2 seconds. Yep. Colossus Smash's total of 172.26 + Heroic strike's 61.71 is a big **233.97.** Taunt falls last with a total of 105.07 + 46.29 falls to **151.36** For further context, Victory Rush which is available every 60 seconds (-15 per minion slain while on cooldown) is 582.4 healing... per ""minute"". BUT can be healed for that amount at full hp, regardless of the heroic chosen. So we need to ask ourselves, yes Twin Blades of Fury is very strong with Second Wind, but SHOULD the other heroics grant ""just as much healing"" as Twin Blades of Fury? If you think about it, TBOF gives up an active ability (vs Taunt and Colossus Smash). In addition, Colossus Smash grants the user a LOT of burst, and with the 25% vulnerability you TECHNICALLY heal more when hurt since you are doing more damage. But winrate numbers don't lie and I think Varian needs some tweaking. ----------------------------------------------------------------- *each change will have a description as to why I think this would be a good change* **The changes** * **Live by the Sword** moved to level 1 - QUEST: Increase the duration of Parry by 20%. After parrying 50 auto attacks, Parry gains an extra charge. (Can only happen once) ~~If you block at least 2 Hero Basic Attacks with a single Parry, its cooldown is reduced by 3 seconds.~~ *Overpower has been moved as for a level 1 talent, that extra Heroic Strike isn't really ""gamebreaking"" in the laning phase. Live by the Sword is now a quest that grants an extra charge. This helps it synergize much better with Varian's weak tank build. Comboing Parry Talents and forcing the enemy to attack you with Taunt will make Varian a much better tank.* * Warbringer - Charge now stuns the target for 1 second instead of slowing them, and its cooldown is reduced by 50% ~~10 seconds.~~ *Basically the cooldown is now 8 seconds with this talent instead of 6. 2 seconds is a considerable extra amount of time to get out, and or live, or risk Varian's staying on you.* * New Level 7 talent - Shalamayne's Battlecry - While Parry is active, enemy auto attacks heal you instead of dealing damage. *Built to rival the other healing talents in this category, this talent favors smart Parry users. With extra duration and charges from Live by the Sword, and forced attacks (and therefore healing) from Taunt, this would be an option for health restoration through defense.* * **Victory Rush** Every 60 seconds, Varian's next basic attack will heal him for **100% of the damage dealt** + 877 (416 + 4% per level) Health. When a nearby enemy minion **or mercenary** dies, the cooldown is reduced by 15 seconds. If a nearby hero dies, the cooldown is completely reduced. *A buff to Victory Rush, favoring Colossus Smash more due to the auto attack being included and the higher potential to kill someone. Second Wind will still be the long-fight sustain talent, Victory Rush however benefits from mercenaries dying so you can still tank merc camps, but also is thematic to the name where if an enemy hero falls in battle, the cooldown will be reduced. It's the ""rush"" you get from a victory, snowballing the fight with a big self heal if your team can manage to score a kill* * **Second Wind** - Basic Attacks heal Varian for 1~~.17~~% of his maximum Health. While below 50% Health, they also heal him for ~~50%~~ 33% of the damage dealt. *A slight nerf to Second Wind overall. It's still the most healing for TBOF, and still the best for the other heroics in a long term sustain fight that lacks burst. It's also still the best for taking merc camps and soloing bosses, but this means Varian can't afk fight a boss, he will have to dodge stuns or maybe even cancel backswing animations.* * **Taunt** Cooldown: 16 seconds - Force the target Hero to attack Varian for 1.25 seconds. **Passive: When you Parry a Hero's Basic Attack, Heroic Strike's cooldown is refreshed. Can only occur once per cast.** Passive: Maximum Health increased by 50%. Passive: Attack Speed reduced by 25%. *Overpower talent has been moved to taunt since it has a pitiful 35% winrate. Varian needs help as a tank, and with the Taunt ability synergizing with overpower's refresh, it makes sense to add it here as a passive and give it to Tank Varian for free. It doesn't hurt the other builds because they always took High-King's Quest for more damage than heroic strike in the first place.* * **Colossus Smash** - Cooldown: 20 seconds Smash a target enemy, dealing 410 (195 + 4% per level) damage and making them **and Varian** Vulnerable for 3 seconds. Passive: Base Attack Damage increased by 75%. ~~Passive: Maximum Health reduced by 10%.~~ *A change to Colossus Smash making it a double edged sword. This will make Varian vulnerable too when he jumps in for his assassination burst, but helps him if he is caught out by removing the 10% health reduction.* * **Mortal Strike** - Heroes hit by ~~Heroic Strike~~ basic attacks receive ~~40~~ 50% reduced healing for ~~4~~ 2 seconds. *Heroic Strike has low up time with builds that DON'T include Twin Blades of Fury. The change to basic attacks means it is consistent, but to prevent you from stacking this on every single enemy you run into, the duration has been reduced. Healing reduction improved a bit to make it a little more attractive than Juggernaut* ----------------------------------- **TL;DR** * Post shows math on Second Wind. * Live by the sword moved to 1, and is quest for 1 additional charge after blocking 50 attacks. No more cooldown reduction. * Overpower moved to Taunt as passive * New level 7 talent: Parrying auto attacks heal you for the same amount. (Tanky version to heal vs other healing talents) * Warbringer cd 6 --&gt; 8 second cooldown now * Victory Rush heals for 100% of basic attack damage, cooldown reduced by mercs, refreshed by hero kills. * Second Wind healing nerfed a bit (1.17% --&gt; 1%, 50% damage dealt --&gt; 33%) * Taunt now has Overpower as a passive * Colossus Smash no longer reduces health by 10%, but now makes both you and target vulnerable. * Mortal Strike now works off of basic attacks, 50% healing reduction, but lower duration. ------------------------------------------ I'm looking for discussion over anything else. I think Varian's tank build is extremely weak right now and the changes above would REALLY strengthen them. TBOF build is slightly nerfed through Second Wind alone, while Colossus Smash has been tweaked to hurt you a little more if you fight stupidly, but save you more if you get caught out. "

TLDR: there is a reason why tanks with good cc and initiation do not do good damage. warbringer needs to be ""tank only"", or rather, it get's stun only with taunt."
128,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Blizzard: Any plans for a Tyrande talent rework?,103,5e0dhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5e0dhc/blizzard_any_plans_for_a_tyrande_talent_rework/,2016-11-21 08:51:04,"We're fresh off of a lot of great updates, and on the cusp of receiving more. You all have done great work so far! The fans always demand more, but please do note that the majority of us are grateful for all the great stuff we've gotten (I even [made a thread about it](URL Tyrande is a great character and one of my favorites to play, but that is largely *despite* her talent tree, rather than because of it. Her talents are full of generics and lacking in the focus that a lot of talent redesigns seem to embrace. It is my humble suggestion that her talents be redesigned to really strengthen her along the three paths: healing, damage, utility. Maybe not make her a true multi-class, but right now, Tyrande has a bit of a problem in lacking focus in any one area. She can spec for damage, but isn't that great at it. She can spec for healing (my usual choice), but isn't that great at it (at 13, she's a little better, but not that much). Her Sentinel build is useful, but comes at the expense of some of the little focus she has. Tyrande's kit is great, very fun to play with. I wouldn't make any major changes there (maybe make Sentinel heal allies it touches?). She could stand to be a multi-class, but even if not, I think having very distinct build options will be good. Let's take a look at Tyrande's talents. **Level 1** This tier isn't bad. It also has actual flavor, rather than generics, which are thankfully going the way of the dodo. * Celestial Attunement: Reduces Light of Elune mana cost by 15. While that is useful (knocking off a third of its price), especially given that Tyrande often runs into mana problems trying to keep up with her team's support needs, it's not very spectacular. This could use some sprucing up. * Ranger's Mark: This is a great talent, allowing Tyrande to help render a target vulnerable to her teammates. If you're going to change it, maybe make its base duration and/or vulnerability a little less, turn into a quest talent that increases both as you complete it? Or increases the range or decreases the cooldown or something. * Seasoned Marksman: This is a great talent ... on other heroes. The problem is that speccing Tyrande for pure damage, especially auto-attack damage, is very suboptimal. I think Tyrande could stand to have this replaced for something tailored more to her, or if her damage build is buffed, this might be pretty helpful. * Empower: This is a useful talent, especially if you're going owl build. I feel that if we're trying to refine Tyrande's talents into stronger, more thematic paths, this one is pretty necessary. However, maybe Empower or Pierce need to be made baseline to help with this. If you don't take Pierce, for instance, Empower is very low-impact. Again I can't help but feel making it a quest talent would be nice, too: hit people with Sentinel to strengthen it, increase the reveal, or lower cooldowns (with completion granting more damage or longer reveal). **Level 4** This level is where a lot of Tyrande's problems manifest. It's full of generics lacking in flavor appropriate to the High Priestess of Elune. I think we could definitely revise this tier to really enhance the ""fantasy"" of this powerful Night Elf leader and priestess. She also has a lot of talents on this tier. I like versatility, and in fact am arguing for Tyrande's strength in her various specializations to be greater, so she can be in fact more versatile (building toward damage, healing, or utility). * Pierce: Useful talent, but I think this should be made baseline, or Empower should. * Focused Attack: Not a bad talent, *per se*, but very generic and very suboptimal for Tyrande. I think if she's going to have a damage build path, she needs something a little stronger in flavor and thematic consistency. Maybe something like ""Sentinel's Eye: Every 10 seconds, increase Basic Attack damage by 20%. Basic Attacks lower this cooldown by 1 second. Quest: Hit 25 Heroes with Basic Attacks. Quest Reward: Each Basic Attack against a Hero increases the bonus damage by 2%. After hitting 25 Heroes with Basic Attacks, permanently gain a 20% increase in Basic Attack range."" * Protective Shield: Again, not really a bad talent, but a very long cooldown and little flavor or synergy with her other abilities make this undesirable to me. Replace it with a shorter-CD ""Elune's Grace"" or something that maybe does something similar, but shields for a specific amount and has a bonus of increasing healing done to the hero. * Healing Ward: Same issue as above. Not bad, certainly, and can be quite useful. But Tyrande needs something more tailored to her style, I think, and maybe less slow as an AoE heal. Maybe a talent that lets Light of Elune heal allied units near the target, as well (perhaps at a lesser value)? * Searing Arrows: I liked the talent on Valla, as well, but she ditched it in favor of something more specific. I like the idea of Tyrande having a viable, Assassin-level damage path, but I would say we could find a better replacement for this. **Level 7** This tier is pretty good. * Quickening Blessing: This can be used as a way to heal while helping an ally escape, much like Smite does for Tyrael. I've never seen a reason to take it because the other talents (particularly Lunar Blaze) are too useful, so maybe it needs a buff. Maybe up the duration to 4 seconds, or increase the speed to 30%? I'm not sure. * Lunar Blaze: I pretty much always go with this one. Last night I had some crazy great stuns with it, absolutely hosing fleeing enemies or setting up some really nice ganks. Let me shut down Twin Blades Varian, even. * Lunar Momentum: Great talent, needs to be kept. Only problem is that Tyrande is very vulnerable up close, but that's more of a strategy thing, really. * Calldown: MULE: Not bad. I think we could do better. I like the idea of summoning a wisp to a building that increases its defense with the visual effect reminiscent of growing structures in WC3 or something. Something like that. **Level 10** This is pretty well-known. I think if we could increase Tyrande's AoE healing abilities through other talent tiers (as discussed above), we could make Starfall a more attractive option more often. Shadowstalk would then be useful as healing, but primarily for escapes or setting up big ambushes. **Level 13** Here's where we really need to start cementing Tyrande's chosen paths, providing greater strength in one of her three ability areas: healing, damage, utility. * Overflowing Light: I love this ability, but also feel obligated to take it. * Huntress' Mark: This could really help with earlier talents in making a damage-based Tyrande build work. * Sprint: Useful, but really comes at the expense of Tyrande's strength in any other area. * Shrink Ray: Same as some other talents, I feel, in that it's useful, but it's also kinda bland. I mean, not so much for some characters, but for the High Priestess of Elune it doesn't really grab me. **Level 16** This is a great tier with several really nice options. The only thing we really need is a better healing option. * Trueshot Aura: Fantastic. Nothing needs to change, and we want this kind of utility in Tyrande's talent tree. * Mark of Mending: Unfortunately, Hunter's Mark doesn't last long enough for this to be *that* useful. We need something much, much stronger for increasing her healing abilities on this tier. * Ranger: I really like this one. Works as both damage and utility. I almost always use it on Tyrande as she exists now, along with Pierce and Empower. * Shooting Star: Again, a great talent that makes for some fantastic plays. **Level 20** Good talents, but some of them are difficult to use because of Tyrande's lack of depth in some areas. * Celestial Wrath: Fun talent. Can help hold points or finishing off a push from across the map. * Hunter's Swiftness: This is pretty amazing for both offense and defense. You can set up some amazing plays with it. * Nexus Frenzy: Good if you have pretty decent basic attacks as is, but Tyrande needs more specialization. I think we could replace this for something more specific, not unlike what happened with Valla. * Storm Shield: Another great talent. I very often take this one because for a big push, or to help survive a strong AoE ability, it can be nice. The only problem I can see is that it benefits high-health heroes *far* more than squishier ones. * Rewind: Always useful for comboing or simply burst healing. So there we have Tyrande's talents. They're good, certainly. I don't mean to suggest she's *bad*, by any means. I just think she is lacking in her ability to specialize, or capitalize on versatility. While I could see her very easily making for an Assassin/Support multi-class, even if not, I think she could be like Kharazim in that she could go for damage or healing, and in Tyrande's case, has some utility that others don't with Sentinel and Hunter's Mark."
129,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Blizzard, Balancing is going GREAT lately, can we just have one last look at Artanis :-)?",8,55eeee,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/55eeee/blizzard_balancing_is_going_great_lately_can_we/,2016-10-02 05:12:17,"There's numerous changes to lots of heroes and it is working out great! Artanis, however, is the eternal black sheep of the Heroes crew. Though he sees marginal tournament representation, with the amounts of soft and hard CC in the game right now, Artanis struggles. I have four very reasonable buffs I would like Blizzard to look at, just to give the Hierarch a place in the spotlight (Please note, implementing one or two of these would be a great start)! - **Increase baseline Charge range by 20%.** Recently, it has been explained in a post on this subreddit that Artanis' current baseline Charge is bugged. If you are Charging at a large target, the Charge Range is smaller than the basic Auto Attack range, which causes Artanis to do nothing. A marginal buff to his Charge Range would relieve this as well as make the Level 16 Charge less of a must pick. - **Improve Artanis' Auto Attack range.** For a hero that relies this much on weaving in Auto Attacks, his range is extremely low at 1.2 *(Several other Melee DPS for comparison: Greymane, 1.2; Illidan, 1.25; Zeratul, Tyrael, Sonya, Anub'Arak, Xul, Alarak 1.5; Kerrigan, Arthas, 2)*. Only Greymane and Illidan score this low, who are both mobile assassins. Additionally, Artanis' model is much larger, making this 1.2 harder to use compared to the other two. This mechanic is somewhat hard to explain. It basically means that the distance between Artanis' body and his target is smaller than it would be for Greymane or Illidan despite them sharing similar Attack Ranges, as the range is calculated from the center and Artanis has a fat ass. He could really benefit from a buff to his AA range, making his AAs more reliable. He is very similar to Alarak, for example, yet Alarak has 20% more range. - **More Baseline Utility on his abilities**. One of the biggest complaints on Artanis is his lack of utility compared to many other heroes. Q is a very technical ability, but also a self-root. W is sheer damage and sustain, E is a pull... which doesn't really do a whole lot. I would like to start by making the level 7 E talent (reduced movement speed) baseline, and transforming the Level 7 talent to 'Root for 1 second'. - **Cancel on Blade Dash**. Ever since he came out, people have asked for Blade Dash to be cancellable. Whilst I quite like the way it currently works as a dodge, more than an escape, I can understand why people want this to be a possibility. Therefore, I would like to see a talent that allows the cancellation of Q, but at a drawback. Drawbacks could include a reset of the Shield cooldown, vulnerability or a temporary movement speed reduction. This talent would be placed at Level 7 or 13. Let me hear your opinions! En Taro Tassadar, En Taro Artanis!"

You obviously can't do this when stunned or silenced, since it's Q-dependent and you can't use abilities in those states.

I (master league hots &amp; hotslogs) played/theorycrafted him a bit, and maybe those insights will be helpful. Lets start with talents : . **Level 1** * Way of the Blade [W] : Critical Strike now happens every 3rd Basic Attack and deals an additional 25% of your Basic Attack damage. **OK**, Its unsafe to stick to melee too long on teamfights, but it helps in PvE and is quite good on full illusion builds (works on illusions). * Way of Illusion [Q]: Quest: Every time one of your Images Critically Strikes an hero, gain 0.5 Attack Damage, up to 20. Reward: After hitting 40 Heroes, gain an additional 20 Attack Damage. **Looks bad**. Illusion only benefit from the last 20 damage bonus (well 30% of it), and their uncontrolable targeting makes it hard to complete before 10. Post 10, this damage isnt significant anymore. * Way of the Wind [E] : Quest: Attacking a Hero from Wind Walk increases the movement speed bonus of Wind Walk by 1.25%, up to 25%. Reward: After hitting 20 Heroes, the duration before Wind Walk can be broken by damage is increased to 2.5 seconds. **Absolutely awesome** : with the level 20 talent, you ll run uberfast. Also provide more reliable escape. . **Level 4** * Deflection : While Advancing Strikes is active, you take 25% reduced damage from Hero Basic Attacks. **Average** still quite dangerous to stick melee range for long. Situational vs AA. * Mirage [Q] : Mirror Image grants you and your Images 2 charges of Spell Block, reducing the damage of the next enemy Ability against you by 50%. Can hold up to 2 charges. **OK**, prevents your illusions from dying too fast * One with the Wind [E] : While Stealthed by Wind Walk, you take 60% reduced damage from all sources. **Pretty awesome** if you go E build, turns E into an emergency armor . **Level 7** * Crushing Blows [W] : Critical Strike now has two charges, and Critical Strikes deal an additional 25% of your Basic Attack damage. **OK**, seems to only serve with Harsh winds (16), to triple critical under vulnerability. * Burning Blade [W] : Critical Strikes unleash a burst of flame, dealing an additional 65% of your Basic Attack damage to the target and nearby enemies. **Meh**, gives more (bad) waveclear to samuro at the expense of assassination burst. I m not a fan. * Phantom Pain [W] : Critical Strikes deal an additional 40% of your Basic Attack damage for each Image you have active. **Really good**, gives an insane burst, more in ""combos"". . **Level 13** * Mirrored Steel [Q]: Basic Attacks against Heroes reduce the cooldown of Mirror Image by 1 second. **Really good**, you can usually safely land 2-3 autoattacks after popping the illusions, so its a bit like 20-30% CDR on illusions. Which is nice. It has also its place in a combo. * Kawarimi [E]: Wind Walk creates an Image at your location that will continue whatever you were doing. **Really good**, one more ""free"" illusion, and gives more juke potential. * Shukuchi [E]: Wind Walk teleports Samuro a short distance in the direction he's currently facing. **Really good**, makes you move faster if CDR on windwalk taken in 20, you can pass walls, and (to be retested), it disjoins projectiles like a liming tp. . **Level 16** * Press the Attack : While Advancing Strikes is active, Basic Attacks increases your attack speed by 15%, up to 60%. **Really good**, but only if melee range is safe or if you intend to take both illusions ultimates otherwise they wont make use of it. * Harsh Winds [E]: Attacking a Hero from Wind Walk causes them to take 30% increased damage from you and your Images for 3 seconds. **Awesome**. Enables your burst. Please note that the first is benefits from the vulnerability. If you go out of invis with a crit, it will be a crit + 30%. * Merciless Strikes [W]: Basic Attacks against Slowed, Rooted, or Stunned targets are always Critical Strikes. **Situational**: if composition permits it, makes you a killing machine. . **Level 20** * Dance of Death : Your Images use Bladestorm when you do. **Seems poor**. Your ult does like + 60% damage but your illusions will never survive long enough. * Three Blade Style : Your Images gain an additional 50% of your Health, and last up to 32 seconds. **Good** if you buffed illusions. Harrass and teamfight presence becomes crazy here. * Blademaster's Pursuit : Advancing Strikes grants an additional 15% bonus Movement Speed, and its duration is increased by 2 seconds. **Bad**, doesnt bring as much as the two other good ones, and trait is already enough to stick in melee if correct stutter stepping. * Wind Strider [E]: Wind Walk's cooldown is reduced by 6 seconds. **OMG**! If you buffed the windwalker, this makes you really strong: 60% armor, ""undecloakable"", ultra fast, +30% damage.. what else ? . **Ults** Bladestorm is really good. Illusion master is anything from bad to absurdly OP, depending on who plays it. Up to you :) **Build ideas and Combos** If you wanna have a megaburst like thrall, go for phantom pain, mirrored steel, harsh winds, wind strider. Get your crit counter to 2/4. Windwalk to a guy. If possible, wait for the nearly end of windwalk. AA then Illusions, then do your natural 4/4 crit on him, immediately pop a crit, then you have a choice. Either you windwalk / run away, or you put 2 more AA before leaving. If you do, they will be +30% too, you will gain more CDR on illusions, which will align all your cooldowns at level 20+ and puts your crit on 2/4, to make the same combo +- 7 seconds later. It deals around... i dont remember... 2500-3000 ? at level 20. Without ultimate. So you can bladestorm after if you want (instead of the two AA to get the vulerability going. You can even try the level 20 talent on it for a full roflcopter burst of... i dunno.. 4000 4500?). Then you have the same thing but without mirrored steel. The two additionnal AA arent as interesting to execute, combo will be safer, less damaging, but you have kawarimi or shukuchi. An easier version, but (i think) much weaker, no mirrorred steel and crushing blows at 7: you windwalk at 3/4 crit, you natural crit, then crit crit and leave. No illusions needed, universal easy combo. Finally you can go full beef illusions build. I would go way of illusions / mirage / phantom pain / illusion master / mirrored steel / press the attack or merciless / three blade style. Then you turn from an assassin into a (very) messy bruiser. Hope it halps and / or gif ideas for tha burning blade. EDIT : formatting. I m so bad at this :D "

Is there a situation right now where he's the best pick? Three possibilities jump out me: 1) Greymane has one of the best giant killer talents in the game, 2) Greymane is unique in his ability (among melee assassins) to act as a ranged assassin when it would be too dangerous to engage, and 3) Greymane's exceptional mobility allows him both to chase and reposition during fights very effectively. The first point is somewhat undercut by the fact that Greymane really struggles to directly fight tanks due to his CC vulnerability and lack of CC on his side. Nevertheless, 3% of maximum health on every Worgen AA is particularly good when combined with his built in AA steroid. My main concern is that Tychus seems like he will always be a safer pick when trying to deal with double warrior comps, although it might be worth picking Tychus and Greymane together but at that point you're really doubling down on AA damage. The second point is probably the best point in his favor. Flexibility is definitely powerful and so Greymane might be best picked against comps where you want a melee assassin but picking one seems risky. Or looking at it another way: if you want a ranged assassin but you'd like the option to dive the enemy team, then maybe Greymane is your lycanthrope. Finally, Greymane really does have exceptional mobility. Illidan beats him in terms of mobility (and survivability) but not in terms of raw damage output. Few heroes are even close to as good as Greymane at diving in, securing a kill, and diving out as Greymane is. But the question that comes to mind is whether that mobility is worth the tradeoff in self sustain and utility he makes when compared to other assassins. If your team is loaded with CC, and the enemy team lacks both CC and burst, then Greymane's mobility is probably more useful than the CC and self sustain of other assassins. What do you all think? Are my reasons for picking Greymane compelling? Did I miss a really good reason?"

I've been playing this game since the start of 2015, I've been there for ignite Kael, launch Leoric and all the other fun stuff we've had. After losing a few frustrating games to Samuro last night and having lived through the fun that was the recent zarya/malf meta I wanted to discuss that sentence which gets thrown around a lot (including by me) of ""It's hard to release a perfectly balanced hero"". Yes it is true, It's super hard to release a perfectly balanced hero and we are well aware that Blizzard has to balance what's possible with a heroes design and what is fair/healthy for the game. The question that I have after Samuro and the recent Zarya fun is over time shouldn't Blizzard get better at releasing heroes at a more manageable level? Outside of each heroes unique kits any given hero is a mashup of: *Health *Mana *Cooldowns *Auto Attack damage *Attack speed *Movespeed *Health/mana regen Blizzard will have loads of data from all previously released heroes that while not exactly the same as a new hero will share common stats and mechanics from previously released heroes. Zarya is a bruiser, Blizzard has data on bruisers so why would they give her the tankiness of non-bruiser warriors? Another example is the old Kael talent that gave him a 30% vulnerability which was crazy strong and later removed. Why then bring it back to Samuro? It isn't even harder to use than it was on Kael. Of the 12 heroes released this year only 2, Dehaka, an Auriel have been considered to not be OP or UP. How is it healthy for a game to only have 16% of characters released this year in a state that isn't considered OP/UP? So is it difficult to release a perfectly balanced hero? Yes it totally is and I know how dedicated the balance team is and want to thank them for that. That being said it feels like over time Blizzard should be getting better at releasing heroes closer to the ideal. "

Especially when playing at lower levels, I would encounter incredibly stubborn folks who thought focusing supports was the first commandment of HOTS. I once watched our Thrall walk past a half health Jaina to get to a fleeing full health Rhegar, and I died a little inside. I have also been frustrated by the dogmatic ""focus medic"" or ""don't focus tank"" that I regularly encounter, and are frequently mentioned on this subreddit. This post will try to give some basic outline to focusing, and I hope others will flesh things out (and correct me where needed) in the comments below. Also, please link any other useful resources involving target priority! **1. There is no objective ""focus order""** The focus order will be different in every game and even in every engagement, based on how each player plays a hero. You may think Morales is the highest priority target on their team, but if their Morales is positioning conservatively and Jaina is coming at you like Elsa on meth, you should focus Jaina. **2. The support is not always the highest priority target** This is a common one that I encountered at low levels and got frustrated with. It is a general gaming mantra to ""kill healer first"", but this isn't always a given in HOTS. Trying to kill a high mobility, high health support (e.g. Rhegar, Li Li) isn't always the best route, as often times you will simply fail. If instead you can instantly delete a squishier or less mobile character (Valla, Kael), you can make the fight a 4 v 5. This is usually easier to achieve and will generally win you the team fight all the same. **3. ""Don't focus tank!"" except sometimes you do** This isn't a bad general rule. You should prioritize their squishier and higher damage heroes over the tanks when possible. In general, you don't want to waste your high damage abilities trying to poke at their tanks. However, if their tanks are the only one in range, you should definitely auto attack them. Why wouldn't you? Also, if their tanks are going WAY too deep, focus them down. Even Chen can become the focus target if he is going too deep without his team. These were the three basic principles that came to my mind, and I'm sure I'm missing something else important which can be added by more experienced players. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There are many other smaller, more specific points that can be mentioned, as well: - * Note when enemies use their abilities. If Muradin jumps INTO your team, Anubarak burrows to ENGAGE, or a silly Valla vaults at your front line to try to secure a kill, make them pay for it. They can no longer escape. - * Lt. Morales is a higher than usual priority support because of her low health, high heals per second, and inability to heal herself during a teamfight. That being said, don't automatically dive her without thinking about alternatives. - * Unless you think you can kill him in the next few seconds, he is way out of position, or he is literally THE only target, don't attack Chen. Especially when he is drinking. Same goes for Johanna. - * Abathur: Kill the slug. But don't die to do it. - * If your team has vulnerability talents, take note on where they are using them. Try to coordinate with your Tyrande or Sylvanas to get a huge burst at the onset of a team fight. - * Coordinate with your team to kill heroes when they try to dive into you (e.g. Illidan, Greymane, The Butcher). This often involves saving your stuns / blinds / polymorph abilities. - * If you are trying to focus The Butcher, and he brands you, just run. He heals for an impressive amount, and can stay alive longer than you would think even against focused damage. Your team will quickly take care of him without the healing from Butcher's Brand. - * Murky is very annoying. He also isn't very good right now. Avoid / kill his puffers, and don't focus him unless you can instantly delete him (pay attention to when he uses his bubble). Please, please, please don't waste an ult on him. Obviously, his priority goes way up if you kill his egg. - * Misha only counts for a quarter kill, and has a powerful, low cooldown heal. She is very low priority. "

139,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Alarak: First talent impressions,8,50ap9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/50ap9l/alarak_first_talent_impressions/,2016-08-30 21:49:39,"I'd like to give overall impressions, but I've given him several games in exclusively AI so I can't really speak much for his engage capabilities, escapability, laning, all that, but I've played the game enough to theorycraft about some of these talents. So, starting off: Level 1 Without Effort (W) Telekinesis no longer costs Mana *I'll go ahead and say it here in reference to the other mana talent as well, Alarak does not have any mana problems really, if you hearth when you have the opportunity and don't try to stay permanently on the field. You do get chances to do so. I've only ever run OOM once though, and this was in AI, right before we ended the game. So these talents will not help you much. The buffed globes from the Gul'dan patch and a fountain tap or two will probably be all you need.* Power Conduit (E) Reduces the Mana cost of Lightning Surge by 15 *See Without Effort comment above.* Applied Force (E) Reduces the damage bonus of Sadism by 10%, but Telekinesis pushes 20% further *Ever felt like Telekenesis needed to give just a little more push? This can help. But for chasing and engaging, the baseline version does a pretty good job. The main utility of this talent, I think, would be for if you use Telekenesis as an escape.* Wide Lighning (E) Increases the width of Lightning Surge's beam by 50% *It being AI, this was typically my go to because they group a lot and I wanted to have some fun. This talent gives you a little more room to work with hitting things caught in the beam. If you don't need Applied Force, this will probably be the preferred choice.* Level 4 Double Cross (Q) Increases the range of Discord Strike by 25% and also hits in a line perpendicular to the forward strike. *Interesting, slightly underwhelming talent. For those that haven't seen it ingame, the ""line"" it forms is actually two small prongs that go off to the side of the triangle, right in front of you. It could be useful if they try to hug close to you and dodge around you, but then you're not getting much out of the range. The range does help him poke more though, could be useful against range heavy teams if you don't need the bonus E range.* Reckless Strike (Q) Reduces the delay of Discord Strike by 0.25 seconds but if it hits an enemy you become Vulnerable, causing Alarak to take 25% damage for 2 seconds. *This halves the delay for the strike in exchange for making yourself Vulnerable. Unless you're against a hypermobile composition, I don't think you really need this. Plus, you really feel a Vulnerability a lot more than a Resistant.* Cycle of Discord (Q) Reduces the cooldown of Discord Strike by 2 seconds. If a Discord Strike hits no enemies, the mana cost is refunded and cooldown reduced by 3 seconds. *My go-to for these games. It reduces the cooldown by 2 seconds baseline, putting the cooldown equal to his E, which is a noticeable difference. The second aspect of it is not just a noob crutch, either, as it puts it on a short 3 second cooldown if you miss with a full mana refund and lets you be much more aggressive with your Discord Strikes, as a miss is not so punishing.* Extended Lightning (E) Increases Lightning Surge range by 20% *The range on his E is already pretty significant. I've yet to wish I had this talent, but if you won't have a lot of direct engage opportunities, it could help.* Level 7 Chaos Reigns (Q) ! Quest: Each time Discord Strike hits a Hero, its damage increases by 3, up to 45. ! Reward: After hitting 15 Heroes, increase its damage by an additional 45. *This is a tier I'm left wondering. Personally, I kept going for Chaos Reigns most of the time, again, because it's AI. The bonus damage here obviously is boosted by your Sadism as well. The only question is if 180 damage is really worth it. Certainly not a bad improvement, but maybe a small buff would be warranted for this talent in the future, perhaps a bonus 15 to the completion bonus. Even without this talent his Q still hits pretty hard. There is also obvious synergy with this and the cooldown reduction of Cycle of Discord.* Endless Energy (E) ! Quest: Heroes hit between you and the victim permanently decreases the cooldown of Lightning Surge by 0.2 seconds, up to 2 seconds. *Upon completion, you get a 4 second cooldown E, which is pretty sweet for poke, and maybe it'd warrant a mana talent for it then, but I still haven't gone OOM the couple times I tried it. With this and the range talent you might be able to compete against range heavy teams in poke.* Thunderstruck (E) Reduces the damage bonus of Sadism by 10%, but Lightning Surge slows enemies hit between you and the victim by 70% for 1.5 seconds. *Very powerful slow in theory, but may be unreliable a lot of the time unless you catch an enemy in a minion wave. Also costs you Sadism, which is significant for your damage output in fights. Unlike the damage bonus further down the line, if you don't get frequent use out of this talent, it's probably a waste.* Level 13 Psychokinesis (W) Increases the damage of Telekinesis by 100% *Effectively makes Telekenesis deal about the same damage as your E, which isn't to be underestimated if it's a part of your burst combo. And at no other cost, this will likely be the ""default"" that the other talent picks have to compete with under different scenarios.* Pure Malice (Passive) When a nearby Ally Hero dies, your Sadism bonus is increased by 8%, stacking up to 40%. This bonus Sadism cannot be consumed by Hasty Bargain and is lost on death. *Ever have those teammates that just won't stop dying? Or a Murky, or a Vikings that keeps getting hunted? This talent could help you keep your team afloat by adding onto your damage even further using their deaths. Definitely a carry-esque talent. Just don't die, yourself, or you lose it. Wonder if any pro teams will use this talent to their advantage through intentional feeding?* Dissonance (Q) Reduces the damage bonus of Sadism by 10%, but increases Discord Strike's silence duration by 0.75 seconds. *Utility at the cost of some damage. Useful against a lot of ability damage, obviously, and for targets that are squishy enough, but have a high enough output to warrant a longer silence, that the lost damage doesn't impact you that much.* Hindered Motion (W) Reduces the damage bonus of Sadism by 10%, but Telekinesis slows enemies by 40% for 1.5 seconds. *Helps for chasing down targets with Telekinesis. The baseline version will likely secure you plenty of kills already anyway, so this would probably only be important if they're doing a really good job of peeling or the target is particularly slippery.* Level 16 Sustaining Power (E) Increases the healing you receive from dealing damage to Heroes with Ligtning Surge by 30%. *The sustain option. It's a pretty powerful increase in self sustain at range, and would likely be the favored choice for a poke-based E build, but for a typical melee build, the baseline version ought to be all you should need to rely on, as you're asking for trouble if you want to sneak any more. Not that it's impossible, but it's very risky, flashy, and could fail you horribly.* Negatively Charged (E) Increases damage dealt to enemies hit by the center beam of Lightning Surge by 100%, but does not generate any additional healing. *This makes the beam between targets hit almost as hard as your Q. My typical go-to, when you get the chance to use it, it HURTS. Just pay attention for an opportunity, even a tiny one, as the ability is as instantaneous as they come.* Quick Mind (W) Reduces the damage bonus of 10% and the cooldown of Telekinesis by 6 seconds. *Telekinesis does have a pretty long cooldown. If you feel like you aren't surviving enough in fights and you're using your W as an engage first, go with this one instead of the sustain talent, so it may be back up in time for you to push yourself out again and escape.* Projected Force (W) Reduces the damage bonus of Sadism by 10%, but increases the range of Telekinesis by 25%. *Telekinesis, like your E, has a pretty solid range already. If you pay attention to when an enemy is starting to flee, you can catch them pretty easily. The range bonus has no impact on your own survivability.* Level 20 Counter-Strike/Deadly Charge (Alarak gains the ultimate he didn't take at 10. The second Heroic will take over the Trait button) *I think Counter Strike is the ideal choice at 10, but if you feel like you need some more engage, or a sweet Charge into Counter Strike combo for huge damage, go for it. The other talents are situational.* Last Laugh (Active) Cooldown: 20 seconds Activate to remove all roots, slows, and damage over time effects and teleport to the chosen location. Activating Last Laugh will immediately reduce Alarak's Health to 1. *Like Bolt, except you practically kill yourself to use it. But you're still alive. This should only be taken as an escape until you're very confident in your Alarak skills, and be wary of minion waves when using it because even a stray Archer arrow can kill you after you use this.* Hasty Bargain (Active) Cooldown: 20 seconds Activate to permanently reduce your Sadism bonus by 4% and reset the cooldowns of your Basic Abilities. *Where Last Laugh will probably prolong your game, Hasty Bargain should be used in the hopes of shortening it. It's a Rewind on a 20 second cooldown, but at the cost of part of your damage for the remainder of the game. That means, you shouldn't want to use this more than 3 or 4 times before you win, because otherwise you're seriously neutering your damage and chances of winning. I wouldn't recommend this talent if you're still getting used to Alarak or don't know how to end a game quickly (that means wasting your time on merc camps after you wipe the enemy team).* I have found Alarak to be a very fun assassin and maybe even my replacement for Greymane after all these nerfs. I try to limit my Sadism reduction where possible, but he looks like he'll have some situational tiers where the utility outweighs the damage occasionally. If you do manage to live without them, you can output a lot of damage in a rather bursty manner. My DPS build (that I deviate from as necessary) and current favorite is as follows: Wide Lightning, Cycle of Discord, Chaos Reigns, Counter Strike, Psychokinesis, Negatively Charged, and either Hasty Bargain or Deadly Charge. Leave your thoughts in the comments."

142,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Ysera Hero Concept - a unique support who heals from afar,38,5246x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5246x5/ysera_hero_concept_a_unique_support_who_heals/,2016-09-11 03:42:22,"I've been thinking a lot of having another dragon in Heroes of the Storm. After reading [the Future of Dragons in HotS](URL I thought of ways to bring each aspect's invidual abilities and themes into the Nexus without falling into the typical dragon abilities like a breath or tail swipe. So I came up with a concept for everyone's favourite green dragon, Ysera, and I hope you like it. Ysera is a ranged support hero who helps out her allies from afar through the Emerald Dream. Kind of like Abathur, she can be useful in teamfights from anywhere in the map, though taking risks and positioning in places where she's left vulnerable is rewarded with more healing output as well as soaking XP for her team. Worth noting is that the numbers are very rough, because I don't know shit about balance, and are just directional. **Abilities** **[Z] Dreamway** * Cooldown: 30 seconds. * Phase through the Dream to a target location you have vision of. [Similar to Abathur's Deep Tunnel.] **[D] Sleeping Minds** * Your abilities have global range. The closer you are to the target of your ability, the more powerful the effect becomes. **[Q] Dream** * Cooldown: 5 seconds. * Dream with an allied hero, gaining new abilities. You also heal the affected ally for up to 5% of their health each second. [Works like Abathur's Symbiote.] * **[Q-Q] Swiftmend** * Cooldown: 5 seconds. * Quickly heal the affected heroes for up to 25% of their health, but the passive healing is disabled for the next 5 seconds. * **[Q-W] Green Scales** * Cooldown: 7 seconds. * Grant the affected heroes a weak shield for 3 seconds. If the shield is not damaged within that duration, it is refreshed. [Basically, you can shield up the whole team before the fight starts to give them an extra bit of protection.] * **[Q-E] Wake Up** * Cancels Dream. **[W] Emerald Whelp** * Cooldown: 30 seconds. * Sends out a Whelpling to scout out an area. Lasts for 1 minute or until killed, or replaced by a new Whelpling. [Similar to Lunara's Wisp. Soaks XP?] **[R1] Tree of Life** * Cooldown: 90 seconds. * Grow a Tree in a target location you have vision of for 10 seconds. The Tree will heal nearby allies for up to 10% of their health each second. [Can't be attacked, doesn't have collision.] **[R2] Creeping Nightmare** * Cooldown: 90 seconds. * Succumb into the Nightmare, allowing you to target enemies with Dream. Your healing done will be damage instead and Green Scales will grant vulnerability instead of shields. Lasts for 15 seconds or until cancelled. **Talents** [just a couple, I can't be bothered to write them all] **Level 1** * Rude Awakening [Q-E]: Wake Up now also deals medium damage to all nearby foes. * Chameleon Skin [W]: After arriving to its target location, Emerald Whelpling will gain permanent stealth. * Emerald Eyes [W]: Emerald Whelpling has increased vision radius. **Level 4** * Fruits from the Dream [Q]: Quest: Whenever an ally gathers a Regeneration Globe, increase the passive healing done to them from Dream by 1%, up to 10%. [Every ally has their own stacks.] **Level 7** * On Emerald Wings [W]: Dream can be used on a Whelpling to grow it into an Emerald Drake, giving you full control over its movement. The Emerald Drake has a lot more health than the whelpling [about as much as a tank would have], and can use auto attacks. [Best used as a meat shield in case your team doesn't have a tank.] * Dream Winds [1]: Activate to make target ally Unstoppable for 1 second. Also increases the healing received from you by 25% for 2 seconds. Can be used while Dreaming. **Level 16** * Growing Scales [Q-W]: Doubles the shield size of Green Scales every time it's refreshed. **Level 20** * Tree of Dreams [R1]: Dream now also affects all allies that are within the radius of Tree of Life. * Echo of Ysera [Q]: After you die, your spirit will linger in the Dream, allowing you to use your Q ability with minimum efficiency."
143,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Should Nova do siege damage?,6,52qbpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/52qbpx/should_nova_do_siege_damage/,2016-09-14 22:56:05,"This topic isn't to debate Nova as hero or how viable she is(n't), moreso to discuss whether or not she should be doing siege damage, killing minions, helping destroy structures, taking camps etc. at all. In my limited experience playing Nova myself, I've been criticised for attacking minions or helping take camps or soaking lanes (when my team mates were not present); yet when I've played with Nova players (in QM or HL) I often see them finish the game with 0 or close to 0 siege damage, which can be especially frustrating to me if every lane is pushed into your towers and there's a Nova just sitting in a bush reapplying her makeup. When I ask them to help I normally just get insults thrown at me. Obviously I'm not suggesting a Nova should be topping XP or anything but being 4th or 5th in siege damage, but the difference between 0 and 20k siege damage can be quite significant to your team IMO and her vulnerability at 16 can massively assist in fast camp steals or boss / objective fights."

But no matter how much time passes her passive continues to be broken even at the highest levels of play. We just got another map that is just a Sylvanas playground, the zerg rush is already super strong and with a well protected Sylvannas the first rush wins games. **I think it's time we just admit her passive is a bad idea in a game with strong NPC objectives.** It's too binary and the only counterplay is kill/zone Sylvannas. But if they won the objective, that's likely not a possibility because you normally don't win objective as the weaker team. Honestly I think it makes even balancing the objectives hard because you always have to ask ""but what if they have Sylvanas?"" She's not even weak at team fighting or anything and pushes pretty well too. **New Black Arrows:** Deactivates minions/mercs and reduces the damage of towers and Bosses by 25%. Original target always suffers vulnerability, basically making Cold Embrace (level 16 talent) part of the ability. Remove or Rework the level 16 talent. *That's just an idea because I understand how massive of a power loss this change would be for Sylvanas. Snowballing objectives is basically the only reason she is picked now.* **EDIT:** As another poster pointed out baseline possession may be a better fit than baseline cold embrace. It helps keep her more specialist focused, I'm personally not fond of vulnerability with short kill times, and then you could buff the rest of her kit a bit to bring her up to par. If she needs to be buffed to make up for the tower deactivation, that's fine, but the boss debuff should be a nice change. Additionally rolling the vulnerability in for level 1 should help make her team fight a little better to make up for her lesser ability to just super snowball a single objective into a win on her stronger maps. **The problem isn't that she is too strong in win rates, it's that Black Arrows is just unhealthy for the game in it's current state.**"

146,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Kael'thas's Changes are Counter-Productive,0,4vqvf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4vqvf8/kaelthass_changes_are_counterproductive/,2016-08-02 15:10:19,"Kael'thas is generally seen as an overpowered god at lower levels of play. In pro play, he goes many games without even being picked or banned. He isn't an automatic pick because he has the vulnerability of no escape  Greymane + Sanctification, or Greymane + Anub'arak stuns, or Sonya's Leap, etc. are all guaranteed kills on Kael'thas when your team is coordinated enough to followup and focus the squishy mage. But what I really want to point out is how he's so good at lower levels of play for a reason. Living Bomb only gets secondary damage if the enemy players actually spread it. The new Sun King's Fury is limited by the enemies' awareness of this, just as Master of Flames has been. The fact that at lower ranks teammates will often light you on fire, and in fact you will often light your teammates on fire, is a big part of what makes him so ridiculously good there. In pro play, however, he is focused down, and the damage he does put out is mitigated. The Q build that many are also gravitating toward now suffers from a similar problem. Not only is it undertuned when not facing extra tanky comps, but players can always dodge the Flamestrike since it's delayed  it become more of a zoning tool alone. The level 20 buff isn't even acquired in many games, and there's still the passiveness of only playing with your Q for the most part and not getting close enough to use W and E while you're working on your stacks. I've always gone the Gravity Crush build in the past for the reason that coordinated play prefers single target focus, maximization of all abilities, and controlled skillshots (made through your own agency) over area damage through uncontrollable enemy mistakes. That's why Nazeebo is never played in competitive! He's pretty much an area of effect mage. You don't get caught in walls often, either. The changes for Nazeebo are hopefully a step in the right direction. But for Kael'thas, I think we're going the absolute wrong way. He was close to a 50% winrate, which means he shouldn't be the focal point of balance  greater outliers should be priorities. And these changes only make him more powerful at accidental damage at lower tiers, and less powerful at coordinated damage at higher tiers. Resulting in the Kael'thas god becoming even more of a noob stomp while even less likely to be picked in competitive. How is that an improvement? On top of it all, we're all tired of having to relearn Kael'thas. Why the heck do we have to relearn again when he was just about 50% overall? tl;dr: Kael'thas just got better at noob-stomping with greater mistake-based AoE, and worse in coordinated play (where he is already less common) where skillshots and target-focus matter for the same reason that Nazeebo is never seen in competitive. Plus, he's been needlessly changed in terms of current winrate and players getting used to the hero."

By nerfing the bonus damage from Frostbite to chilled enemies, the Base Damage of Jaina's Abilities can be buffed without buffing her Amplified damage as well.* **Frostbolt** - Increase Damage from 190 to 219. (Amplified Damage from 285 to 284.7) = *With Frostbite dealing more base damage, she will have better poke damage that can compete with the other mages.* **Blizzard** - Increase Damage from 142 to 147. (from 213 to 191.1) - Cooldown decreased from 15 to 10 seconds. - Increase Waves from 3 to 4. - Deals 25% less damage to Structures. - Mana Cost reduced from 90 to 65. = *Blizzard cooldown reduced from 15 to 10 but wave damage is nerfed by 10%. Lower cooldown but less damage. Mana Cost reduced to allow spamming the ability and effectively zone without zoning Jaina's mana management.* **Cone of Cold** - Increase damage from 230 to 291.

148,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Greymane's Marked for the Kill change...,3,4rdsby,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4rdsby/greymanes_marked_for_the_kill_change/,2016-07-06 03:20:58,"Went from being one of the most potentially fun ultimates (with the right adjustments) to a boring vulnerability spell. You can no longer reactivate to leap to opponents? A much more interesting change would be to simply reduce the Cooldown of the spell dramatically (say 20 seconds or so) and remove the vulnerability of it all together or nerf it significantly. Then, Greymane would be hopping all over the map executing some of the most sick plays in the game- and an unskilled Greymane would often find himself too deep without an escape. This would be awesome!!! But instead, we have an ultimate that basically does the same thing as his other one- it makes it easier to kill an enemy that is close to him. Boooooo! Do you remember seeing the Greymane spotlight?? Remember how cool Marked for the Kill looked? But then... we realized it was on such a damn long cooldown and was so insignificant that no one ever took it. But I took the damn thing! Why? Because it was so much fun. However, missing a shot and having to wait a minute and a half to get the darn thing up again was ultimately not worth it- especially compared to Go for the Throat's ability to clean up a team fight. But if Marked would just be on a shorter cooldown, it would literally allow for some of the coolest plays and highlights in the game. "
149,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,A misconception about pushing.,156,4rz4sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4rz4sr/a_misconception_about_pushing/,2016-07-09 16:15:35,"Right now alot of people have the idea that pushing properly does not take skill and that they are losing to lesser skilled opponents because they got outpushed even though they BELIEVE they could out team fight them. This is something that has resurfaced with the minions/cata changes. But neither of these is the case. This is basically the equivalent of micro/macro in Starcraft. **You have your team fight strength and mechanical play (micro) and your pushing/split pushing/mercs/rotations (macro).** Both are inherently important skills in the game of Heroes of the Storm. The dramatic difference happening with the PTR changes is that maco matters more now. Since the scaling changes superior macro gave you an advantage but superior micro is what won games. You could outmacro an opponent and even outmicro them for most of the game, and lose to their micro once and lose the game. However outmacroing them was still not very effective and rarely ended games. With the minion/cata changes the balance of micro to macro has dramatically changed. No longer is micro exclusively and overwhelmingly dominant and it's a large change. The balance may or may not be ok. But calls of being beat by less skilled opponents or that micro should be the only thing that matters are incorrect. Think of starcraft if either macro or micro was dominant to the point the other didn't matter. It'd be a lesser game, and so would Heroes of the Storm. The close fights are more exciting, but without the overall storyline they are also far less compelling. **So I ask you, as players, to consider macro an important part of the game.** We all have our own opinion about the exact balance of macro to micro, but undeniably having both a viable threat will make for a more exciting and varied game overall with better storylines. **And regarding the current balance on PTR?** Test, try to let go of your personal feelings, test, test, test, and then try to come up with a good idea/compromise/solution for an level where both micro AND macro are effective. **Edit:** A side note about promote comparisons. Promote was instant, required no investment, and required no skill or vulnerability. You just popped it right before objectives and opponents had to spend forever clearing big bags of hit points or let them destroy structures. Proper pushing requires time, coordination, planning, teamwork, and puts people at risk of death. It's also about 50 times easier to clear than promote, taking one ability rotation from many heroes to kill an entire push. The differences between proper pushing and old promote strats are day and night."
150,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Li-Ming Talent issues,7,4taydj,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4taydj/liming_talent_issues/,2016-07-18 04:50:05,"Li-Ming is currently in a pretty good spot, however some some talents could use small tweaks. **Tal Rasha's Elements** - there was a patch that changed the way this talent and Temporal Flux work... and it dropped Li-Ming's winrate by 1.5%, even though those are just lvl 20 talents. The way this talent works now is that it gives 5% ability power stack after casting each ability, but the bonus is not applied to currently cast ability. For example doing WQER combo will have W at 0% bonus, Q at 5%, E at 10% and R at 15%. Next ability cast will have 20% bonus and chain will be forced to end, resetting to 0. Basically this means it's impossible to get full benefit of this talent within one rotation of abilities, which makes this talent very clunky to use. *Solution 1*: Add a way to maintain ability power stacks after getting to 20%. One way to do this is to require full 4 different spell rotations for it to maintain effect. Example: WQER-WQER should have second rotation of spells at full 20% bonus, but something like WQER-QWQ should break chain at last Q, resetting to 0. Other way to do this is to lower amount of ability power per stack, but increase number of stacks (for example 5 stacks of 4% or even 8 stacks of 2.5%) and revert mechanics of this talent to pre-nerf state, which is as long as you don't cast same spell twice in a row, stacks are maintained. This would make getting to full stacks require good spell management and sometimes sacrficing potential cast in favor of maintaining stacks. *Solution 2*: Make stack bonuses be applied immediately within a chain. WQER would make W at 5%, Q at 10%, E at 15% and R at 20%, next spell should start new chain and have bonus of 5%. Using ability twice within a chain would reset bonus to 0 for the ability breaking the chain. For example, WQEQ would be W at 5%, Q at 10%, E at 15% and second Q at 0%. Next ability cast would start new chain and have 5% bonus. This solution would make effective rotations of spells more rewarding, but still punish breaking the chain by resetting bonus to 0. **Temporal Flux** - in the same patch, functionality of this talent changed from constant 40% slow, to stacking slow, up to 60%. The problem is that fully stacking it takes a long time and missing ticks resets stacked slow to 0 (for example if target uses blink ability). *Solution 1*: Significantly increase stacking speed (and maybe even increase maximum slow amount to 80%, after holding laser on a target for majority of the duration). This would make holding laser steadily on target more rewarding, but still allow counterplay by using escape abilities. *Solution 2*: Make stacks decay at the same rate as they are applied. Stacked slow would gradually fade away instead of resetting instantly. **Archon** - currently very situational talent, usually causes players to suicide by making them easy focus targets. *Suggestion*: Increase mana regeneration while in Archon form by 100%. This would increase viability of this talent and add depth to its use. **Illusionist** - after increasing activation threshold to 20% of max HP, it started to be quite inconsistent. There are many impactful abilities hovering around 550 damage (540 is 20% of Li-Ming's HP) at lvl 20 (like Illidan's Hunt). When being on even levels, talent works just fine, but getting just one level ahead (which should grant an advantage) prevents this talent from activating. This could essentially mean that fighting with 1 level lead may cause loss in critical late game teamfight. Another issue is with Li-Ming duels in QM. Calamity scales 3% per level, while health pool scales 4% per level. This means that, after level 17, being 1 level ahead puts you at massive disadvantage, as your teleport will proc opponent's Illusionist, but her teleport won't proc yours. This creates counter-intuitive situation, where you should avoid engaging enemy Li-Ming when being ahead in levels. *Solution 1*: Decrease activation threshold to 17-18% of max HP. It would be a buff, however considering Li-Ming's winrate is just 48% this patch, it is a fair change. *Solution 2*: Make Illusionist proc based on level 0 stats, multiplied by active modifiers (such as Follow Through, Resistant or Vulnerability). This would make this talent consistent regardless of team levels. **Zei's Vengeance** and **Arcane Orbit** - orb talents currently have by far the lowest winrate on every tier. *Solution*: Buffing both these talents from 25% to 30% bonus could increase viability of Orb builds and make them on par with good Missile and Teleport builds. **Ess of Johan** - although this talent was far too powerful on level 4 and removing it was better solution than leaving it there, perhaps reintroducing this talent could add some intersting options to Li-Ming's builds. *Suggestion*: Add Ess of Johan to level 20 talent tier. When other heroes gain access to extremely powerful level 20 talents, Ess of Johan is a fair, especially considering it would be mutually exclusive with current level 20 choices, unlike on release day. EDIT: As Ess of Johan suggestion is causing some controversy, I wanted to clarfiy I merely included it as food for thought and a starting point for possible discussion rather than main focus of this thread. I just think it could be an interesting talent for 20 tier, a possiblity that was never explored in game."

The concept is a *living* map. Onyxia is hovering at the top of the map and at match start yells: **Amuse me pathetic mortals.** The map minions are welps. The Mercs are Draconians. At periodic intervals Onxyia will land at random areas for a small duration. The team that does the most damage to Onxyia will be rewarded with Eggs near their forts/keeps, which they can hatch for super large minion waves. Dealing 75% of Onyxia's total HP will cause the enemy team to randomly spawn black welps map wide. Welps will not reveal position, but if their targeted attack hits, will cause the player to be slowed and X% vulnerability. Completely killing Onxyia before her *enrage* timer will cause the boss to spawn. Nefarian? Chromaggus? Killing boss does not summon the boss, but instead empowers the eggs hatched within a period. To keep things interesting, at level 18 Onxyia will start randomly spewing targeted AOE at players, revealing their location. "

Then try the oldest mage in the game, Jaina! Many people think she's almost completely outclassed by Li Ming and Kael'Thas in terms of damage and range, and frankly that's pretty true. If you talent Jaina wrong, she's literally just a worse mage than them. What is talenting her wrong? Blizzard. Don't talent her blizzard. With range and aoe talents, it becomes a Fel Infusioned Kael'thas Q that only costs two talents! Rather, play Jaina like a scrappy low range mage who perma cc's and focuses the enemies divers and can stay alive through the worst of it. Go these talents, focus their frontline not their backline and see the results for yourself! 1. Lingering Chill (Best option because you don't need range to deal with melees, and it allows your 4 second cd Q to keep buildings chilled during pushes and it kites enemy melee's harder. Other talents will synergize with chill so longer chill is best) 4. Arcane Intellect (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TALENT. This solves all of Jainas mana problems. If you go blizzard or Q talent here you will suffer mana problems so great it'll make your head spin. This is something Kael'Thas with his mana-less W and Li Ming with her low mana costs don't have to worry about. If you don't take this talent it'll really hurt, Jaina's a different hero with it.) 7. Frostbitten (This is the only talent you have available that actually increases your damage. More damage is good.) 10. ROF (70% of time) or Water Ele (30% of time) (Depends on mobility of enemy comp, often Ele just doesn't do enough but sometimes it's godly) 13. Ice Barrier (Lets you survive face to face confrontations with their frontline) 16. Numbing Blast OR Exposure (50-50. If your team has hard cc you want vulnerability, burst them harder when they're already immobile. If your team doesn't have hard cc they likely have more damage, so 1 second root is better because it sets teammates up.) 20. Improved Ice Block (Works so well with this build's playstyle, extremely low cooldown is great and chilling enemies is awesome because talents 4/7 synergize with chilling.)

She's my favorite character since I was a kid back in WC3 so I'm pretty sad about that. Well to start off I first have always thought that Jaina is not quite what a Frost Mage I imagine to be. She is pretty much 80% Blow people up with a combo and 20% Crowd Control. However, when I imagine a Warcraft frost mage, I always think of them to be CC focused as opposed to diablo's frost mage that is more damage focused. So here is my ideas to make that happen with a lot of fun stuff mixed in. ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------- **Jaina Baseline Reworks** ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- *Trait* Frostbite * Basic Attacks now also chills targets and is amplified by chill. * Chill's amplification is reduced to **30-35%**. *(This is because her basic attacks are now amplified by chill and also to make her less bursty baseline, allowing her talents to decide whether she is more burst focused, sustain or cc focused, giving Jaina a possibility to have more flexibility in talent choices.)* * Chill's slow increased to 30%. -------------------------------------------- *Basic Abilities* Frost Bolt * Increase Range by 15%. * Cooldown reduced by 1. Blizzard * Cooldown reduced by 1-3 seconds. * Radius increased by 10% Cone of Cold * Increase range by 15-20%. * Now also doubles the slow of chill on chilled targets for 1 second/decaying back to normal over 2 seconds. ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- **Talents** ----------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------ **Lvl 1** Winter's Reach * Hitting an enemy hero with Frostbolt increases Jaina's basic attack range by 20-30% for 3 seconds. Brilliance Aura * [Quest] Gathering regeneration globes increases your mana regeneration by 0.1 per second up to 2.5 per seconds. Also increases your allies mana regeneration by half of the amount. * [Reward] After gathering 25 globes, increase your allies mana regeneration by 1 per second... or increase your allies ability power by 5-10%. Crystal Clear * Chilled enemies are revealed for its duration. Lingering Chill * No change. ---------------------------------------- **Lvl 4** Frost Shards * Every 3rd Basic Attack against the same CHILLED target deal 60% more damage. Arcane Intellect * No change. Snowstorm * Increase Blizzard's radius by 12%. Also reduces blizzard's cooldown by .5 second for every enemy hero hit. Deep Chill * [Quest] Hitting chilled enemy heroes with cone of cold increases frostbite's slow by .5%. * [Reward] After reaching 10% more slow(20 stacks), cone of cold now roots chilled targets for 1 second. --------------------------------------- **Lvl 7** Frostbitten * [Quest] Takedowns against CHILLED heroes increase Frostbite's amplified damage on chilled targets by 3% up to 30%. This bonus is lost on death. Frost Armor * No change. Ice Floes * Hitting enemy heroes reduce the cooldown by 1 second. * Cannot reduce Cone of Cold's Cooldown for more than 5 seconds. [To prevent the talent from being OP on maps like Infernal Shrines] Ice Lance * Frostbolt now pierces enemies and increases its range by 10%. Dealing 20-25% more damage every time it pierces an enemy. -------------------------------------------- **Lvl 13** Storm Front * No change. Ice Barrier * Dealing damage on chilled targets shields Jaina for 30-40% of the total damage dealt. [Basic Attacks now also contributes to her shields.] * (The increase in shield gained is because of the reduction of frostbite's bonus damage from 50% to 30-35%.) * Ice Barrier duration unchanged. (This is due to basic attacks providing shields and resetting the duration so it remaining in 3 seconds is fine.) Icy Veins * No change. Deep Freeze * Activate to gradually double the slow of chill on all chilled targets over 2 seconds. Upon reaching the peak of the slow, the slow decays back to normal over 2 seconds. --------------------------------------------- **Lvl 16** Northern Exposure * Hitting enemies with both waves of blizzard causes them to take 25% more damage for 2-4 seconds. *(The purpose of this change is to highlight Jaina's quote: ""I'm here to help!"". Moving it to Blizzard makes it an after combo Vulnerability allowing allies to follow up and kill instead of being a talent that turns Jaina into a explosive hero killer)* Frost Nova * Gain an active ability that blasts frost in an area around Jaina (Basic Attack Range) stunning/rooting enemies for 1 second and applies Chill. Snow Crash * No Change. ---------------------------------------- **Lvl 20** Cold Snap * No Change Wintermute * No Change Improved Iceblock * No Change [I won't touch this change as I feel like this is something that's up to Blizz so I'm leaving this out untouched for my rework idea.] Arcane Power * No Change Nexus Frenzy * Increase Basic Attack Speed by 20% and Attack Range by 20%. ---------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ Thoughts? :D --------------------------- EDIT: Added Deep Freeze"
156,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Nova/Widowmaker split (New Hero Idea),0,4pbum1,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4pbum1/novawidowmaker_split_new_hero_idea/,2016-06-23 03:22:43,"Okay this is a very strange idea but hear me out. I have two complaints about the way Nova works at the moment: 1. I really like Nova but I never get to play her because at my level of play she is essentially unplayable, I feel she has a fundamental design problem where she absolutely dominates lowlevel play when people don't know how avoid overextending and is close to useless in high level play because she does about as much damage as any other assassin with no other utility. 2. The existence of Nova prevents Widowmaker from ever being a character (as evidenced by the Widowmaker skin), and I really like Widowmaker and want to play her in Hots. So my suggestion is to split Nova into two characters, one side emphasizing the stealth character and one side emphasizing the sniper. **Character 1: Widowmaker** Widowmaker is a sniper with an ability to rapidly relocate and kill foes from a distance. She lacks stealth and if caught while grapple is on cooldown she's pretty much dead, but she can offer a team a lot in terms of long range safe damage, an aoe blind, and tricks to reveal or punish foes. She also has a trait which encourages her to get greedy and try to get as many last hits as possible. Trait: Trained Assassin - Enemies last hitted by Widowmaker have 5 seconds added to their death clock (this includes Murky and Misha) Q: Snipe - Works like Gazlowe's laser, except it doesn't pierce enemies, is very narrow and much longer, and inflicts additional % of max health damage to heroes. At maximum charge, snipe ignores minions and mercs. W: Venom Mine - Widow maker throws down a fast arming mine. When an enemy runs into the mine or destroys it creates a cloud of gas that blinds and damages over time enemies who remain in it. E: Grappling Hook - Widowmaker fires a grapple in a direction, the grapple travels extremely quickly and goes nearly as far as stitches hook. When it hits any object (minion, merc, hero, structure, level geometry), Widowmaker is flung to the destination very quickly and roots the target (if its hostile). Heroic 1 - Killing Zone: Widowmaker focuses for a brief channel and enters a stationary sniping stance in a 60 degree cone of your choosing, until she moves or after 15 seconds have passed: Widowmaker cannot see or attack outside of the established cone, widowmaker gets a large boost to auto attack damage and range, and widowmaker's snipes start around 50% charged. Heroic 2 - Infra Sight: Reveal and make the target 25% vulnerable for a moderate duration, your attacks and abilities benefit double from this increased vulnerability. Additionally, your line of sight is not hindered by bushes, walls or impassable terrain. *Talent ideas* Widow's Kiss - Snipe inflicts a very light poison that does tiny damage over 20 seconds, if the enemy tries to hearth while poisoned they are revealed and the channel takes 30% more time. Suppression - Snipe inflicts a small movement and attack speed slow to everyone the bullet goes near and in an AOE around the final target. Venom Cloud - Venom Mine's gas cloud expands by 60% over its lifetime. Spider's Trap - Venom Mine makes character suffer increased damage from your next snipe. Choking Fumes - Venom Mines damage over time is increased by 500% against minions and 200% against mercenaries. Escape Artist - Grappling Hook can be used while rooted, makes you unstoppable and gives a brief speed boost. Garrote - Grappling Hook slows and damages over time enemies hit by it. Flying kick - Grappling Hook knocks enemies back and delivers moderate damage. Web Slinging - (Quest) Kills reduce Grappling hooks cooldown permanently and instantly refresh it. At 15 Kills, Grappling hook also gets longer and happens faster. Generics: Seasoned Marksman, Sprint **Character 2: Nova** Nova isn't really a sniper. She uses a sniper rifle, but more important to her identity is that she is a ghost, a sneaky operative with a bag of tricks. So Nova is now a james bond-esque gadgeteer. She gets a ton of long cooldown abilities and tricks to help her out and can help a team in nearly any circumstance. Her massive versatility is her greatest tool. Trait: Right Weapon for the Job - Nova passively cloaks after 3 seconds, Activate to have Nova switch between a Pistol, a Sniper Rifle and a Shotgun. Her current weapon will change her Q and adjusts her base stats in some way. The Pistol reduces the cloak time between attacks to 2 seconds and increases her energy regeneration. The Shotgun gives her attacks an AOE and makes her do increased non-heroic damage. The Sniper rifle gives her extra range and sight range, slows her attacks but makes them proportionally more powerful. Pistol Q - Double Tap: Nova fires a very lame, very fast, low cooldown version of triple tap. Shotgun Q - Impact Shell: Nova damages and knocks foes back in a very narrow cone. Sniper Q - Snipe: As Nova's current snipe though lower damage. W - Necksnap: Nova inflicts % damage to a target in melee and stuns both herself and the target for .5 seconds. E - Combat Roll: Nova dives in a direction, suffering half damage for the brief period of the animation. Combat Roll does not break stealth and recharges twice as fast in stealth. Heroic 1: Nuclear Launch - Nova selects an area, reveals herself, makes herself 50% vulnerable and begins an 8 second channel. After the channel a nuclear missile hits the target in 2 seconds inflicting massive damage to anything in a small radius and moderate damage to everything in a huge radius. Nuclear launch is interrupted by movement and stuns. If Nuclear launch is cancelled before the nuke hits it goes on a 60 second cooldown, if the nuke launches it goes on the full 120 second cooldown. the nuclear missile has friendly fire, though it does not affect allied structures. Heroic 2: Orbital Strike: As Nova's Current Orbital Strike. *Talent Ideas* Monomolecular Blade - Add a sword to the rotation of weapons, the sword does very high damage at melee reach and its Q ability is Artanis' double strike. Pulse Grenade - (Active) Throw a grenade that slows and does moderate damage. Flashbang - (Active) throw a grenade that blinds foes for a brief duration. Incendiary Grenade - (Active) Throw a grenade that inflicts damage in an area over time. Medikit - (Active) Heal an ally within a very short range for 15% of their health. Jetpack - (Active) Jump to a distant location after a short channel. Stim Pack - (Active) Increase an allies attack speed by 15% for a moderate duration. Lockdown - (Active) Stasis a character for 1 second. EMP - (Active) release a pulse that damages enemy shields and mana. Domination - (Active) as Sylvanus Possession. Drop Pod - (Active) summon two marines and a marauder to attack the target. Turret - (Active) Drops a turret that auto attacks nearby foes. Throat Punch - Necksnap silences the target for a short duration. Vanish - Instantly Stealth on Combat Roll. Generics: Sprint, Calldown Mule.

157,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Hero concept 'Evil' support,71,4gmmjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4gmmjj/hero_concept_evil_support/,2016-04-27 13:15:35,"Like most, I too want a new support, however, I want a support that is unlike any other support thus far. Even different from Tyrande or Khaz whom can go into DPS. This new support I want will have new mechanics. Let me present Blood Queen Lana'thel! Trait: Blue Blood While Blood Queen is above 50% HP her healing is increased by 15%. While Blood Queen is below 50% HP her damage is increased by 25%. You can activate her Trait by pressing D to siphon 10% of your max HP to an ally Hero of your choice restoring them for the HP you siphoned off. *Note* Her appearance changes based off of the HP she is at below 50%/above 50%. She will look composed, proper, royal at above 50% more like a lady. However, while below 50% she will look crazed, given into the darkness, evil. She will look more Vampire like in appearance with faded hair, glaring eyes. She wont be very mobile. She will also work similarly to Kerrigan in concept. Melee unit range for the most part. However, the cool part is that her HP Regen will be similar to Murky allowing her to keep siphoning off her HP to allies and her HP pool similar to Arthas at 5,220 at level 20. Which would stand out from any other support and allow her to make these plays. Q: Blood Bath 4second cooldown Deals moderate AOE damage in a small area. The damage dealt is reverted back to Blood Queen Lana'thel as HP gained. While above 50% HP she will recover more HP. While below 50% HP the AOE damage will be increased by 25% and increase the healing to herself by the damage multiplied. A few talent ideas for her Q: Bath again! Similar to Jaina's blizzard she will cast two pools of blood on enemy units in a small area after one goes off. Thicker Than Water. The AOE range will be increased. My Collection. Gain 1 life blood for each unit hit up to 10, 10times. Each life blood gained will increase Q damage by 1. At max stacks the damage will be increased even after death with a bonus of 50 damage. If she dies before full stacks it will reset W: Ominous Glare 8second cooldown After channeling for 1second Blood Queen will daze nearby enemy units to run away from her for 1.75 seconds. This is not affected by her trait. A few talent ideas for her W: I Cannot Stop! The channel time will be removed. Fallen Ill. After the ability is casted Blood Queen will get a bonus 30% movement speed for 4 seconds E: Vampiric Bite 12second cooldown Deals heavy damage to a single target in a small range. Applies 15% vulnerability for 2seconds BEFORE activating her E. Meaning that her E will almost always deal 15% bonus damage. The damage dealt is converted into HP gained for Blood Queen. This is affected by her trait. It'll do 25% increased damage while below 50% HP and while above 50% HP the selfheal will be increased by 15%. A few talent ideas for her E. Double Strike. Vampiric Bite attacks the same target twice in quick succession. Losing blood. Enemy units affected by Vampiric Bite will take damage over time ""blood loss"" by dripping blood for 4 seconds. Similar to envenom. R1: Feeding Frenzy 115second cooldown Increase damage dealt by 30% for 15seconds Increase max health by 50% for 20seconds Increase healing by 100% for 20seconds This does pair with her trait. However, it will not be multiplicative. It will be additive. Meaning that it wont be 30% increased damage paired with 25% increased damage from her trait for 55% increased damage. However, it will be that original 30% increase multiplied by the 25% Trait bonus. Talent for level 20 (No one lives) would be to increase the duration of each affect by 15 seconds. Making it 30 seconds, 45seconds, and 45seconds. R2: Feel My Pain 80second cooldown For 5seconds after activating all damage taken will be applied to the enemy unit. Taking equal damage of their life at once after the 5seconds is done. After applying the damage taken into damage dealt. The target will bleed for Blood Queens Regen x level (4 per level) for 8 seconds as damage over time. Similar to Xul's Poison Nova but only to targets that attack her while she is casting this ability. Note; she can still use Q,W,E, Trait while casting this ability. A talent for level 20 (Do you feel it?) The channel time is increased to 10 seconds, however, damage is dealt back immediately while applying the bleed over time affect. Something I wanted to add to her base kit but found it might be a little too much (OP) was Illusion. Blood Queen places a copy of herself (similar to Nova's decoy) while escaping as a shadow/blood pool that is invulnerable with an increased movement speed of 30% for 2seconds. Could be a level 13 talent. Similar to Sylv's Untouchable talent at 13. "
158,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Why I think DPS Nova is Strong,0,4hsns7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4hsns7/why_i_think_dps_nova_is_strong/,2016-05-04 13:16:48,"Hi i'm a scrub who first bought nova during alpha and fell in love with a cloak 100-0 burst assassin and got a master skin for her. I think Nova is actually in a very strong state right now. Of course i'm not speaking in terms of being a HL or TL rank 1 carry hero. I'm referring to how her talent diversity is more interesting now and that she actually has very strong damage output that almost seems as reliable and powerful as her previous 100-0 stale playstyle. I think that the best nova build at this point is to go for her auto attack + W build, and ignoring snipe talents. Snipe has been buffed enough after her rework where it's base damage is still very high without putting talents into it. And if you add in the fact that you can now have spammable auto attacks and W vulnerability, you can do insane dps at a fair distance and actually have the ability to help your team fight bosses. Lvl1 I take Longshot. This is essentially core for this playstyle. The long range on the slow and your auto attack lets you do damage from afar and pick off fleeing targets. Lvl4 is up to the player. I only ever use decoys for blocking skillshots, vision, or creating a meat shield to waste cooldowns before I attack. So for that I use Rapid projection for the lower mana cost and cooldown. Lvl 7 One in the chamber is essential for this build. This build centralizes weaving in auto attacks after spells for strong dps. Compared to one in the chamber which is more burst focused and honestly doesn't match up dps compared to one in the chamber. But not saying that it won't ever work. Lvl 10 This one is up to the player again. Most times you may find Precision strike better. But I always had much love for Triple tap with it being my favorite heroic ability in the game. Lvl 13 Double Tap is a must. Up to this point. You have a long range slow with a long range auto attack that does more damage for each spell cast. And now you have another charge for another stronger auto attack. Happy Nova! Lvl 16 This is an obvious choice. Crippling shot is very strong and allows you to do so much damage. Vulnerability is already a very strong talent. And you can either put it on 2 people or just ruin someone's day. I have many times where I can 100-0 an Assassin with a full burst. Lvl 20 I've been experimenting on this one. I like Nova's heroic upgrades, but the other two choices are very fun. Rewind is just insanely strong combo'd with one in the chamber that you won't even use all your spells. (Rewind only grants one charge of pinning shot) And I tried ghost protocol and I had a lot of fun with it. I honestly felt like a new hero playing this build on this talent. So if you want to try a new nova today, try out this build you probably already knew of! Or you can just flame me for playing Nova. Have an excellent time in the Nexus, Hero!"
159,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Support with a mana drain like Trait.,0,4jbxu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4jbxu4/support_with_a_mana_drain_like_trait/,2016-05-15 01:58:59,"So i was thinking about that. An heroes that drain mana as a trait would be an amazing heroes. I was thinking of those ability. Q- an aoe wave clear 6-8 sec W- Vulnerability on ennemi 10-12 sec CD E- Protection on ally 10-12 sec CD D- Mana drain with a small to medium radius. Only affect 1 person per CD 6 Sec CD H1- Increase the potenty of all of your ability. Q,W,E One time deal, D would be 3 proc of the trait 60 sec CD H2- An aoe vulnerability/Protection. So baiscly an AOE with medium radius that give all ennemi vulnerability and all ally protection. (Starfall like radius) 120 sec CD That kit would be really interesting! The goal of that team would be to just have super long poke fight so you can drain mana of the other team, mostly their tank. You would have a more passive team fight or really aggresive depending on the Heroic that been choose. "
160,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,[Speculation]Next Overwatch hero to come to Hots,3,4jocj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4jocj4/speculationnext_overwatch_hero_to_come_to_hots/,2016-05-17 10:55:10,"Here is my speculation on the next Overwatch hero to be released to Hots. All these speculations are also assumeing that the hero ""stay true"" to it's overwatch style game play, also only having 1 ult. --- ###Offense/Assassin *Least likely as there already are a number of assassins in Hots compared to other roles* **Tracer** - NA **Soldier 76** - Unlikely as he would forfill the same role as Raynor **Reaper** - Share ult with Valla, not likely. Valla master skin also have skull mask **Genji** - Possible, would be the first hero with a deflect mechanic **Mccree** - Would use ammo system like Tracer and have combat roll which refill ammo, Flashbang would be changed from stun to slow/blind I don't see how they would incorperate his ult. **Pharah** - Possibility. There are not any """"rocket dude"" yet in Hots. Would deal AoE damage with AA and able to rocket jump. --- ###Defense/Specialist *Also less likely as we are getting a specialist soon, Medivh* **Bastion** - Still still and shoot people ult turn into mobile tank. already filled by Sgt.Hammer **Hanzo** - Possible, but his standard abilities are not really suited to fit in a MOBA, His ult would also most likely just outshine Li Li water dragon. **Junkrat** - Long range bombardment which put down mines. See Basion **Mei** - Already have a ""Ice mage"" in the form of Jaina, also her ability to create walls is already in Tassadar. **Torbjrn** - A more defensive Gazlowe, both put down turrets. **Widowmaker** - French Nova --- ###Tanks *Just got a tank in the form of Dehaka, yet tanks are still far less frequent then assassins* **D.Va** - Possibility, would utilize a ""two life mechanic"" first you would need to destroy mech then D.Va herself. Would also be the first hero with a self destruct. Would also be the first with a shield which pops enemy projectiles. **Reinhardt** - Possibility, Would be one of the first ""true"" defensive tanks. Right now most tanks work in such a way which have them dive into the enemy team. Reinhardt would use his wide energy shield to soak enemy damage instead, and his ult is a cone stun which would be a great anti engage/peel tool. His charge would be like a diablo charge only that it's a skillshoot instead. **Roadhog** - Already have a ""hook tank"" in the form of stiches **Winston** - To similar to Muradin. Jump in and healthboost/knockback ult. Bubbleshield would be cool **Zarya** - Shield self/one ally. Tassadar does this. Graviton Surge is almost the same as Gazlow gravity bomb --- ###Support *Something which there are a lack of in Hots, curently there is 9* **Lucio** - Would be a AoE healer/Move speed buffer, Like Kharazim W but passive, his ult would be a stronger version of the Stormshield talent **Mercy** - Single target super healer with damage modefier(stim drone), to similar to Lt. Morales **Symmetra** - Small shield/turrets/teleport. Tassadar shields better, Gazlow put down better turrets. Zagara have Nydus worm(teleporter) **Zenyatta** - Single target heal over time like Malfurion, 25% more damage to enemy debuff some supports already have this as a vulnerability talent. AoE heal. Malfuries/Li Li does this. --- Based on this personly I believe that the next Overwatch hero to come to Heroes of the storm would be **Reinhardt**. For me it's between D.Va and Reinhardt. The thing is though as I mentioned earlier is that there are already plenty of offensive tanks that dive the enemy backlines and no full ""I protect my party"" tanks, hence placeing Reinhardt over D.Va. What are your thoughts?"

Level 7 is a toss-up between Follow Through and Wind Shear, Level 13 between Grace of Air and Giant Killer, and Level 16 between Forked Lightning and Tempest Fury. Even though theres a myriad of combination, for this write-up I decided to focus on Follow Through at Level 7 and Grace of Air at 13 for simplification. Because of Follow Through and Thralls trait, Frostwolf Resilience, the two level 16 talents offer an interesting dichotomy. Whereas Follow Through procs after each skill usage, boosting the next AA by 40% damage, Frostwolf Resilience gains a stack each time a skill does damage, restoring 660 HP for every 5 stacks. Its worth noting that in the Forked Lightning build that a 3rd possible Chain Lightning is possible soon after the full skill rotation (as it has a pretty low cooldown of 6 seconds). Although this does not take advantage of the 4 stacks leftover, because you only really need one more Frostwolf Resilience stack to heal another 660 HP, it does mean you still have 4 stacks left for the next Feral Spirit or Windfury to proc the heal. However, if one wants to look at cooldown timers and number of Frostwolf stacks possible to compare levels of sustainability on Thralls HP, one would have to take into consideration other talents as well (namely Level 7s Wind Shear). That could be another post on its own and wouldnt be all that practical. It might tell you damage and sustain spikes based on how long a fight lasts and how many enemies are around but at that point its just numbers on paper. You would be better off playing Thralls different builds in-game to get a feel for the pros and cons of different builds and the sort of playstyle that works best for each. #**Jaina** URL For talent reference: URL ##**Ring of Frost Combo** **Demonstration** URL **Required Talents** - Level 7: Frostbitten - Level 10: Ring of Frost - Level 13: Icy Veins (Optional) - Level 16: Northern Exposure or Snow Crash - Level 20: Arcane Power **Execution** 1. 2 - Arcane Power 1.

R - Ring of Frost (if chosen) **Damage (Level 20)** - Summon Water Elemental: 3025 to 5762 - Ring of Frost: 2304 ##**Comments** Jaina is largely considered to be weaker than Kaelthas and Li-Ming in the current meta and hasnt seen competitive play in a while. However, when talented to be a glass cannon, Jaina still deals a large amount of damage and both her ultimates provide a lot of great CC. Of course, this leaves her incredibly vulnerable without any hard CC (other than Ring of Frost), shields, or the Ice Block at Level 20, but the damage numbers of her defensive build are notably lackluster. Coming up with the damage numbers for Jaina was particularly intensive because of the variety in her talents. I wont go into each individual number or each build, but for the Summon Water Elemental (R) builds the first damage number is immediately after Blizzard ends and the second damage number is after Water Elemental ends. Its worth noting that this will cause some discrepancy as the Snow Crash talent at Level 16 creates 3 waves, meaning that the first number includes more Water Elemental auto-attacks. I tried my best to remove variability by not AAing with Jaina after casting all her skills. When deciding on any skill rotation I had to take into consideration the bonus damage from Jainas trait, Frostbite, as well as the bonus damage from Level 16 Northern Exposure. Speaking of which, Jainas Level 20 Arcane Power and Frostbite add together when calculating damage. So if her Frostbite is talented at Level 7 for 65% bonus and Arcane Powers 15% is activated, Jaina has 80% bonus damage. Also, this bonus 80% damage is calculated on her skills before the 25% vulnerability on opponents hit by Cone of Colds Northern Exposure (Level 16). Onto her offensive builds: if Northern Exposure is chosen at Level 16, one should cast Blizzard (W) first because there is a delay before the first wave falls and that way you can get the most value out of the 25% vulnerability offered by Cone of Cold (E). Also, it is possible to hit Ring of Frost (R) during the 2 second vulnerability window if it is casted quickly enough after Cone of Cold (E). If Jaina talents into Wintermute at Level 20, she should wait for her Summon Water Elemental (R) to appear first as there is a wind-up time and it will not copy your skills during that time. In the defensive builds I took into consideration the benefit of locking down an opponent, which is why Frostbolt (Q) comes before Cone of Cold (E) in the Defensive Ring of Frost build. In the Defensive Water Elemental build, the Water Elementals (R) attacks place Chill on targets so one should wait for it to attack first before casting Cone of Cold (E). #**Artanis** URL For talent reference: URL ##**Phase Prism Combo** **Demonstration** URL **Sample Talents** - Level 1: Seasoned Marksman - Level 4: Lethal Alacrity - Level 7: Solarite Reaper or Follow Through - Level 13: Triple Strike - Level 16: Zealot Charge - Level 20: Nexus Blades **Execution** 1.

W - Twin Blades **Damage (Level 20)** - Solarite Reaper Combo: 2000 - Follow Through Combo: 2007 ##**Comments** Artanis does not really have a combo; quite contrary, hes known for his crazy sustain in the right situations. So even though he has high hero damage numbers from time to time, its due to his constant auto-attacks and stickiness in fights. However, I thought it would be fun to see how much damage Artanis could do with his arguably unsynergized kit. Of course, one would ideally initiate the combo while the target is running away so that Artanis is in place after his Blade Dash (Q) to AA into Twin Blades (W). #**Sylvanas** URL For talent reference: URL ##**Windrunner Combo** **Demonstration** URL **Sample Talents** - Level 4: Withering Barrage - Level 10: Wailing Arrow - Level 13: Windrunner - Level 16: Cold Embrace - Level 20: Deafening Blast **Execution** 1.

However, she can also be talented for great hero damage mainly through her Withering Fire (Q). One thing I discovered while playing Sylvanas in Try-Mode is that even though you can hold Q in order to auto-fire Withering Fire, you can fire faster still by manually rapid-clicking Q. This can be seen in the Keyboard Map displayed in the demonstration gifs above. Note that I am still spamming Q even after all 6 stacks of Withering Fire (Q) have been fired and I have already casted Haunting Wave (E) to restack Withering Fire (Q). I do this because of Withering Fires (Q) low-cooldown, which means that it will gain one more charge before I have to reactivate Haunting Wave (E). #**Valla** URL For talent reference: URL ##**Q-Build Combo** **Demonstration** URL **Sample Talents** - Level 1: Siphoning Arrow - Level 4: Puncturing Arrow - Level 7: Repeating Arrow - Level 10: Rain of Vengeance - Level 16: Tumble - Level 20: Storm of Vengeance **Execution** 1.

For example, adding Vallas Strafe (R) versus Rain of Vengeance (R), adding Level 10 versus Level 20 damage numbers, and addressing the unconventionality of upgrading Rain of Vengeance (R) at Level 20 versus talenting into Blink (1). For the sake of this post and for simplicity, I have consistently chosen Rain of Vengeance (R) and its Level 20 upgrade and decided to vary Vallas other talents for her 3 popular builds (Q Build, W Build, AA Build). It should be noted that the reason for such high damage numbers in the AA build is due to the many AAs when measuring damage numbers. Also, Giant Killer assumes a relatively high HP for the target when the target is the Training Dummy (the bonus damage is 121, meaning the target has an HP pool of about 8000). The damage numbers for the AA-build were achieved by stopping Vallas AAs when Rain of Vengeance 4 waves completed. Each of Vallas builds has its own strengths and weaknesses. Admittedly, I am not a Valla player and have only played her sparingly. Roughly speaking, Q-Build is great for sustain and 1v1 combat. W-Build is good for damage in team fights and wave clear because of the AOE of Multishot (W). AA build is consistent, sustained damage, which is good for long fights. #**Chromie** URL For talent reference: URL ##**Time Trap Combo (w/ Q-Build)** **Demonstration** URL **Sample Talents** - Level 1: Compounding Aether - Level 3: Bronze Talons - Level 6: Dragons Eye - Level 15: Quantum Overdrive - Level 19: Past and Future Me **Execution** 1.

Even though One in the Chamber is the most popular talent at Level 7 (One in the Chamber/Anti-Armor Shells/Snipe Master), I decided to look at all 3 talents because theoretically each talent offers something great. However, for simplification, I did not take advantage of every single proc of One in the Chamber when testing damage numbers. This would have required careful weaving between Novas AAs and her skills, which I feel like is against the idea of having a combo. When considering the ideal skill rotation for Nova, one has to take into consideration Novas Level 16 Talent, Crippling Shot, which increases enemies hitting by Pinning Shot (W) to take 25% increased damage for 2 seconds. This is why Precision Strike (R), which has a 1.5 second cast time, is casted right before Pinning Shot (W) to take advantage of the 25% vulnerability and to allow for enough time for follow-up skills to also gain that bonus 25% damage. As a side note, casting Pinning Shot (W) right before Triple Tap (R) allows for the first two shots to deal the extra 25% damage. Because Nova is played similar to Zeratul, in that she has to jump in, deal damage, and jump out quickly, throwing out her Holo Decoy (E) as a distraction is a hallmark of experienced players. The skill rotations listed above also take this into consideration. As noted at the beginning of this post, the damage numbers for Novas combos varied depending on how quickly the skills rotations were executed. If you test these combos for yourself, the numbers may vary in a range of a few hundred. #**Nazeebo** URL For talent reference: URL ##**Ravenous Spirit Combo** **Demonstration** URL **Sample Talents** - Level 4: Spider Cluster - Level 7: Gidbinn - Level 10: Ravenous Spirit - Level 13: Dead Rush - Level 16: Leaping Spiders **Execution** 1.

I was curious what sort of damage numbers Nazeebo could output in a combo, especially because he is known mostly for his push potential and his teamfight strength is mainly attributed to poke/sustain damage and not burst damage. The biggest difference one may see between his two combos are that Gargantuan can be killed relatively quickly if focused by the enemy team but Nazeebo is able to auto-attack unlike if Ravenous Spirit is chosen. When deciding on which ultimate to choose, one should consider the map as well as the enemy team composition. Ravenous Spirit Nazeebo is susceptible to being interrupted by stuns and the Gargantuan has great damage on non-heroes and can output a lot of hero damage if uninterrupted. On the other hand, Gargantuan can be difficult to manage due to frustrating AI and the users inability to micro it apart from Nazeebo. Ravenous Spirit is easy to control and offers quick AOE damage while Nazeebo stays far from the fight. #Last Note If anyone can come up with other combos and would like to see them, I am open to requests. Other suggestions on what information youd like to see, whether numbers or graphics, or any other related tidbits I would appreciate. I hope this guide encourages you to try out these heroes and test out their wombo combo potential!"
162,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Building from Overwatch hype, Blizzard should probably add another Overwatch hero.",0,4ktv4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4ktv4o/building_from_overwatch_hype_blizzard_should/,2016-05-24 23:51:08,"As in title, they might want to add another Overwatch hero. This would help draw attention, as well as adding more diversity to the roster (i.e. Not another Warcraft hero...) Due to the low numbers of Supports, I was thinking Zenyatta would fit pretty well as a ranged support. They need not design him like Tracer, using a charge, but could do so if they want to be consistent. Rough idea below: * **Q - Orb of Harmony -** Heal over time on an allied hero. This could mimic the original's LoS requirement by being a burst heal, with a less powerful HoT if the target stays close. (Or that feature could be a talent.) * **W - Orb of Discord -** Damage over time and/or vulnerability (I don't play enough to know if vulnerability at level 1 would be too powerful) * **E - Orb of Destruction -** Zenyatta charges for a short period before firing multiple orbs at the target. Basic damage ability. * **R - Transcendence -** Ultimate ability. Unable to attack or use other abilities, but heals all nearby team members. Similar to Tranquility. May give a boost to health or a damage resistance so that he isn't killed too easily. This may be part of the different versions similar to Tracer's mine. * **D - Master of Orbs -** Passive: All healing orbs give 100% extra health and mana to Zenyatta and nearby allies. I realise he's a bit similar to Malfurion, but these are just rough ideas that could easily be modified to be less similar. Sorry if you guys are sick of ""Hero idea"" posts, but I played a lot of HotS while waiting for Overwatch and thought I'd share my idea. I prefer this game to the other MOBAs, and would be happy if it could benefit from Overwatch's popularity. (I have many more ideas for Overwatch heroes that I will spare you from.)"
163,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Zeratul + Nova (tweak ideas),0,4c5wjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4c5wjb/zeratul_nova_tweak_ideas/,2016-03-28 02:25:36,"I like both heroes (we could use one new stealth hero tho.. Valeera maybe?), but both have some stupid/weak points. **Zeratul** If I dont count Zera having way too many ""generic"" talents, some which are completely out of place (fire aura, rly? :), then his other ulti (Shadow Assault) is something soooo primitive/stupid that it shouldnt have place on this arguably ""skill"" based hero. So what instead of Shadow Assault? Maybe Void Rupture. Zeratul teleports into area and does AoE damage around him, he can repeat it 3 times, consecutive AoE hits increase damage on targets. AoE area should be rather small in order to actually make it ""skill"" to land it. Lvl 20 could have increased damage and becomes stealthed after each hit (no matter if he takes damage or not). I can imagine it could be used for some interesting plays, apart nuking one target down. Also instead of stupid fire aura, maybe give him short vulnerability on bomb? (25%, 2 sec) Tho given number of generic talents, hes more ready to be redesigned. **Nova** Her Q was buffed, actually her Q was buffed so much that if you can nail it enough times, its as good as it was (W+Q, rewind, W+Q .. everything dies, maybe except Cho'Gall). Problem is other stuff. While her follow up build is okay-ish (Follow Up and Damage Decoy), her AA + Damage Decoy is kinda weak. Well in fact Damage Decoy simply doesnt do enough damage. So solution is either, up Damage Decoy % of Nova damage up (and thus make it really lvl 16 talent) or buff both Anti-Armor and Follow Up. If Follow Up had 100% - 120% extra, then it would be a bit more viable. Same goes for Anti-Armor shells, btw. since they are ""Anti-Armor"" could they actually ignore block? Either that or simply buff damage to 300% and make auto-attack speed only 50% of regular rate. Anti-Armor is nice that it give ""compressed time"", so you have damage now, but problem is it really doesnt increase your damage. Both Follow Up and Snipe Master increase your damage. Anti-Armor only shifts it in time, which in long term isnt good at all. **TL:DR, Q build is fine, other builds not.** Also her ultimate, noob catcher Triple-Tap. Oh my how bad is that thing. Not only you are rooted as KT when he winds up his Pyro, but unlike Pyro it stops on every structure/hero first hit making it nearly useless at any higher MMR than 1000 (irony). So how to replace it? Railgun, after very short delay (0.25 sec) fires one penetrating round that never stops. Catch is, it should be super thin round (and reasonably fast). Damage slightly higher than Ion Cannon (25% extra). I imagine skill diversity as ""multiple ways to do same stuff different way based on situation"". IMHO Triple-Tap is the worst ulti in game, or close to it."

How do you guys feel about it? I haven't had the chance to play her new form yet, but what I read actually bummed me out a bit. I always played her as a mobile poke and burst hero, upping her range, movement to speed, attack damage, and getting vulnerability. This was certainly a challenging/high skill ceiling build, but it made for some really amazing plays when you were dialed in. Given that you now have to choose between these talents, along with the nerf to cold embrace, I'm worried that she's now pigeonholed into a merc-pusher. Thoughts?"

Her wave clear is much slower due to no longer being able to take barbed shot + unstable poison together. Her assassination potential is lower due to no longer having envenom. Her team fight is worse due to no longer having AoE vulnerability. I don't even know what she's supposed to do anymore. She was already just average, but they pretty much gutted everything she did. "
166,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Sylvanas' talent build guide/discussion:,13,4cma8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4cma8i/sylvanas_talent_build_guidediscussion/,2016-03-31 06:10:56,"After playing around with the new Sylvanas (in the best master skin in the game) I've not only got some talent builds I'd like to share but would also like to see what others are doing. I've also noticed a lot of people seem underwhelmed with her talent choices so I thought I'd shed some light into some different build paths: **My current favorite: Q build:** This build takes Q talents all the way from 1-7 and offers faster clearing of both minions/mercs and more player damage than previous Sylvanas pre-patch builds. I have pretty much been building this way every game. *Level 1: Overflowing Quiver:* Sylvanas' level 1 talents are mediocre by themselves. A lot of people are disappointed with them because they offer no power spikes, but where these talents really shine is at other points in the game. I take overflowing quiver because the other two talents are very situational. Merc queen is only truly useful in Blackheart Bay if you're bot lane against someone who might have a hard time clearing siege; otherwise you are almost never going to be pushing WITH mercs - they are at their best when taken before an objective so they can do work on their own. Paralysis is only useful if you want the extra slow (more on this later); because you're refreshing your passive attack minions/structures anyway and it's borderline useless for anything else. The biggest reason you want to take this talent in this build is due to level 7 where we take barbed shot. The barbed shot damage bonus applies to the free Q from Overflowing Quiver, making you clear just as fast as Unstable Poison but giving you the additional bonus against mercs. *Level 4: Withering Barrage:* This talent offers more damage and more burst in comparison to the other two talents. More Q range is nice but unnecessary and against dive comps there are better builds that use W. The W talent isn't something you want to take if you want this bursty build to work. *Level 7: Barbed Shot:* Normally you'd take unstable poison here but Sylvanas' new talent options allows for some flexibility. Barbed shot, in combination with Overflowing Quiver, will annihilate minion waves just as fast as poison and will grant you supreme merc clearing power. You can even take bruiser camps in about 10-12 seconds with this set up which is a fantastic tool to have in your arsenal to deploy before objectives. Unfortunately for possession, it's still not very good; even as a talent. *Level 10:* Level 10 is, for once in Sylvanas' life, a flex talent. Wailing arrow is great against aggressive team comps (Illidan, Butcher, double Warrior, Morales, etc.). Mind Control is good if your team can protect you and if you are confident in your team's damage. *Level 13:* Again, another flex talent; I prefer to choose defensively here. If you are being targeted directly by CC will of the forsaken is a life saver. Spell shield is great against a mage and allows you to be more aggressive towards them. Ideally, Windrunner sounds like the ideal choice because you would be able to refill 6 Q stacks twice; but in practice it's hard to actually get all of that burst on a target. Remorseless at 16 is actually better at plucking down a tank as well. Life drain might be a talent that was useful for laning if it came way earlier but there are better defensive options than some healing. *Level 16:* Keeping up with the trend; another toss-up. The only bad choice is Overwhelming Affliction as it doesn't offer as much as the rest of this tier. It really depends on the enemy team comp. If you find yourself unable to safely hit anything but the front line take Remorseless and auto them down while tapping q. If your team is all about burst cold embrace, while it doesn't impact in an aoe anymore, is still a good talent (especially since it's easier to throw on who you want thanks to the range not being reduced anymore). If you still find yourself dying/needing help against aggressive enemies take evasive fire and run circles around them. *Level 20:* Bolt is usually the correct choice as it allows for better defensive options and offensive options; however, if you aren't having trouble dying, upgrading your heroic can give your team just what you need to close out the game. Silencing an enemy for 5 seconds takes them away from half a teamfight, and the extra range on mind control can take an enemy halfway across a map to where his team can't help him. **Current testing build: Dagger chucking:** Another potential option for Sylvanas is one that lets you spam W; providing an AOE slow, AOE poison, and frequent vulnerability procs. *Level 1: Paralysis or Overflowing Quiver:* Again, Sylvanas' disappointing level 1's are really there to set up synergies with other talents. Paralysis will impact this build later if you choose the slow at level 16. Other than that, OQ is still good if you want to take barbed shot (which I still think is way better than unstable poison). *Level 4: Lost Soul:* This is a crucial part of the build and the build wouldn't exist without it. This allows you to get way more W's off in a teamfight than normal. *Level 7: Barbed Shot or Unstable Poison:* You have no barbed shot synergy if you took paralysis and possession doesn't offer any reasonable degree of wave clear so unstable poison will be your go-to choice to prove you're a specialist. Otherwise, barbed shot - even without the upgraded Q - will still clear waves fast enough with overflowing quiver and offers better control against mercs and boss monsters. *Level 10:* See the Q build for choices; the build doesn't directly depend on a single heroic. *Level 13:* Mostly defensive options here that will be based on the enemy team. See the Q build for explanations. *Level 16: Cold Embrace or Paralysis:* More dagger throwing means more cold embraces. A key point is that although the range in W is quite long, simply chucking this at the back line when your team cannot or is not damaging said back line does nothing. Even if the enemy warrior is the only hero taking damage, chuck the W on them. 25% extra damage is enough to melt any target currently taking damage. Taking Paralysis can actually help out your team as well since the slow will be spread so much by W. However; this very much depends on the enemy team comp. If Illidan dives your team simply auto'ing and Q'ing him will almost take him out of the fight. If the enemy team is clumping a lot your dagger chucking skillz will be slowing a lot of enemy heroes at once. I'm convinced that in a dagger throwing build this talent, with paralysis, CAN be useful; but it's hard putting it into practice. *Level 20:* Same reasoning as the Q build. See there for some recommendations. Overall, I'm really happy with some of the builds I've found so far and happy with the Sylvanas rework. Her talent tree is far more flexible than before - especially starting at level 10. Hopefully these builds can help people out there who have just started trying her again and hopefully this can be a great place to discuss her builds in general."
167,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Thoughts on the Tychus Rework: What he Needs,109,4cr048,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4cr048/thoughts_on_the_tychus_rework_what_he_needs/,2016-04-01 04:16:44," For starters, I really like and appreciate the changes! However, there are some issues that should be addressed in future patches for Tychus to truly shine (arranged by ease of patching). Also, I have linked a [**clip**](URL illustrating how to use the Laser Drill for those saying it is useless/avoidable (thank you for the game to TGN Squadron's **MFPallytime** and **Koala** -- much love). &amp;nbsp; **Issue #1:** The Drakken Laser is stronger than the Odin in almost every scenario -- the Odin is often a liability even! For instance, Tychus can normally survive and defeat a diving Illidan (using Q and E to kite and W for knockback) whereas in the Odin Tychus stands no chance. Tychus is stronger *out* of the Odin than in it sometimes, while the Drakken Laser is useful 100% of the time (and more useful most of the time anyway when used skillfully). **Solution:** Have the Odin grant an *appropriate* hp boost or shield (or an ""armor"" mechanic that reduces damage up to a threshold as suggested by **Mandena**). Not only would this make the Odin a viable option, but it makes no sense that a giant mech is easier to take down than a dude in a spacesuit! The current meta (Illidan in particular) makes it so that taking and using Odin can be inferior to taking no ultimate at all! &amp;nbsp; **Issue #2:** The names of his D and E make no sense given the redesign of his trait! Why does using Minigun (D) empower auto-attacks, which are fired from the minigun anyway? Run and Gun (E) doesnt make sense either anymore since it neither effects movement speed (running) nor auto-attacks (gunning). **Solution:** Rename his D AP (or Armor Piercing) Rounds since activating it empowers auto-attacks (versus high health, armored targets especially) and rename the level 16 talent of the same name something flavorful (**GetEquipped** devised ""Lead Poisoning""). Rename his E Dash (self-explanatory) and rename the level 1 talent of the same name Run and Gun since it effects movement speed (i.e. running). &amp;nbsp; **Issue #3:** Tychus is **arguably** squishier than he should be considering he ~~has to get so close (short range) and~~ can't stutter step without sacrificing dps (fast auto-attacks). He is balanced, but *probably* on the 45% end of the 45% to 55% spectrum. This issue has to do with playstyle more than anything. **Solution:** I'm not really sure, but ~~either~~ a *slight* hp/regen ~~or range~~ boost **might** be warranted given his vulnerability to poke/dive/burst. &amp;nbsp; **Issue #4:** What happened to his cigar and cigar dialogue!? **Solution:** Bring back the cigar! Explain to the ESRB that it is a space cigar, and therefore tobacco-free. &amp;nbsp; I would like to point out a great idea by **TheExpendableOne** in the comments regarding the level 16 talent ""Armor Piercing Rounds"", which I'd like to see renamed (""Lead Poisoning""?) and *possibly* reworked. Instead of a 50% damage buff to ""Overkill"" (Q), the reworked talent would make it so that Q deals the 1.5% hp damage of his trait every tick. This would synergize well with ""That's the Stuff"" and address the perceived need for more survivability on Tychus. &amp;nbsp; **Consensus of the Comment Section:** Tychus could benefit from a little love in the survivability department. He may need a minor hp/regen buff, and the Odin definitely needs an hp, shield, or ""armor"" buff (it doesn't distract or zone threats away like Laser Drill and leaves him too vulnerable without resistant/movement speed from E, knockback from W, lifesteal from D, etc). The feedback for my proposed talent name revisions is overwhelmingly positive! Borrowing a phrase from **GetEquipped**, Blizzard's redesign *came close, but... no cigar*... :p &amp;nbsp; Many Edits, Fixed the Link (because I care, #MakeTychusGreatAgain)"
168,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Arthas Talent Rework Proposal,9,4d66ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4d66ui/arthas_talent_rework_proposal/,2016-04-03 23:45:43,"About myself Hello, Ive been a long time lurker, but this is the first time Ive actually decided to post something on Reddit, so apologizes if Ive messed something up by making this post. After the hero and talent reworks from this last patch and the recent discussions about changes for Arthas and him being rather lackluster, I was inspired, and bored enough, to take a closer look at him and try to do one of my favorite video game characters some justice (or at least more interesting). Full Disclosure: I am not an Arthas main; I am not a game designer or balance specialist; I have been rank 1 multiple times (currently climbing back after a losing strike) but have rather mediocre MMR (low diamond); I have been playing since the alpha and have about 2400 games, nowhere a huge amount; I am not a pro or even TL player; and this is my first and only MOBA (not counting the original Warcraft DOTA). Why a Talent Rework for Arthas? As evident by numerous other posts about the state of Arthas, his popularity across all levels of play, his win rate, comments by the Blues, and general perception, Arthas has fallen behind other heroes in the game and has done so for a long time. Arthas, as one of the primer Blizzard characters deserves attention. While his kit is niche and arguably clunky, my goal is to improve Arthas almost solely through changes to his talents and to refine and reinforce his role there, so as to make his niche a desirable one while still being clearly defined and not meta-encompassing. Through focusing improvement via his talents rather than kit or heroics, Arthas will fundamentally remain the same, but will now offer kore choice in how he is played to suit different playstyles and contexts, and for the actually Blues, easier to make marginal adjustments to. The changes laid out in this proposal are not intended to drastically change Arthas into a new character or to make him the new OP, first pick/ban, although I have tried my best to be conservative with his power level and for this to result in a minor overall buff to him, as Arthas is by no means bad, only subpar and somewhat boring. Ultimately, the overarching goal of this proposed rework is to make Arthas a more interesting and enjoyable character to play. If a hero is fun and interesting enough, even if subpar, people will find ways and opportunities to use them (sometimes unfortunately *cough Nova*). While this rework does not address the largely problems that Arthas faces which are inherent to his kit, the greatest flaw with him currently is uninspired talents and a dearth of excitement, something which I hope will be changed though a revamping of his talent tree. Unchanged Talents For reference here is a link to Arthas current talents and kit: URL As I decided to get rather extensive with my changes, for simplicities sake here are talents which are unchanged:  Rune Tap  Obliterate (D)  Army of the Dead (R1)  Summon Sindragosa (R2)  Immortal Coil (Q)  Absolute Zero (R) Talent Rework I have attempted to match the wording used by Blizzard in similar talents when possible, and to make the functions of each talent as clear and concise as possible, although I am sure that they are not all worded well enough. The names are completely subjective and again I have attempted to appropriately flavor them to match their function and the tone and lore of the character, so please focus instead on the actual workings on the talents rather than their names. Additionally, as stated before, I am no game designer, and so take the numbers when provided as approximations of balance, as in game testing at all levels of play, for each map, and with all compositions would be needed to determine actual, functional values. Level 1:  Bone Shield  Upon hitting an enemy hero with a basic attack, gain a charge of Bone Shield, which blocks 50% of the next heroic attack (an auto-attack or ability). Stores up to 3 charges. o A situational hybrid of block and spell shield, weaker than both separately, but with clever play can be very strong against enemy teams that dont counter this. Emphasizes your role as the front line and makes you tankier the more aggressive you can be. Synergies with AA buffs to promote more comp considerations. Possibly leans too much on being aggressive and perhaps should be able to grant charges from auto attacks made on any enemies, not just heroes, however then that may be too powerful.  Death Strike (D)  Heal for 100% of the damage dealt by Frostmourne Hungers o Encourages greater thought on when to use your D (not getting around that phrasing), and adds some Blood DK fantasy to Arthas. Also gives you burst healing which scales very well with later talents.  Harvest Soul  Collecting Regeneration Globes permanently increases health regeneration by 2 and mana regeneration by 0.1 o A stronger version of Regen Master and Conjurors for a hero that wants both health and mana regen, however provides no burst healing. The 2 health regeneration is more or less equal to Regen Master with Amplified Healing, without having to also give that to Arthas and making him better with healers. The fantasy of Arthas should include being the sole source of his own healing and being forsaken by the light and healers, not getting healed more by them.  Immortal Coil (Q) (same)  Death Coil also heals when used on enemies. When used on self, the amount healed is increased by 50%. o A reasonable talent that tried to split the difference between damage and healing, but just resulted in being worse than both Frostmourne Feeds and Stoneskin, now gives you a reason to be casting Coil on yourself in the early game and lets you get more aggressive when ganking kills or laning, but doesnt scale well with other talents until late in the game unlike other options. Level 4: Utility tier that gives you some options which help to round out your build, and adapt to the enemy teams playstyle.  Cull the Weak  Deal 100% more damage to Minions and Mercenaries. Reduces damage taken from Minions and Mercenaries by 50%. o Helps Arthas with laning, mana, and thus lets him gank more. Reinforces the fantasy of being the Arthas that destroyed Stratholme, betrayed the mercenaries that fought for him, and lead the armies that killed most of the population of the Eastern Kingdoms (yay lore). Too strong on heavy rotation maps, maybe, but Arthas never had much trouble with laning besides mana and not being able to use his kit for what its intended for, and notably this does not affect map monsters (e.g. the Immortal or the Spiders) or structures. If Johanna can have this at level 1, why cant Arthas get his own version at level 4 when he is more group focused?  Damnation (D)  Increase the damage bonus of Frostmourne Hungers by 25% for every 10% of life you are missing o A combination of Destruction and Embrace Death which makes Destruction, which was reasonable, more interesting, and Embrace Death, which was terrible, usable. This offers much more room for personal skill and reinforces the idea that you are a strong frontline and a killing machine. Perhaps you want to get focused and then surprise a greedy squishy. Also makes healing an Arthas more interesting by moving away from the idea that you must always heal a damaged ally, especially a tank, and providing for more big yet simple plays with good communication. The damage bonus is potentially too powerful, particularly when paired with shields, so more number crunching would be appreciated.  Might of the Frozen Wastes (W)  Howling Blast cooldown lowered by 3 seconds and is free when Frozen Tempest is activated. o Its hard to make talents for Howling Blast, given that it is so binary: you either hit the root or you dont, but it feels odd and makes an ability seem bad if there are no talents which affect it. Damage is in other parts of his kit and this can effect no one to the whole enemy team, and prevents them from leaving. This talent is simple, if boring, but does provide a solution to Arthas mana problems. See further before for a suggested replacement talent, as I personally feel this is on the weaker, and most importantly, boring side of my suggestions, however those who play Arthas would of course have a better idea on if this is the case or not.  [ Winter is Coming or Frost Presence] (E)  Frozen Tempest now applies its slow twice as fast. o Simple, but not boring, as often the slow applied by E goes unnoticed, this instead brings it to the forefront and enhances your ability to provide peel. Scales very well with your tier 13 talents. Punishes melee or those without escapes from getting caught with your E and helps Arthas a little bit with his issue of being kited, something which in principle seems silly for the Lich King. Level 7: Refinement tier where you get to choose a talent to enhance your decision at level 1, also Shadow Trap.  Rune Tap (same)  Every 3 Basic Attacks heal you for 3% of your max health. o Its Rune Tap. Previous Arthas only talented healing outside of Regen Master (which he couldnt abuse without Amplified Healing) and Army of the Dead (an ult) this is unchanged as it still fits in with his Death Knight theme and self-healing. Significantly enhanced by addition healing and migration talents in the level 1 tier, and new tools for keeping enemies close to you within the tree help to offset the rather long amount of time needed to get any worthwhile value out of this.  Obliterate (D) (same)  Frostmourne Hungers also hits enemies near the target for 50% damage. o As with Rune Tap, this is improved by other new talents in the tree and still feels like an appropriate improve on his kit. With additional survivability options beyond Rune Tap in the early/mid game, this is now a more attractive option and fits into a potential D build or further enhances your mercing ability.  Chains of Ice (W) Enemies hit by Howling Blast are also slowed by 40% for 1.5 seconds after the root expires. o As a replacement for Frost Strike, this maintains the same effect while moving it to Howling Blast to improve the game flow when used. When on D, often you would have already used W to catch them and the slow was either wasted or only secured another auto attack or so. Now, the slow more naturally fits into how you use your abilities and can effect groups of enemies, offering more value. W becomes more interesting as you can now either choose to use it primarily for the root, which requires you to be in close range for effective use, or use it as a long range slow, reaching your target once the root is expired but they are still slowed. Possibly annoying to play against, but also forces more decisive usage of ones escape.  Shadow Trap  Activate to summon a Shadow Trap beneath a target which knocks back and deals minor damage after 2 seconds. Lasts 3 seconds. 60 second cooldown o A small size Wave of Force or a Tychus/Medic Grenade for those who never did the Lich King fight in WoW, but also the immediate mark of someone who knew the basics of positioning and someone who didnt, something which fits quite well with Arthas kit. Very strong, perhaps too much so if used right, but serves to make up for his lack of hard displacement an effectively allows you to talent into an interrupt, something every other tank has besides Leoric. Possibly should activate after 1.5 seconds to force greater precision when used with Howling Blast (as the root would prevent the knockback). Would be too strong if directly attached to Howling Blast, as the two are de facto linked together in practice already, although if this is indeed too strong, a weaker version attached to W would be the place for this concept or even as a replacement for the base W itself. Helps to offset lackluster heroics with its innate, yet hopefully skill intense, power while also capturing more of the flavor from Arthas character history. Level 13:  Remorseless Winter (E)  Increase the radius of Frozen Tempest by 50% and the slow applied to up to 60%, but no longer deals damage. o The radius I am aiming for is approximately Azmodans Globe of Annihilation, so ignore the stated radius increase which is likely wrong. Talents which provide trade-offs between buffs and nerfs, like the old Cold Embrace, offer the chance to give grossly-powerful improvements at the loss of power elsewhere in the ability, something Cold Embrace previously failed at by over valuing range and undervaluing a team-wide 25% vulnerability debuff. Here, the trade-off is focused on team power vs individual power. A massive, largely unavoidable team-wide slow is very powerful, but is more palpable if the person providing it cant kill you, or cant kill you fast enough. Reflects the fantasy of Arthas not being dangerous solely because of his individual power, but also due to the power of the army (Team) he leads and commands. Potentially too annoying to play against with such a large slow, however given that all it does is slow and there are characters which can out range it despite its large size, it may be fair. Would be very interested in discussion about how slows in the game feel and how impactful they really are.  Biting Cold (E)  Frozen Tempest Damage increased by 50% and its slow lingers for 1 second on enemies leaving its radius. o A damage option for those who want it, but with the added change of helping you against kiting and peeling for your team safely. The buff to this talent is possibly unneeded and too much, however a straight damage buff by itself, while possibly impactful, is boring and does nothing to change your playstyle. If a tank is getting damage talents, they should also be doing something for their team, otherwise you simply turn into a tanky assassin and create confusion between your characters role. Arthas may be a bruiser, but hes a bruiser who slows and offers peel and these functions should be reinforced and reflected by his talents as appropriate.  Chill of the Throne (E)  Heroes and Summons affected by Frozen Tempest have their Attack Speed slowed by 40% o In refocusing Arthas around slows, attack speed should be included along with movement speed. This talent further punishes players for getting caught by Arthas, while improving his and his teams survivability, and encourages Arthas to not be as scared to rush the frontline, and for the enemy team to try to bate him out of position and murder the backline. Helps players to learn the value of overextending and positioning and rewarding those that do so correctly. Likely too powerful at 40%, which was chosen to keep it in line with Imposing Presence, given the area it affects and ease of use, and I am likely overstating how this will affect the enemy teams playstyle.  [Death Does Not Stop or Might of the Scourge] (D)  While Frostmourne Hungers is activated you are Unstoppable. o Another trade-off talent, giving you a vastly more powerful version of Relentless, and arguably Johannas trait given the potential uptime of this, in return for not being able to auto-attack and making A-clicking in melee very risky. Forces more strategy use of your D, reinforces the feeling of being an unstoppable (literally), evil, undead overlord, and solves most of your issues with kiting. Both helps and hinders your role of being the frontline, as you can approach and bate the enemy unheeded, but once you get to them you either have to give up being Unstoppable or not hit them or risk getting too close. A situationally more powerful Relentless that has (likely) lower uptime and requires self-restraint for proper usage. Has the potential additional benefit of lessening the important of Cleanse for Healers, as if you know how to use your D properly, you wont have to rely on being Cleansed if you go too close to Zagaras Maw, for instance. While very powerful on paper, Im not certain of this being broken, given the lower uptime, self-limiting nature of it, and being able to be countered by staggered stuns from the enemy team. Level 16:  [On a Pale Horse or Invincibles Reins]  Increase your Movement Speed by 10% and casting abilities no longer dismounts you (auto-attacks and your D will though). o Thematically appropriate for Arthas specifically and the Death Knight class generally, while also providing a fun visual and helping Arthas with mobility issues. The main benefit of this is solving the issue of Sindragosa being difficult to cast from the front, and thus does lower the skill needed in using Arthas abilities. However, by level 16 other heroes are getting talents that provide more than strict utility and quality of life improvements, and so by not offering any direct power beyond a moderate movement speed buff, this talent is hopefully still reasonable.  Death Pact  Activate to gain 40% of your maximum health as a shield for 5 seconds. Cannot benefit from external healing for 5 seconds. o This talent represents the opposite of the above talent, all direct power and negative utility, functioning as both a significantly better Stoneskin and as a significantly more punishable Stoneskin. In a QM and likely even a HL situation, this is strictly better, however in TL or in the presence of enough coordination and focusing by the enemy team, this can be countered and deny Arthas his healer(s) leaving him dead. Points for change on this talent include preventing Arthas from benefiting from any healing effect, increasing the duration of the shield and/or debuff, and increasing the shield and the extent of the debuff or a combine of such. Of the talents I have suggested, this seems to me the most unbalanced when taken in conjunction with Unstoppable on D, however I am not sure if Arthas would benefit if they were included on the same tier.  Succession (D)  Frostmourne Hungers cooldown lowered by 3 seconds. Takedowns reset the cooldown of Frostmourne Hungers. o Takedowns include both allied and enemy heroes who die. In order to allow the existence of D granting Unstoppable, Frostmourne Feeds had to be removed as an option, and so this is its conceptual replacement, which also seeks to add some more flavor to Arthas by reinforcing his patricidal and soul-devouring aspects. This can be either better or worse than Frostmourne Feeds, with its variability partly offset by the included cooldown reduction. If an ally dies, then this serves as a minor comeback mechanic for the fight, and if an enemy hero dies, as a win-more mechanic and an opportunity to get greedy with kills and chase. Given the potential to deny the enemy team a comeback, its possible that the cooldown reduction aspect should be removed or lowered, or for an internal cooldown to be applied to the reset effect.  Necrotic Plague (Q)  Death Coil will ricochet between nearby enemies, even when used on yourself. o Like Howling Blast, Death Coil is also difficult to create talents for. This is intended to amplify the healing done by Immortal Coil with the chain effect, while also providing another means of damage and displacement for Arthas, helping to create of rhythm of spreading out and grouping up when facing him, remanence of a raid encounter. Although this doesnt really change how you use Coil, it does add some more prominence to the ability that it currently lacks. While effectively serving the same purpose as before, only doing it more so, this talent will now change how the enemy team reacts to seeing Death Coil and take advantage of the spells travel time. Plus, a bunch of evil skulls flying out of people would look neat, and sometimes that is reason enough for something that is otherwise boring to exist. Level 20:  Legion of Northrend (R1)  3 additional Ghouls are created. Ghouls heal for an additional 25% more and no longer expire. o Swapped for the 5 second increased duration on the Ghouls for them being permanently, allowing for the banking of Ghouls. Forces greater emphasis on killing the Ghouls rather than just focusing Arthas, as if he lives he gets to keep them and has the potential to get 2 cooldowns worth up at once. In practice, likely nothing changes about how this talent affects the game and is more of a quality of life improvement over anything.  Absolute Zero (R2) (same)  Sindragosa flies twice as far. Enemy heroes are rooted for 2 seconds, and then slowed by 60% for 2 seconds. o Turns a lackluster ult into a very impactful one, no reason to change this as it serves its purpose.  [Wrath of the Lich King or Heroic Mode]  Take 25% less damage while above 50% health, and deal 50% more damage while below 50% health. o A replacement for Hardened Shield that fits the character better. Allows Arthas to tank when needed and to transition into a bruiser/dps when hes close to dying, further reinforcing the fantasy of being an unkillable, unstoppable monster that deserves to be the single most hated figure in WoW.  There Must Always be a Lich King  Your Respawn Timer is reduced by 15 seconds for every other dead allied hero. o Made this solely for the name, and have no intention of this being a viable talent. Realistically, this provides a minor comeback mechanic in the vein of similar talents at 20 for Uther and Johanna, however requires your team to effectively be all dead for full value, and if youre getting multiple full resets off of this, then at this point of the game a lone Arthas cant stop the enemy team from destroying the core or capturing all the objectives. One additional talent that I couldnt find a place for, but thought was an interesting idea. Can be slotted in to replace any of the above which may be too weak or too strong:  Forsaken by the Light  Increases self-regeneration effects and healing by 50% "
169,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,State of the Nexus: Kael'thas,7,4da6bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4da6bu/state_of_the_nexus_kaelthas/,2016-04-04 18:12:03,"""Your *world* is **upside down**!"" - The fire mage **Kaelthas** recently received a significant talent rework with the Dehaka patch. [As discussed](URL by /u/crawlingenchilada, his winrate is definitely not hot right now (around 44%) despite his continued high popularity; issues include reduced effectiveness of multiple talents as well as gimped kit mechanics (double casting Living Bomb, Gravity Lapse speed and duration). Here are my thoughts on achieving the theme of his kit in relation to his changes and at the same time bring balance to the hero. **Background** - I like to main Kaelthas, I've had him at level 20 for a while and recently hit 700 games played on live. I am deeply invested in Kaelthas gameplay and am both excited but serious about the continued development of this hero. I wouldn't be writing this much if I didn't care so much; he feels like the face of one of my gamer lives at this point... I'd buy any new skin in an instant. I played him so much on the PTR that I leveled him to master and more, and have still been playing him nonstop since the patch's release. To share my own statistics, my winrate with Kaelthas has dropped from nearly 60% to about 45% over his last 2 patches. *I was very unhappy when Kaelthas was nerfed at the time of Li-Ming's overpowered reign. This felt like a slap in the face to Kaelthas players such as myself. Granted, his nerf was a long time coming. But the context was out of place. At the time, playing Kaelthas required significantly more skill than Li-Ming for multiple reasons: worse mobility, less range, less burst. Whereas previously one could land 1.5 second Gravity Lapses to make ""stunning"" plays, with the change to have less stun duration and the nerfed Arcane Barrier percentage, his tools to engage became totally inferior. His Q build with Flamethrower was the only thing reliable  a build wherein most of your gameplay came from only 1 ability in the kit!* At this point, he is majorly reworked, and I've been having a refreshing amount of fun this talent-tree overhaul. He has creative new talents such as Gravity Crush and Sun King's Fury. The former allows a stronger 1v1 style of gameplay, while the latter enables Kael'thas to keep up momentum in fights whereas before he was a total sitting duck after casting his abilities. You can trade off Gravity Crush for Sunfire Enchantment in situations such as Battlefield of Eternity where damage on unstunnable targets adds up, or if landing your Gravity Lapse is less reliable. I find myself picking between his level 20 talents too... although they are fairly lackluster in general. He also buffs his E duration upon use of Verdant Spheres (D). This is nice when you need that extra moment of lockdown. While I would argue that his increased talent diversity is a significant success for his design, and as such he is in a better place than before because he's on the right track to fully using the abilities in his kit in tandem, there are still issues that need to be addressed in order to balance out his winrate and fully manifest the theme of his kit. **Theory** - Allow me to establish a dichotomy between the theme of Kael's kit and that of Li-Ming, while at the same time differentiating theme from balance. &gt; In contrast to the queen of constant arcane barrage, Li-Ming, fully engaging with Kaelthas revolves around the successful use of Gravity Lapse (E). Whereas Li-Ming is poke-poke-poke lasers popping in and out with teleports to flirt with the kill until ""oops I just killed you with that orb I sent your way"", Kael'thas is all about engaging properly. Flamestrike (Q) can be cast to land poke damage, but in order to utilize his entire kit he must get up close and personal. He achieves this by launching out the (E) whirlwind to stun his opponent and buy the time he needs to apply some Living Bomb (W) fire and ideally get more DPS/value out of the exchange than he expects to receive. If this isn't the case, he shouldn't even be closing in... for once his stun subsides, he's like a sitting duck  he has no mobility. Whereas Li-Ming can shoot everything from a distance, and gets even more revved up after dealing critical damage, Kael'thas intends to get a significant nuke out with his engage then take the time to cooldown after his stunning moment of glory. This isn't necessarily inferior in theme, it's just the nature of his kit. He's airy and combustive. He raises his arms, his target raises too, and things explode. However, it needs refinement with this approach in mind to be more competitive with the easy button mashing, skillshot-dodging wizard. **Suggestions** - -  **Revert the default stun duration of Gravity Lapse; allow Living Bomb to be recast to restart its duration** Here's my ""long-winded"" argument... Previously, a stun would grant the sun mage enough time to followup with the classic D-W-Q-W. You had the distinct play of not only getting off one Living Bomb, but exploding it into another one because you rewarded yourself that additional explosive opportunity by Lapsing the enemy. Now, with less of a stun, there's less from the sun. Here's how casting feels right now with less stun duration... you're reduced to poke-levels of damage by lighting people with a W and maybe landing your Q underneath. You can't double cast your Living Bomb (W) anymore. Kael'thas no longer has enough time or mechanics for his thematic moment of glory; he has to try and Li-Ming attack (read: poke, damage without fully commiting/engaging) his opponent. Then he waits, and he waits, then finally his stun is up and he can again try for a combo. Or maybe he doesn't even bother to land his stuns anymore, seeing as he only gets off a single W anyway. He prefers to D-W poke for free, and leave it at that. Or perhaps he went with that weak Convection talent and does all this with Qs only, fearfully forgetting about the rest of his kit or else risk the stacks he has gained. To fix this lame experience, Gravity Lapse needs its duration reverted. And double bombing should still be possible, but with the altered effect of simply resetting the duration. Gravity Lapse's reduced duration is also woefully inadequate for peeling yourself from the likes of Illidan or Diablo. It's so extreme against Illidan, in fact, that I feel a severe pang of inadequacy due to lack of counterplay whenever in the Illidan dive situation. I call this woe Gravity Lack. Without a reliable Arcane Barrier or Bolt of the Storm either, Kaelthas has very poor survivability in general. He isn't played at all in the pro scene for a large part due to this reason  the pros always capitalize on lockdown, so he doesn't survive at all if he gets even the slightest stun focus. Li-Mings can teleport out of so many scenarios. If you find yourself wondering why she has a better winrate, I would argue this is the primary cause. And to be sure, it's not like before I could get away from everything; quite the contrary. But very rarely now do I have those moments where I land the clutch stun and happen to slip away from death. My Gravity Lapse felt like a valued option before; now it feels like a mere delay of the inevitable. A microstun, practically a whack from the old Muradin Avatar. It's good for canceling, at least. You might remember there used to be a talent, Gravity Throw, to extend the duration of Gravity Lapse (and destroy minions). Let's be straight  nobody really ever picked it. *But the one time I did find use for it was awesome, I was able to disable the enemy Cho'gall just enough to secure ogre kills. Two stuns for one made Gravity Throw that much better, and Chain Bomb that much worse at spreading. It was a rare moment of talent diversity in old Kael'thas.* Wonderfully, D-E does now extend the duration of Gravity Lapse by 50%. I think this is a fantastic way to reorganize the old Gravity Throw talent. I find myself D-Eing on single targets now, especially to combo with Sun King's Fury, or to allow the rest of the team just enough time to followup with damage. *Synergies like this are what I think distinguish mains such as myself from less-experienced Kael'thas players, who tend to be carried more purely by the preeminent mindsets of ""land the big Qs"" and ""spread as much W as possible""; I know when the usually surpassed gains of D-Eing are amplified to surpass alternative Verdant Sphering. In the case of Sun King's Fury or having your team ready to match with damage, longer stun can mean more total damage than two W's or a D'd Q. Especially since W can't be double cast now.* However, oftentimes paying for the old stun duration with a D isn't worth it, and feels like too much to ask, for the reasons listed above combined with this loss of Verdant Sphering another ability instead. I also had the thought to instead give Kael'thas a movement speed buff whenever casting Gravity Lapse. This would follow along with the wind theme as well, and similarly allow him to engage/disengage more feasibly by accelerating in and out instead of just walking back and forth unexcitedly. Regardless, however, I think it feels too weird to have such a brief stun when the ability costs a whopping 85 mana by default and the animation is all about that big tornado of wind  which turns out to not do a whole lot.  **Reimplement the Nether Wind speed buff** I would say that before when I automatically picked the old Nether Wind I got it primarily for the speed. It helps reduce reaction time for the opponent. This is also the premise of Fireflies on Li-Ming  for a long-distance ability, speed is quite helpful. You see, it's pretty damn easy to dodge a long-distance Gravity Lapse when it spins toward you at only mediocre speed. I have trouble guaranteeing ranged stuns, no matter my proficiency at aiming, without the speed as well. Dodge-guessing is not an option for me at long range. I really only benefit from range when they don't see it coming, perhaps through a wall (like to disallow an immortal stun dodge on Battlefield of Eternity), or have no other path to take (such as through their gate). And fast speed or slow, the low-range targets are rarely dodged anyway. You pretty much have to miss, or they have start sidestepping the same moment you start casting, in order for the stun to not collide with its target. Speed and range are basically a paired issue to themselves. And with just increased range on Nether Wind, but this reduced new duration of stun, what's the point of increased range on his Gravity Lapse if by the time Kaelthas gets in range, the target is no longer stunned? Well, this part would be solved by reverting his stun duration.  **Unlock Arcane Barrier immediately, with a lower starting percentage, and increase its scaling derivative; trigger it as a side effect of Gravity Lapse instead of via a massive cooldown** Here comes a ""barrier"" of text, I hope it's not too ""arcane"" to read... Arcane Barrier tends to come in way too *late*, and way too *little*... *Late* because the game is usually decided by the time you acquire it. If you are winning, it will merely allow you to engage a little harder under fire. Nothing a bit of sustain-under-fire-style healing wouldn't mitigate without a thought. But if you are losing, it rarely provides enough shielding in dire situations to save your life  this is what I mean by too *little*... For such a huge cooldown, it should be making a significant difference. With a longer cooldown, its effect increases accordingly, and then the result becomes more of a binary outcome, by which I mean it really has to do its job or else totally fail. It either works or it doesn't. You have to pick a serious time to use it, too, because if you find yourself in a dangerous situation, start Arcane Barrier, but turn out to not be the one who gets attacked, it gets seriously wasted. Right now, Arcane Barrier in the losing game scenario is just such a binary ability  you either shield yourself, live through enough of the Diablo flip and its ensuing lockdown damage to blow some wind out and run to safety, or don't have enough shielding to get off that saving stun and it hardly matters whether it was activated or not. It's not like it's making Kael'thas unstoppable the way Johanna's trait shields her; he has to literally have a huge chunk of damage to absorb if heavily locked down or else it's all for naught. Now the issue really rears its head because 100% of your mana is rather difficult to make substantial with globes. As an Arcane Barrista, your job is to get enough globes to be able to pass this binary threshold when the time comes. That's very tough; I often don't even get an Arcane Barrier running until the catapults era in casual play  it usually happens in TL when I'm consistently teamworking for globes, or in the Lost Cavern where there are enough globes to form a galaxy. The other thing is, it has a large 45 second cooldown. *That's in the ballpark of heroic ablities!* There's a particular wizard who with Diamond Skin can get a sizable (20% health) shield with *every teleport*, the cooldown of which is only *5 seconds* and don't forget it has its cooldown *reset instantly* with her trait, putting her large shield off cooldown as well! I suggest instead of fumbling any further with Arcane Barrier percentages, we do away with its binary performance and embrace low mana-percentage amount by giving it greater frequency. In my iteration, casting E would proc Arcane Barrier just the same way Li-Ming's teleport E procs Diamond Skin. He would usually acquire his shield whenever engaging/disengaging, just like Li-Ming does. The two heroes manage their engagements in a different manner (stun vs. relocation), but could both deserve a shield in such a scenario. Why have to wait through a massive cooldown every time you want to pull up a shield? I think it makes more sense to be a frequent, smaller bonus than a larger, Johanna-reminiscent ""extra bar"". I think this approach is more appropriate and modern anyway, also given the latest Ice Barrier direction with Jaina toward shields resulting from ability casts, instead of from an activated mini-heroic ability on a large cooldown. Furthermore, I suggest Arcane Barrier be an available effect right after picking the talent. Why bottle it off until later? We should be able to feel the real results of questing as we go, feel our power to shield ourself grow, like developing an expertise in wards. Of course, it would have to be changed to a very small starting proportion. Unlike Li-Ming's constant shielding value, though, Kael's would be unique in that he wants to nurture the power; his has the advantage of potential maximization via the power of questing. Right now, Arcane Barrier is a constant percentage, which scales according to the rate at which globes are collected. I figure this is probably linear or sublinear in most games, assuming the rate of globe collection is either consistent throughout the game or greatest at the beginning. So in the new iteration, it would scale superlinearly. This way, it isn't too strong early, but it is closer to a reverted percentage later, still based on the number of globes collected. This can be handled by increasing the mana-shield percentage value at each level-up, just like other talents' numbers adjust as you level-up (for example the heal on Fel Infusion). Wouldn't it be fun to have a minor mana-shield early on? It'd be as natural an ability as [casting a ""ward"" (shield) in Skyrim](URL Plus, it would be a very real way of staying in tune with your increasing mana capacity. (This is actually how I thought it would work at first when skimming the patch notes  I was really excited for such an intuitive combination of previous Kaelthas gameplay components. Unfortunately it was just myself interpolating what seems intuitive.) How does this change impact player mentality on both sides? Enemies trying to slay Kael'thas recognize his shielding effect more consistently, and as such know when to expect it and aren't annoyed by any sudden unexpected lack of kill. Kael'thas himself isn't frustrated by what sometimes turns out to be a wasted 45 second cooldown. What I'm asking for is the reverse-Sindragosa treatment on Arcane Barrier. The Diamond Skin treatment. The Cho'gall hammer treatment.  **Have Kael'thas explode with a Chain Bomb upon death** I think it makes perfect sense to remove Bolt from Kael'thas. It was a good move, because Li-Ming should be unique in her blinking mage ability. Besides, thematically, he shouldn't have a generic defensive option. And admittedly, it's hard to design him a different defensive option other than a big shield and have it satisfy both uniqueness and theme. But Kael'thas could use some kind of deterrent instead. Have him explode the effects of Chain Bomb to nearby targets upon death, just as if he were an enemy hero killed by his own Living Bomb. Include this in the W ability description. He should go out with a flame! Jaina slows her death down with lategame iceblock, but Kael'thas is fast to die and let loose some fire! Li-Ming either dodges/ force displaces or doesn't! All three can have ability shields. Kael'thas grows his over time by collecting globes, Jaina wreaths her self in protective ice for as much as she casts, and Li-Ming has a consistent percentage spell for shielding. Yay for uniqueness, yay for theme! Three unique mages, with fully characterized kits! Perhaps Kael'thas' winrate would be about 50% with these changes, I would very much love to see. I wish I could mod it and experiment for real. **My Current Playstyle** &gt; As a result of the current issues, I find I do best with Kaelthas when I'm in a win-more, chase scenario, where I excel at extending the lockdown on targets that Dehakas have licked into your team. I've been playing with a skilled Illidan player in buff-the-Illidan (Tassadar + Rehgar), along with Dehaka, comps. I get the Gravity Lapse vulnerability at level 4, Backdraft at 13, and Sun King's Fury at 16. I am able to setup kills for my team by bursting down single targets. I can 1v1 many squishies by catching them with an extended D-E, dropping my Q and lighting my W, then Sun King's Fury autoattacking them to death. Bloodlust combos really well here, as well as the slow from Rehgar's totems. Depending on the outcome, Backdraft slow will help me chase or escape more easily too. Pyroblast combos with The Hunt to dish out single-target focus to enemies without a full heal, saving shield, Brightwing, or Void Prison kind of backup plan available. *By the way, the current [overview of Kaelthas on the game's website](URL doesn't reflect any of the live patch changes.*"
170,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Theorycrafting - New KT Chain Bomb,2,4dajjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4dajjc/theorycrafting_new_kt_chain_bomb/,2016-04-04 20:48:02,"So I was thinking about new KT and new Chain Bomb and wanted to see if I can make it work. I'm not going to claim it's particularly good, but I'm hoping someone more skilled than me can comment or even give it a try. * Mana Addict or Fel Infusion. * Energy Roil * Gravity Crush * Pyroblast or Phoenix * Backdraft or Fission Bomb * Twin Spheres * Master of Flames The basic idea is to spread the bomb as much as possible by casting it on different targets. With Twin Spheres, it can be cast on 3 different targets very quickly with D-W-D-W-W. While bombs won't chain between minions, they can chain from minions to heroes. Gravity Crush and Energy Roil are the only level 4 and 7 talents that enhance Chain Bomb. With these talents, you can apply 4 second vulnerability and 1.5 second stun on a 6 second cooldown. Backdraft or Fission Bomb can both create more lethal Chain Bombs. Backdraft's slow keeps enemies from splitting and pairs well with Phoenix. Fission Bomb is a straightforward radius increase. Mana Addict and Fel Infusion are both strong, so it depends on map, enemies and preference. Fel Infusion offers 5% more damage, but Arcane Barrier makes it safer to be at short range."
171,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Sylvanas, Escape Artist and Masterbaitress",10,4ddrbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4ddrbr/sylvanas_escape_artist_and_masterbaitress/,2016-04-05 09:30:37,"Hi reddit, Just want to share some of my best moments with Sylvanas, our Dark Lady. Since the scaling changes and Haunted Mines being taken out of rotation, she has not seen much play. But with the last patch her damage numbers went back up. Combining her incredible utility and a brand new Heroic, she is slowly haunting her wave back into the meta. If you watched the HGC Spring Championship, you would know that both MVP Black and EDG highly valued Sylvanas in their draft, and they were still playing in the last patch. Sylvanas' trait heavily potentializes map objectives such as the Immortals, the Punishers, and the Bosses. The vulnerability from Cold Embrace gives a lot of kill potential to your team. She is also the only hero in game with auto-cleanse now, excluding Lunara's storm-tier talent Abolish Magic. Will of the forsaken allows her to play agressively and still come out on the better end of the trade. In my last game I was able to bait out Sundering twice and lure the enemy Thrall out of postion for a counter kill. IIRC in all of my recent games playing with or against Sylvanas, the player took Mind Control. While as this is a flashy new Heoric, it is just not on par with Wailing Arrow. 2.5 seconds is not nearly enough time to displace an enemy backline into the focus of your team. Often times it makes you the prime target for the enemy, and your tank and healer end up needing to protect you instead of securing the kill. On the contrary, aside from being an excellent engage/counter-engage tool, a well timed Wailing Arrow can deny multiple game-ending Heorics like Divine Shield, Divine Palm, Ancestral Healing, and Mosh Pit. But if you can persevere with Mind Control until level 20, hilarity ensues. So, ask the Dark Lady to aid you in the Nexus, stand with her, or fall before her! 1. Thrall, you can't touch this. URL 2. Thrall, I told you already you can't touch this. Also, Uther, stop playing with bubbles! You have a freaking beard! URL 3. No, Muradin, you can't touch this either. URL 4.

172,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Nova feels pretty strong to me right now?,0,4dh85q,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4dh85q/nova_feels_pretty_strong_to_me_right_now/,2016-04-06 02:33:57,"I've never been a Nova player. I messed around with her a bit for that couple of weeks when she was strong due to gathering power, but otherwise she's never really interested me. Yesterday, I decided to try her again and played her for 9 games in QM. We won every single game, and she felt very strong to me. Granted, I'm only at 2600 MMR, and she'll always be a hero that does better at lower MMR. I went the Pinning Shot build. While she definitely couldn't one shot a squishy like she used to, her burst felt surprisingly good. Even early game, a pinning shot, snipe, and AA would take a Falstad in a lane from full health to quarter health and he'd have to b. In team fights, I didn't feel useless. The extra range on pinning shot let me stay in the backline, and the vulnerability on pinning shot allowed my team to delete even tanks pretty quickly. Also, I could 1v1 most assassins late game if I had two stacks of pinning shot up. Moreover, because we don't have to take Anti-Armor Shells anymore, she was actually not horrible clearing lanes when I had to soak. Obviously, most other heroes are better at clearing lanes than her, but at least I could clear them myself relatively quickly, as opposed to before, where she couldn't do anything. I see a lot of Nova fans complaining about her since the rework, but I'm not sure I get why? She feels more useful to me than she did before, even those few weeks she was considered good with GP. Yeah, she still has no escape whatsoever, but her pinning shot build allows her to play safe. Still not sure I'd pick her in HL over other assassins, but I definitely am not as upset if we end up with a Nova on our team as I used to be. tldr: Nova seems decent to me now."
173,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,I think I can fix Tychus,0,4dm7lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4dm7lg/i_think_i_can_fix_tychus/,2016-04-07 01:24:09,"I've done quite well with Tychus before the rework, but post patch he has been the oddest hero for me. I don't know if I consistently rolled crap teams or I he is that potent, but I've lost like 7/7 games with him and 5/7 of those times I was the top dps and the top siege. 7/7 times I was top dps. dafuq bruh? the two biggest issues are, with cooldown reduction on run n gun, his mana drains waaaay too fast, especially if you get bob n weave, because of low cooldowns combined with minigun he has the worst synergy between spells, talents, and ulti out of all the heroes, especially after rework. in fact, his ulties are so underwhelming i don't even want to use thor most of the time. it's broken, fix it. it's insured, isn't it. ok so, the recent li ming nerfs were justified because blizzard wanted to balance her high dps with mana management. which is fair, and i guess tychus can fit into this role, as well, given my consistently top dps, but unlike li ming he has zero mana recovery options, and actually empties much faster than li ming. i find myself needing to hearth way more often than li ming, and that's not cool. solution 1: minigun should be free. activation and cooldown alone are enough. now to thor. what exactly is this thing actually good for is beyond me. the missiles are rubbish, the flame lance is cool, but the immobility and vulnerability are waaaaay to restrictive. with the 3% dmg minigun talent, you can bring down the tankiest heroes to 40% before thor's second shot. the range bonus is thus irrelevant. thor is not fun to control, hard to target individual heroes, and just not fun. solution 2: buff spells (preferably rework missiles with either faster landing time, nuke follow up, dps after impact, grenade style displacement, or a mini stun) or make a lot more talents scale with it, like 3% per hit per arm, cooldown reduction on thrusters from auto attacks etc. i think that will do it"
174,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Giving Kerrigan the Illidan Treatment: Talent Rework Suggestion,22,4e8lmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4e8lmx/giving_kerrigan_the_illidan_treatment_talent/,2016-04-11 11:25:10,"Hello, I spent some time thinking about this and figuring it out for fun, so I thought I'd make a reddit post about it. How I came up with the tiers was based off of the Illidan rework and the idea of having talents that allow you to adapt to the situation. Rather than picking talents to make up for and fill holes in your heroes kit you can pick the talents that best fit the enemy teams comp or the map that you're playing on. As such, I think Kerrigan's trait and health need a slight buff like Illidan received. She may also need a slight buff to her base damage in either her spells or aa's since the changes I suggest may decrease her total damage output overall. Keep in mind this is just the general framework, the numbers on these would have to be calculated and tested. So without an further ado.... Kerrigan Rework -Base Health and Regen Increased -Shield amount generated changed from 10% to 20% (15% if that's too much) -Shield duration increased from 6 seconds to 10 Lvl1-Mana tier that allows you to adapt to how you get mana based on whether the map revolves around waveclear, roaming, or team fights. -Talent 1: Regain 5 mana per nearby minion that gets defeated -Talent 2: Regain 4 increased mana per second after not taking damage for 3 seconds -talent 3: Hitting an Enemy Hero with an ability reduces the mana cost of your next 2 abilities by X% can only trigger once every 10 seconds, or just attach it to ravage. Lvl 4-Utility Tier list like Illidan has at 4. Which ability do you want to become more useful. -Talent 1: Increase Ravage's Range by 20% and let's you jump to allies -Talent 2: Blade Torrent: Increase Implaing blades radius by 30% and reduces its cd by 2 seconds if it hits -Talent 3: Increase Primal Grasps Width significantly and reduce the cd per target hit by .5 Lvl 7- Burst Damage tier. Decide between increasing your single target burst damage with abilities, aa's, or just increase your aoe burst damage overall. -Clean Kill: (Moved) Bonus Damage increased to 40%. No longer refunds mana. (Maybe ravage could restore half of it's mana cost if it secures a kill baseline.) -Sharpened Blades: (Moved) Increase Impaling blades damage by 50% -Double Strike: (Moved) Bonus damage decreased to 50% Lvl 13- Defense Tier: Adapting to a team with a lot of ability damage, aa damage, or cc. -Talent 1: Reduce spell damage by 25% while assimilation shield is active. -Talent 2: Reduce aa damage by 25% while assimilation shield is active (Give block charges on ravage, or some other form of aa mitigation) -Talent 3: Reduce CC by 50% while assimilation shields are active (Or some form of CC mitigation) Lvl 16- Utility Damage Tier. Decide between percentage damage for tanks, increased sustained damage for heavy healer teams, or Vulnerability for increasing your team's damage. -Talent 1: Ravage does 8% of a targets maximum health -Talent 2: Infected Wound: Impaling Blades does a significant amount of poison damage over time if it lands. -Talent 3: Primal Grasp Causes all targets to become Vulnerable, taking 25% increased damage, for 2 seconds ala Jaina's level 16 talent. Lvl 20- Kerrigan isn't really about aa'ing so Nexus Blades doesn't make sense for her. Instead I would recommend a talent that increases her ability power since her niche role is doing a burst of ability damage. Also Bolt of the Storm is slowly being phased out, so may as well give Kerrigan a replacement as well. -Nexus Blades replacement: Killer Combo: After using an ability, any following abilities used within 3 seconds gain 10-15% ability power. -Bolt of the Storm Replacement: Queens Rush (Moved): Decrease the cooldown to 20-30 seconds and increase the movement speed bonus to 50% If you stuck with the post this long, then thanks for reading. Again, keep in mind this is the rough draft and general idea. So, some things about it may need to be tweaked or changed to work logistically and fairly within the game. Edit: Switching Zagara and Kerrigan's Ults is an interesting idea. Kerrigan gets Devouring maw since she's more about CC, and Zagara gets Ultralisk since she's a summoner. This might be a good way to balance Zagara too since she feels too hard to kill with devouring maw in her kit. It's a ""get out of jail free"" card that covers up a core weakness like Bolt of the Storm and Arcane Barrier did for Jaina and Kael Thas. Maw would likely be less frustrating on Kerrigan as you don't have to dive to attack her like you do Zag. Also taking away devouring maw's damage would make a lot of sense. There would be almost no reason to take Maelstorm if Devouring Maw also provided Kerrigan CC and AOE damage. If devouring maw had it's damage removed it could also go back to being a 100 cd, as it can be a pretty difficult skillshot to land."

176,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Rough Concept of Kerrigan Rework,1,4eyj5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4eyj5o/rough_concept_of_kerrigan_rework/,2016-04-16 06:01:55,"Right now, Kerrigan is in a weird spot. She's been underpowered for a long time now, and some people argue it's a numbers problem. I think her concept is flawed. Her kit is awkward. It requires a tricky combo to land, and the cooldown is absurd, not to mention the damage is pretty lackluster. She has a spell that lets her dive in, but unless she has pre-loaded her shields, she's almost always blown up. To finish it off, she basically needs to spec multiple talents to make her trait decent. Overall, she's both bad and awkward, in my opinion. According to her lore, she has great psionic powers. I'd like to turn her into a mage. We have a frost, fire, and arcane mage, why not have a psionic mage? To start, change her to ranged. Have her shoot blades, or a psionic mass as a model. Trait: Psionic Presence: Creates an aura around Kerrigan. When no heroes are around Kerrigan in an aoe radius, her damage is increased by 25%. However, when a hero comes into the radius, she gains 15% increased vulnerability. Damage bonus is removed. Range will be well below her attack range, as this will conflict with her second spell. First spell: Psionic Blast: Straight line skill shot, fast speed, small area, high damage, low cooldown (maybe around 5). Blasts the first target hit with damage, and pushing the target back a small range. If an enemy is hit by the knockbacked hero, each are slowed by 25% for 1 second. Deals half damage to second enemy hit. Second spell: Empowering Strikes: Kerrigan's next 3 basic attacks deal extra damage. Starts at 100% bonus. If attacks hit the same target, the bonus increases by 50% each time. So if you have 100 damage, the first hit deals 200 damage, then 250, then 300. Slows 10%, and subsequent attacks increase by 10%, so 10%, then 20%, then 30%. Lasts 5 seconds, debuff lasts 2 seconds and is refreshed by another hit. 8 second cooldown. Also makes her attacks splash, however the bonus damage for the splash is only half what the main attack would be. Third spell: Vortex: Creates an area of psionic energy. Aoe is a little larger than the size of KT's flamestrike. Lasts 5 seconds. Any enemy hit by a Kerrigan spell will take double damage and double effect. So Psionic blast with deal double damage and slow for 50% for 2 seconds, for example. Area reduces as time goes on. At the end, will be half size of original. 12-15 second CD. Heroic One: Psionic Rage: Increases her trait to 100% bonus damage, but vulnerability increases to 40%. Lasts 8 seconds, CD of 50 seconds. Numbers could be tweaked, but overall idea is trading more damage for more vulnerability. Heroic Two: Psionic Overload: Point click ability. Inflicts the target with massive pain, dealing X amount of damage per second for 5 seconds. Each enemy hero in a radius around the target will increase the damage by 25%. In addition, enemies in the radius are slowed by 20%. Also, damage starts low, and builds up with more time. So say it does 2000 damage total to the target (just a random number). First tick will do 100, second tick 175, third 325, fourth 550, fifth 850. If no enemy heroes are in the radius, damage is halved. So there is a rough idea of a rework I had for Kerrigan. Of course, the numbers aren't perfect, but I'm more focused on the concept part. I think she'd serve better as a mage, that when left alone, can deal very high single target damage, as opposed to Jaina and Kael, who both deal good aoe damage, and decent single target damage. This new Kerrigan would not be the best 1v1, as she has no escape, but would excel as a back-line mage. However, she is very squishy, and vulnerable to melee damage and heroes that can get close to her. Her only cc is slows, plus a knockback. I feel like this coincides with her psionic abilities. TL;DR Change Kerrigan to a mage, focused around her psionic powers. Give her some slows for ccs, and make it as if she is ignored, can deal high damage, but if she is focused, especially by melee, she is very squishy. All her spells should be medium range, as too high of range would make her trait OP, and too low of range would make her too squishy."
177,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Fat Demon Can't Dunk - The winion guide to Azmodan,23,4f7jjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4f7jjr/fat_demon_cant_dunk_the_winion_guide_to_azmodan/,2016-04-18 03:32:16,"I love Azmodan, and with his azmodunk skin out, we need a guide for the people who might not be so athletically gifted in the dunk department. About me: I have an Azmo only smurf named EZmodan who fluctuates between r1-r5. You can find me in the reddit channel scolding people who say Azmo sucks (Damn you, Cupil!) This is not a dunk guide. I love taste for blood, but without your team actively helping you farm it, it can be unreliable. I run a winion build focused on his D talents, with Sieging wrath level 1. Some consider this blasphemy, but there are reasons for it: 1- Your dunks are free and you are free to ignore minions. You can use them to pelt walls, to stall altars or minions, and be way more aggressive with them. You can participate in the game without blindly farming last hits! 2- It hits hard from level 1. Ill often have top damage until around lv 10. But black pool makes my dunks stack so much easier! To that I say try this out. Dump black pool and dump stacking for a few games and then come comment on how it went. Have you ever been on a team with a stacking Azmo that plays poorly? This is why people think azmo is trash. They push blindly because they have to for stacks, and when the teamfight comes around they are either already dead from overextending or needing to hearth for mana. My build conserves mana instead, and allows me to stay out in the field way longer. **The Build-** 1-**Sieging Wrath**  Its great, I love it. Getting used to timing max range dunks and landing them with accuracy is what makes this better than taste for blood for me. If you like Taste for Blood, try this. I personally think MOD is a trap talent. Laser is good already, and it really isnt your primary source of damage. If you take MOD you are stuck immobile using a laser until 13, and even with all the laser talents, its not worth. You will see laser azmos dying repeatedly and saying I got the fort though. 4-**Army of Hell**  This talent is great. Your demons are saints. They arent for damage, they are for spam. You have zone tools. Is your team turning in on blackhearts bay and the other team is coming? Lay 2 demons, one going each direction, to dismount them and buy your teammate that half second. Their damage is negligible but their presence is not. Use them to soak up bullets and to make minion waves last longer. Use them for vision in bushes or down corridors. The lower mana cost means you can spam them without feeling so guilty. 7- **Bound Minion**- The bread and butter of this build IMO. Bound minion will make 1 minion strong enough to tank about a full wave. It also heals that minions up. Your D needs to be used every cooldown. Use one the second the first mid wave spawns in the beginning to get as many possible seconds of uptime as you can. If you are playing with a Zagara doing the ol zagmodan, use them on her lane to buff her minions. It doesnt work for Xul. I spend every game very aware of the minion on minion action, and the best value you can get is by buffing a frontline minion right as he is about to die. Dont just use D in your lane, use it in the lane where it will get the most value. At 20 with forced recruitment and this talent, you can heal a catapult to full and turn it into a savage killing machine. 10- **Demonic Invasion** - This is controversial and known as a bad ult. I get value out of it. On a map like Towers Of Doom where lots of people dont like Azmo, you can steal a keep everytime altars pop. You use this ult to force the other team into a split second decision, then you capitalize. Use it on undefended forts, use it on forts in different lanes, just dont use it near somebody who can murder them right away. Use them on a bruiser camp to cap it quicker and give them some more beef. Use them to dismount people coming to hit your buddy turning in. They have no timer, and will push until they die. They get lots of value out of being in a lane with giants. The key is timing them where you get the most uptime and passive push out of them. Use your D on them (or pref a low minion near them for the bound minion buff) for extra oomph. 13- **March of Sin**- You have to take this. It changes your whole kit. The laser is mostly useless until this level. This is how you trade with melee that are overextending, or short ranged attackers. Bait them back with your huge health pool, then lock on and follow. By the time they escape, you should be able to finish them off with a dunk. A lot of times running is the wrong decision and a laser will zone them out and give you a second to mount up and bounce. Experiment with it to see whose scared of it, and exploit that vulnerability. Use it on soft targets that cant ignore it like Jaina in a teamfight. You will be tempted to use it on the tank, this is trap. I fall for this trap. The tank is trying to bait your laser, and even if you get some damage off, you have to wait for it to be ready again and become useless for a bit. You dont want to sit there burning down Jo or Mura while your team gets rekt. This takes some practice to learn proper positioning. 16- **Imposing Presence/ Demonic Smite / Blood for Blood**  This level you pick what is most relevant. ChoGall? B4B. I mostly pick Imposing because everybody auto-attacks, but demonic smite can be huge for this build. 20- **Forced Recruitment**- I know, he has bolt! You just shouldnt need it. If you play right, there will be so much pressure on them at this point with 2 Ds on catapults. Yes, Ive died without bolt in cases where I didnt need to, but I still think the threat of 2 catapults hitting their core for 5% each hit can be worth the sacrifice. YMMV. And remember, your auto-attack damage might be low, but it doesnt mean ignore AA. A lot of heroes are way easier to zone with AA than youd expect. I will answer any questions you have, but I don't feel like getting into it about why stacking or black pool is better. Every Azmodan I've ever met is very defensive of his build (especially those laser jerks) so I don't try to change their mind, but I find a lot have never used bound minion or forced recruit or demonic invasion and can't see the value. To each his own. "

This is also becoming more common across the online competitive games. Based on this happening, I decided to try and help with the following information. However, there seems to be a big gap in those who say ddos versus what a ddos actually is. DDOS has become something people say on a whim when they don't know what it is, how it works, or if it is truely the problem. This post is to hopefully help some understand what a DDOS is, how to validate a DDOS, and some tips to prevent and protect yourself. Before I begin, just some background. I've been in the network/security industry for 18 years now doing support and design. The past 7 years specifically on network switch/router design. I'm sure others here are in the same fields or have equal/more experience, and I encourage them to add in. The goal here is to help people. A few general notes I wanted to add before we begin... Your network will have multiple IP Addresses, Internal and External. External is your actual internet address. This is how people connect to you. Your Internal addresses are your private network. Anything on your network (PC, phones, xbox, apple tv, etc...) will have an Internal IP. All of your internet traffic, regardless of what device it starts from, goes through your External IP. I hear people say things like, VPN prevents DDOS. Even when you VPN, you are still going through your External IP. If your External IP is being DDOS'd, VPN won't do anything for you. VPN will however, help protect you by keeping your External IP hidden (hopefully). **A. What is DOS/DDOS? Difference?** Denial of Service is a type of attack that someone uses to in a sense, shut down access to a pc/service/network. In its basic form, a DOS is a one on one attack. It is done by sending large amounts of traffic towards the intended target, so much that the target gets overloaded and begins denying access or unable to respond. A DDOS (Distributed DOS) is the same, but instead of 1 on 1, many on 1. Usually through botnets or clients distributed across the internet to mass flood. They use ICMP/TCP/UDP to accomplish this. ICMP could simply be a insane amount of never ending ping attacks, UDP could be spoofed packets, and TCP is often SYN floods. This is where the hacker opens up TCP sessions but never completes the handshake, but the receiving client continues to wait and suddenly has never ending open sessions. Other attacks are based on application vulnerabilities. **B. How to validate a DOS/DDOS?** Just because your internet died or game crashed, doesn't mean you were DOS/DDOS'd. In fact, you probably weren't. Assuming you were and writing it off doesn't solve other problems that could be occurring. There are a lot of things you should be doing to try and validate what the true cause of your issue is. For example: 1) When your game crashes, do other internet applications work? Voice, web surfing, video streaming? If so, not DDOS. 2) Do other devices on your network have the same issue, or is it only your computer? If it is only yours, doubtful it is a DDOS. 3) Check logs of routers/firewalls/pc's. If you have a decent router/firewall with any logging, you will see an abundance of incoming sessions at the time of the issue. Windows may also catch this. 4) Check PC resources. When this happens, does the system usage spike? Does processor/memory/network all see consistent with normal behavior? 5) Contact your ISP. Your ISP is not going to want giant floods of incoming sessions and traffic on their network. Work with them to see what happened during this time. Often these things happen at night or on weekends when they may only have jr staff on. Call then, and maybe follow up during the week and hopefully you get a more Senior Engineer that can help. They should be able to identify any traffic issues. 6) Use Ping/Traceroute tests to various sites and game servers. Try and isolate where the issue is. If you use a traceroute and the ping doesn't jump until the 3rd hop, then it's not a DDOS (at least directly on you). **C. How to prevent and protect yourself?** 1) Be smart on your internet usage. Going to unsafe sites and using unsafe applications put you at risk. 2) Have Anti-Virus (if you need a free one, try avast) and Anti-Malware (malwarebytes). Keep these updated and run them often. 3) Ensure ALL computers on your network (mom, dad, sister, brother, sig. other, roommate, etc...) ALSO have Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware. Any piece on the network could be infected and sending out your External IP. Even if you reset your IP and router and get a new one, if you have a infected PC, it will just update the attackers anyway. 4) NEVER NEVER NEVER have your PC directly connected to the internet without a router or firewall in front. Your PC can do this, but it doesn't typically have the resources or security to protect you from basically anything. 5) Know the applications you use and how they work. This is on you. Anything you install on your PC is your own risk. Things like skype, which traditionally have given out your External IP. Things like IRC, FTP, even many websites will show your External IP. 6) Spend some money and get a really firewall. This is the only true way to protect yourself IMO. A good firewall will have some anti-ddos built in. It will allow you to block incoming ping requests, auto detect TCP SYN floods or UDP floods and drop/ignore traffic from those sources. These devices will have in depth logging to determine where the traffic is coming from as well. Helpful to work with ISP or if there is a legal issue at some point, you have some evidence. Things that a basic home router will NOT do. These devices can cost a coulpe hundred of dollars, but if you are a competitive gamer -- This is your life and your work. Consider this a business expense... Ex: Sophos UTM, Sonicwall, Watchguard, Fortinet.... All of these make a lower end solution for a Small Office/Home Office with an IPS/IDS piece. Note - even with the best protection you can still be targeted. With enough botnets and finding the right application vulnerability, it can happen. ie: lizard squad vs blizzard, psn, xbox, etc... Most attacks though, would be very small in size. A couple of botnets causing a flood for a home users on a linksys router wouldn't take that much. Any good firewall would shut that down. Again, this is a very small guide with some basic information on what a DDOS is, how to validate your issues, and some initial preventitive steps. Hopefully this helps at least spread some knowledge about the subject. I'm sure a lot of you will have additional info to add, so please do so. The more information, suggestions, and ideas will only help others.

180,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Malfurion alternative heroic suggestion,1,4854e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4854e5/malfurion_alternative_heroic_suggestion/,2016-02-29 07:01:16,"Hi everyone, I was just looking at the thread about alternative level 20 talents on the front page, and had an idea for Malfurion. However it is a far better heroic, and since (though I know we all love it) Twilight Dream is a bit lackluster on a hero like Malfurion, I wanted to suggest this alternative: **Swiftmend** (20 second cooldown) *Requires regrowth to be present on the target hero.* Malfurion instantly heals the target hero for the full amount of Regrowth plus an additional [*number, TBD*]. Doing so also unleashes a carpet of druidic energy that heals all allied heroes standing in it for [roughly 25%-50%] of Regrowth's healing over three seconds. Obviously these numbers are in no way final, but I think it would make Malf's playstyle a lot more dynamic; you'd have an activatable burst heal at the cost of tranquility; you'd still get some area healing every 20 seconds, but much weaker than usual. I think it could be really cool as it would take away Malf's vulnerability to some bigger CC ultimates such as Maw or Anub's web, while also making him more potent against burst damage. What do you think? I don't expect anyone to love this, but if you don't like the suggestion, I'd love to hear what you'd change to make it acceptable, or if you really hate it, why! Thanks, Keden"

I based her trait, Q and R1 abilitys on her story, as there are no known abilitys she uses. She plays a bit like Azir from LoL. [Here is the link to Heroesfire.](URL You will want to ""poke"" with your Q, position yourself correctly to geht full damage from both E's and burst a target down with a Q+E+W combo. Ult2 provides a mix from Slyvanas and Falstads Ults, that can be very deceiving, as it depends on the placement of your Q. One way to do it, would be: Place your Q in a bush, cast the Ult and redirect your q towards the enemie, so they wont see it coming. Additionaly: As she has no stun, slow or teleport, like the other Mage-type heroes, i realy liked the idea of her trait. She still (even with the shield) has a small health pool, but can't be as easily controlled either. Overall i think this would be a very interesting playstyle. I hope you liked it and as always would like to discuss talent posibilitys, ideas and everything else with you guys :) ***Below all abilites in Plain Text:*** D: Queen Azshara can't be blocked by a body and gains a shield equal to 1% of her maximum health every second until it reaches 10%. ----- Q: Summon a Keeper of Eternity inside of a large area around you. The Keeper cannot move, but will attack enemies in its (melee) range every second. Every attack deals 174 (+4% per lvl) damage. Every second, you can activate this ability again to move the Keeper. The Keeper cannot be killed, but deals 50% less damage against structures and mercanaries. It will always prioritze heroes. If you leave the area of influence, the keeper will be destroyed. Cooldown: 9 seconds | Cost: 58 mana ----- W: Let your Keeper explode. After a short delay deal 380 (+ 4% per level) damage to enemies in the area. Cooldown: 13 seconds | Cost: 62 mana ----- E: Fire a magical burst resembling a curved triangle in front of you, dealing 295 (+4% per lvl) damage. Targets at the point of the triangle will recieve 10% additional damage. If a Keeper of Eternity is active, he will also cast this ability, pointing it in your direciton. Cooldown: 6 seconds | Cost: 55 mana ----- Ult1: Transform into the Naga Queen for 15 seconds increasing your basic attack range by 1 and your basic attack damage by 10%. Your basic attacks will stack 4% vulnerability with every attack, up to 20%. Cooldown: 100 seconds | Cost: 90 mana ----- Ult2: Summon a portal that will release a beam of pure energy after 1 second. It will always shoot in the direction of your Keeper of Eternity, dealing 520 (+5% per lvl) damage to enemies in its path, silencing them for 1 second and destroying the Keeper. Cooldown: 80 seconds | cost: 95 mana"

They have 60% winrate when combined in hotslogs, and for a good reason. They synergize extremely well. Bone Prison + Vulnerability+5 Magic Missiles with Charged Blast is 100% broken and 100% hilarious. Only counterplay is to have Azmodan or Zagara summons to block the missiles, otherwise you're dead. Skeletal Mages + Orbs to the face and Poison Nova + Disintegrate slows are also fun. Also saw Xul+Azmodan, which was also crazy amounts of Push and roots+lazer kills people trying to stop that push.

I take a lot of notes for myself on HotS to better understand things so if you guys find this useful let me know. This is to go over his talents more in depth so that players will understand why he has one of the strongest kits ever released based on his current stats. It's one thing to think ""This hero is really good (or bad)"" but it's another thing to understand why. I won't discuss what his skills DO because anybody can just read the skill descriptions. I also won't post any ""builds."" The goal is for people to understand why certain talents are picked so you can pick the best ones in any situation. You don't get actually get better by simply copying whatever the most popular builds are in the game because you're always going to be behind the curve (unless there's no patches for like 2 months). It also lets you adapt more quickly because you know how talents at each tier compare with one another so if one of them gets nerfed you might take a different one and change your playstyle to adapt. ## Xuls Role and the Importance of Waveclear Xul has immense utility in his kit in the form of massive AoE damage, a ranged poke, a targeted root, attack speed slows, and a passive that shoves the lane better than essentially any other hero. Xul's waveclear is immense with a low cost Q ability and his passive already. With W he can clear waves of basically any size, leading to one of the strongest wave management heroes in the game. Remember Leorics wave control on release? That is nothing compared to Xuls kit and this alone nearly puts him in Tier 1. It's no surprise that Xul trash talks Leoric after he kills him. When Brightwing's Q damage was buffed, she went up 3% when there weren't really any other changes in that patch. That is the impact of waveclear in HotS and right now Xul is an absolute wave control monster. Things he does well overall: * Laning - Exceptional waveclear and skeletons cost no mana, meaning he can easily outsustain most heroes in the game, including Zagara in lane. If he takes Rathmas Blessing, you can forget about laning against him because he heals 20%+ of his max hp off of every wave as you'll see in the talent analysis. * Roaming - he has a targeted CC and plenty of damage to back it up so he can pull off ganks AND push the lane. You know how even if Nova kills you she doesn't really shove the lane in? This is why you can sometimes feed against heroes with low waveclear like Nova and still win the game, because you need to convert your kills into objectives. Xul can kill you and then destroy all your buildings so if you're feeding this guy it's much, much harder to make a comeback. * Teamfighting - he has tremendous AoE damage, utility, and two devastating teamfight ultimates. Considering those are more or less the most important three things in the game, he covers essentially every role you would want a DPS to cover. Roles are extremely important in this game: * If you compare him to Azmodan who doesn't really add anything to a teamfight you'll see that Xul is overall better than Azmodan. This is because Azmodan doesn't really bring anything to the table that Xul doesn't bring. Azmodan does bring poke but he doesn't poke enough to make up for being weaker in other roles. * If you compare him to another rival who is strong in lane and has a devastating teamfight ultimate: Zagara, you'll see that Xul can also roam, which Zagara can't really do. However, you can't say that Xul is better than Zagara overall because she also provides utility in the form of vision. * If you compare him to Arthas, who is strong at roaming and decent at teamfighting, you'll see that he Arthas is a much worse laner. He has to spend tons of mana clearing waves. I am actually the least happy with this hero release compared to any previous one because Xuls skill floor is pretty low IMO. His base kit is strong AND his numbers are really strong as well. This results in him pushing out a lot of other heroes completely because he fulfills so many roles. * His passive means that half the heroes in the game simply cant handle him in lane and it has no counterplay. I say his passive has no counterplay because minions will die and he will get skeletons. If you dont kill them they soak your tower ammo and if you DO kill them you waste mana so you're almost always at the losing end of the deal because youre forced to react to something hes just passively doing. * He also has gigantic W autoattack speed slow built into his kit. Normally youre at least forced to pick a talent for attack speed slow like Muradin or Imposing Presence. * Most people are saying that you can play around Bone Prison, which is only partially true. But if you're a melee hero and the only way to play against Xul is to actually not fight him, you know there are problems. Anyway, let's go into the talents now: ## Level 1 **Backlash** - The aggressive talent. 15% of max hp is actually a HUGE amount so this is a very, very good talent. The only reason that this isnt the go to talent is because of Shade. **Shackler** - Gives you some extra CC when you get up close and personal. This basically lets you roam and gank a little bit better early game because its acting like Rehgars Totem. Youre able to slow them down so hopefully the are in a worse position when your Bone Prison root triggers. Overall its not as good as the other two talents because you simply dont need the slow that much. **Shade** - Makes you invincible against autoattacks for 3s or as long as Bone Shield is active. This is exactly like Evasion on Illidan which basically makes him unkillable during that period of time. Obviously not that useful if youre playing against tons of mages but this skill is obscene against autoattackers. This is part of the reason why Xul more or less destroys all melee heroes in the game. ## Level 4 **Death's Reach** - Straightforward talent and youre probably going to take this if they have more ranged heroes and you wont be able to get as much value from Bone Prison. More range is always good. **Jailors** - Adds some extra damage to your E and synergizes with the other Skeleton Mastery talents. This can do a disgusting amount of targeted DPS once you hit 16. **Trag'Oul's Essence** - Xuls W and E have 10s+ cooldowns and his Q only costs 45 mana and has and 8s cooldown (so its actually cheaper in cost than Li-Mings Magic Missiles because 45/8 = 5.6 mana per second and 20/3 = 6.7 mana per second). Because of the mana efficiency of Q you can save W for the most part so you don't really need to engage the lane in melee. This means he doesnt really have mana problems if you tap and recall so you would never get this talent unless you literally are never planning to well or recall (which can have its benefits honestly). ## Level 7 **Harvest Vitality** - This is a ridiculous talent if youre able to actually hit 2-3+ people with your W active, which shouldnt be uncommon in teamfights given how insane the arc on W is. 3.6% of your max HP per hero per strike means you could potentially heal 40% of your max hp over 4s if youre hitting 3 heroes. Another reason why you don't want to run melee heroes into Xul. However, Rath **Weaken** - This is an example of diminishing returns. Reducing enemy DPS by 50% is already so high that they should be retreating. If they choose to autoattack you while doing 50% they are going to lose and if they choose to autoattack you while doing 75% less damage they are just going to lose harder. You basically never *need* this talent due to diminishing returns. **Rathma's Blessing** - This heals you the same amount as Harvest Vitality for every single minion that dies. Given the amount of minions that die in a game, youre almost certainly going to get better value from this talent than the other 2 in any game. It heals you for 3.4% of your max HP every time a creep dies so clearing a single wave heals you 25% of your max HP. Theres also no cooldown so if theres more than a single wave you heal even more. You know all the times youre low after a fight and theres a big wave pushing? Now youre not low anymore. ## Level 10 **Poison Nova** - Actually does exactly what Blizzard says in that it works very well against melee heroes. Often you can hit ranged heroes as well but mostly you won't be able to if they are positioned correctly (and as people learn how to play around it). It hits literally everything including buildings but the cooldown is 90s so you arent going to randomly use it on towers for no reason. Does a huge amount of damage if you can hit 3+ heroes with it but if you cant, then Skeletal Mages will probably be better because of the utility. But sometimes straight up more damage is exactly what you want and Poison Nova has it covered because if you hit 3+ you are almost certainly going to win the teamfight. **Skeletal Mages** - You summon 4 ranged mages that do ~100 DPS each and slow for 30%. The damage upside is really low compared to Nova so it's more of like safe ult instead of a huge teamfight winner. However, if you cast it on terrain it actually doesn't spawn some of the mages which gives this a huge potential downside making it a lot less reliable than Poison Nova. ## Level 13 **Decrepify** - This adds utility to your Q. The 40% slow for 3s is solid and helps you transition smoothly into teamfighting. If the map is more about teamfighting than laning then this is a go to talent because you wont be getting that many Skeletons and a 40% slow can help your team much more. **Giants Curse** - This is almost certainly a win more talent. If you only hit one target with this its worse than Giant Killer because you only do 0.5% more for 4s which is literally just a single autoattack. Obviously you get value if youre hitting multiple heroes like Harvest Vitality. But if youre able to just waltz into the enemy team and use Harvest Vitality + Giants Curse and they cant stop you with stuns or blind, then you were probably going to win that game in the first place based on your kit. **Corpse Explosion** - This is probably the best all around talent at this tier on most maps. Increases your pushing power tremendously as every single skeleton you summon will now do AoE damage when they die, probably resulting in more skeletons being summoned. Similar to Unstable Poison, except that you dont even need to do anything. ## Level 16 **Executioner** - Xul actually has a decent amount of slow coming from his kit including his ult so this is an entirely viable talent. Your DPS could be absolutely insane if you split the enemy frontline / backline with Skeletal Mages and then focus a slowed target. **Flowing Wounds** - Potentially 50% cooldown reduction on your Q is decent because Q damage is pretty high, but unlikely to be as strong as the other talents unless youre just focusing on utility with Decrepify and Mortal Wound at 20. **Amplify Damage** - Adds vulnerability onto the target while they are guaranteed to be rooted. Remember how Jaina can pick either vulnerability OR a 1s root at 16? Well, Xul gets both. **Skeleton Mastery** - If you think about what this actually does: increases your overall Skeleton damage by 200%. You get 50% more skeletons and you get 100% more damage on Skeletons. If youre getting this you also certainly took Jailors so you can theoretically have 300% more damage compared to just your base kit. Each Skeleton does 32 + 4% so with this talent they are doing ~130 per attack so if youre ever, ever left alone you will be able to absolutely annihilate buildings. Jailors will guarantee that you have 2 skeletons beating on the Bone Prison target for ~260 DPS (although it's not clear to me what their attack speed is, but I'm just assuming it's per second). ## Level 20 **Call of the Grave** - 1% of max hp for 10s on a hero: tanks will take an extra 50-60 DPS and squishies will take an extra 30-40 DPS. So essentially youre doing an extra 30-50% damage with Poison Nova and thats a lot. **Raised Mage** - The spawn on death component could be useful on any point control map like Towers of Doom where sometimes youre simply forced to fight until people die. 50% slow is good. Obviously a snowball talent and has likely the least true value out of all of the talents at this tier. **Mortal Wound** - This was the most hyped competitive talent when it was announced. A 75% reduction in heal is absolutely disgusting and can potentially remove a hero like Medic from the game. You think Brightwing doesnt heal much? Imagine healing her 75% less as in, your team just wiped. Youre likely able to just focus down a tanky target with your team just by using Q slow + Bone Prison + whatever your team decides to toss out. Blizzard will probably remove this talent or nerf it really badly. **Bone Spear** - This is literally an additional skill so it cant be undervalued. Youre gaining another line AoE nuke with a 10s cooldown that doesnt cost mana so you can use it off cooldown without thinking at all. **EDIT**: Changed my view of Skeletal Mages after using it. If you don't place it perfectly you don't even spawn some of them which makes it have a huge potential downside, meaning that Poison Nova is actually more reliable than SM when it should really be the reverse. This honestly feels like a bug because if you cast an ult and it immediately has 50% less effect that's pretty bad."
185,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"[Discussion] Issues with ""Scaling""",0,499vab,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/499vab/discussion_issues_with_scaling/,2016-03-07 10:57:34,"After Blizzcon, HotS revamped the scaling on all heroes and abilities; from a baseline that increases numerically per level, to now multiplicative. Currently, it's 4.5% increase on all heroes and abilities. And while this change was welcomed for comebacks, not feeling such a massive disparity of power being a level or 2 down (Not talent tier), it's taken me a while to notice some of the issues; specifically in Warriors and Supports, as well as the ""burst meta"" we've been having since the beginning of the year. Let's say for example, an Uther's Divine light heals Artanis for 20% of his max health. Well, at level 1 or level 20, it will still heal for 20% of his max health, regardless of what the numbers say (200 out of a 1000 is pretty much equal to 1000 out of 5000) While Assassins gain a lot of combat potency in their talents, there aren't many ways for a support to increase their throughput in abilities (Yes, Rewind and Hardened Focus decrease CDs, but don't affect the output when they press their abilities.) This also goes for Warriors. Very few Warriors have abilities to increase their health pool, and have some mitigation talents in forms of Spell Shield and Imposing, a Jaina's Frost bolt will still deal the same percentage of damage. While Assassins can pick up more and more damaging talents, as it's their job to dish out the pain. They can increase bonus damage on procs, extra percentage damage with Giant Killer, and a few even pick up Executioner or Vulnerability talents. All while the Warrior gets is ""Hardened Shield"" at 20 to survive burst. _________________________________________________________________________________________ **My Suggestion:** Individualize scaling per class, or even possibly per character. What I mean is, instead of Warriors getting a 4.5% increase per level on all their stats, increase their Health pool and Health Regen by slightly more (Let's say for example... 6.0%) for supports, their abilities and mana regen to 5% as well as assassins getting an AA or Ability increase for 5.5% while lowering increase in fields where they are not specialized in. (Warriors can lower their AA damage scaling to 3%, Assassins with health, and supports with Health regen) I think this adjustment can help diversify hero selection, as well as be able to make more precise adjustments. (Anub's health pool is still too low late game, increase scaling to 6.25%) Again, the example numbers aren't in anyway vetted, but I hope people can get the idea."

I also know that no one likes these posts and I'll probably get trashed for writing it. But hey, my main finally got reworked and it's my turn to be salty. Tread further if you wish. I really really really don't like the *playstyle* changes to Sylvanas. Like everyone else, I am exuberant that she is finally getting a second ult. But I have my reservations about the talent changes that came along with it. And, in fact, I am not too thrilled about what the ult actually is. I think it will be useful and set up some amazing plays, of course. But I also think she's incredibly frail and 3.5 seconds of down time, even with that range, definitely puts it on the list of most counterable/most potentially costly ultimates in the game. Unlike staying in Lili's Jug radius, there isn't an intuitive incentive for anyone to stay and peel for her. Unlike ETC, she lacks the tankiness and instant movement to survive during the duration or in the immediate aftermath. Unlike Nazeebo, she cannot fight during this time. I think it has its uses, but in the long run, it will definitely play second string to Wailing Arrow in soloQ. That's not a problem in and of itself, of course. I have three concerns, personally. One, I really would have liked two ultimates that could both suit a majority of situations to contrast the situation she was in prior. This is a meta thing and not an actual gameplay criticism. Second, both her ultimates provide anti-hero cc. I really would have liked her second ultimate to do something fundamentally different from her first. To have damage against heroes and siege, for example, and to compare that damage/area denial to the utility of a ranged AoE silence (How that damage manifests is another story. I've always favored Bow or Banshees). Instead, both are utilities and neither lends well to her siegey kit. (To reiterate, I don't think it's bad at all. I think it will see lots of use and be useful and competitive teams will make it shine.) I know this ult was actually very popularly requested by the playerbase, so I don't blame anyone for my disdain for it. But I also think it's at odds with her both as part of her kit (as I've partially explained) and even thematically to an extent. If I want someone to stand still and manipulate my foe, it should be a Warlock-type-mage of some sort. Possibly guarded by his minions. Sylvanas' design and powers are quick, subversive, *invisible,* often hard to read the impact of at first. She's a ranger, not a caster. She's a Windrunner. She may be a general and a leader, but she doesn't strike me as the kind to stand in the back and shout orders all the time. Mechanically, all her abilities are short ranged and her gap closer is not only slow, but it's also her escape. (For me, it's always given me a feel of the leader being the last to leave the field of battle. She can throw it back and hold the line slightly longer before retreating when everyone else is safe). Stealthy, quick to react. Her entire kit is so mobile, from her Withering Fire, to her fast autoattacks, her dagger, her banshees that let her move one way and then suddenly shift another. She can reposition constantly. I'm all for diverse branches in hero design, but it seems to kind of stand alone as part of her kit. It's on the list of 'Things she can do and everyone knows she can do,' sure, but it doesn't seem like something that she would naturally use in battle. Looking at its cost and the difference from her general style, it looks like a last resort. EDIT: I want to reemphasize here, that lorewise, I totally understand that it fits in her character. But HotS only imports a portion of a character into the game. Sort of like how Diablo fans complain that Heroes don't always allow for the same build they did used for that class. Heroes like Sylvanas could have been many different heroes. She could have been a necromancer general with an army. But the way they put her into the game, she is a ranger who recreated her old powers and identity in the lens of and using the powers she has now. I know she's really known for it and I know it fits her lorewise, but it doesn't fit the Dark Ranger theme and playstyle they've put at her foundation as a hero in this game. We can only give a moba character a very limited subset of what lore can give someone. In this case, her aesthetics and gameplay both line up really well on her as a stealthy, agile ranger. Except when she stands there channeling, totally vulnerable. Buuut, I'm okay with the ultimate. I don't like it, but I don't hate it. I have my criticisms and laments. If that was all, I wouldn't have made a whole thread about it. I'm bothered by the talent changes. Paralysis and Overflowing Quiver are still crap. As is often said, Paralysis only takes effect once Sylvanas stops hitting you. Which means the effective increase is only .75 seconds if you hit them once or a thousand times. It does not scale and has minimal effect anyway. Sure, with overwhelming affliction you can make that slow linger a little longer. That .75 seconds does scale in conjunction with dagger, since you cannot constantly hit many targets at once. So you can slow the enemy team (if they're close together) all for almost a second longer. That *might* save you sometime. But it will almost never *feel* like it saved you. It has a rather small impact, but the *apparent* impact is even smaller because Black Arrows is a natural part of her. It is constantly on anyways. Overflowing Quiver is weak, even with the buff. Sylvanas has always been a goddess of waveclear. She falters with Zagara's or Xuls minions, with neutral monsters. And waveclear has become much easier for other heroes post-scaling. So, in the end, a ton more waveclear lead to a rather small increase in actual efficacy. I would posit, however, that it is her overwhelming waveclear that allowed her to have other builds. She could branch out without sacrificing waveclear because she would pick up *enough* for the situation. No talent in particular was absolutely needed (You can fight me on that, people who insist on always having both Barbed shot and Unstable Poison together), but you could still spec into it entirely if you desperately needed that extra oomph. Why did I go on this rant when I was talking about Quiver? Because quiver is clearly meant to be the new Barbed shot. If you want to start off devoted to waveclear...you get one more arrow that you can't aim, and that talent will be virtually useless later on, and entirely useless in teamfights. Know how Syl can do camps early and safely, but very slooowly? Even with the damage buffs, they don't compare to Barbed shot early on. There is no longer a talent for that. (It wasn't always the right choice, but it was something that only a few heroes could do, and she is now going to be off that list the majority of the time). Note that an early Barbed Shot could also be decisive on objectives. Temple Guardians, Immortals on the Battlefield of Eternity, Infernal Shrines creatures, etc. She has lost that as well as a significant amount of early waveclear and solocamping. Her earlygame is shot. Do I need to mention Merc Queen? It arguably has the greatest impact, but requires the greatest input. She'll need to drag an ally to camps with her (Though, she probably should anyway prepatch) and keep an ally around to push with. She's easily gankable with her low escape, tankiness, and burst. On the flipside, the reward for doing this is pretty good since she can disable structures and all. I don't think Merc Queen is bad, per se, but it certainly doesn't round out this talent tier. None of this outlines why I hate this talent tier now, though. Nothing on this tier is part of a build. Before, Sylvanas pretty clearly wanted to choose from two builds with lots of added situationality. Dagger or Arrows (AA+Q), with interwoven bits of E for safety and also general waveclear based on how much you needed (Potentially jacked up to ridiculous levels and overwhelming any real build if the situation really called for it). This is, at least, my interpretation of the design paradigm Blizz was going for, and I think that would be a really good idea if it worked out. I do not think they succeeded, and I think with this new rework they wanted to wipe that slate entirely. In my opinion, that's a waste. Paralysis helps build into Overwhelming Affliction, buffing it somewhat. That's all. This is a synergy, but its not a build. Overflowing Quiver will technically benefit from some things, but it really doesn't aid waveclear or structure damage much and teamfight damage not at all. Supposing there is an arrows build now, I would not mention this even if I took it as part of it. Merc Queen is not part of a build, it is part of a playstyle. it incentivizes pushing with mercs. Strictly speaking, anything that aids in doing that would 'build' with it. All in all, I would conclude that this talent tier is very vacant in terms of impact throughout the game. The choice between Lost Soul and Barbed Shot, on the other hand, is more interesting: both define your earlygame capacity and consistently benefit you and your talents throughout the game. Talent Tier 2, we get some builds choices. But two of them are both for the Arrows build, and one of them clearly has a much better return if you can handle the (rather small) risk (That is, Barrage increases your burst and dps a bit, with With the Wind gives you a bit more safety). Not great, and I can't see With the Wind seeing much action, but this wouldn't be a terrible tier in general. (Immediately following an empty tier, however, means that this becomes the tier that defines your early game. And for that, I would call it lackluster). Tier 3 makes you choose between types of waveclear. This is the exact opposite of the old paradigm where you could choose more waveclear at basically any tier as the situation demanded. Now, you have to wait until level 7, and you can no longer choose to stack all your waveclears together. You can no longer choose to almost entirely shirk waveclear because your built in kit is enough. You are now forced to choose. This dramatically decreases the sense of situationality I felt was embedded in her kit. All three talents are good at what they do, but it's an unfair comparison now. Barbed shot works on mercs and neutrals and builds with Barrage and such. Unstable Poison lacks the versatility and synergy. Possession is cute, but Sylvanas has always been great at waveclear. Annihilating a wave is much more useful in most situations than making a bigger wave on your side. (ie Against anyone with a Quest talent based on killing minions). I like Possession as a tool, but making it fight against her other waveclear options...Well. I've already said it a dozen times haven't I? Lowers situational building, decreases her ability to be the goddess of waveclear and to vary her waveclear based on the match, and can not compete with its tier brothers in most situations. And, of course, there's a lack of synergy/builds from this tier in general. It's not quite an empty tier, but it's closer than it is to a tier that contributes to builds and cross-talent synergy. Barbed shot synergizes with any Q talent, but its the only one that directly benefits in such a way. (Now would be the time to make obvious what may be obscured by repetition. I don't think every tier has to be about choosing between two or three builds, as evidenced by my focus on situationality. But I do think that some *essense* of more than one build path should persist on most tiers even if you're playing a hero who benefits most from building every single ability they have rather than focusing on one. Right now, these tiers feel like a conglomeration of changes rather than something to path through.) Tier 5/Level 13. Life drain is not desirable. Even on Shrines, I don't heal much from it when I land it on as many neutrals and enemy team members as I can. It might be bigger than I think, but there's no way to see my accumulated selfheals. Windrunner is now pretty damn good. I was willing to get the two talents separately to do this combo before. However, now it is no longer a combo, and it is not competing with anything. The other talents are rather weak while this one is rather strong. Three survivability choices...or one choice which gives survivability, dps, AND builds with Arrows? Level 16 is a cluster. Do you become the goddess of kiting? Do you afflict one enemy with your weakened vulnerable? (Btw, Sylvanas needed an overall buff, but her strongest aspects were all nerfed/streamlined and the only pure buffs I see are raw damage to her Arrows and Windrunner. This looks more like a rebalancing around her current power level than a buff. Wish I had dev notes to understand). Do you help your team and give them super high Executioner/Unfair Advantage uptime? Do you give in to the Arrows Build and start auto-attacking things with a vengeance? (I liked Remorseless at 7. At 16, it's a pretty big shift in how you think about the playstyle at a very late point in the game. At 7, it might not be the biggest impact, but you've had some time to find the groove of the match and figure out if you're safe to be autoattacking, while also being early enough to make big playstyle changes based on talents. Plus, it helps with mercs, objectives, and hero damage.) Why do we have this big build-defining choice at the end of the game? These talents are all defining, yet versatile. (teamfight utility really does count as multipurpose. You can engage or disengage with good Slows or Vulnerability.) Defining, yet versatile sounds exactly like it should happen during the formative part of the match, not at its end. Also, we have two arrows and two dagger build talents here. Dagger 'build' no longer really exists if you can't string Affliction, Embrace, and Lost Soul. Picking two is, again, a synergy not a build. Overall, I feel like this is *too good* of a choice, and we lose more than we gain by having this one hard, defining choice. I think she needed some work, but I feel like the problem was in her weaker talents and her numbers (and second ult). Her concept, build diversity, and situationality were all *almost* in the right place. Tier One gave us a nonbinding choice between Arrows, Waveclear (w/Arrows), and Dagger (With useless corruption sitting there, and the Arrows choice being kinda sucky). Tier Two asked if we wanted more hero damage or more Arrows (for whatever purpose) with Paralysis and Quiver sitting on the sidelines. Tier Three asked if we wanted waveclear, sustain, escape, or a playstyle change that would make the difference between Arrows being just Q and having AA intertwined fundamentally with the Q (Remorseless is 100% of the reason why I call it Arrows and not WF/Q. Syl looked like she desperately wanted an Arrows build with Remorseless, but she didn't really have one). I feel like there was a lot more build diversity and room for situationality in her old kit. I also know that my opinion doesn't weigh any more heavily than anyone elses and that Blizzard seems to have a policy of making further changes rather than reverting their choices once made. So this may be an exercise in futility, but I just wanted to let this out because she's my favorite character to play even though I know she's on the weak side and has many useless talents and only one ultimate. Aside from level 10, I always felt I had more than one choice in most situations. And in any situation I would have a choice that would help. I don't think I can say that now. That's all, if you read it all, thanks for reading. I know I'm probably mostly just gonna get flak for this."
188,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Resetting talents in Try Mode after activating Trait with Sunfire Enchantment cause all AAs to be affected, even after Verdant Spheres is expended.. and it's not that OP?",0,4bfxgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4bfxgl/resetting_talents_in_try_mode_after_activating/,2016-03-22 15:02:08,"So this is obviously a bug. But unlike a lot of Try Mode bugs.. It's actually not that broken. What if this were made part of the talent? Say, all AAs made while Verdant Spheres are active are Sunfire Enchanted and give the extra damage. At level 20 this only does roughly 400 (401 to be exact) damage. I think making *all* AAs do the bonus damage while Verdant Spheres are active wouldn't be that OP, especially considering the competing talents Burned Flesh and Gravity Crush (the latter of which is a Kael'thas-only Vulnerability which makes Pyroblast do hilarious damage but Burned Flesh seems more favorable anyway). It would add an extra layer of depth to his trait and allow for a sort of AA build like Li Ming has with Sunfire, Sun King's Fury and Pyromaniac. Combining the two AA boosts it does 818 damage per AA at level 20, but on a squishy, low mobility mage like Kael'thas who already does almost that much damage with a single Living Bomb anyway and would require him to kite in AA range, could you really call it broken? What do you think? Should all AAs made with Verdant Spheres active be boosted by Sunfire Enchantment?"

I've seen a lot of people build her Q on the PTR and then claim NOVA RIP in General Chat. I tried the Q build as well and it does feel a bit lackluster and too difficult to use (miss one Snipe and you lose all your stacks). This W (Pinning Shot) build is safe to use due to the increased Range AND is EASIER because it is mostly POINT AND CLICK. Her new build also isn't as frustrating to fight against (she can't 100-0 you anymore), but she still puts out respectable burst. She feels like somewhere in between sustained damage and poke/burst in the PTR. I think Blizzard did a fine job with reworking her. I haven't experienced major mana problems with her as well. **Talents:** - 1 - Upgrade on W (+30% range on W and your next basic attack has +30% range) - 4 - Holo Decoy upgrade whatever you prefer - 7 - Anti-Armor Shell/One in Chamber - 10 - Precision Strike - 13 - **Get 2 charges on W** - 16 - Either Vulnerability on W or Damage on Holo Decoy - 20 - Whatever you prefer **Your combo looks like:** - W -&gt; AA -&gt; W -&gt; AA -&gt; Q -&gt; E (if you go with Holo Decoy damage) **Level 16** - Vulnerability on W - I take this when we the enemy has multiple tanks/warriors or if we need to burst one target down asap. - Holo Decoy deals 40% of Nova's damage - I use this for fun or when they have plenty of squishies with disengage. **Holo Decoy Talent at Level 4 to go with Level 16** - I like the longer duration on Holo Decoy for a bit more sustained damage - However i've been using a lot of the reduced mana cost and cooldown talent because this build is a bit mana intensive - Finally the increased range and vision on Holo Decoy could also be useful if the enemy has Valla, Zeratul, Lunara or heroes that can blink when you need to finish them off from afar as they flee. **Power Spike at Level 13:** - You get the talent that adds 2 charges to your W. With this you can burst a squishy down with - W -&gt; AA -&gt; W -&gt;AA -&gt; Q/R - More damage if you can squeeze an extra AA-move in between the two W but that is pushing it Just my /2c! -Board"
190,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,I now feel more like a WEREWOLF when I'm playing Rehgar than when I'm playing Greymane.,0,436y4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/436y4l/i_now_feel_more_like_a_werewolf_when_im_playing/,2016-01-29 14:14:51,"Simple reason why and simple fix. Rehgar increases his mobility- BIG TIME. He increases his ability to hunt and to escape. In other words... he feels more like an actual animal. So the fix that I see. At least a step in the right direction: increase Wolf form movement speed to make him feel more like a wild animal. Right now he feels more like a hairy old guy with a hunched back just heaving out of breath as he waits to swing his cane at you, as the sheer weight of the wooden stick actually propels your old weak ass forward. Lol. Greymane only feels like a werewolf when he is aggressively attacking someone or leaping on them (see both his ults). The rest of the time you can feel somewhat impactful with your Moltav's, but when you build for it, you still feel like a weak old man every time you transform (at least I do). So the first fix I'd like to see Blizzard try is a simple movement buff in wolf form. Make him scary. When he changes, make his enemies feel like ahh shit. I better not run cuz he's just gonna chase me down... I mean... this IS what people are saying right now when the simply SEE Mi-Ling. All of us on PTR are like... oh shit. There is Mi-Ling. I could literally blow up from a giant purple planet flying from accross the screen and through a nearby bush at any moment. Or fuck... I hope she didn't go TP build with that damn Armor upgrade. She could wipe our whole team if we don't watch ourselves... But how does Greymane make us feel? Well certainly not like an animal. Rehgar baby... now that's a hero starting to feel like an animal. But, ok... back to how I think he can be fixed: Step 1) Increase wolf-form base movement speed (by a lot). Maybe not as fast as rehgar or lunara, but damn close. Step 2) If this in anyway means you have to nerf some of his numbers... do it. That's fine. At least he'll be more fun and fun is a good place to start... Step 3) What is one of the most fun things to do with Greymane, that I almost never see? His bullet heroic.. whatever its called. Take THAT thing and make it way more fun. How? By decreasing its cooldown tremendously. You know part of why MiLing is so damn fun? Because her Heroics are on a 20 second cooldown! You get to play with them all the time... but Greymane's toys... not so much Step 4) get rid of the vulnerability (perhaps do this) on the gun thingy heroic. The fun part of this heroic is not that the enemy takes extra damage. Its the whole ""can I hit this guy from a screen length away and get a chance to jump on his ass...?"" moment. So let me shoot my gun on people every 10 damn seconds. Why not? Step 5) Enjoy how much more fun Greymane is. He will more like an animal. He will be able to hunt his opponent from afar every 20 seconds or whatever. BUT... there will be tradeoffs to both of these abilities. They will make him a threat to dive and a better chasing hero... but he is still very weak when alone. Dive too deep off screen not watching the map? Get surrounded by 3 heroes and blown up. Chase Lunara too deep in the woods (how fucking cool would that moment be btw!??! instead of grandpa werey yelling at her saying! ""my baaaaaack! I'll get you next time sonnyyy!!! Just you wait!!!! I aaaMMM THEE HUUNNTT---hahhaaahaa cougn) and get blown up by a purple bush. Anyways... think FUN blizzy. How can we make this less than powerful hero be more fun? Not closer to 50% win rate. Not ""more viable"" or ""in the meta"" and picked by all the pros... but more damn fun. More like a werewolf. More like you just did for Rehgar baby!!!! :) "
191,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,MVP.B. Sake's Ranged Assassin Tier List / PTR Impression,65,439yph,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/439yph/mvpb_sakes_ranged_assassin_tier_list_ptr/,2016-01-30 05:01:41,"Hey folks, MVP Black's Sake apparently posted on a [Korean forum](URL his ""Tier List"" for Ranged Assassins/DPS based on his impressions on PTR and recent scrim experiences, so I figured I'll share what he posted: Please keep in mind that this is just an opinion of **one pro-player**, based on **his current impressions**. It is **NOT** suppose to be taken as an absolute truth that will never change. If anything, there's already been many times where MVP players said a hero is weak or not viable in an interview, then proceeded to use the hero a lot couple days later. **=======BELOW is the Translation of the Post=====** I'm bored, so here it is. Based on my point-of-view, scrims, tournament-based. #Tier 1 : Kael'thas, Li-Ming ##**Li-Ming** Li-Ming super strong. CD reset and strong poke. Can do instant burst with short-range talents. S-class escape ""Teleport"" + All-around fighter with ""Illusionist"". If KT gets nerfed, she will be Tier 1 assassin with no one coming close. Jaina-level burst with KT-level poking. Strong at both siege and defending. As for drawbacks, early waveclear is weak. It's workable if you hit arcane orb from the side, but terrible if it ends up hitting a hero mid-travel. Low health. ##**Kael'thas** Early team fight is weak, but good waveclear helps (although it takes high mana). Gets very relaxing once you hit 13. Just DWW, but going to be nerf'd. Probably lower damage on Q, no DWW on same target, increased CD on Phoenix. #Tier 2: Jaina, Lunara, Falstad, Zagara, Tyrande ##**Jaina** Not good, not bad. Usable. A bit sad that vulnerability on E will no longer apply to structures. ##**Lunara** Based on PTR and the recent trends. Lunara can do great damage on both front line and back line at the same time. She can do free damage to the front line with her kiting. But no mount, and has clear counters such as Thrall, Stitches. ##**Falstad** Still strong in EU and CN. If KT gets nerfed, he might become Tier 1. Single-target burst damage and mobility. Ability to dictate when you want to fight is a strong plus, but heavily reliant on Q. If you get blinded when your Q is out, your damage is halved. ##**Zagara** Great vision and strong lane pressure. Some times weak against ganks, but can get experience lead with early tower takedowns and destroys enemy formations with Maw. Useable. ##**Tyrande** Technically a Support, but not a support. Early AA-damage is better than most assassins, and has stun + vulnerability. Owl build lets you reduce your CD quickly in team fights and W,E, AAs nets you strong damage from the back line. Can cloak with ult, and good 1v1 thanks to shrink ray. No longer a tier 1 support due to OP'thur, but more than capable of being a tier 2 assassin. #Tier 3: Raynor, Valla ##**Raynor** Nerfs to bullseye and lower HP makes him weaker than before, but his money AAs is great for melting the front line. But nerf to Focused Attack would make him even weaker, and based on how he is seen less in scrims these days, it won't be long for him to join the tier 4 ranks. ##**Valla** She has been coming up as the replacement for Raynor. The WQERW build allow kiting with Frost shot and burst single-target damage with Q, Strafe gives decent damage. But high mana usable and you get deleted once you use your E. Crapallla #Tier 4: Crap ##**Siege Tank** Low health. Bad mobility. Can force an enemy to engage, but you get withered down by Li-Ming, Falstad, Zagara's pokes and relying just on AA's is so-so. Powerful siege damage. I have fun with cloaked + focused attack in QM, but that's also getting nerfed. Last time we used it in scrim or tournament was Sky Temple vs Snake at Super League* **TLer's NOTE**: I can't tell if he just forgot about the Grand Final against DK, or if he is consciously trying to erase it from his memory. ##**Nova** Before PTR: for QM and trolling. After PTR: Not as mana-inefficient as before, but not as good damage either. ##**Tychus** No solution. Last time we used it was Super Leage vs Snake at Infernal Shrines. Odin as a surprise tactic for shrine fights through AA and W to wither enemy down and melting them with Q. Nothing good. ##**Sylvanas** Making structures vulnerable like Jaina was nice, but that's gone too. Girly AA and ult damage. Lack team fight presence. Bad. Specialize in daily quest. ##**Nazeebo** Super trash. In the same level as the old S.C.D.E. (Stitches, Chen, Diablo, ETC) I take a deep breadth whenever I see him on HL, and makes me want to leave the draft. If you see this post, please don't pick the No.4's in HL. **====================================** That's it folks. Let's hope things remain civil."
192,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Analyzing the Nova rework,0,43c85k,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/43c85k/analyzing_the_nova_rework/,2016-01-30 13:30:14,"I have to start by giving kudos to Blizz and the Heroes team for being so proactive in the recent balance patches which have been largely positive and well thought out. &amp;nbsp; There's almost nothing more polarizing than a nova post on this sub. I'll say up front that I'm a nova fan who believes that the hero needed a rework, but that the current changes on the PTR are overkill. I understand that many players couldn't care less about nova and would be happy to see her nerfed to the ground, however I don't believe that the live state of Nova warrants what is effectively a removal of the hero from relevance. &amp;nbsp; I get that the hero is too binary currently. I agree that nova on live is not healthy for the majority of the player base. Please hear me out. The following is based on the top Quick Match build for Nova on hotslogs. Why only Quick Match? Because that's where the majority of the issues exist. The popular builds take the following: &amp;nbsp; Ambush Snipe (+20% snipe damage from stealth) Gathering Power (+30% max ability power, based on kills, resets on death) Anti-Armor Shells (+250% basic attack damage, increases time between attacks accordingly) Precision Strike or Triple Tap (we'll go with PS because it's the most popular) Lethal Decoy (decoy does 25% of nova's damage) Double Fake (2 decoys) Rewind (reset basic abilities cooldowns) &amp;nbsp; * **Damage Reduction:** &amp;nbsp; Lets start by looking at burst damage reduction. We'll assume all abilities are used, followed by rewind, followed by abilities again (All numbers are taken from level 20 Try mode on PTR and Live): &amp;nbsp; **Typical Rotation on Live:** &amp;nbsp; 1) Pinning Shot: * 241 base * +30% from Gathering Power = 313.3 &amp;nbsp; 2) Snipe: * 735 base * +20% from Ambush Snipe = 147 * +30% from Gathering Power = 220.5 * Total with just GP: 955.5 * Total: 1102.5 &amp;nbsp; 3) Decoys (to keep it simple lets assume the decoys only get off one snipe and one pinning shot): * 25% of Snipe with GP x 2 decoys = (238.875 x 2) = 477.75 * 25% of Pinning Shot with GP x 2 decoys = (78.325 x 2) = 156.65 * Total: 634.4 &amp;nbsp; 4) Precision Strike: * 1000 base * + 30% from Gathering Power = 300 * Total: 1300 &amp;nbsp; Ability Damage subtotal: 3350.2 &amp;nbsp; 5) Rewind 6) Pinning Shot (same as above): 313.3 7) Snipe (same as above minus 20% from ambush snipe): 955.5 8) Decoys (same as above): 634.4 Total theoretical ability damage: 5253.4 &amp;nbsp; Can you begin to see the problem here? *Lethal Decoy + Double Fake + Rewind is extremely overpowered on Nova.* The pre-rewind damage is borderline acceptable for a glass cannon ambush hero who has executed a perfect combo and blown their heroic ability. The post-rewind damage is why you see some heroes get 100-0 deleted with little or no ability to avoid it. &amp;nbsp; But let's look at what a high damage PTR build might be (please correct me if there's a higher dps build i've missed): &amp;nbsp; Longshot (30% range on pinning shot) Holo Stability (+120% decoy duration) Snipe Master (up to +50% damage on snipe provided you never ever miss HAH) Precision Strike Double Tap (2 charges of pinning shot) Lethal Decoy (decoy does 40% damage) Rewind &amp;nbsp; **Typical Rotation on PTR:** &amp;nbsp; 1) Pinning Shot: * 241 base * extra charge from Double Tap talent * Total: 482 &amp;nbsp; 2) Snipe: * 588 Base * +50% from max snipe master (yeah, right): 294 * Total: 882 &amp;nbsp; 3) Decoy (as above, assume 1 snipe and 1 pinning shot) * 40% of snipe w/snipe master: 352.8 * 40% of pinning shot: 96.4 * Total: 449.2 &amp;nbsp; 4) Precision Strike: 1000 base &amp;nbsp; Ability damage subtotal: 2813.2 &amp;nbsp; 5) Rewind &amp;nbsp; 6) Pinning Shot (rewind only resets one cd, so just 1x this time): 241 7) Snipe (same as above): 882 8) Decoy (same as above): 449.2 &amp;nbsp; Total theoretical ability damage: 4385.4 &amp;nbsp; So we can see that in an absolute best case scenario where a player keeps up the 50% snipe buff, our total theoretical ability damage burst is **only about 16% lower** than the current live version of Nova. It should be obvious to Nova players that it is very realistic to expect a high uptime on the +30% gathering power, whereas it is nearly impossible in a real game to maintain the +50% sniper master buff. In practice I'd estimate that most players will go for One in the Chamber over Snipe Master, and that the basic attack damage would go up by 80% if executed perfectly, while the snipe damage on decoys and nova go down by 50%. &amp;nbsp; **So if the numbers aren't as bad as everyone initially thought, why does nova feel so weak and fragile now on the PTR?** &amp;nbsp; Well, let's look at what we lose going from live to PTR outside of damage. &amp;nbsp; * **Defense Reduction** &amp;nbsp; Decoys: A big part of nova's defense lies in her decoys. Unfortunately when Double Fake was removed, so was a good chunk of her ability to juke opponents. &amp;nbsp; Spell Shield: This was available at lvl 13 and has been removed. &amp;nbsp; Advanced Cloak: Not many people have mentioned this, but advanced cloak was an excellent defensive/escape/sustain talent at 13 that was nerfed and moved to level 1. On Live it gives +25% move speed and +2% health per second. On PTR it is simply +30% move speed. I much prefer the live version. &amp;nbsp; Bolt of the Storm: removed. While Ghost Protocol is kinda neat to use, IMHO bolt of the storm was a much better escape, and was a tough choice between it and Rewind. On PTR I can almost never justify giving up Rewind, as it allows for more damage AND defense through the extra clone. &amp;nbsp; * **Utility Reduction** &amp;nbsp; Decoys: Decoys previously applied effects from Pinning shot including vulnerability. On PTR this appears to have been removed. &amp;nbsp; * **Opportunity Cost** &amp;nbsp; This mostly entails talent tier arrangement and the elimination of some combinations that were previously available. &amp;nbsp; 1) We must now choose between basic attack bonus talents and snipe damage (One in the Chamber / Anti-Armor Shells / Snipe Master on same tier). Given the existing ability damage reduction, there's not a lot of justification to further reduce by forcing this choice. &amp;nbsp; 2) In addition, the Nova iteration on PTR has little if any reason to ever pick Anti-Armor Shells over One in the Chamber given the available build choices. &amp;nbsp; 3) a note about Snipe Master on this tier. It's just a bad talent with a very frustrating mechanic. Unless you are a top 1% player in a pub stomp, you are not going to ever pick this in its current form. It's almost laughable that someone at Blizzard thought this up and it got through to the PTR. &amp;nbsp; 3) We are forced into a decoy talent at lvl 4. The talents are decent, but they are a waste unless you plan to build further into decoys. What was the thought here? This does not promote overall build diversity. &amp;nbsp; 4) We are forced to choose between vulnerability on pinning shot and lethal decoy now. This used to be a choice between double fake and vulnerability which IMO was a more compelling choice. &amp;nbsp; 5) The level 13 talents are kind of a joke. Double Tap is going to be the best choice even on snipe builds. None of these talents give a significant power boost at 13. Lethal decoy should be moved back to 13. &amp;nbsp; 6) Why are there so many noob trap mana talents? Nova doesn't have mana issues. &amp;nbsp; * **Build Diversity** &amp;nbsp; I currently see a Snipe build (which is doomed to fail because it depends on Nova's ability to expose herself more often, which is a tall order given that she lost a lot of defense ability), a team fight build via double pinning shot + vulnerability, and a decoy rewind build. Nova still cannot effectively clear lanes, has several trash talents (which is very annoying given this is a rework of the hero), has lost a significant amount of damage AND defense, and does not bring anything to the table over other assassins in the PTR iteration. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **So my final plea to blizzard is this:** * Taking away Gathering Power was enough of a numbers nerf if you also take away rewind. Rewind was what enabled the cheese 100-0 delete-a-hero builds. * Bump snipe back up to the original base, but take away Ambush Snipe if you wish. * Leave double decoy for defense and lower their damage from 25% each to 20% on each clone. * Get rid of Snipe Master, it's a dumb talent and isn't fun or interesting, only frustrating and volatile. * Keep Ghost Protocol in place of Bolt, it's an interesting choice once you remove Rewind. * Give her a poke/wave clear build that sacrifices single target damage. * Don't force us to choose a decoy talent. * Please for the love of god rethink all of the garbage talents in this 'rework' of nova. It's insulting that you guys take so much care not to overnerf certain heroes like Tyrande or KT who almost singlehandedly caused many pro players to quit the game and forced a stale meta for months, then seemingly stick your intern on the nova rework. You guys have proven that you can make intelligent creative balance solutions when you want to. The nova rework, while you may get praise from quickmatch nova haters, sticks out like a sore thumb as a half effort on your part. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **EDIT:** Removing the Zeratul bullet point. People just reading that and flat out ignoring the entire post. "
193,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"New Nova is not that bad, she's just not the same.",36,43dvu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/43dvu0/new_nova_is_not_that_bad_shes_just_not_the_same/,2016-01-30 23:24:40,"I've played quite the Nova games on the PTR (I'm around 8 right now), against all sorts of Li-Ming comps. (let's say that if one comp on the PTR doesn't feature Li-Ming, there's an issue there) **Nova has changed and made a 180 degree turn.** She is not anymore the old burst hero everyone loved playing with but sadly hated playing against or just wrecked. She is now a **high sustained damage dealer**, in constrast to Zeratul being the stealthed burst dealer. The reason why people are failing with her on the PTR is because they try to play her like the Old Nova. That is **impossible**. While the early game is still the same (look for kills), Nova just doesn't have the burst to flank in teamfights anymore. But she has the damage to prepare kills or to finish people in a safe position. I've figured three kind of different builds for her yet (those apply without the bugfixes) : *The Pinning Shot -cripple them down- build* : URL This build is about readying opportunities for your teammates by weakening as much as you can the enemy team. You can stay pretty safe with the range, and use your tools to make their tanks go boom, then kill their healer. You basically help your team with the focus by providing useful damage and slowing. In my opinion, this build is better with **strong AoE damage dealer that can use the massive vulnerability or strong single target burst damage that can insta-gib your target**. As Rewind's bugged with Pinning Shot, it's just better to go for Precision Strike + The Ult upgrade. This way you can actually try killing people if you want to. The other build is the **Snipe-a-lot build**: URL This is a build meant to be used against a **heavy frontline comp**. Hit the tanks for safe Snipes with 4 second CD. You're like a Spell Damage Based Raynor -that can't waveclear, but whatever- that can finish people down with triple tap! Triple Tap is... There for two reasons that Precision strike will have issues doing so. 1- Finishing the melee targets. Let's say that if a Sonya is hitting on your Morales, she'll dodge easily the precision strike unless you can predict her movement perfectly due to the +10% mvt speed. Melees usually have good mobility -minus the Butcher and Kerrigan- making them hard to hit with PS, but need to use their stun to dive -minus Kerrigan-, so there you go. Do this after weakening them with snipes so only the first two shots are best are to be used. 2- Creating havoc on the enemy team. Fire at long range a squishy, and make their positioning change. This can also create problems with a Kael so they have to spread the bomb somehow not to die. (btw this is also one of the reasons you can pick Triple Tap on the Pinning Shot build) As you're not gonna obviously always kill the target (and even then not gonna have a huge time to use that since that Jo's condemn will be back by then), Fast Reload is not a great option. Rewind is also meh since the only tool you'll be using after getting uncloaked is Snipe and it has a 4 sec CD. So Ghost Protocol comes. And this thing is wonderful if you like Juke City. You can juke armies with that thing if you know how to use it. Definitely one of my new favorite talents. (if you want you can also pick Advanced Cloaking instead of Covert Ops at lv1 for more reliability) The main issue about this build though is the **lack of waveclear**. You're only gonna be able to help your team at that when your snipes miss and it's not gonna be that consequent. Pick this only when you have a great waveclearer ready to serve but weak to a heavy frontline. (like Kael or Li-Ming) Now for the last build : **Holo this up**: URL This build turns Nova into a very high sustained damage dealer with the Holos that brings finishers with Precision Strike (or triple tap, whatever there). Main weakness of this build though is that it really takes sense only when Nova reaches lv16. Why Anti-Armor Shells and not OitC? Trying both on the PTR at the Try Shop, I've discovered that while the overall damage of the decoys + Nova is the same at 20 with both, the decoy hits harder with AAS. **Decoys hit for ~2000 single target damage with AAS while they hit for ~1800 single target damage with OitC** -with Double Tap picked to ensure max damage-. Yes, if a target is left alone against two decoys (which might be unlikely, but you can still clear the lane with Precision Strike somehow), they deal 4000 damage. That is enough to kill most of the ranged assassins. Your Decoys will weaken people for you to finish them. Imo this build is best on maps that will finish in duels or ganks. Idk, Dragon Shire's shrines if you get the enemy team's rotation isn't that perfect, Towers of Doom if there's a Falstad on the enemy team that is sure to try contesting altars on his owns... Or just to bring disruption by lv16. Though, it's sure she's flawed, I can't disagree. If she does not hit the meta yet, I propose one of these changes imo : - **Base Holo deals now 1 damage with every of Nova's abilities**. The reason why? To bring her builds earlier disruption. Nova lacks of early game usefulness. - **Reworking her scaling to make her early game damage better while the lategame stays the same**. Again, I'm hitting on the same Nova issue : Her early game. Nova has quite the okay-ish damage early on. A full rotation on a Hero -well, you'll still obviously try to gank early on- deals **497 damage**. A full Jaina combo deals **~750 damage** (without the blizzard second hit). See where the issue is? Buff her early damage but make her scaling like 3% or 3.5% so she remains with the same -imo- good late game numbers. - **All the bugfixes/tooltip corrections**. That is a no-brainer. I think that's all. Enjoy playing the new Nova and wrecking the nexus with her!"

IE she'll be dead or it will be over. Actual DPS is a bit lower honestly. Auto Attacks are assumed to be fired twice per combo and movement happens between combos, follow through adds decoy to combo for extra attack, Anti-armor shells is assumed to only fire once per combo. &amp;nbsp; **Comparison Damage - Level 20 Values:** baseline damage/damage with vulnerability -- dps over 12 seconds (cooldown) - Baseline Snipe: 587/734 -- 97.83/122.33 (8) - Max Stacks Snipe Master: 940/1,175 -- 156.66/195.83 (8) - Max Stacks Snipe Master Perfect Shots DPS: -- 235.00 (4) - Pinning Shots: 241/301 -- 38.33/45.16 (12) - Auto Attack: 230/287 -- 38.33/47.83 (1) - Anti-Armor Shells AA: 575/719 -- 95.83/119.83 (2) - Follow-Through AA: 414/518 -- 103.50/129.50 (1) - Leathal Decoy: *varies*, using Rapid Deployment numbers &amp;nbsp; **Combos:** Burst Damage ; Total Damage over 12 sec -- DPS over 12 sec - Default Combo: Pinning Shots/Snipe/AA. 1,288 ; 2,346 -- 196 - Perfect Shots/Snipe Master: Pinning Shots/Snipe/AA. 1,641 ; 3,992 -- 333 - Crippling Shots/Snipe master: Pinning Shots/Snipe/AA. 1,990 ; 3,813 -- 318 - Lethal Decoy/Snipe Master: Decoy/Pinning Shots/Snipe/AA. 2,297 ; 4,926 -- 411 - Crippling Shot/Anti-Armor Shells: Pinning Shots/Snipe/Anti-Armor Shells. 1,694 ; 3,508 -- 292 - Lethal Decoy/Anti-Armor Shells: Decoy/Pinning Shots/Snipe/Anti-Armor Shells. 2,014 ; 4,766 -- 390 - Crippling Shots/Follow-Through: 2011 ; 4,142 -- 345 - Lethal Decoy/Follow-Through: 2,318 ; 5,346 -- 432 &amp;nbsp; Again keep in mind the total damage numbers are over 12 seconds. 5,000 damage in 12 seconds is not near as impressive as it looks. &amp;nbsp; **Conclusions:** - *Follow Through vs Anti-Armor Shells:* Follow-Through offers a bit higher Damage and DPS (about 15%) in return for staying around for alot longer (about 2 seconds longer) when compared to Anti-Armor Shells. You trade Safety for a bit of extra damage. They seem well balanced vs each other, though I have my doubts about staying in place for 2+ seconds as Nova to unload on a regular basis. - *Snipemaster vs Anti-Armor Shells:* Snipemaster offers about 15% more burst at max stacks than Anti-Armor shells and but the DPS of the two is roughly the same. For the horrendous limitations and the need to build stacks I don't think it's worth it. Especially because Anti-Armor shots is infinitely more usable with a 2 second cooldown and targeted. - *Sustained Holo vs Rapid Projection:* Sustained Holo is Worthless. Rapid Projection achieves the same DPS and burst while saving mana and having more utility. Sustained Holo needs a buff or should just be replaced with a non-holo talent. - *Nova's Damage:* Burst and Sustained damage are numbers achievable by many heroes in game atm. The advantages she has are stealth and range. But of course she also has no escapes and very low hp. We shall see if she can compete with her new numbers. I'm pessimistic but stats will tell. &amp;nbsp; **Snipermaster Suggestion:** Make Snipemaster like Muradin's Perfect Storm and increase the damage by 15 whenever you hit a hero permanently. Then cap it at 30 stacks. This would give Nova a potential baseline snipe at end game of 1,037 and fix the severe issues currently facing the talent. You'd have to hit 23 snipes to get to current level of effectiveness after 10 snipes. Stack limit and damage gained per snipe would also be quite valuable tools in adjusting the effectiveness of the talent in varied ways without needing severe and drastic nerfs. **Sustained Holo Suggstion:** This needs something to make it useful over Rapid Projection. Give it more hp, give it a minor hp regen aura, roll it into Remote Delivery to make the scouting more valuable...something. Currently it's just a useless talent."

Just think of it like the extra trash he's carrying around improves his armor class. Plus makes robogoblin a little more viable as an off-tank."

Level 7: Anti-armor shells, this works great later. Level 10: Either or, personally if Li-ming takes disintegrate Triple-tap works really well as it out ranges her and she can't teleport out of it. Level 13: Explosive round, with this you can finally help clear lanes, and do some decent damage in a team fight. Level 16: Lethal Decoy, easy free damage and the snipe of the decoy also procs explosive round. If you take this and rewind you can easily drop a bunch of damage in a teamfight free and safely. Level 20: Rewind is usually my go to choice, but if there's ever a time when you can take ghost it's not a bad idea. It's gotten me out of a couple situations already, but the timing has to be spot on. Overall though it should really be lower in her talents. So with this, you still have a good amount of burst, and you can contribute to a team fight without putting yourself at risk. Clearing lanes actually becomes possible and you still kinda retain so of that old nova threat with constant clones. Don't get me wrong, you lose a good amount of burst without vulnerability. You make up for it with a surprising amount of harass though. TL:DR; Explosive rounds, lethal decoy, and anti-armor shells make nova a bit more versatile. Edit: Spacing."

In fact I'd say this guide isn't even really finished per se, but I want to get something up for the people who are planning their drafts. I was making an effort to be more succinct, based on some feedback from the previous two guides, as well and... well, I didn't do a great job. Next weeks guide will be awesome. Promise. &amp;nbsp; It is that time again. The map this week for Chair League is Battlefield of Eternity, the only two lane map still in the map pool. Lots of potential strategies on this map, but lets go over some key points. &amp;nbsp; The Map &amp;nbsp; Two lanes, widely spaced apart. Four merc camps, upgraded siege at the top and bottom, upgraded bruisers at the sides. The middle area is four platforms surrounded by narrow entrances, where the map objective spawns. &amp;nbsp; The Immortal objective is, in my opinion, the one I see misplayed most often in the standard course of HL and QM. You never, emphasis on never here, really want to fight evenly around the enemy Immortal. If the entire enemy team is up and you're at even talent tiers, at best you can do some poke damage on it until the the enemy team comes. Then you have to leave. On the flip side if the enemy team picks a fight next to your Immortal, always take it. Most of the fights should happen around the edges and in the middle. &amp;nbsp; Sustained damage is very strong on this map, as are vulnerabilities because it allows you to DPS down the Immortal very quickly. It isn't uncommon to win a team fight and not be able to quickly kill the immortal because you are a CD based team without strong sustained damage. &amp;nbsp; Vision is of course at a premium, with such a large area where fights will happen, multiple vents/terrain features, etc. &amp;nbsp; Wave clear can be critical on this map despite the only two lane arrangement, because if you are playing from behind you can send one person to soak and defend safely around the Immortal. Also the camps are quite strong and will need to be de-pushed quickly if the enemy team times them correctly to push during Immortals. It isn't uncommon to accidentally lose a Keep to bruiser camp that gets ignored in the mid-late game. &amp;nbsp; As the map is very poke oriented, strong dive heroes that can force bad engagements around the immortals while they are being poked are very strong. &amp;nbsp; You need to assess your comp's damage. If you can win the race for the immortal, you don't need to defend yours. If you can't win the race, you'll need to defend. Which means whichever team has more Immortal damage has the small advantage of knowing the other team will always feel obligated to defend. &amp;nbsp; Often team fights in the middle, even if you win, leave you too low to do anything useful. It is often better in the early game to all back, even after a won team fight, then to proceed straight to DPSing the Immortal. A full health and mana enemy team coming back right away when you are low is a bad situation. &amp;nbsp; Pre-10 you should basically never all-push or all-defend after the Immortal phase. You need to still get the soak from the other lane, or you'll fall drastically behind. Also the early Immortals are so weak it is often better to 4-man push the opposite lane, rather than push with the Immortal. Applies certainly to the first one and usually the second. Sylvanas on your team is probably the only exception. &amp;nbsp; Heroes to consider for BoE: &amp;nbsp; Tyrande: Vulnerability from level 1 means almost any team comp can win the Immortal race. &amp;nbsp; Li-Ming: High siege, high poke, very mobile. &amp;nbsp; Thrall and Diablo: For the same reason. Hard engage and sustained damage. &amp;nbsp; Zagara: Vision, vision, and vision. Maw is also an excellent anti-dive Heroic, which is good for teams that mesh well with Zagara as they tend to be poke based. &amp;nbsp; Cho'Gall: Incredible zoning and poke, only two lanes so the lack of a body is less relevant. &amp;nbsp; Sylvanas: Must be mentioned on any map where there is an AI objective that pushes for you. &amp;nbsp; Sgt. Hammer: Can outrange the Immortal stuns and makes defending your Immortal much easier, in addition to substantial sustained damage. &amp;nbsp; Abathur: The Immortals last a very long time and Abathur can soak both lanes, one with a body, one with a hat, in the mean time. The limited number of buildings also means late game Abathur can be pushing down core. Mines provide vision and the slow mines are some insurance vs dive. You will be relatively fragile till 10 in team fights, so you need to be careful not to negate the soak advantage by dying. Even if you lose every Immortal to 10, you can end up ahead. &amp;nbsp; All the ranged auto attackers. Greymane, Raynor, Valla, Falstad, Tychus. Each come with pros and cons. &amp;nbsp; Last note on map mechanics, people often think the Immortals are random, but they aren't quite. &amp;nbsp; Specific Mechanics Credit to: URL &amp;nbsp; The duel starts at 105 seconds, and 105 seconds after the last Immortal is defeated. The warning comes 15 seconds before the start, and 10 minutes into the game it changes to 30 seconds. There are four configurations of where the Immortals land - North+South, South+North, West+East, East+West. On the first event, the immortals start at either North+South or South+North, and always reposition to East+West after either of them reaches 50% (so they are always near the enemy base). On subsequent events, the initial position pair is chosen randomly, except it can't be the same as last time. After repositioning, they can land in any of the three remaining configurations. The winning Immortal always chooses the most 'healthy' lane. If the two lanes are (almost) equally pushed, the lane is chosen randomly. &amp;nbsp; The Draft &amp;nbsp; So what do you want in the draft? &amp;nbsp; One piece of fast wave clear, to deal with de-pushing camps, the split soak, etc. &amp;nbsp; One source, at least, of vision. Zagara, Tassadar, Tyrande, Lunara, Brightwing, all the usual suspects are good here. &amp;nbsp; One source, at least, of sustained damage. &amp;nbsp; Decide if you are a dive comp trying to force fights, a poke comp that is going to win the race, etc. Have a strategy for your draft based around the heroes your team is comfortable playing and stick to that plan. &amp;nbsp; As you can see, your draft can remain fairly flexible. Zagara covers all three of those things by herself, leaving the rest of your draft completely open. Because the map emphasizes team fights so early and so often, you want to consider your sustain, both in terms of mana and health, on your heroes. Mana less heroes, self-healing heroes, and highly efficient healers both excel on this map. Brightwing, Sonya, Raynor, E.T.C., etc, are all particularly efficient on this map. &amp;nbsp; Any specific questions feel free to ask and I'll answer them or drop by my stream at URL"
201,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Nova's Rework Is a Failure Not Because It's Undertuned, but Because Her New Direction Clashes with Her Core Design",535,451roo,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/451roo/novas_rework_is_a_failure_not_because_its/,2016-02-10 19:32:20,"By now it's pretty obvious that the new Nova is extremely undertuned. I don't see much disagreement on that, and that can always be fixed with some numbers adjustments, just like Rehgar's new design can be brought into line with some numbers adjustments in the opposite direction. However, the real problem with Nova's rework is on a much more basic level, and one that wont be solved until she's reworked again: her new talent design no longer accentuates the design of her basic kit or fantasy, but rather tries to force her down a different route that she just doesn't fit. To compare her to Rehgar again, this rework is like his earlier rework (the one that came with Brightwing's rework which turned him into a boring healbot), except that it's even worse. Take a look at Nova's basic kit: * A single target, thin line skill shot * A low range, single target slow with minor damage * A decoy that is uncontrollable and doesn't do damage * Out of battle cloaking and a boosted AA range * Heroic choices between a series of powerful, single target projectiles, or a large delayed AoE burst The two core aspects of her kit are a focus on high burst single target damage (Snipe, Pinning Shot, Triple Tap), and misdirection (Cloak and Holo Decoy). Her basic design suggests a flanking assassin that uses her misdirection abilities to either kill high priority targets (squishy damage dealers or supports), or hurt them enough to pull them out of the fight, with a bit of safety from confusion. The problem is that her new talent tree doesn't support that design. She has very few talents that increase her burst, making flanking far too dangerous for her, and subsequently removing the purpose of her misdirection. Instead, the new design appears to suggest either sustained damage or utility roles for her, but neither her basic kit nor her fantasy fit these roles. Let's review some reasons for why: * Snipe isn't reliable enough a skillshot to rely on for sustained damage output, especially when it can't be used from a flank. * She has the second lowest health in the game among ""regular"" heroes (i.e. everyone other than Lost Vikings, Abathur, and Murky), but unlike every other hero in her health range, she has no escapes or sustain at all (not even Bolt). * Her cloak and decoys do nothing when you're constantly dishing out damage. * She offers little base utility. A minor single target slow and a decoy for vision are not worth wasting a hero slot on while waiting for some of her later talent options. * She's a sniper and a Ghost. Since when were snipers know for running around hitting things with a pea shooter? So why pick her right now? Why take her for sustained damage when you could take Valla, Raynor, Falstad, Sylvanas, Zagara, etc., and deal more damage while staying safer? Why take her for the utility of slowing and vision when Lunara can provide more slows and safer vision? Why take her for Vulnerability when Tyrande has it out of the gate, Sylvanas and Jaina can provide it in an AoE, and Artanis has better up-time on it? There's no reason to pick her right now, just like there was almost never a reason to pick Rehgar before this rework, simply because other heroes can do the same things she can while providing more complete packages. I'm sure Blizzard could buff her enough to bring her win rate back to an acceptable level, but she'll continue to play awkwardly, as if her basic kit and talent trees were designed by different people for different purposes. And that's because they were. Am I saying that Blizzard was wrong to attempt to give her a new direction? No, and I'm going to bold this because a lot of people hated her old design and will probably want to downvote this post because they'll think I'm saying she needs her old talent tree back. **What I'm saying is that, if Blizzard wanted to change her role so drastically, she needed to be redesigned from the ground up, trait and abilities included.** I'm surprised how Blizzard managed to release two reworks in a patch where one did so much right, and the other so much wrong. Rehgar's new talent design fixes almost every issue they created with the previous rework, with talents that accentuate his basic design and kit instead of forcing him into a role he wasn't meant for. It's sad too, because it's not like there wasn't an interesting opportunity to shake up Nova. Her kit doesn't really resemble a Ghost or sniper all that much anyway. Maybe she could've gotten things like the EMP, Dominate, or Psionic Sight. Maybe her trait could've been reworked to lean more towards the sniper side, with something like a spotter mechanic. Maybe Precision Strike could've actually been replaced with a Tactical Nuke. Instead, we get another awful rework that'll probably lead to another rework in the future."

I think Blizzard was really trying to introduce some build diversity but just had a few mistakes. The pinning shot build is pretty fun in my opinion, if a little different than old Nova. Is Nova good? Not really. Is Nova the worst character to ever exist right now? I don't believe so honestly. Precision Strike, although not as good without GP, is still a global presence on an assassin with halfway decent single target damage. I think that and the ability to apply vulnerability alone is pretty good. Sure Sylvanas and a bunch of other characters have it too, but I find with the level 1 pinning shot talent that you can safely make someone vulnerable and get a One In The Chamber shot off from a pretty good distance away. I don't know, just my 2 cents. Sure she's in a rough spot right now but they won't abandon her. The player base likes her too much. Just try changing your play style a bit and staying behind terrain and using pinning shot and a OINC follow up attack, then sneaking around to a new position and doing the same thing. "

Since release of Li-Ming its starting to be kinda obvious that if things go further in similar way, specialists will be completely useless (at least those which cant do good DPS). You probably noticed that you wont meet much specialists these days in almost any game mode (TLV have free week, otherwise you wont see them probably at all). If you check HOTSlogs, you will see that specialists (and Rexxar) are kinda on bottom of popularity. Why? Well, cause every character can soak, sure not that good as Azmodan or TLV, but they can. So for soaking not really needed. And damage to buildings? Li-Ming can destroy towers without even being in range (you can on a lot of maps simply stay in bushes while destroying walls or towers). I should know, I do that a lot in early game. Plus its not only Li-Ming, well fed Butcher can later chop down towers and forts faster than Gaz even with his siege ultimate. Or we have Lunara which still can poision towers (I wonder how sick tower looks like..) and take em down really fast. And Greymane with his steroid which take down towers very fast too. This create certain problems (mostly Li-Ming but others too). **1) problem is that some characters despite they are not designed for it can cut down towers and forts very fast and very easy** **2) specialists are near useless, cause while they might be good at tower/keep elimination, they mostly are not good in enemy hero elimination, thus much less versatile than average assasin and cause for 1) are not needed or wanted** Which leads to state where most ppl play assasin, tank or healer. Usually I see only these. **How to solve this?** Separate damage into ""siege"" and ""standard"". Standard will suffer 50% damage reduction. Siege damage will be made only by specialists (any ability or auto-attack they have). And ""standard"" damage will be damage of everyone else (exept some ""siege"" specific abilities, like Tychus talented grenade or his laser, or Raynors AoE). I would probably even give Sylv her vulnerability buff back for buildings. It would most likely need some HP tunning so buildings wont be ""too tough"" but it would certainly made specs bit more wanted in game. **EDIT: Those are just ideas in general direction, only something to make ""specialists"" bit more viable and needed. Cause at this moment you really dont need them at all.** (take Li-Ming + Rehgar and win)"

Additionally, I am aware people might not like one change but might like another. Therefore, please read the proposed change log below and take the [survey](URL to pin-point which changes you like and which changes you despise. Thank you for your time. Up-votes and comments are most appreciated. [SURVEY](URL [RESULTS](URL **** **AnubArak** - Block talent added to Level 1 Talent Tree - Burrow Charge * Default Cool-Down reduced from 16 seconds to 12 seconds * Stun duration increased from 0.1 second to 0.5 second *In my opinion, AnubArak doesnt need too much to become a reveled warrior. Increasing his disruption, mobility and sturdiness should bring him up the required notch to start seeing more play* **** **Arthas** - Frozen Tempest * No longer costs 15 mana per second, instead makes Arthas take 5% more damage when Tempest is active * Cool-Down between toggles increased from 1 second to 3 seconds * Frozen Waste talent changed from reducing mana cost to reduce vulnerability (from 5% to 3%) * Hindering Cold talent added to Level 4 Talent Tree: *Enemies afflicted by Frozen Tempest slow have their dashes, blinks, jump abilities silenced (until that slow wears off).* *Arthas himself is the definition of an immobile tank. I think giving him this new flavor and niche will add diversity to the game and definitely make him a strategic pick against mobile comps* **** **Falstad** - Barrel Roll * No longer gives default shield * Level 1 Talent Updraft now also grants shield atop of the 30% increased range - Mighty Gust * Cool-Down increased from 40 to 60 * Duration of slow reverted back from 5 seconds to 3 seconds *Over the course of a few buffs, Falstad has become top-pick, top-ban material in the competitive scene. This is especially true in the European Scene. He has too much versatility at the moment. Per Developers balance log of old, Mighty Gust was over-buffed to encourage people to see its potential of Hinterland Blast. Now that we have seen it, tuning its cool-down to be in line with Thralls Earthquake and reverting the duration of the slow should bring down its power. Secondly, default shield on his barrel roll is a left-over mechanic that was deemed necessary when his second heroic was an AoE delayed Stun with some burst damage. For the amount of mobility, damage (both consistent or burst, depending on talent specs) and utility; it makes sense for Falstad to be squishier than he already is* **** **Illidan** - Attack Damage * Increase level scaling from 4% to 4.75% - Dive * Double-Edge Dive talent added to Level 16 Talent Tree: *Diving an enemy mini-stuns them for 0.1 second, but increases cool-down from 6 seconds to 8 seconds* - Evasion * Isolated Focus talent added to Level 4 Talent Tree: *Increase Evasion Duration from 2 seconds to 3 seconds* *I think Illidan is mostly seeing play due to the Rehgar over-tuning. Once that is toned down, he will vanish from the competitive scene again. There should be absolutely no reason why a non-secret weapon Falstad attack should hit so much harder than a non-sweeping strike Illidan attack. Additionally, giving him a little bit of channel disruption and potential survival adds synergy with his other evasion talents* **** **Sarah Kerrigan** - Impale * Default Stun Duration increased from 1 second to 1.25 seconds - Ultralisk * Torrasque egg duration reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds *I dont think Sarah Kerrigan needs too much of a push to see competitive play. A slight increase to the stun duration and making her pet more active at level 20 should be a step in the right direction* **** **Tychus Findlay** - Overkill * Increase base main target damage from 860 to 900 and AoE base damage from 420 to 450 over 5 seconds *Currently at level 30, Tychuss ramped up base attacks deal more damage to the target over 5 seconds (2,840) than Overkill (2,793). With percentage scaling on the higher base-damage, Tychus should become a flavorful pick for uninterrupted sustained damage* **** **Valla** - Vault * Mana Cost decreased from 75 to 25 *There is absolutely no reason why Li-Ming gets to have her blink on a shorter cool-down and absurdly low mana cost, while Valla has to expend more mana on this ability than her damaging non-heroics. Reducing the mana cost by one-third will make her starve less on mana in extended fights, which will increase the value of Repeating Arrow and Tumble Talent Trees*"

I tried to use his abilities he has in WoW as well as wove in his trait from the Hearthstone card. He's a melee assasin that can single out enemies from their team. To enable him in 1v1 as well as Aoe heavy fights, he gets his W. To compensate for his relatively strong trait, his abilities are very mana intensive, but should be highly impactful as well. ***Disclaimer*:** Obviously all numbers are fictitious and probably not realistic. Here is a link to the [heroesfire page](URL (Mobile users shouldn't use this website as there are some wierd ads running) And also in plain Text: Dagran Thaurissan was the Emperor of the Dark Iron clan, a descendant of Emperor Thaurissan and Modgud. Even as the leader of his clan, he is, like all Dark Iron dwarves, a servant of Ragnaros.Dagran currently wields the legendary hammer Ironfoe, but not by legitimate means. The hammer's hereditary owner, Reginald Windsor was captured and imprisoned by the Dark Irons, his weapon claimed by Dagran. ----- **Trait; Ironfoes' might**: Reduces the mana cost of all of your abilites by 1% every 10 seconds up to 100%. You loose all stacks upon death. (NOTE: This ability stems from his Hearthstone card) ----- **Q; Melting Boulder**: Rips a melting boulder out of the earth from behind and Smashes it on the ground in front of you. The boulder will deal 82 (+ 4% per level) damage upon creation and 209 (+ 4% per level) damage upon impact. (NOTE: If you're quick enough, you can deall all the damage to the same target) Cost: 60 mana | Cooldown: 6 seconds ----- **W; Earthen Skin**: Activate to absorb and reflect 5% of damage taken. Cost: 30 mana per second | Cooldown: 20 seconds ----- **E; Emperors Will**: Pulls the target a short distance towards your position while throwing a firebolt at them, dealing 110 (+ 4% per level) damage. Potentially has 3 Charges (max) if activated within 3 seconds of the previous use. Each subsequent use will cost 10% and then 15% more mana, based on the cost from the previous use. (NOTE: This is a short pull, maybe a third or less of Stitches' hook, using all three pulls should place your target in front of you, if they stand still) Cost: 80 mana | Cooldown: 12 seconds (if the 3 second window runs out) ----- **Ult1; Avatar of Flame**: Transform for 20 seconds. Your basic attacks will deal 10% additional damage. Enemies near you will recieve 22 damage per second and enemies attacking you will recieve 39 damage per hit. (NOTE: This is his first abilitie from WoW, its a by Ragnaros corrupted version from the Ironforges Avatars) Cost: 100 mana | Cooldown: 100 seconds ----- **Ult2; Hand of Thaurissan**: Summon a fiery hand out of the ground that grips the selected target and slows them by 80% for 5 seconds. Deals minor damage. (NOTE: This is his second WoW abilitie, there it is a 5 second stun, which is obviously way too OP. I'm not sure if the duration is too long or the slow too much either.)

Before a keep is destroyed, there are physical shields around the core and Invulnerable written above it. When a keep is destroyed, there's a shattering sound and the Core is vulnerable. On Towers of Doom, the shattering sound plays when a Fort / Keep is destroyed, even though the Core is always invulnerable. The invulnerable text and shields are removed as well. Not a big deal, just an inconsistency due to this map's peculiar mechanics."

Theres been alot of buzz for support class characters ive seen on some threads. Someone had said ""you can only have so many ideas for a healer"" I had the thought of adding - Zenyatta from Overwatch - A unique ranged support with decent AA dmg that can provide regen buffs and debuffs - using the health and discord orbs - if anyone has had the chance to play the beta maybe they can agree with me - hes very squishy but very good Trait could be something like gains X% damage reduction for every minute zenyatta remains alive - max 50% Working with some more micromanagement than most other supports , he can place regen orbs on his teammates from across the map and a discord debuff orb for enemies - maybe one that decreases move speed or attak dmg or drains mana/health or gives 10% vulnerability to enemies Ult transendance can be used sort of like malf or lili AOE however instead of providing healing maybe make it provide a 20% redux of incoming enemy damage for everyone in the aura for 4 seconds while providing a 20% movement speed buff Just an idea sorry im on my phone - lets get some other ideas going! The way the orb works - lets say you're laning mid and you notice your teammate top lane fighting or about to clear a wave.. Press q click on your teammate top lane use the regen orb and pop it on your teammate - he gets an extra x% HP+Mana/Sec regen bonus for as long as the orb remains on him - press w hit your opponent top lane with the debuff orb which also remains on the target until changed - you can change targets of the orbs with a .5 sec CD if you notice your teammates in other lanes who need assistance He would feel more of a higher skill cap support hero that would require more of a ""piano uther"" type of feel And just ideas im throwing out there - Can talent into a burst heal/dmg on orb grant; multi orb (have 2/3 orbs of each out at one time) / resistance aura/ de-generate aura - "

Aside from really low numbers in siege and hero damage (I'll often outdamage these kind of Kharazims just playing as a serpent build Li Li), it doesn't feel like support to me. Instead, I think Kharazim's damage style would be better suited if he inflicted a vulnerability status similar to Tyrande's Hunter's Mark instead of dealing raw damage. Obviously the duration should be significantly lower as to not outshine Tyrande, but if he was continuously punching somebody with that, his allies could synergize with him better as well. Honestly, something like 1 to 1.5 seconds of vulnerability per punch. Yeah I know that posting that here is rather fruitless, but I wanted to get some input on that idea. I also think that his mana style should restore a tiny percent of mana to all of his allies in the AoE, but that's another thing all together c(:"
211,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Scrub's Guide to Playing a Better Nova,4,3zok4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3zok4p/scrubs_guide_to_playing_a_better_nova/,2016-01-06 17:17:30,"Hi, I'm a 3k mmr Nova player who gets match made around 3.2k because I usually duo Q. Over the last 30 days, I have maintained a 77%+ win rate on Nova in rank 1 games against other players who are diamond and higher (out of 31 games). My life time win rate with Nova in Hero League is 63%. I hesitate to call this a guide because I don't believe I can definitively say what is the best way to play the champion or even the game. Hopefully however, my perspective on the champion will add something even for players better than me. **Nova's Kit** * Auto Attack: Nova's auto attack is as powerful as any other champions and arguably more powerful. Anti tank shells means that you only need to be in auto range once every like two seconds to get max auto attack dps. Take advantage of this and poke in and out with your autos. They add up over the course of a fight. Nova has the same auto attack range as Raynor so you can often get free harass in without the other person being able to respond. * Q: Snipe. Hit this on people. Don't be afraid to use it as a poking tool or to help your allies get lane advantage early. Its not just for kills. If something doesn't need to be sniped, don't use it. Nova becomes much less threatening once her snipe is on cool down and you need to maximize the damage it does. Overkilling a squishy with snipe when an auto attack or a team mate had the kill means you'll lack damage to pressure their other squishies. * W: It slows. Use it to set up your Q, peel for your team, and initiate ganks, to set up for other skill shots from team mates. * E: Two of the most obvious uses on E are using it for vision and for confusion, to cover a get away. Occassionally it'll be useful for you to walk randomly, to pretend you're a clone, when revealed in hopes of them choosing the wrong one. However I prefer to avoid those situations in the first place. More importantly, clone blocks skill shots. You can use it to catch things like a KT gravity lapse and save your team mates. After Holo Clone Damage, the clone can also be used to delay enemy rotations while you remain in stealth. Often if the team is doing a boss, I'll throw a clone down in a nearby choke to dismount their tanks and delay potential engage while we finish the boss. If you take crippling shot, your clone will use it on something close to it. You can place it on top of someone such as their tank, who's engaging, as a second source of vulnerability, while you take your actual crippling shot into their backline. Knowing how to make use of all of clone's functionalities is critical in providing your team with utility. * Triple Tap: I like this ultimate on Towers of Doom, the map is large, buildings are out of the way, and people are often by themselves capping or clearing a wave. Triple tap has utility against certain squishy divers such as Illidan where you triple tap them as they're diving in. It allows you to 1v1 an Illidan in some situations where you normally never could. Triple tap can also be effective as a pressure tool against 4 squishes + 1 tank compositions. * For everything else, or if you have a sweet aoe combo team going on, take Precision Strike. **Nova's Roles** *General* 1. Always be mounted when possible. Staying mobile, pressuring the map early and circling team fights later for zone pressure is a huge part of Nova's utility. 2. Remember, people can still see you when you're invisible. 3. Don't ever show yourself when its not necessary. 4. Your invisibility prevents you from appearing on the mini map. Use this to rotate aggressively, cut off rotations, or pretend to be a sentry ward as people walk by you. 5. Check sketchy bushes or vents with a clone, not your face. *Early Game* 1. Gank Squad: Run around with a CC/damage source and gank lanes. When gank squading, if you arrive before the rest of the squad, get in a position to body block. People often don't realize there's something invisible in their way at first and you add an extra half second cc to the gank. 2. Poke: If your team can't support a gank squad, just roam around the lanes and poke people out of lane to help your team get an experience advantage. In these types of teams, you're a poker with a nuke. Don't save your snipe to get kills early. When poking rotate between the lanes where their healer isn't, so the damage sticks. 3. Walking Ward: Track enemy rotations between lanes and ping appropriately 4. Build up GP stacks. No reason to ever die here. Wait for a good opportunity to snipe, whether its waiting for someone to be out position, for cool downs to be blown, or for someone to be low enough that they can't fight back. *Middle Game* 1. Poke out enemies walking toward objectives. High priority targets include Morales and Tyrande who are relatively inefficient at self healing. In full out team fights, you're half a champion so your job before these fights start is to bring the other team down to your level. 2. Providing vision and getting pick offs on enemies rotating for soak continue to be very important 3. Use your clone to delay enemy rotations. 4. Help your team with objectives. You aren't a special butterfly. Although you attack slowly, you still output a lot of DPS and not helping your team with a Boss can sometimes mean the enemy team gets there in time to contest it. *Team Fights* 1. Combat sniping. Once the fighting starts you have to position in a way that you can follow up on your team's damage. Often this will be from the side, to hit them when they're weaving out of the fight, or occasionally, to the back. You usually don't want to be in the back though because then its too easy for them to just turn around and wreck you while you're between their team and their buildings. Being on the side gives you more options to escape and if they want to spend their time chasing you, they're more than welcome. Sometimes, however, you'll have to snipe them from the front, through their tank line. Landing those snipes to finish off kills can turn fights. 2. Getting chased. Snipe has a 10 second cool down. Once you blow your load, if they want to chase you around, that's fantastic. Few things are less useful than Nova with no snipe. If they want to trade a perfectly good Sonya for you after you've already taken someone out of their fight, that's amazing. 3. Zoning. Find a good angle to threaten their squishies, out of range of their poke and their bruisers. Make them afraid to walk up to do damage, to blow important cool downs, because the moment they do, you'll rip their faces off. You don't have to do anything, just hang out with your snipe up. At 15 stacks of GP, I've made Raynors spend half a team fight pacing back and forth, afraid to stand still to auto in case I one shot them. 4. Not getting chased. Make sure to weave in and out and get off your anti-tank autos until someone starts chasing you. *Late Game* 1. Be able to combo with rewind - if you do your double snipe properly, you can one shot Raynor through his E. KT and Jaina can usually be killed through their active defenses if you land both snipes as well as your ultimate, or in Jaina's case, at least one snipe. 2. Don't be afraid to trade yourself for one of their late game carries. 3. Roam conservatively. You want to pick off their idiot, not be the idiot who gets picked off. **Gathering Power** Gathering Power is a big part of Nova's threat and most of her utility comes from her ability to influence how the enemy back line plays. With GP, she can 100-0 and is very hard for squishies to duel. Without it, the situation completely changes and you lose not only damage, but also utility. It's almost never worth it to trade yourself 1 for 1 with somebody, except going into the late game, where it can be worth it to take down a late game scaling monster, or after you have Rewind for double snipe. Having double snipe makes you much less reliant on GP providing you can hit both snipes. **The Case for Crippling Shot*** I've been using Crippling Shot over the Triple Decoy and I don't have enough experience with Triple Decoy to write a comparison article. The decoy talent may in fact be better (its more popular too!) but I can explain at least why I enjoy and have had success with crippling shot. 1. More precise application of damage from a range. Unlike the holo decoy talent, which can some times misfire on people or things other than your intended target, crippling shot will help you get your picks with maximum burst damage not requiring you to walk on top of them (so both clones will focus the correct target). 2. Helps you peel for your backline. Sometimes your carries are better than theirs and their tanks aren't that tanky. In today's hero league that basically translates into your team has Raynor and their team has a Diablo. If you full combo Diablo with vulnerability while Raynor whales on him with Giant Killer and someone tosses any kind of CC on Diablo, Diablo explodes and Raynor is now free to wreck everything. **Nova in Champion Select** Nova likes to be paired with other high burst champions, preferably mages, who can also poke. Often a full rotation from a mage early to mid game will leave one or more people at half health, where they can proceed to weave in and out of the fight. With Nova on their flanks, they have to leave or risk getting picked off with a snipe, giving Nova a lot of kill and zone pressure, often on priority targets. She matches up well against top meta picks including Diablo, Jaina, KT, and Tyrande. First picking Nova is sort of risky but not as risky as its often made out to be. She can be countered but the heroes I find to counter her will often require coordination that HL doesn't have, a non-meta team comp that not everyone knows how to play, or can be played around. At the worst you'll have to accept that you won't be effective as usual and play differently so as to remain a contributing member of the team. News to no one, Nova is happy to see squishy targets and especially the three pack chicken nuggets, TLV. *Mildly Annoying* * Tassadar: often forces a double support comp from the rest of his team, which can be exploited by heavy burst which is currently popular in hero league. If he's the only support, Nova can just poke his team since he can't heal. If Tassadar is on point with his Oracle, he can make it hard for Nova to flank, but he needs to be backed up by a credible threat to punish Nova when she's seen. Otherwise, you just ignore him * Illidan: Often makes a career of jumping on Nova. You can, in certain situations, take triple tap to punish a diving Illidan. Its very hard for Illidan to stay in the fight after eating an entire triple tap, even through evasion. Triple tap also makes it possible for Nova to 1v1 Illidan. There are very few good Tassadars or Illidans in HL and both picks will warp team comps. These are two weaknesses that the heroes I hate playing against as Nova don't have. *Very Annoying* * Tyrael: He can counter Nova's damage with Santification and get on her face with Judgment. There's no kiting a Tyrael as Nova, you can't dodge his gap closer (Sonya) and or block his cc (Muradin) and the effective range of his Q+E is very hard to play around. He can easily punish a flanking Nova once she's revealed. * Abathur: Abathur building mines can shut down Nova's roaming and flanking game by mining up choke points. At the same time, his clone will often be worth more than Nova in a team fight. Nova also does not counter Abathur if Abathur is careful. There is a misconception that Nova is a good candidate to snipe a body soaking Abathur. In reality, if Abathur mines the paths leading toward his position, Nova will be spotted enroute and either die to Abathur's team or waste her time while Abathur burrows away. * Cho'Gall: You can't threaten or zone Cho'Gall while he can chase you down, one shot you with his ult. Against Cho'Gall, you're limited to harassing the rest of his team, which can often be difficult if they've picked well. If you can pick off one of his team mates though, you can leave Cho'Gall stranded in the middle of your team with very little support. *Theoretically Annoying* * Against Nova, I personally like playing Utility Falstad (where you talent stuff like First Aid and shield on lightning strike; 60% win rate over 20 games). Falstad with Gust goes above Nova by doing something even more powerful or impactful. Nova's trying to get picks on individuals. Falstad can save these individuals and prevent follow up engage if Nova gets a pick. On the other hand, Falstad is also great a getting pick offs, especially on low mobility, squishy champions like Nova, starting team fights which Nova doesn't excel at, and even 1v1ing Nova once he has both first aid and shield on lightning strike (you must dodge either snipe or her ultimate).

I think with a lower cooldown (it's currently 60s) this talent could be rather useful in the stun-fest we have going on at present.

While we're on the topic, I'd like to see more heroes have access to an Unstoppable-granting talent (i.e. Iron Skin, Will of the Forsaken; talents that you activate to become Unstoppable for a few seconds with the express purpose of countering/avoiding stuns) rather than just abilities that make you unstoppable for their duration (things like Wraith Walk, March of the Black King, Dwarf Toss, etc.) It might do something to counter the stun-heavy meta going on right now. Thoughts? Feelings? Confessions? P.S. I've literally never taken anything but Cold Embrace. Maybe Will of the Forsaken would be better at lvl 13."

I originally wanted to write a reddit post about this myself, but as I was writing it, I realize I was being somewhat emotional in my wording, so I wanted to take a short break beforehand to collect my thoughts, but here's some of what I wanted to say in there. &amp;nbsp; I personally view the current Tyrande meta as a failure of communication between players and developers. Players could've voiced their concerns stronger, and devs could've made more efforts to hear us out. Yes we spoke, yes they listened, but not even close to the level of communication that was needed for this mess. &amp;nbsp; The issue is, Hero League is simply unenjoyable to play in the current state, largely due to the imbalance that Tyrande alone brings to the table. The simple fact is, she ""completes"" auto-win team comps at a % chance that should NOT be allowed in a team-oriented game. &amp;nbsp; Simple steps to win every single game of Hero League : * **pick** Tyrande * **pick 3 from** Diablo, Kt, Raynor, Muradin, Zagara * **pick one** Nova, Thrall, Tassadar, Sonya &amp;nbsp; Congratulations, you just won the game. Now enjoy every minute of the completely predictable gameplay that follows! Cause if you don't, you will really hate your life when you are inevitably placed on the opposite side. &amp;nbsp; At low MMR, this is much less of a problem since players there vaguely understands what wins and what doesn't. At a level where people do, this is all Hero League is. Completely un-fun, absolutely soul-crushing when you are on the receiving end of it multiple games in a row, utterly imbalanced to a point where wins don't feel rewarding at all. They just feel like cheap compensation for the brutal beating you get from the perfect tyrande comp you will inevitably face. This is the reason why the current Hero League is so loathed among mid-high level players. &amp;nbsp; To add salt to the injury, the current Hero League design makes it so that there's absolutely no incentive to play at rank 1, except to play the game for the fun of playing the game at a more competitive environment, and the current meta completely strips of that fun factor. This is why so many people are taking a break from this game, this is why so many people are resorting to playing SEL, this is why so many people are getting salty to no end in public forums. All this amounts to the stagnation of the growth of a fantastic game that could be more, but very questionably so. &amp;nbsp; Another huge issue with the current ladder system, is that it provides no real indications of skill beyond a certain rank. Poor design of this system allows for some low-mid level players to be placed in the exact same bracket as high level players, sometimes even surpassing since regardless of your MMR, you can still drop ranks once you break a certain number of losing streaks. The discrepancy in skills here, would sometimes be comparable to putting challengers and plats into the same division in LoL. And let's not even get started on the matchmaking system putting the top 1% and the bottom 1% into the same game, because yes, it happens. On top of all this, this flaw in ladder system places false sense of entitlement in these low-mid level players, hell even the flat out low rank players, to a point where they are literally trying to teach the players who are 2k+mmr above them. Even if we were to completely drop our ego and ignore their comments, it still makes it hard to communicate strategy to these people resulting in an unpleasent playing environment and uneven fields in case the other team does not suffer from the same issue. Hero League can be extremely frustrating for all the wrong reasons. &amp;nbsp; Getting back on Tyrande meta, I think it is very natural for us to run into patches that end up in a complete mess. The main issue here is the pace of which the countermeasures take place. At this rate, I'll be taking a family photo with my grandson when bans are implemented. Which by the way, should really be here to, * Potentially diversify the team comps, * Promote team communication at the draft screen, * Provide a temporary countermeasure to future Tyrande-like catastrophes. &amp;nbsp; Another thing that I really want to mention to the people being involved in the balance discussions including the devs, is to NOT look at the stats of low level games as reliable data when it comes to balancing. Low level for this game would probably be around 70~80% of the playerbase, maybe even more, given that the game is relatively new and it is largely comprised of casual players. Way too many people still lack the basic understanding of the game without the proper tools or motivation to get better. Why disregard stats from low level games? Because in low level games, * There are many heroes with the basic skill requirement that cannot be met by low level players, * Low level players do not understand talent values and talent optimization at a basic level; skews data, * Low level players do not understand timings on teamfight / objective; skews data by games not getting into proper phases (aggressive phase, passive phase, stall phase, objective phase, soak phase etc), * Low level players do not meet the required mechanical skill level to use the very basic movement-related maneuvers in teamfights; skews data on skillshots, favors raw stats such as stationary DPS (how much dmg you put out by standing still and auto attacking in an average teamfight scenario, literally what happens most of these games). &amp;nbsp; Balancing the game around these players would be completely pointless, most of DotA/LoL balances revolve around tournament showings and top level ranked games for this very specific reason. Yet, I see way too much mention of general stats taken from the entire playerbase of HotS, instead of using more reliable data gathered from high level games + tournaments and opinions of active competitive players. We also have an issue here when a community based third party website with replays manually uploaded is our best chance at ""reliable data"", but let's not get into that right now. &amp;nbsp; I am merely stating what I believe to be the underlying problems in this game instead of simply throwing out my version of a solution, I'm looking for a stronger immune system, not a cough syrup. &amp;nbsp; If I were to concoct my syrup though, I would suggest leaving the stun mechanics as they are, but changing, * Tyrande - the right combination of higher CD on mark (and/or higher CD on level 1 talent for the mark) and lower dmg % amplifier (will have to be a new mechanic from vulnerability, like ""lesser vulnerability""). *EDIT* Forgot to mention her Shadowstalk ultimate, which also needs a tweak in the form of increased CD * Diablo - Either lower his damage on W and/or lower his tankiness to lessen his effectiveness of late-game revives * Raynor - Lower base attack damage and/or attack damage per level * Kaelthas - Lower damage of his W when its spread or change how verdent sphere works on his W (example : instead of giving it a 0 CD, give it 1 or 2 sec CD) &amp;nbsp; These are the 4 heroes I believe to be the most urgent changes we need, keep in mind that KT is more of a sleeper compared to the other 3, the only reason for his relatively less OP nature is due to the fact that he can actually get countered way harder than the rest. &amp;nbsp; I love Heroes of the Storm and the people involved in making it, and when I say the people involved, I mean both the devs and the community, because I firmly believe a truely great game is not made solely by the devs, but with the help and involvement from the community who sincerely care for the game. So please, bring changes and bring them when we are still playing this game! &amp;nbsp; "

More I play HOTS, the more I understand the value of true support. Seems obvious, but as I wasn't playing any MOBA before (yeah, i'm 29 and haven't played Dota, I exist) Currently we see some equation between Healer and Support in HOTS, except Tassadar, who is not directly connected to healing abilities. And I understood that I lack supports that have some othere utility, not only healing. My examples and vision below: 1) Edrick the Pure, cleaner, character that has ""Cleanse shield for 3 sec"" as one of abilities which would be highly valuable currently in Tyrande+Diablo meta, second skill - some AoE damage, 3rd skill - vision, Heroics - Area Cleanse shield and AoE vulnerability 2) Saboteur, silences and damage - character that would have single target silence as one of the skill, silencing opponent for 2 sec, Heroics - mass silence 3) Motivator, character that could be ""battle momentum guy"", whose abilities would reduce CD of teammates abilities 4) Mana Demon, Gul'dan?, character that could drain opponents mana (oh yeah, this could allow Karazim to be built in AoE mana trait :P) My personal belief is that Hots will greatly benefit with those ""non-healing"" supports, that will allow more strategies and team composition. That cleanse-support guy could lead to not nerfing Tyrande, which is good, because i think that more OP characters is better than no OP characters. Thank you for attention "

I feel like the Cocktail talents in that tier are pretty useless and as for the other inner beast talent I feel like I just wasn't getting much value out of it. Level 4: I take Thick Skin because I feel its pretty much essential, especially this week with hammers and butchers everywhere and although I can see Eyes in the Dark having some uses as a skilled player you shouldn't need stealth as well disengage effectively. Level 7: I feel Incendiary Elixir is pretty much essential on this tier because it allows you to provide quite heavy long range poke and allows you to use it to scout bushes and stuff as well and even if you do miss your target by a bit because it still explodes it will hit them. This tier in general is actually one of the strongest tiers I've ever seen in a hero though and you could probably make a case for all the talents but imo Wizened Duellist isn't worth as much simply because as a melee hero your chances of being caught out and dying are higher and with Quicksilver Bullets having the increased range is nice but you aren't a solely range hero and in most cases you actually want to be closer so that you can jump in for the kill (with btw is soooo satisfying). Level 10: Honestly i'm too sure on this tier but I think Go for the Throat is a better ability in general because there are other heroes that get vulnerability as non-heroics and Go for the Throat can give you more mobility and Burst jump on a target. Level 13: This is probably one of the most well designed and balanced tier I've ever seen on a hero and I think it really comes down to a personal choice but for me I go with Unfettered Assault because the increased range allows you actually travel through a hero and body block them and the mobility and escape it can provide you is actually insane. Level 16: I normally just stick with Alpha Killer but I can definitely see how Relentless Predator could come in use and I have yet to try out Concentrated Blast Level 20: I'm honestly very surprised to admit that this is probably one of the weakest tiers he has, I really feel like none of the talents here provide the power boost you would expect from level 20 and in general they all feel kind of underwhelming and situational but Unleashed and Tooth and Claw are usually the ones I stick with."

At level 20 you can upgrade for piercing, but you want splash/cleave on your AAs, and compare to Sylvy's W which is an AoE vulnerability right from level 16, is not a skillshot, does more damage (I think?) on a low CD. The leaping function isn't much of a saving grace because at that point just take Go for the Throat. I feel it could go for a lower cooldown."

218,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Tyrande Discussion: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Potential Changes",0,40zget,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/40zget/tyrande_discussion_strengths_weaknesses_and/,2016-01-15 07:29:48,"We have known this is coming for a while. DB has confirmed on several occasions that the balance team is looking to make some changes Tyrande, and now we have official confirmation that Blizzard considered her ""overpowered."" I expect we will see some flat nerfs instead of the give-and-take adjustments that Blizzard has been trending towards more recently. I want to start this thread to discuss what exactly makes Tyrande so strong, and what changes we might expect to be implemented in the next balance patch. _____ **STRENGTHS** _____ * **Vulnerability (Hunter's Mark)** This is the most impactful tool in Tyrande's kit. Hunter's Mark applies four seconds of 25% vulnerability on a relatively low cooldown. This allows Tyrande to designate a target in a teamfight that dies near instantly if focused. After the scaling changes, the burst damage is stronger than ever, arguably turning Hunter's Mark into the strongest ability in the game. * **Lockdown (Lunar Flare)** Lunar Flare is one of the more difficult skill shots to land, but that hardly matters in a metagame where stuns are so prevalent. Tyrande turns any form of CC used by your team into a chain stun. Combining Lunar Flare's high damage, one second stun, and potential Hunter's Mark followup lets Tyrande burst squishies and chunk tanks. With the Lunar Blaze talent at 7 no one is safe. * **Healing (Light of Elune, Shadow Stalk, Overflowing Light)** Tyrande's healing is mediocre. At any other point in the lifecycle of Heroes of the Storm, Tyrande's current healing would be labeled as dispersed and ultimately non-impactful in teamfights. Fortunately for Tyrande (and unfortunate for the enemy team) healing is of diminishing importance in the current metagame. No amount of healing will sustain a hero through properly executed enemy focus. While Tyrande's healing is outclasses by every other support except Tassadar by a significant margin, that healing is still sufficient to meet the minimum required healing in a competitive composition. Right now teamfights are won by bursting down a single kill target and taking a decisive lead. Tyrande does this better than any other healer in the game. All that Tyrande needs to do is heal through moderate poke damage as your team cleans ups. * **Vision (Sentinel)** Not much to say here but Tyrande can gives vision and does it well. Sentinel allows Tyrande to globally scout any location every 18 seconds, and unlike Zagara there is no way to counter or eliminate Tyrande's ability to scout. I would say she is tied with or just barely below Zagara in terms of vision advantage. The only thing Tyrande lacks is a reliable reveal (though she has a unreliable one). * **Utility** Mule, Battle Momentum, cloak, AoE slow, Shrink Ray, Movement Speed, Rewind, Storm Shield. Tyrande has it all. The only thing Tyrande lacks is cleanse, and as her team is often the aggressors that is off less importance. Tyrande and Uther could do a piano duet. * **Versatility (talent tree)** Stun, Mark, and focus, occasionally scout, is the core of Tyrande's kit, but it does not end there. At every talent tier Tyrande has the ability to chose between healing, damage, and utility depending on what your team needs. Tyrande has synergy with literally every competitive composition, and because none of her would-be counters has as much talent diversity she can circumvent counterpicks. _____ **WEAKNESSES** _____ * **Lack of Mobility** Tyrande lacks any escapes unless you pick up Sprint at level 13. This is a viable choice, though often skipped over in favor of Overflowing Light or Shrink Ray. This disadvantage is somewhat mitigated by Tyrandes range. It is difficult to reach Tyrande if she backlines properly. * **Low Health** Again, this is less important because it is difficult to reach Tyrande. However, if you manage to catch her she will melt. Tyrande cannot afford to ever be focused in a teamfight. Players often forget this and draft too many squishy DPS and not enough frontline heroes. This may lead to disaster if the enemy team draft a solid dive composition. * **Poor Healing** I mentioned this under Tyrandes advantages, but it is only helpful in this specific meta. In a sustain metagame Tyrande's healing would be insufficient . Double tank compositions can take advantage of this if they can avoid having a hero bursted down within the first phase of a teamfight. _____ **DIRECT NERFS** _____ * **Hunters Mark vulnerability** 25% increased damage has insane synergy with burst and stunlock compositions. The scaling changes shifted the metagame from sustain to burst, making Hunters Mark an incredibly valuable ability. A straight nerf to the increased damage would decrease Tyrandes lethality. Ive seen both 20% and 15% figures thrown around. This would preserve Tyrandes core playstle, though many players dislike straight nerfs. * **Hunters Mark cooldown** Currently Hunters Mark comes up two or three times per teamfight baseline. With the level one talent its cooldown lines up almost perfectly with Lunar Flare. This is absurdly powerful. Removing the cooldown talent or moving it to a higher tier would hurt Tyrandes teamfight. Alternatively, increasing the base cooldown to 20 or 30 seconds would do much the same. However this would do nothing to Tyrandes gank potential, as only a single Mark is needed if you are caught out. *Lord Dibbles the Terrifying would like to remind everyone that taking two steps outside your towers is overextending, and you should be punished.* * **Remove Hunters Mark** It is possible that Blizzard made a mistake in giving a hero vulnerability skill at level one. Outright replacing Tyrandes trait would be drastic, and to seriously harm Tyrandes viability if made alongside other nerfs. One possible replacement talent Ive seen proposed is Trueshot Aura. Make it her trait and reduce to ~10% AA damage. Hunters Mark may or may not be preserved as a level 16 talent. * **Reduction in Lunar Flare stun duration** One second is a relatively long stun. Reducing that to 0.5 seconds would preserve Lunar Flares use as ranged disruption, while shortening the window for chain stuns. * **Damage Reduction (across the board)** Tyrande has high damage on her auto attacks and Lunar Flare, as well as moderate damage on her Sentinel skillshot. Combined with talents often found on assassins, Tyrande is able to keep pace with most ranged DPS in terms of single target damage. Tyrande has a niche as the assassin support. Reducing her damage would certainly hurt her win rate, but it would also sacrifice this niche. * **Healing reduction** Lastly, we come to the elephant in the room. Many players will disagree with me having called Tyrandes healing poor, citing the buff to Shadow Stalk as the point at which Tyrande rose in power. This is not true, Tyrande was already a priority pick in competitive play before the buff, and had a high win rate at high MMR. The buff to Tyrandes healing merely solidified this at low to moderate MMR, and allowed her to solo support. If Tyrandes healing were nerfed, at best we would see a reversion to double support compositions. These are commonly run in competitive games in which Tyrande is not banned. In such cases Tyrande is still first pick and the burst strategy does not change. A nerf to Tyrandes healing is unlikely to bring her win rate in line. _____ **INDIRECT NERFS** _____ * **Cleanse Buff** Cleanse used to give two seconds of unstoppable. This let supports pre-cleanse incoming or predicted crowd control. Currently cleanse grants exactly three frames of unstoppable, and a relentless effect thereafter. If a target is caught out, that relentless is often insufficient to save a target from follow-up stuns. Giving cleanse 0.5 seconds of unstoppable, followed by 1.5 seconds of relentless would allow supports to preempt crowd control and/or give focus targets a small window to use their escape tools. This makes Tyrandes chain stun less reliable. The cooldown timer on cleanse would likely need to be increased if this change goes through. * **Diminishing returns on stuns** Chain stuns are straight up less effective. This a nerf at the metagame in general. * **Buffs to dive heroes** Heroes such as Anubbarak and Illidan are weak in this metagame. If they had more sustain/mitigation, Tyrandes lack of mobility would become a much more serious problem. The loss of focus attack on Zeratul and nerfs to Tyraels Judgement also removed two potential counters to Tyrande. There are other potential answers, I am just listing a few. * **Altered health and damage scaling** The scaling changes made tanks tankier and assassins do more DPS in the early game. The problem was that these changes benefited assassins more than they did tanks. If the balance was changed slightly more in favor of health/sustain, Tyrande would suffer a loss in effective lethality. _____ **CONCLUSION** ____ Tyrande is overpowered and a nerf is in the works. I have presented a brief overview of what I think are Tyrandes relative strengths and weaknesses, and what changes might be effective. I do not expect any particular change to be implemented; I am merely bringing up some changes that I think we may see in the next patch. What changes do you think Blizzard is considering? How do you think Tyrande will be played a month from now?"

Ive had some free time to actually crunch some numbers and hopefully put this myth to bed. Lets say Greymane is lvl 20 and has Inner Beast active throughout this engagement. The engagement will last 5 seconds - the duration of the vulnerability introduced by the mark for the kill. Ive chosen Incendiary Elixir at lvl 7 for this, since Wizened Duelist is always variable. Ive chosen Concentrated Blast at 16, since alpha killer is also variable per target. 1 auto-attack / 0.75 sec (with IB active). This allows 6 aas in a 5 sec window. ---------- In the **Marked for the Kill** situation, Greymane will mark the target (begin 5 sec countdown), throw his cocktail, immediately leap, auto-attack, swipe, auto-attack X4, swipe, auto-attack (this will last roughly 5 seconds) (In these calculations, Ive got the baseline dmg multiplied by 1.8 for a lvl 20 hero. Each baseline value is +4% per level. Im not sure if this is additive or multiplitive - if theres any major flaws here, Im guessing I would have made it here. Again, I cant test this for myself right now. EDIT: I also am not sure if heroesfire is showing aa dmg in human or worgen form. I'll assume it's human and I've adjusted aa for 40% more dmg.) MftK = 70.72 x 1.8 = **127.3** Cocktail = ((71.47 x 1.8 ) x 3 ) x 1.8 = 694.69 x 1.25 = **889.2** Leap = 45.76 x 1.8 = 82.37 x 1.25 = **102.96** AAs = 302.37 x 1.4 x 6 = 2539.9 x 1.25 = **3174.88** Swipes = 165.36 x 1.8 x 2 = 595.3 x 1.25 = **744.13** **Total = 5038.47 dmg** ---------- In the **Go for the Throat** situation, Greymane will throw his cocktail, immediately Go for the Throat, auto-attack, swipe, auto-attack X4, swipe, auto-attack (this will last roughly 5 seconds) Cocktail = **694.69** GftT = 390 x 1.8 = **702** AAs = **2539.9** Swipes = **595.3** **Total = 4531.89 dmg** ---------- Everything Ive read states that MftK is not even comparable to GftT, but as you can see, the vulnerability you give to the target actually boosts your own damage past the damage that choosing GftT does. Keep in mind this also boosts damage from ALL other sources. This definitely justifies some credit as a decent talent pick. Now, Im not saying, by showing these numbers that MftK is better; I understand that these heroics are both used in different situations (engage vs closing). MftK is quite easy to miss, giving you no heroic for 1 min., but lets at least discuss this and give MftK another chance. Stats here: URL **TL;DR:** MftK isn't as bad as you think. I'll definitely be using it more."

I think GFTT is more for Worgen oriented builds, whereas here, I am going to make the argument that MRTK is a better ult for cocktail build. The build in question is Wolfheart(or Viciousness) Draught Overflow Incendiary Elixir( or Quicksilver Bullets) Marked For The Kill On The Prowl Concentrated Blast level 20 ult is Blunderbuss if you took Quicksilver Bullets and flexible if not. At level 20, Cocktail with Inner Beast with Vulnerability debuff from MFTK does 1100 damage. I wanted to find a build where I could work this into a combo, and then MFTK really provided an opportunity to make this work. The combo - Start in Human form. E-&gt; W-&gt; Q-&gt; R -&gt; Q -&gt; R -&gt; Q What's happening in this combo is, you dive into a worgen form, doing AA and Q swipe, then land the bullet, which forces you back into human form without incurring disengage CD, now you can Cocktail for 1100 damage, then press R again for worgen form for Q+AA damage. The frustration I've been feeling about playing worgen oriented builds with Relentless Predator and On the Prowl and Go For The Throat really had Greymane dive and be forced to dive even further. This build allows you to use MFTK on tanks, so you can do a full combo during 5 sec vulnerability window that includes a huge cocktail damage(to the tank who presumably is in front of his team and allowing full splash to hit the backline). &lt;b&gt;TLDR&lt;/b&gt; Mark For the Kill forces graymane into human form despite having shapeshifted for a combo, after which you can weave a huge cocktail blast.

221,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Tyrande - suggestion on fix,0,41lcbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/41lcbk/tyrande_suggestion_on_fix/,2016-01-19 09:12:39,"Change trait: Hunter's mark - Places a mark on a target, revealing it and causing basic attacks against marked enemy to heal the attacker for 2.5% of maximum health (cannot be used on structures) New Level 16 talent: Marked for Destruction - Hunter's mark also applies vulnerable, and can be used on structures. Marked structures do not provide healing. Simple enough once someone mentioned something along these lines in Discord yesterday. Tyrande's problems were that she had a short cooldown vulnerability at level 1, and that she lacked healing as a support. Switching the effects of her trait with her level 16 talent, Mark of Mending could fix both at once. Healing from her trait would vary from hero to hero, and require attacking marked targets, but would not be much different than Tassadar's Leeching Plasma level 4 talent or Kharazim with Transcendance, and would have good synergy with both still. Moving her vulnerability to 16 like most others are helps with the burst combos currently allowing her team to win before the opponent can effectively fight back, but since it would be a talent at 16 should also help end the game, so making structures vulnerable but lack healing felt appropriate. The current choice at 16 is lackluster, at least I find it so. But with a choice between increasing attack damage with Trueshot Aura or making Hunter's Mark apply vulnerability, I would not always pick one over the other, but instead choose based on my team composition instead."

Ive seen a lot of concerns about the number of stuns and CC effects in HotS, and Im inclined to agree. I feel like too many games revolve around taking multiple heroes with stuns, and too many heroes are completely shut down by it (and unplayable as a result). I wanted to create a support concept which was designed more around preventing this kind of composition than raw healing numbers. I know some people dont like hero concepts being posted here, but I hope Ive put enough thought and effort into this to make it fit into the sub. Blizzard has done a great job so far of making heroes fit with their fantasy, so I carefully considered which hero would fit this design best. I settled on [Auriel](URL from the Diablo franchise, as she is essentially all about providing hope for allies, which I thought fit quite well the concept of preventing a hero from being suppressed. She gives her allies the determination to overcome it, if you will. **OVERVIEW (TL:DR):** This concept is designed as a counter-pick to the CC heavy meta, as well as a potential melee assassin enabler. She has a dedicated anti-CC ability on W, along with a passive aura which provides CC resistance. Her talents are designed to be quite flexible and adaptable to your opponents composition. She has decent health and damage, but middling healing and poor self-sustain. This can be mitigated a bit with talents, but doing so will cost a great deal of utility. Her heroics consist of a powerful anti-engage and a powerful accelerating aura, with your choice depending on whether your team finds itself to be the aggressor or defender in fights. She is designed to empower allies simply by being present at fights. **LORE:** Auriel is the Archangel of Hope and a member of the Angiris Council. The most beloved of all angels, it is she who leads the sweet chorus of the High Heavens Wiki page [here]( URL Auriels usual combat weapon is a Almaiesh, The Cord of Hope. It is a cord which can be used as a long whip in combat, while also being capable of healing and supporting allies. She is also known to use a sword and, despite her role of providing hope and clarity to her allies, she is not afraid of violence and battle when it is necessary. **BASIC STATS:** (NOTE: I may easily have screwed up these numbers as Im not entirely used to the stat overhaul just yet. Lvl 1 values are listed) Health: 1,920 (Ranged) Attack Speed: 1 (Ranged) Attack Damage: 76 Standard numbers for health regen, movement speed, mana and mana regen. Mount as standard. **ABILITIES:** (Again, numbers for lvl1, +4% per level. Dont read too much into numbers  theyre mostly ballpark as obviously I cant playtest this) **D:** Beacon of Hope All other nearby allies have the duration of stuns, polymorph, silence, root and slow effects reduced by 25% **Q:** Touch of Almaiesh Mana: 50 Cooldown: 6 seconds. Attach Auriels whip to another ally or enemy. Heal ally by 380 over 3 seconds or damage enemy by 380 over 3 seconds. 2 charges **W:** Resolve Mana: 65 Cooldown: ~~12~~ 18 seconds. Apply buff to target other ally. If the ally has a stun or polymorph effect inflicted upon them over the next 3 seconds, it is instead applied to the enemy which used it and Resolve ends. No effect on displacement abilities. **E:** Dissipate Mana: 65 Cooldown: 12 seconds. Auriel swipes an area in front of her with AlMeish. Enemies in the area take 111 damage and are displaced backwards. If an enemy is hit, Auriel heals herself for 250 **R1:** Peace Mana: 100 Cooldown: 100 seconds. Become immobile and channel an aura over a wide area for 4 seconds. All attacks and abilities used by heroes within the aura deal 1 damage. **R2:** Inspiring momentum Mana: 100 Cooldown: 80 seconds. For 8 seconds, cooldowns on yourself (other than Inspiring Momentum itself) and nearby allied heroes recharge 200% faster **TALENTS:** **Lvl1:** Conjurers Pursuit Staunch resolve: Resolve can now deflect up to ~~3~~ 2 stuns or polymorph effects Vigilance: Resolve heals the target by 250 if it doesnt prevent a stun or polymorph effect Martial hope: Your basic attacks become melee ranged, deal 50% more damage and slow enemies by 10% **Lvl4:** Protective Shield Touch of haste: Touch of Almaiesh increases allied attack speed by 10-20% or reduces enemy attack speed by 10-20%. Intensity is stronger the closer Auriel is to the target. Touch of light: Touch of Almaiesh increases allied movement speed by 10-30% or reduces enemy movement speed by 10-30%. Intensity is stronger the closer Auriel is to the target. Energising light: Dissipate restores 40 mana to Auriel and allies in its area if it successfully knocks back an enemy hero **Lvl7:** Clairvoyance Watchful riposte: Skills deflected by Resolve cost the enemy who used them double the usual mana. Healing Touch: When Touch of Almaiesh expires, target ally is healed for X Searing Touch: Touch of Almaiesh also deals damage and applies effects in a small area around the target **Lvl13:** Whiplash: Casting Touch of Almaiesh on a target already under its effect teleports Auriel to the target. Snare of Almaiesh: Casting Touch of Almaiesh on an enemy already under its effect roots the target for 0.75 seconds Intensity: Casting Touch of Almaiesh on a target already under its effect applies resistant to an ally for 3 seconds or vulnerability to an enemy for 3 seconds Relentless hope: Beacon of Hope now reduces durations of stuns, polymorphs, slows, roots and silence effects by 33% **Lvl16:** Dazzling Presence: Enemies who attack Auriel are blinded for 1 second. This effect does not stack Fortifying hope: Beacon of Hope can be activated to make other allies in its range unstoppable for 1.5 seconds. 60 second cooldown. Dance of Almaiesh: Touch of Almaiesh gains a third charge Saturate: Dissipate can be cast a second time for free within two seconds, which deals double damage and double knockback. **Lvl20:** Peace through superior firepower: Peace no longer affects allied abilities. Surging momentum: Inspiring Momentum also grants 20% ability power Hope remains: On death, apply two charges of Touch of Almaiesh to all allies and enemies in range Bolt of the Storm Storm Shield **USAGE:** Auriel is designed as a counter pick to heavy roaming/stun compositions, by effectively nullifying a stunlock attempt with lvl 1 talent Staunch resolve. This combined with a light version of relentless applied to nearby allies and a number of talentable buffs and debuffs makes it very difficult to pick off a hero which Auriel is protecting. However, Auriel herself has little base self-sustain (and sacrifices a lot of utility for self-defence talents) and is very vulnerable to being stunlocked  she is only good at preventing this from happening to others. She is also a melee assassin enabler, preventing immediate crowd control effects from shutting down an initiating melee assassin and potentially helping them stick to their target. Auriel keeps the team alive by stopping unfavourable fights from starting. Her healing itself is relatively low and needs to be managed carefully to get maximum utility from Touch of Almaiesh and its many talentable effects. **TALENT THOUGHT PROCESS:** **Lvl 1.** Auriel will likely go through mana quite quickly with a fairly spammable Q, so conjurers is an option here. However, I would expect one of the two W talents to be picked most of the time. Staunch resolve is a main reason to use Auriel as a counterpick, shutting down stunlocks, while if Auriel is against a team with few or no stuns, Vigilance provides extra sustain. Martial hope is mostly a flavour talent, as Auriel is known to use a sword as well as her whip. While it may appear as a lvl1 Nexus Blades, remember that you are giving up a ranged attack for it. The increased damage and slow is necessary to make it attractive at all, and it is designed to help melee assassins stick to targets in situations where stuns are not too much of an issue. **Lvl4.** Protective shield fits Auriels anti-gank function quite well but is replaceable. Again, I expect one of the two Q talents to be taken here, depending on what the team needs the most. The E talent is another option for mana management, but I thought the ability to restore mana to an ally made it a bit more interesting, although that would be quite difficult to land consistently. **Lvl7.** I thought about giving Auriel a vision-based basic ability, but decided it would make her kit way too passive and changed the E to what it is now. Clairvoyance is there to replace it, since vision is a good way to prevent ganks, which is Auriels job. Healing and Searing touch carry on the trend of a pair of common picks dependant on situation. Healing touch is something you would almost always take as a solo healer, while searing touch is a more powerful talent which can be used to provide pseudo-burning rage/wave clear and AoE slows/speed boosts in the early game, and potential AoE roots, Resistance and Vulnerability later on, at the cost of Healing Touchs sustain. Riposte is designed to really twist the knife on stunlock comps by destroying their mana and forcing them to back more often. Whether or not its worth sacrificing the Q talents for Im not sure. **Lvl10** Peace: Most of the time, its an Oh shit button when your team is getting collapsed on, buying you a few seconds to get away or reposition while wasting enemy cooldowns. It will be better in coordinated play where the Auriel can tell the team to save their cooldowns do avoid wasting damage. Can be used offensively, with Auriel flanking or diving into the enemy team while ranged heroes blast away at them. Note that it is probably quite bad against poke comps, as it effects the damage dealt by heroes within it, NOT the damage taken by heroes within it. This means poke comps can just shell your team from range while your team cant do any damage. Intelligent use required. Momentum is the go-to heroic for Auriels role in supporting divey assassins. It massively accelerates their cooldowns and will likely work in a similar way to an AoE Icy Veins or a Bloodlust for abilities. Its also probably the solo queue ult of choice as it doesnt require as much coordination and would be pretty devastating in combination with many common hero league picks like KaelThas. **Lvl13** Probably my favourite talent tier. I really liked the idea of double-tapping Q for a powerful benefit at the cost of sustained healing/damage. Here there are options for an escape/dive, disengage/engage on a single hero (with the root) or just extra protection/damage. Searing Touch gives a small AoE to many of these effects, which makes them quite powerful. Each option will require you to manage your Q very carefully, but get stronger at 16 if the Q talent is taken there. For the last talent, I thought about just making D into an AoE relentless, but that seemed too strong, so I decided on buffing it from a  reduction to a 1/3 reduction instead. I dont want it to be tooo attractive because I like the other talents a lot more, but I still want it to be worth taking. **Lvl16** Dazzling Presence might be a bit unbalanced and is mostly here because it popped into my head one day as an interesting alternative to Imposition Presence (which wouldnt fit Auriel at all). It would have no effect at all on heroes with an attack speed slower than 1 per second, while completely shutting down the damage of a hero which just brainlessly attacks you at a speed of 1 per second of faster. Stutter stepping could help you to play around this, although it messes up Tychus, Valla, Illidan and Artanis pretty badly if they try to focus Auriel no matter what they do. Thoughts? However, powerful as that may be, I think youre giving up a lot for it, with a powerful AoE cleanse, extra charge and Q which has tonnes of synergy with the lvl 13 talents and what is potentially a very powerful displacement tool. I wanted this tier to feel sufficiently powerful and hopefully it does. **Lvl20** The ult upgrades might be completely overpowered, but to be honest, so many heroes in the game completely ignore their ult upgrades that I think they need to be overpowered to some degree. Theyre still on a long cooldown, after all. Peace Through Superior Firepower could be crazy, but remember that Auriel can be CCed out of the channel. Bolt can be used to flank with the ability more easily and may offer more flexibility anyway. 20% ability power on momentum Im not sure about since its not particularly interesting, but the synergy makes sense. I didnt want just generics and ult upgrades, so I added Hope Remains as an on-death ability. With a bunch of Q talents, this can potentially apply attack speed boost and resistance to your whole team, along with a small burst heal and HoT, while applying an attack speed slow, DoT and mass vulnerability to enemies, amongst other effects depending on what talents you decided to go with. Thats quite a lot of stuff, but then, it does require you to die. Maybe it could be an activatable skill instead. **BALANCE AND OTHER CONCERNS:** Resolve has the potential to be far too strong on channelled abilities like Mosh Pit, Ravenous and Jugs, particularly with the Staunch Resolve talent. This is the reason for allowing displacement effects to still work, so heroes like Raynor, Tychus, Johanna and so on can still stop a Mosh Pit. It essentially has a similar effect to Divine Shield on Mosh Pit which is less robust but more readily available. Hopefully allowing displacements through would be enough here. The other concern with Resolve is if the enemy doesnt have stuns, its a worthless ability unless you talent into the heal at lvl1. Auriel is supposed to have weak self-sustain, as shes designed as a presence which boosts allies, but it might be a bit too lacking and force her to always take escape on 13 or Dazzling Presence on 16, which would be sad. I considered First Aid at 7, but I think its a rather boring talent and wouldnt want her force to take it. Hopefully the heal on E would be enough. Q could be adjusted to allow Auriel to apply it to herself, but I feel like this would hurt the fantasy of the hero. Silhouette is a bid of a worry if she takes the sword talent at level one, as she might look too much like Tyrael with angels looking as similar as they do (#notracist). **Final note** Thanks for taking the time to look at this  my first hero concept. Let me know if you like this format and what I can do to improve it. And of course, please discuss what you think of the concept itself! &lt;3 EDIT: Fixed typos and formatting derps"

It's up with an English cast on Khaldor's channel right now if you're interested in watching. EDG's draft in game 1 was just bizarre. Sonya, Jaina, Valla is OK but with a Leoric solo tank and Rehgar (and this not because there were no better options available)... there's just no support for that backline and literally only one hard cc effect on the team. Estar did basically just roll over them in all the fights. However, I honestly think Estar should've had a much bigger lead earlier on with them having a Falstad and being 6 or 7 kills up and still on basically even XP... against C9 they were in much the same situation where they were just missing tons of XP. Seems like a real vulnerability of the team."
226,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Greymane builds, talent concerns and initial thoughts",7,3xmote,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3xmote/greymane_builds_talent_concerns_and_initial/,2015-12-21 09:46:46,"So I'm just taking a gander at Greymane's talents that've been datamined, and I like what I see overall, but I am concerned that his worgen form is probably only going to have one real build, with slight variations, and several of the worgen talents are basically 'winmore' (As in, if you can take them without issue, you're just solidifying a major lead that you already have). So after intense study (And by that I mean cobbling random stuff together in ten minutes) I've come up with a few possibilities. [Look ma, I'm a fire mage!](URL Basically the cocktail build. I have no idea how much damage it'll do, but it's fairly obvious the human form's cocktail will be a significant source of ability damage. Essentially this is 'mage' Greymane I'd say. [Pewpew, I'm a hunter.](URL Or marksman. Or whatever you wanna call it. Putting a heavy emphasis on Greymane's ranged attacks, and using his worgen abilities probably just for utility more than anything. Wizened Duelist is a possibility overt he extra range. However, Greymane's ranged, uhm, range, is quite short. And to be honest you might as well take Raynor, who just lacks a decent escape compared to Greymane. Though the vulnerability is nice, the leap follow up is pointless if all your talents are based in human form. [Rawr. I'm a worgen.](URL A worgen orientated build is inevitable, and to be frank I think it's the stronger contender. However, it will, in the current meta, -require- the talents orientating around anti-CC and damage mitigation. Melee assassins, at least last I checked, were very squishy (As they should be), but why take melee assassin's that need to give up damage for beefiness when you can take an assassin that can sit safely at range? It's a tricky balance of course. But none the less... Alternate choices include Running Wild (Not sure how big the range on Darkflight is. If it's decent I could see this talent being passed on, but if it's short, we might need it to help stick to priority targets, which Worgen form is nearly built for). You could also take Executioner if you had the comp for it, or Relentless Predator if you're facing a CC heavy team. Admittedly a 75% reduction on, well, almost all CC is nothing to scoff at. Nothing short of death will peel off a stubborn Greymane in worgen form from your squishy assassin's or supports! **Talents I am concerned about** Let's start with the first heroic, go for the throat. As someone who used to play Warwick in League of Legends, it seems like a very similar ability. Except as far as I can tell it doesn't suppress a single target (Which admittedly was very potent in LoL), and if it kills the target, it allows it to be used again. However, that is a -big- if. Unless the damage dealt is high, and it's easy to gauge how much it'll do, getting the extra leap will be difficult. This also makes the lv20 upgrade... less than ideal, as you have to guarantee TWO kills in rapid succession with one ability to get the most of it. If the damage is relatively high, at least on squishies (I can see that pouncing Jaina, Kael, or a squishy support like Lili could be a game changer, esp if it chains to another target), and the range is good, I can see some potentially awesome plays on a worn down enemy team (In which case, greymane would benefit from staying in the fog of war as a team fight goes on, then leaping at the back line as the enemy presses forward). But if the range is 'eh' and the damage is 'eh' even on fragile targets, it'll not only be hard to secure the kill with the heroic (As it provides no benefit for making -team- plays happen like Warwick's Ultimate did) either for a global (Nuke the support to make 4v5) or personal (Double leap) benefit, but it'll just be a souped up Darkflight... As it stands, until I see GftT in action, Marked for the Kill is a far better choice. It enables a long range leap, applies vulnerability (Benefiting the whole team) and at lv20 can pierce a whole team with a well aimed shot. (But at that point, why not take Sylvanas? Or Jaina? Or Tyrande? They can do a vuln without needing to use a heroic for it...) Wizened Duelist is also iffy. Melee assassin's unless played well and carefully will tend to be the first to drop dead, so this'd encourage Greymane to potentially stick to fighting at range, but for how long? One wrong move and SPLAT. Stacks gone. And unlike Butcher (Which I find very fun to play), the stacks can't be regained with a few creep waves. You need -kills- to get them back. On the upside, it's only 10. However, this nudges it into a 'winmore' area. If you can consistently maintain those stacks, then the enemy team is probably doing something wrong. 30% damage is huge on any assassin, and they should be priority target #1, right alongside the support if not above the support! The two lv20 cleave talents are... very underwhelming. 4% AA damage? Really? I don't see that having all that much use except for wave clearing and mercs. Unless the AA rate and damage is insane compared to other heroes those 4% ticks are negligible. Fury of the Storm would probably be a better replacement for both of these, and it'd free up a slot for a new talent. Though that being said, if his AA is great by default, quick and powerful, then I could see the 4%s adding up quite a bit. But I fear that if you take Marked for the Kill, the upgrade is too good. Only Go for the Throat's upgrade is greatly iffy as previously mentioned. **Why would you want Greymane on your team over &lt;hero&gt;?** Good question. And it's one that I am having a hard time trying to answer. Vulnerabilities? Already gone over that. We've several heroes that can mark multiple heroes with it on a regular ability, and with wider spread than a narrow skillshot. Melee assassin? Plenty of those with various forms of survival built into their kit without relying on talents. Hell even Sonya is basically a melee assassin nowadays. CC? He has none that I can tell (Unless GftT suppresses/stuns, which it doesn't mention doing). Other assassin's tend to have some way of aiding in peeling, or setting up kills. He has some neat versatility in being able to switch between two assassin types on the fly. With appropriate abilities... but that's about it. I struggle to think -why- someone would take Greymane instead of another hero. I'd play him for funsies in QM, but I don't want a similar case to several other heroes where picking him in HL just leads to flaming. And often rightfully so, again, why should I pick a hero that is not as capable as another in the same aspect? Damage, securing kills, poking, etc. "
227,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Some Information on Greymane,67,3xn7z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3xn7z4/some_information_on_greymane/,2015-12-21 12:14:52,"I've noticed a bit of wondering about Greymane so I decided to record some stuff on how he plays in Try Mode. Let me add that this is practically ""perfect scenario"" and I'm not sure how Greymane will ACTUALLY play out in normal games. With Inner Beast on and using the worgen build, Greymane does about 1000 damage per second. Take that how you will. This is without the 30% damage increase at lvl 7 because that seems to be his equivalent to Gathering Power and it seems to be incredibly unlikely to kill 10 targets without dying while still being an even game. Go for the Throat deals about 10% HP to Arthas in Try Mode while Spell Shield is down. It does **822** damage at lvl 20. Seems very underwhelming, however, you must note that this is indeed Arthas so it might be devastating upon squishies. However, due to the fact that Greymane's autos with full Wizened Duelist do **600** damage at lvl 23 (400 with no Wizened Duelist) and GftT does **900** damage at lvl 23, I'm not quite sure if it'll be good enough to use over the vulnerability ultimate. However, it is worth noting that if used on a target that is about to die, GftT will effectively do **1800** damage. There is a **[small indicator](URL above the enemy's head when Greymane's ""Go For The Throat"" ability will kill a target, which makes using it far easier. No memorizing numbers in relation to health bars here. This is the [range](URL of GftT. It takes Greymane **~6** seconds to kill Arthas with NO stacks of Wizened Duelist and at lvl 20. This is using all abilities with a worgen form build. It takes Greymane **~4** seconds to kill Arthas with 10 stacks of Wizened Duelist at lvl 23 (impossible for me to get 10 kills on Arthas without forcing myself to level up, sorry. Setting it to lvl 20 resets my talents.) I likely could have killed him earlier due to GftT but he died too quickly. This is using the worgen form build. A note on his two level 20 talents, **Tooth and Claw** and **Hunter's Blunderbuss**. I have no idea where Heroesnexus got their information from, but both talents splash for 100% damage, not 4%. As in, they actually deal the same amount of damage to the primary target and all targets around it. Another note is that the talent ""On the Prowl"" talent at lvl 13 seems incredibly necessary for Greymane, as he has no real gapcloser other than his E to engage and his Q(Worgen) to run forward. His Q(Worgen) only lunges him forward a tad bit, so you are likely not going to be able to AA them afterwards. The range talent seems good but it doesn't truly compare to a 30% speed increase that you can keep up by AAing. [Greymane's attack range](URL with the lvl 7 attack range increase. [Greymane's attack range](URL without the lvl 7 attack range increase. I couldn't see much of a difference at all between those two talents, although I may be missing something."

I tried searching for the answer but didn't find anything. My apologies if this question has been posted and answered before. Edit: These are the findings by /u/sentient_microwave: Just checked this in Try Mode: * First tic of Shadow Dagger (the one that applies vulnerability) doesn't get damage bonus, the rest do * Envenom (and I assume other DoTs) benefit from vulnerability as long as vulnerability applies - no snapshot. If a target becomes vulnerable while affected by Envenom, the damage bonus will apply Shrink Ray and GP stacks affect the damage output of a hero, while vulnerability affects the damage done to a hero, this is why snapshots happen with one and not the other.

[**Talents can upgrade Overlord into Overseer with additional abilities, allow you to spawn multiple Overlords, passively heal Heroes, and more.**] * **Q - Spawn Zerglings** - Spawns 2 Zerglings in each lane that will run down the same path of your mercenary wave. You can micro-control these units. [**Talents could spawn more Zerglings, give them upgrades to speed, and more**] * **W - Spawn Drone (Skillshot)** - Spawn a Drone that will travel the direction chosen, and merge into the first damaged building it encounters to repair it. [**Talents could spawn something other than a Drone, give the repaired building a Spore Crawler, and more**] * **E - Penetrating Gaze (Global)** - Target enemy hero has its movement and attack speed slowed down for a small amount of time. [**Talents could add vulnerability, make penetrating gaze reveal a significant area around the hero and decloak units, and much more.**] And then the ults: * **R1 - Domination** - Take control of an enemy Hero for 3 seconds. You cannot use the Hero's abilities, but you may move them and basic attack. [**Lvl 20 talent could create an infested copy of the Hero if the hero is destroyed during the Domination.**] * **R2 - Spawn Cerebrate** - Spawns a Cerebrate on-top of a Fort, replacing it (gaining slightly more Health than the fort in the process if damaged) and its towers with Zerg-equivalents. Cerebrates will decloak units, and periodically spawn a zergling to join mercenary waves. If you have no more Forts remaining, you may spawn Cerebrates surrounding your core. Note: You do not need to destroy Cerebrates to destroy the Core. [**Lvl 20 talent could allow the creation of multiple Cerebrates, or significantly strengthen Cerebrates**] "

You don't need to keep it up just because you see people at who aren't at full health. Let them regen a bit, let the orbs regen do their work. * Use Safeguard with a purpose. Don't use it on CD. I personally use it as a ""buffer"" if I need to heal person A, and person B is eating harass (Or I see the Shield Break animation from vulnerability) then I throw B to just put a band-aid on them. * If some is under INTENSE focus, then throw the guard and beam on them * Grenade is slow and does piddling damage. Safe it for peel, not for harass. * After a fight, either go back to tap the fountain or mana. A lot of Medics often stay on the field because they're at full health because of their trait, but you still need mana as well. Alright, I hope this helps a few of you aspiring Medics out there. **Edit** I'm not gonna say I was right... but someone else's thread was taken down. You know a thread complaining about the non-existent mana issues the Medic doesn't have... yep."
233,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Highest Hero DPS on Try Mode dummy with short cooldown mode toggled,1,3o2yzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3o2yzw/highest_hero_dps_on_try_mode_dummy_with_short/,2015-10-09 20:41:41,"After testing every hero with this, the best I got was 15k Gazlowe by putting a shitload of turrets while spamming dynamite/grav bomb and autoattacking with the talent that increases turret duration by 1 sec for autoattacks. I could probably get more if the dummy had higher health to allow me to set up more turrets because I can get 15k sustained dps and it spikes to near 20k right as the dummy dies and my turrets start expiring after that due to not having something to autoattack. Second best is Kael'thas at 6-7k by spamming phoenix, trait+Q (with the talent that does Q twice), and W. Third best is Jaina at around 4-5k by spamming every ability (with cone of cold vulnerability talent) with a water elemental lvl20 talent that makes it mimic my casts. Surprisingly 4th best is Leoric with about 3.7k dps by getting the Drain Hope talent that deals 10% max hp in damage when it expires as well as Spectral Leech for the 5% max hp per auto attack, and then just spamming W while auto'ing (Q results in a dps loss because you miss autos and therefore miss the 5% max hp per hit). Others come close, especially heroes that can take Blood for Blood talent to spam that 10% max hp damage active ability. Heroes with Rewind also come close because the short cooldown mode doesn't give you instant cd reset, it takes a couple seconds, so doing all your abilities and then rewinding lets you do the abilities again before the cooldown reset kicks in and resets all of them along with rewind. Nova clone build for example, or murky. Also, pick envenom if other talents in the level doesn't increase your DPS. It's not much but it's better than nothing. Also I didn't choose Seasoned Marksman or any of the other talents that can stack infinitely because obviously those would win (at least I think it stacks infinitely) Disappointing heroes that I thought would do very well but did absolute crap: Nazeebo, Azmodan (with fully 500 stacked Q and spamming minions, black pool, and laser), Zagara, Sylvanas (each time your cooldown gets refreshed it only gives you a single Q charge back), Butcher. The highest possible is probably Abathur with locusts spam but I couldn't get an accurate dps test because the dummy would die WAY too fast after a ton of locusts, and then the locusts would walk away and into the lane after the dummy dies so I lose all of them. He probably has higher potential than Gazlowe because after a certain point you run out of room to place turrets as Gazlowe due to the bigger model size and less attack range vs the locusts. Best 45 minutes I've ever wasted."
234,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Hero League and Team League Meta a lot different,109,3o3546,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3o3546/hero_league_and_team_league_meta_a_lot_different/,2015-10-09 22:01:20,"Team League is by far not as popular as Hero League altough it gained some more attention with the recent changes and removing 5 mans from HL. Some days ago I started playing Team League aswell with 3 different teams and we are hovering at around rank 5-1 in team league now. What I noticed is that the hero league drafts are completely outdated or it feels like it at least. In Hero League people still try to get mainly Leoric, Kael and Johanna. They are hugely contested. Other extremly popular picks are Nazeebo and Zeratul On the opposite. Abathur and Nova are very disliked in Hero League. In Team League the situation seems a lot more logical. (Obviously since it's full teams but still): Uther is the most contested pick in the game. 90% of all games have Uther as firstpick. Many combos do not even work without having Uther, no support even gets close to him currently. Rehgar and Monk are just scratching the surface compared to him. Nova is a very popular lastpick to punish squishy teams. She is in every third game and teams usually do really well with her. Another thing is that most Nova players do actually not pick 20% snipe damage in team league but 4 second slow duration coupled with the vulnerability at 16. The recent days of team league gave me the impression that Nova is a very underrated character despite having a bunch of weaknessess. People claim against coordinated, good players she begins to suck massively but in team league the complete opposite can be observed. Kael and Jaina have fallen off in popularity. Massively. Almost every team in team league plays double warrior. But usually you only see either Kael or Jaina if even. They are about as popular as Nova in Team League. Kerrigan is very popular which along with Nova are two factors that Kael and Jaina are not being played so much anymore. Stitches and ETC are extremly popular now. The two are seeing more play in Team League than Muradin. At least one of them happens to be in nearly every game which makes sense given that Stitches works best in a team with communication and ETC's buffs make him a very strong warrior again with moshpit. Medic sees ocasional play in Team League but it almost never works out. In Hero League Morales appears in like every game because of ""Hurr durr new hero look at me instantbuying it and bringing it to ranked, so good. Durr"" and there seems to be a common misconception that she is supposed to be good with Illidan and the like which is obviously not the case as they work very much against eachother. Leoric and Johanna remain quite popular but you definitely don't need either of them anymore on your team to win. A common team league game usually starts off with an Uther first pick into either Raynor, Leoric or Johanna. Melee compositions usually settle for Abathur+Illidan/Sonya/Kerrigan while standard teams often go for Zagara/Hammer/Nazeebo with either Kael or Jaina. Last picks are almost always picks that completely try to make the enemys team compositions fall apart. Nova, Vikings, Rexxar etc. Having a lot of fun in TL compared to HL and can only recommend people to try and get groups going to try it out. Yes you will often end up with teams, getting stomped and people leaving group after first loss. It's still a lot more entertaining than HL especially once you find good players to play with on a regular basis"
235,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Artanis talent theory crafting,0,3onpbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3onpbd/artanis_talent_theory_crafting/,2015-10-14 11:21:44,"Post your artanis talent calculator builds here, and give your own reasoning as to why you went that build. We are assuming the enemy team has a generic mix of aa and ability damage heroes. URL Artanis's level 1 talents are honestly pretty meh except for maybe the block and seasoned marksmen works really well with the bonus attack speed at lvl 4 and his triple strike on w at 13. Slow on 7 with purifier beam to ensure that you can at least get 3 ticks of the ulti damage off. I like all the damage talents on artanis for the most part because I dont think hes going to be your main tank anyways. He basically has 0 cc options except for slow on 7 and blind, and hes not that tanky outside of his shield. He really needs to fight to live. I dont like the vulnerability on his w at 16 because it wouldnt help much with your ult, and most of your damage comes from your w, and even against like a kaelthas or rexxar or someone with mid-tier hp pool titan killer on artanis just does so much damage. Its like a lower cooldown thrall e that doesnt give movespeed. Also another thing is that with at lvl 20 i think nexus blades will be best not only because we've already gone for a very auto attack heavy build, but yet again, slow from this talent will help with your ulti to help it catch up. Although the upgrade to your passive at 20 doesnt sound bad either. Variables: If the enemy team has a butt load of ability damage I think the ability damage reduction at 13 on the shield might be good and the blind ulti could be potentially extremely powerful against the likes of raynor+valla or just in general a bunch of auto attack heroes."

I'm doing my best to clean them up, but it's becoming clear I just need to play Artanis more than 10 games before opening my mouth. There are some GREAT comments / feedback below, but take everything in my OP with a grain of salt! I definitely love Artanis and will be working more to refine my play with him. **IMPORTANT:** You should know that [Artanis currently has a bug where you can trigger Twin Blades twice in a row.](URL The videos being linked of him bursting down Valla and others may be results of this bug. -------------------------- Hey all, I've played a few games as Artanis and I'm surprised there aren't a ton of posts with serious feedback about him (there are a few good comments scattered throughout several Artanis-related posts though). **Here are some tidbits that I hope help:** - Use his phase prism (E) to initiate, not blade dash (~~W~~Q) - Note that phase prism will pass through minions! Try to cast it from a bush on a retreating enemy - Instead, use blade dash to avoid AoEs and skill shots; Azmodan's laser, Jaina's abilities, etc. - ~~Phase prism appears to disrupt some channeled abilities (e.g. Azmodan's laser) but not Ults like Valla's~~ Clarification: Phase prism will disrupt any channeled ability that requires someone to stand still. - Although the tool top for Twin Blades (W) says ""next attack,"" it actually activates immediately, so using it between auto attacks is awesome. It looks like it does reset your AA cooldown though. - ~~Don't try to build him for burst damage, he just doesn't have it. Triple trike and zealot charge seem great, but his low attack speed and lack of escapes make him too squishy to stay in the fray.~~ /u/zimmah has shown me that I'm wrong; check out [THIS BUILD](URL that definitely makes him bursty af (at the cost of some utility talents) **Instead, try this build:** 1: Reactive Parry 4: Lethal Alacrity 7: Psionic Synergy (really good with alacrity) 10: Depends on enemy team comp 13: Phase Bulwark 16: Psionic Wound ~~(the vulnerability will do way more than a third strike if your team is coordinated)~~ 20: Suppression Pulse or Force of Will, depending on what you took at 10. If you're somehow the only warrior on your team, I strongly recommend Force of Will no matter what. - With this build, I tend to save the dash until I'm at like 60% health, then cast it to hit the most enemies. - This also gives my healer a big window to heal me. I don't care if u get healed above 50% health with this build, because the trait cooldown ends up being so low (as opposed to builds that rely on Twin Blades). **Edit:** He also synergizes super well with Tassadar, who can just add to his shields! - I try to swap spots with someone who over extends and immediately hit them with Psionic sickness - I tend to swap spots with the squishiest target in melee range (since the prism travels so damn slow) and just body block them **Other feedback** - Artanis would really benefit from Battle Momentum. Given how necessary the dash is for his survival, I think this should replace the talent that lowers it's cooldown when he's at half health, because you really need to time the first one so that it hits stuff right after he falls below 50% - The prism needs to travel faster. It's much slower than Stitches' hook and Stitches doesn't swap spots with the person he hooks. Before you argue that it phases through minions, please remember that it's got a pretty short range and there are maps where you're not fighting around minions a lot (tributes, pirate turn in, immortals) - I think the blade dash should work like Zeratul's worm hole. Hit Q once, and he dashes to a spot and deals a little damage. If you don't hit it again in 3 seconds, it goes on cooldown. That way you can use W first if you want **OR throw a prism out and dash back for a very long swap**. I think that second one is where the real power would be. Artanis is definitely full of good ideas. His kit needs a couple adjustments but I think he rules and will definitely fall into the meta (in a spot similar to Sonya and Tyrael) as more people try him out! --------------- edit 1: fixed my bad mistakes; wrote this on my phone last night, so I did it from memory. Sorry for messing up which talents compete."
237,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Implement a ""Damage added"" stat when an enemy takes damage while under Vulnerability?",0,3qeynn,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3qeynn/implement_a_damage_added_stat_when_an_enemy_takes/,2015-10-28 00:13:54,"With the Medic patch, we are now able to directly apply Resistant to our allies and not just ourselves, through Safeguard. When an ally takes damage with Safeguard and Safeguard wears off, a number shows up that tells you how much damage you effectively prevented with the reduction, and it is applied to your Healing stat (similar to how Tassadar shields only add ""healing"" through lifesteal and if the shields take damage). But while we just now are able to apply Resistant to allies, we've been able to apply Vulnerability to our enemies for some time, the most notable way to do so being through Hunter's Mark, Tyrande's trait. This ability applies Vulnerability and reveals the target for 4 seconds. So what I'm asking is, can there be a ""Damage Added"" stat that is simply a quarter of the amount of damage the enemy took in the duration of Vulnerability that is then added to the hero's Siege/Hero damage stats depending on the enemy/ies that took the extra damage? Like Morales, it's a way to show just how much we contributed in helping the team, except through damage rather than healing (though she can do both!)"

So I have no memory or fondness of it like a lot of Brightwing players seem to have. However shes easily become my favorite healer. I just love everything about her, from her character to her kit. Until recently I always went Bouncy Dust at level 16. Now the past day or so I've been trying out Critterize. And I have to say, I like it a lot more than bouncy dust. As I've found more often than not, the bounce from pixie dust isn't all that useful because of how it targets. Although this could be just shitty positioning on my part. And the 25% vulnerability is really nice. I'll also admit, the greater polymorph looks pretty nice too! Although I feel like if you pick that, you're obligated to go rewind. Which I don't like doing, Revitalizing Mist seems too good to pass up. So my question for all the Brightwing mains out there; how do you determine which level 16 talent to take?"

240,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Why your game stutters, and what you can do about it.",629,3c530e,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3c530e/why_your_game_stutters_and_what_you_can_do_about/,2015-07-05 07:34:18,"With another increase in ""why does my game stutter"" threads hitting this subreddit, I figure it's time again to explain why this happens in HotS. First, I want to clarify the scenario we're talking about here. This is the stutter that occurs usually when you're connected to specific servers like ORD1 or US8 (press Ctrl-Alt-F in-game to see the server and your ping times) and is usually accompanied by a flashing Ethernet port symbol in the upper-left. Ping times are usually over 100ms when this is happening. &amp;nbsp; **Warning: This is long.** Try to bear with me, or you can skip through to the TL;DR at the end. Seriously though, if this is hurting your game, it's worth it to read through, isolate the cause, and investigate your options. &amp;nbsp; **Why does this happen?** HotS is based upon the SC2 engine, and thus uses the deterministic lockstep netcode model common to RTS games (and some MOBAs, in fact). What this means is that as the game is played, all that is exchanged between game clients and the server are player inputs. The server and the clients run in lockstep, or absolute sync, at an internal ""frame rate"" for player actions. I don't know what this rate is, but in many lockstep games I've read that it's around 10 fps, or 100ms. UPDATE: /u/TyaArcade says that ""...[assuming it's the same as SC2, it's 62.5ms . The engine ticks every 1/16th of a game second.](URL UPDATE 2: /u/barrett777 (owner of HotsLogs and coder of the system that reads replay files) has confirmed the HotS engine indeed still runs at 16 FPS. When a player initiates an action, that action is displayed immediately on screen, but is actually performed server-side (and on all synchronized clients) during the next possible action frame. A good way to actually witness this is via the new HotsLogs in-browser match replays. This is effectively the replay file, which is a recording of player actions during the game, being played back to show the data contained within the action frames. &amp;nbsp; **So why does it make my game stutter?** If a client doesn't get any updates from the server or any acknowledgement that its own updates have been received for each action frame, the game effectively halts until any necessary information is received. It can't render anything new and so it freezes until it has something to work with. If this happens for long enough, your client is effectively no longer in sync with the game and you get the ""Server is xx:xx ahead"" message. During this time your game is trying to collect all of the actions it's missing and simulate them at an accelerated internal rate until it comes back into sync with the server and the rest of the clients. HotS puts a server-controlled bot in place to input actions on behalf of your client until you return. For those wondering why Blizzard, other MOBAs and most RTS would choose to netcode this way, the answer is simple: absolute fairness. Everyone always sees exactly the same thing, though obviously those with a lot of latency or packet loss can miss bits and pieces as the game stutters due to getting only intermittent action data. A potential programming solution to the network-latency stuttering might be for the game to try to fill those gaps between action frames that are missing data by using a form of visual interpolation (prediction based upon past trends) to display to the player what it *thinks* is happening instead of just sitting still. Many games implement something like this to a certain degree to ensure smoothness, but it's a double-edged sword. If the prediction isn't accurate (and it can never be 100% correct, particularly in the clickfest of a team fight or objective battle) then ultimately you could witness scenarios where a skillshot appears to connect but does not, or a player teleports / rubber bands to a new position as more accurate information comes in to update the game. However, this kind of visual inconsistency is generally unacceptable in a latency-sensitive competitive game environment and can be exploitable. It could spell the death of the competitive scene for HotS and this subreddit would be flooded with a whole different kind of rage! So before you blast Blizzard's decision to netcode the game this way, consider the alternatives. I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement, but we'd need to know a lot more details about HotS netcode (Blizz, plz?) before we could criticize much further. &amp;nbsp; **Why are there networking problems?** * This can be for a few different reasons. One could simply be a local networking issue between your PC and your router. If you're on WiFi, interference or overlapping channels with other WiFi networks could be a big cause of the issue. The capacity of your connection between your router and your ISP could be maxed out because of someone doing heavy downloading or uploading on your network. * It could be an issue on your ISP's network. Traffic leaves your router and heads to your local ISP's CO, or Central Office, to get told where to go next. If you're seeing a lot of packet loss between your router (probably 192.168.x.x) and the CO, either there's an issue somewhere out on the wire, something is maxing out the capacity of your service with your ISP, or your ISP has too many people sharing the same network resources in your neighborhood. This type of oversubscription is common and can particularly be a problem if you're on a cable connection, as your modem will spend a lot of time jumping between frequencies on the cable to try to find ones that aren't really busy. Past that even, your ISP may have issues with capacity or routing performance past the CO as traffic goes to an internet gateway where it'll be handed off to another service provider to take to Blizzard. * Thus it might also be an issue with internet latency between your ISP and Blizzard. The key word here is *between*. This may not be an issue with your ISP, it may not be an issue with Blizzard, but somewhere in-between. For example, there's a known issue currently between some service providers like TWC and the ORD1 server because of internet transit link congestion issues over intermediary service-provider XO Communications. These issues tend to manifest during the busiest hours for that link. * And lastly it could be entirely on Blizzard's end, or their service provider (AT&amp;T in the US from what I've seen). While certainly possible, if this was commonly the cause, it'd be a problem for *everyone*. Since it's usually just a portion of players having the issue, it's usually the first three scenarios that are the root cause. &amp;nbsp; **How do I find out exactly what's causing my problem?** First, try playing in Try Mode, which runs completely client-side. If everything is great there, proceed. If you still get some hitching / latency, try: * Delete your shader cache by deleting the `C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Heroes of the Storm\Versions` folder (hidden directory, paste into Windows Explorer or Run line) and then allowing the Battle.net launcher to update * Switching HotS to 32-bit client mode via the Battle.net launcher options * Ensuring your PC/laptop is not in any power-saving mode * Reducing graphics settings to lowest ([and here's how you can disable shadows entirely](URL * Set sound quality to low (it eats up a surprising amount of system resources). Assuming Try Mode works great, the best way to investigate further would be to run a MTR test from URL to the HotS servers and [diagnosing the results](URL However, recently that looking glass has not been working well. Alternatively, you can run a pathping/WinMTR test from your side (open command prompt aka ""cmd"" and type pathping followed by the appropriate IP listed below) *while your performance to that server is being consistently poor* **and** *while you have no other downloads or uploads running anywhere on your local network*. US8: 12.129.222.10 ORD1: 199.108.62.157 SG1: 202.9.67.59 SA1: 54.207.104.145 AU1: 103.4.114.233 Use the [MTR Analysis article](URL guidelines to evaluate your pathping (principles are the same) or download [WinMTR](URL if you want to be able to follow word-for-word. Please do *not* use Blizzard's pathping article as a guide. Compared to the MTR article it's garbage and contains blatant misinformation that could send you barking up the wrong tree. Essentially, look for a point on the path to the server in question where you see latency or packet loss jump up *and remain that way all the way to the end*. That last part is key; some devices on the internet respond to the pings sent to them by these tests at their leisure, but will still transmit pings sent anywhere else as quickly as possible. Thus you should be looking for a point where latency or packet loss occurs and *remains consistently bad at all subsequent hops*. Again, that [MTR Analysis article](URL does a pretty good job demonstrating what you should be looking for. &amp;nbsp; **What do I do with this to actually improve my game performance?** * So if it's an issue occurring on your local area network (*any* packet loss or double-digit latency on the first hop or any IP starting with 192.168.x.x), you should switch to playing from a wired connection if you're not already and stop all other heavy network usage while you're playing (people watching NetFlix, torrent streams, watching HD cat videos on YouTube, etc). Some people may suggest QoS as a solution, and it may be if the type of traffic maxing out your connection is TCP and your router supports per-user or per-connection bandwidth limits, but things like streaming video are difficult to throttle effectively inbound. If you're on a wired connection and there's no other downloading / uploading going on on your local network, and you're still seeing a lot of packet loss to your router at hop 1, consider swapping your ethernet cables and making sure they're not sitting on power cables, upgrading your router firmware, or possibly replacing your router completely. If you need to rule out your router and your local network, plug your PC directly into your modem and see how your game performance is then. Don't leave your PC this way though; it's just asking for a botnet to discover a security vulnerability on your PC to exploit. If it's an issue occurring between you and Blizzard as indicated by your pathping or WinMTR, you have a few options: * Call your ISP if the latency and packet loss is happening between your router and another service provider. Please be sure that you've run the pathping or WinMTR when your service isn't under load by heavy utilization like large downloads, streaming HD video, etc. Otherwise they'll just laugh at you and try to sell you more bandwidth. Consider a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem if packet loss and latency between your router and your ISP's CO happens consistently during certain hours of the day; DOCSIS 3.0 has the ability to utilize multiple channels simultaneously which could reduce the impact of your ISP oversubscribing its userbase in your area. Also remember that 1 hop here or there on your pathping or WinMTR with high packet loss or latency doesn't mean there's a problem; those are simply network devices configured with a security mechanism against DDOS. It's when you see multiple hops in a row with the same packet loss or high latency that you can be sure you're seeing something that's actually impacting your performance. However, if the problem is happening on another service provider's network, good luck getting your ISP or anyone else to do anything about it; you should turn your attention to the further options below. * Play during off-peak hours. If the issue is related to internet congestion, playing in the middle of the night for your region when the rest of the world is asleep or early in the AM should mean less congestion. Keep in mind though that if you're on the east coast, 11 PM is still 8 PM on the West Coast; lots of people are still watching NetFlix and filling up internet pipes. [This graph](URL (though a little dated) can give you a good idea as to when internet congestion issues may occur. * VPN into another service provider that follows a different path to the server. I'm not going to explain this further, Google can take it from here. Tricky part is finding a public VPN that isn't already slammed with use. This can also significantly average latency to the servers, but as long as it doesn't go up into the hundreds of milliseconds it should be an improvement. * Completely block the servers you are having issues connecting to via settings in your router, using Windows Firewall, or a 3rd-party firewall. A lot of people would link [this common thread](URL on this subject, but I don't think the IP range listed there works anymore. You can block the IP using the list previously provided above, or by running command prompt as administrator while you're in-game connected to the laggy server and typing *netstat -bn*. Look for the Heroes of the Storm client IP, finish your game (don't be a jerk) and then block that IP. The downside to this method is that the game may still continue to try to connect you to the server in question over and over, so it may take a number of tries to get connected to another server that works. Supposedly this method is safe to use without gaining leaver status. NOTE: Apparently the party leader is the one that decides the server everyone connects to, so if you're using this method or the next one, you should be party leader (otherwise everyone else might connect to a server you can't join). * An alternative method I've heard is to [fool the game into connecting to different servers](URL I'd heard this method wasn't working right (the file contents would change match-to-match), but my guess would be that setting the file in question to Read-Only would address that issue. The original thread got deleted, so I'm not sure if that's why or if Blizz isn't happy about the prospect of players messing with game files. File this one under use-at-your-own-risk/may-not-work. * The final option is to switch to another ISP. Sound crazy and over-reactive? Not really. You probably already have 2 ISPs... your cable service provider and your cell service provider. I address my ORD1 problem currently by setting my phone up as a hot-spot and connecting to it. Average ping times tend to sit at a solid 70ms and my game is buttery smooth when I do this, as my traffic routes through non-congested internet links. The only thing to be careful of is your usage; most cell providers have limits in place, and while the average match is 5-10 MB of data, it can add up quickly. &amp;nbsp; **This stuff is cool! Where can I learn more?** **[This post](URL by /u/occupydota is a great read into how Heroes of the Storm's deterministic lockstep system probably works, though just about everyone in that thread must have read about halfway through, only remembered the P2P part, and ranted about how HotS is not P2P. Yes, it's not, it's client-server, but SC2 was P2P and that's what HotS is based off of, so please don't get hung up on that. At the bottom of that post are further excellent resources that detail the pros and cons of netcoding a game this way, (for example, it's almost possible to use multiple processors efficiently).

242,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,For those who still love Brightwing; An extensive guide.,45,3dzx4u,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3dzx4u/for_those_who_still_love_brightwing_an_extensive/,2015-07-21 07:55:28,"The Story of a boy who loves Brightwing and Polymorph These days I don't see many Brightwings. The Brightwing's that I do see are usually not very effective and when I check their builds afterwords I see the random things posted by the various websites that carry HoTS guides. Now, I played her a lot before the changes(nerfs) that were bestowed upon us during the last, big patch. However, unlike other people who considered Brightwing their main, I haven't given up on her. This is a long guide, but it's in-depth. It's not just talents and why, it how to actually play her effectively. I'm sorry for it's length in advance, and don't recommend bothering if you're not interested in playing her. A bit of a disclaimer: Unlike in the past, I don't' think Brightwing is a support for every team, or every game anymore. She does however excel on Sky Temple, Cursed Hollow, and Garden of Terror. Pretty much anywhere that Falstad is good. In fact, I'd say that Brightwing and Falstad are basically BFFs. They work well together. If you have a friend who like's Falstad and you like to support. Brightwing's a pretty good option. As for playing Brightwing: With the Talent Changes, and overall nerfs to her play, Brightwing's strategy is contingent upon her Z and Polymorph. Honestly Arcane Flare, Soothing mist, and Pixie dust are borderline useless. Soothing mist gets a pass because it doesn't cost any mana and you don't really even have to remember you have it. The three keys to playing her now are Hearthing aggressively, positioning/kiting, and Polymorph prioritizing. Hearthing aggressively- Every time your Phase shift (Z) is on cool down you should be using it. Now, without talents, the best you can hope for is to synchronize your teleport with your soothing mist. Which will basically allow you to target a heal every forty-five seconds. It's not an incredible heal, nor is really reliable, but it's the closest you get. The basic order of operations is to teleport in on someone in a 1v1. Assist them with a kill or lane de-push and then head for some nearby bushes and hearth back with approximately 10 seconds left on your Phase Shift cool-down. So long as you do this correctly and frequently, you shouldn't run out of mana. Trust me on this. It can be very hard to sustain fight with Brightwing. Unlike other Supports you absolutely can not spam your cool-downs. Because two of her abilities make too small of an impact on fights; and because, if you do and things go wrong, it's very hard to disengage; she has no mount. Kiting/Positiong- Basically to be good at kiting and positioning on Brightwing you need to have good decision making. Gauging what level of aggression to approach with will definitely make a difference. As it is, Brightwing is actually quite aggressive. She likes to get in, right behind her tank/off-tank and support from there, between the friendly team. Take a look at a six-sided die. If you don't own one, google it. And look at the five side of the die. The middle dot is pretty much where you want to be, as Brightwing. You're a fragile little butterfly, but you still need to be in range of everybody. Sometimes you'll want to get up, in front of the tank and use some abilities before crawling back behind some protection. That's going to be something you'll have to learn from playing. Just remember that your Aoe Heal is passive, but doesn't heal much and doesn't have great range. So you have to be in a position of relative safety, and proximity. For the Kiting part, Brightwing can not duel very well. She will lose most one-on-one fights. However, she's great at slowly gliding away, and feigning weakness, and quite good at Poking. She's very good at baiting for Ganks, and great at taking a single hit and re-positioning because again, her passive will heal single attacks pretty easily. You want to know when to play safe, and when to stack all your abilities on enemies. Polymorph- This is the holy grail. Some of what I'm about to share with you are trade secrets. Things you'll learn from years of playing PvP games with de-buffs. Other things are fairly common knowledge, but it's important to know how they're actually applied. Here's the deal. Polymorph costs a lot of mana(70), has a long cool-down(15 seconds) and only impacts the game for 1.5 seconds when it's used. You have to use it effectively and your team has to know how to utilize it as well. Most of the time you want to hold polymorph until a full team fight is occurring. First red flag: Don't use Polymorph if there's a minion wave around, or close-to your target. Believe it or not, they can move around. If they move around and you target a minion than you wasted it, and since brightwing can't do much else, you're really no good in the fight. With Dueling you don't really want to polymorph other than to scare an enemy off. Usually when someone get's polymorphed they immediately head towards a friendly tower. The silence is bad, but it's really more of a scare-tactic. People always remember dying while being Polymorphed, but luckily most people won't remember that they only died from Polymorph after the enemy Brightwing had already hit sixteen and was surrounded by a team. That's good for you. However it's unlikely, at any stage of a game, that you can kill someone on your own, even with polymorph. It's better to hold on to it for a team fight. Now during team fights Polymorph is pivotal. But I want to share with you WHO to polymorph. A lot of people will Poly(from here on, you get it) the opposing healers or DPS. However, in almost every situation, you want to Poly the tank. That's going to allow your entire team to bypass their front line and attack the back line. It's only 1.5 seconds. That's not enough time to get around a tank if you poly a healer. The healer will pop back out while you're being peeled by the tank and start healing again. Depending on team compositions it can be smart to hit the DPS long enough to kill him so he can't fight back. Poly can also be used with a more defensive mindset. If your team is on the backfoot. Instead of using it to kill, this is where you want to poly the dps to help your team survive a fight, since your healing can't counteract burst. Second Red Flag: Polymorphing too early in a fight will rarely result in a kill. You need to be a distant after-thought so that your opponents keeping spamming the Q on their keyboards without even realizing they're poly'd. That's how you're going to stack kills and keep teammates alive. You can also use poly while chasing people. Giving an ally a speed boost, and making your enemies silenced and slowed will usually be enough to secure easy kills. Also, it's quite ineffectual for an enemy team to turn it around during a chase sequence when you have a poly up. Whoever initiates to try and punish you is being turned into a little crab, and probably going to get themselves killed. Now with talents, in late-game teamfights, this can change. After picking the right talents I would say focusing a single healer first, is usually correct. However, if you have enough dps, you can still poly off the tank, and kill him/her first making it easy to walk into their back line. Important side note for Polymorph: Polymorphing Falstad or enemy Brightwings will result in hilarious mishaps. And ProTip: if you polymorph Falstad just as he's about to fly your whole team will probably laugh as a flying pig crosses the map. Jokes aside, this leads me to my preferred build for current Brightwing. Talent 1(lvl 1): You want Hyper Shift. It's going to allow you to hearth even more often and also allow you to time your Phase Shift with your Soothing Mist more often. This will allow you to heal in all three lanes pretty effectively. It's also very effective when used in conjunction with your impending level 7 talent. Devaition: You can pick Bribe from time to time. Bribe does have incredible application on the battlefield of eternity since you can use one stack on the 'shaman' minion of the bruiser camps and then auto-attack the little dogs with incredible solo speed. The extra range on your passive, Unfurling spray, has applications against double mage comps on the enemy team. As for the Arcane flare talent, I can't even tell you what, exactly, it does. And recommend not picking it. It will only detriment you in light of the other three talent options. Talent 2(lvl 4): Unstabable Anomaly. Criminally undervalued. Since Brightwing is focused on polymorph this talent allows polymorph to add a small bit of burst on top of allies damage. It also means, that a low-health enemy trying to run away under polymorph will die when the polymorph ends, and it you don't have to chase it for that last hit. You can think of it like you get a free auto-attack on anything you polymorph. It may not seem like much, but it's genuinely better than the other talents for current-state Brightwing. Deviations: If your enemy team has at least two of Nova, Zeratul, Murky, or Abathur as well as any of the more annoying gank characters (mostly melee assassins) it's not unfeasible to pick Peekaboo. Information can be incredibly valuable, and getting vision with Brightwing as you come in for help, isn't half-bad. The big mistake for most Brightwing players come at this talent tier as well. They pick Manic Pixie, but it's garbage. It's similar to Rhegar's talent where if they have a lightning shield they'll get healed for more. Except Rehgar's is better and still not picked often. And lastly the arcane flare talent, again, I don't know what it does, and it's pointless. I know it doesn't triple Arcane flare's damage (because I would have picked it if it did) and beyond that, it's just not usable. Talent 3(lvl 7): Phase Shield. Build Synergy achieved, am I right? This used to be a level 13 talent for Brightwing. And I used to pick it then. Now they moved it up, and gave it synergy with your level one talent, effectively. Since your Z is one-third of your play arsenal, and you should be able hearth back, and Z once every 20-25 seconds with the cool down reduction with your level 1 talent, you pretty much get to use it as a twenty second target heal that also heals you to full health and mana (because you hearthed aggressively) Deviations: This tier has the most optimal deviation; Cleanse. Cleanse is not an always talent, it's a sometimes talent. Like Peekaboo, it really depends on the enemy team. If your opponents have lots of roots/stuns/and disables you want to get cleanse so your assassin's and tanks can muscle through. However you do have to remember that when getting cleanse you're losing the closest thing you'll get to a target heal until level 20. As for the other talents, I know Mistfied is the most popular. But since you can't spam Brightwing's basic abilities, which at best have an 8 second cool down, you're not going to get any real mileage out of this. Lastly, again Arcane Flare talent, ignored. (I hope you're seeing a trend and never picking these) Talent 4 (lvl 10) Heroics: Blink Heal. BOOM! Kind-of a target heal. But the real benefit of Blink heal is less that it heals for a meager amount, and more that it let's your position effectively. It can also help with disengage since you can teleport away to friendly minions or heroes who aren't in aggro range of enemies. The healing is not irrelevant, but it also isn't a substantial enough amount that it should make you the mvp with your teammates typing clutch heals! Deviation: Emerald Wind. So I have to admit something, I think Emerald wind sucks unless it's on Dragonshire or Cursed Hollow. I've used it to steal bosses, and I've used it to disengage, but when people pick Emerald Wind what I usually see is closer to this: Entire team is using AoE Heroics; Brightwing pushes all but one enemy to safety. At Emerald wind's best case scenario it's as good as the basic, ability, Diablo combo; Flip, and Push towards the base. I would never pick this if I was the sole healer on a team. And I, personally wouldn't pick this unless you're playing Dragonshire/Cursed Hollow. On those two maps you can push people out of the objectives (shrines/knight channel and curse channel) long enough for an ally to actually pick it up. On other stand here map objectives, the enemy team has ample time to regroup and just walk back in. The damage is negligible. Talent 5 (lvl 13): Shield Dust. Yeah, nothing special really. You get to tell your allies not to worry about spell shield since this has a quicker cool down than spell shield does. It also means they get to blame you when you use it on the wrong target. You have to be diligent, but it's better than the other talents. Deviations: I think it's acceptable to pick the other Pixie Dust talent, Pixie boost. It's also reasonable to pick Ice Block. Pixie Boost does less than the Shield dust does, in my opinion. The extra movement speed to an ally is less helpful than cutting a heavy, DPS attack in half. Ice block's drawback is that it directly interferes with step 2 of Brightwing play; positioning. Lastly I know there's an Arcane Flare talent, which adds a movement speed de-buff. Not even joking, this is the best Arcane flare talent. This might be the only one worthy of being picked since the rest of the his tier is kinda lack-luster towards your overall strategy. Talent 6(level 16): Here it is, king of kings, Critterize. Now, your polymorph slows, silences, and gives vulnerability. Your enemies take an extra twenty-five percent damage from anything that hits them while poly'd. This is your end-game. This is how you're supporting. Playing Brightwing was all about this pay-off. This is why you stuck out with the little faerie dragon who can't heal anymore, who can't shield, and can't deal real damage. It was worth it! Time to celebrate. Deviations: I would strongly  No, Vehemently  Insult you for deviating in this tier. Critterize is worlds better than the other talents. Bouncy dust is the most 'often picked talent in this tier(According to HoTS logs) and all it does is create a mathematical mess for you utilize the other pixie talents. But it's inferior. Strictly so. You shouldn't have been picking up pixie dust talents in the first place, because they are ineffectual for end-game Brightwing play. You have to wait ten seconds to than do something, that kind-of helps do something else, a little. If that sounds appealing to you, you should probably steer away from Brightwing. Honestly. As for Hardened focus, frankly, if you're above eighty-percent health through most fights, than you weren't aggressive enough. Sticking around thirty to forty percent is usually the sweet spot of Brightwing support. Too much more, and you're not being aggressive enough and any less, and you're about to be burst down. There is one MAYBE deviation to this tier; Greater Polymorph. Personally I think the third affix of venerability is better than saying the slow and silence last for 2.5 seconds. But if you do pick Greater Poly, you're getting a single-target use of Sylvanas's ultimate plus a twenty percent slow on a 15 second cool down. That's an acceptable trade. But Critterize; probably still better. Talent 7 (level 20): So you have this dominant little dragon. Who pops into a fight, takes an enemy out of the fight from peeling,damaging, healing, and subsequently, they usually die as soon as the polymorph is over. What do you do now? To really maximize the value of this build you pick Rewind. I think the strongest talent in the game. (sans void prison) You get to teleport in giving a shield and potential vision; pixie dust an ally, reducing damage; poly off an enemy, almost assuring their death, and guaranteeing that they won't interfere for at least a second and a half; then rewind, hit another ally with spell shield, repeating the damage reduction; poly a second enemy, effectively killing them or finalizing the first enemy's death(really depends on your team's reaction time); then hearth back, Teleport back in. Repeat the process a third time, and then a forth and fifth time on Rewind's cool-down. Truth be told, this is a very mechanically difficult process, but Brightwing is, in my opinion, the hardest support to utilize, and her pay off is you pick apart enemy teams while keeping your team just above the borderline of death on the right side of the ground.....above it. Deviations: Sadly, a lot of time, if you're the only healer you just have to pick Storm Shield. It's an activated heal that essentially, heals twenty percent of everyone around you. Rewind is great when your team has momentum, and knows how to play, but if you're being heavily used a crutch or if you're doing the unforgivable Brightwing carry, than you really need Storm Shield. Revitalizing mist, while being a mathematics nightmare, does heal quite a bit. If you're able to position effectively in 5v5 team fights, it will definitely get you some impressive healing numbers (still painfully less than pre-patch! Sorry, I promised I wouldn't complain). And double wyrmhole let's you make really cool looking Juke-city plays. An honorable mention for continuous winds, it's funny to use with Falstad's mighty gust. But mostly useless. I'm sure there have been other successful Brightwing builds, but after 200 games with Brightwing, This build/guide is the most effective post-patch game-play I've had experience with. If you have questions, I'll answer them, and if you have other ideas (probably arguments about talents) I'll hear them out as well. Because playtime. That's why. "
243,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Amazon Hero Concept with Discussion (wall of text warning),1,3e2ao7,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3e2ao7/amazon_hero_concept_with_discussion_wall_of_text/,2015-07-21 22:15:49,"Heroes of the Storm Amazon (be forewarned this is about 8 pages of text. For a version without my musings and opinions, click [here](URL The amazon was the dexterity class from Diablo 2 and feature popular ranged builds focusing on bows and crossbows as well as melee builds focusing on spears. Because of this, The amazon hero for Heroes of the Storm should also try to mimic the diversity available to amazon players, with the first combination of melee and ranged combat to occur in a single hero. The lost vikings don't count; those were three heroes in one. The structure of this MOMUMENTAL wall of text I have created is as follows: First I explain and rationalize the way her Trait will work. Then I will describe her three basic Bow abilities and rationalize them, before doing the same with her Spear abilities and then her two heroics. Then I will detail, level by level, her available traits and their possible uses. Then, if you read it all, you can treat yourself to something special I suppose, you gosh-darned warrior. HER TRAIT: The Amazon's trait as I imagine it would be dual mastery or something along these lines. It would be an activate ability with a very short cool down (~1-2 seconds) that switches the Amazon between her ranged weapon (a bow) and her melee weapon (a spear). Using this ability will also alter her active abilities to better suit the weapon she is using. Another component of this passive is her resource system. The amazon DOES NOT USE MANA, but instead has a finite number of arrows she can use with her bow to attack enemies from range, as a throw-back to D2's finite arrow system. In keeping with this theme, her initial maximum arrow count would be 250, an amount which should last an average player for quite a while. The amazon's bow would however have quite a high attack speed, and all of the Amazon's bow themed abilities will require arrows to use, so managing her arrows will be essential. Slain enemy RANGED creeps will also drop between 1-3 arrows on death. These will last a similar amount of time to regen globes and will require the amazon to physically walk over to them and pick them up. Arrows will also be dropped in larger quantities by slain heroes, partially refilled by healing fountains and fully restored by returning to the nexus. This mechanic probably seems strange, pointless and most of all, annoying, so let me detail my reason for designing the Amazon in this way. First of all, it is at least partially nostalgia for Diablo 2, a game I spent far too much of my childhood on and a desire to see it's mechanics accurately recreated in a newer game. Secondly: the amazon did indeed have both ranged and melee builds both of which were viable in their own rights and had their own strengths and weaknesses. I feel that is a big part of what made the amazon what it was and that needed to be brought along to Heroes of the Storm. Thirdly, the Amazon was the Diablo 2 precursor to the demon hunter in Diablo 3, a hero already in the game by the name of Valla. The dual weapon system of the Amazon will allow her to remain distinct from Valla and a hero, and not simply be another Assassin with good ranged DPS. The finite arrow system also aids in this respect. HER BOW SKILLS: Now that I've hopefully justified this little pipe-dream design decision, onto her actual abilities, starting with her bow themed skills. Q: Freezing Arrows: Fire a two-staged freezing arrow along a straight path. In it's first stage, it will simply move straight forward, freezing the first minion it hits or slowing the first hero it hits, dealing damage. If it travels far enough, it will shatter into five smaller arrows, each one seeking out a different enemy, dealing reduced damage, freezing minions and mercenaries and slowing enemy heroes. Consumes 5 arrows. W: Poison Shot: launches an arrow along a straight line, where it explodes against the first enemy it strikes, splashing all nearby enemies with a poison that deals damage over time. E: Barrage: Focus your attacks and unleash a seemingly endless stream of arrows towards a distant target. While channeling this ability, you cannot move. Each arrow consumed will launch three arrows that deal reduced damage (approximately half). The arrows fired have a very small randomized spread to them. The channeling lasts up to five seconds and consumes 3 arrows per second. This channeling can be interrupted at any time for it's duration, either by being stunned, silenced or by moving. Her first, and simplest, ability to discuss is Poison Shot. This is quite simply a useful and versatile AoE attack that she can use to help her push creep waves, as an opener in a team fight to lay down a little additional damage, or use while chasing to prevent an enemy from mounting up or hearth-stoning out, possibly even killing them if they hide behind a gate, as the splash will reach over walls and the like. It would detonate against terrain obstacles, however, so that is something to keep in mind. Her ext ability, Freezing Arrows, can be used as both a powerful pushing skill or a deadly single target damage spell. Since the second stage launches five arrows, each of which will target different enemies, it would be possible to slow an entire enemy team for a short duration, while a single point-blank shot with Frost Arrows will be both a good source of single target damage and a very powerful slow, since it will combine the effects of all five smaller arrows into one. It should be noted that once the arrow enters it's second stage, two arrows will not target the same enemy, even if there are less than 5 enemies nearby. Any unused freezing arrows will simply disappear. Freezing arrows in their second stage will also not target buildings, though they can still be struck in it's first stage. Barrage is the Amazon's final bow themed skill, and is primarily intended to act as a a single target damage spell, despite it's arc of fire. Speaking of which, the arc on this ability is extremely narrow, somewhere around 15 degrees, or about half of Sylvanas' banshee wave. At nine arrows per second for five seconds, this skill will unleash 45 arrows total, each one dealing about a half of a basic attacks worth of damage, resulting in just over 22 basic attacks worth of damage in 5 seconds. Though it would have a longer cool down to compensate, it would still e effective at melting softer targets in a very short amount of time. A simple amazon combo could be to use poison shot to initiate, frost arrow to slow and allow you to close the distance, before unleashing a point-blank barrage to finish them off. From a full supply of arrows, one could do this continuously about 11 times. As a rough estimate, the damage of this combo would not be a one shot kill, except against a murky or another very squishy hero like a Malfurion effected by vulnerability. Of course, 5 seconds is also a long time, and most heroes would be able to move out of the way of barrage before it's full duration was over, thus avoiding the majority of the damage. Because of this, stuns or roots would be a huge support to the Amazon's damage output, possibly more so than other heroes. SPEAR SKILLS Q: Jab. Perform a quick and powerful attack against the nearest enemy, prioritizing heroes over creeps, striking 3 times in the blink of an eye. Each of these strikes deals damage equal to basic attack damage. If the jab kills it's target, it's cooldown is reduced, by one second for minion kills, and entirely for hero kills. W: Impale, after a micro-channel (~0.75 seconds) use your spear to strike forward in a straight line directly in front of your character. This strike will deal huge damage to any enemy it hits, but has a long cooldown, is interrupted by taking damage and has a 25% chance to damage the Amazon's spear if it strikes an enemy hero, reducing her basic attack damage by 10% for a short duration. E: Fend. Strikes all enemies in a small radius around the amazon, dealing damage. Each enemy struck by the skill reduces the cooldown before it can be used again by 0.5 seconds, up to a maximum of 5 seconds reduced cooldown. This is approximately half the cooldown of the ability. Jab functions as sort of a mid way between three other abilities: Thrall's windfury, Sylvanas' withering fire and Kerrigan's ravage. It's a single target ability that can be used for hit and run harassment attacks, possibly while also collecting arrows from dead creeps. It can be used as a late game pushing skill, due to it's short cooldown and high damage output and it is a powerful single target ability for team fights, if for some reason your arrows have been depleted. The target enemy would be highlighted with a golden circle, similar to how Sylvanas highlights her target with a purple one. While it may seem similar to thrall's windfury, I've hopefully made it different enough to excuse it. Firstly, instead of simply attacking 100% faster, these three attacks are for all intents and purposes instant. All damage would be dealt at the start of the animation, and the animation could be canceled once the damage has gone off. Impale is a more powerful attack that can usually one hit creeps and severely wound heroes. With talents, it could be used as a mobility skill in a chase, due to it's ability to carry you forward if no enemies are struck. Due to it's channel time and the fact that taking damage will cancel it, it is a dangerous ability to use in a team fight, though could be very rewarding if done right, as delivering such a high damage attack to the enemy team could be devastating in the right conditions. The damage spear mechanic is another throw-back to the fact that, in Diablo 2, where Impale would tend to cause a great deal of durability damage when used. While weapon durability would be an almost impossible mechanic to effectively bring across to heroes of the storm, having a small chance to reduce Amazon weapon damage for a short period of time has a similar effect, turning Impale into a high risk, high reward skill. Fend is a true team fight skill, functioning almost like an AoE version of jab, striking all nearby enemies in a small AoE around the Amazon and making it a dangerous proposition for enemies like Illidan to get in too close, especially since his evasion wont help him. Fend also provides a quick an effective way to reveal stealth enemies, though the limited range of it might make it a little difficult. Fend would also benefit from a number of more defensive talents. HEROIC ABILITIES R1: Summon Valkarie: Summons a powerful Valkyrie to assist the amazon in battle. If she has her bow equipped, the summoned Valkarie will be equipped with a spear and focus on being resilient and tanking damage for the Amazon. If the Amazon Equips her spear, the Valkarie will instead equip a bow and attack from range. R2: Immolation Arrow/Lightning Fury: If the Amazon has a bow equipped, they will fire a single immolation arrow, which will fly in a straight line, creating a large wall of fire perpendicular to it's path of travel whenever it hits an enemy. If the Spear is equipped, the amazon will strike a target enemy and fill them with charged lighting, dealing powerful damage and causing other bolts of lighting to arc off the initial target and strike other enemies. Will cause approximately three additional bolts a second to arc off and lasts 4 seconds. I feel that Summon Valkarie should be the first heroic ability unlocked for new amazon players as this is the most useful in any situation, especially with level 20 talents. It should be noted that changing weapons once the Valkarie is summoned WILL NOT cause the Valkarie to change. Eg, it is possible for a bow wielding Amazon to also have a bow wielding Valkyrie. The Valkyries two different forms were obviously intended to have synergy with the weapon the Amazon was using at the time of summoning, and thus would be more friendly to newer players of the amazon than the other heroic ability. Speaking of the other heroic, these two are intended to be very powerful team fight abilities. While Immolation Arrow could be a very effective pushing tool, by firing it directly at the center of a gate so the firewall hits both towers, and Lighting fury could be used the same way, it's long cooldown and capability to output massive damage in team fights would make that less than ideal. Immolation Arrow in particular would be very effective in team fights for acting as an area denial ability. For example, coming from behind to cut off the enemy team's escape route and funnel them in a particular direction. It also synergies well with AoE stuns and roots, as the firewall can deal a lot of damage if enemies remain in it for too long. Lightning fury is better directed to being used directly in the middle of an enemy team, where the target hero will ensure their entire team is damaged by the lightning bolts. Also, if an enemy affected by Lightning Fury dies, the effect ends entirely. Thus, it would be arguably better to target tankier enemies with it and let the lightning arcs eliminate the weaker enemies. Another important thing to note about heroic abilities is that HEROIC ABILITIES SHARE COOLDOWNS BETWEEN WEAPON LOADOUTS. BASIC ABILITIES DO NOT. Thus, you will have to chose between immolation arrow and lighting fury, or between ranged and melee Valkyrie, as you will not be able to use both in a team fight. TALENTS: Level 1: Scavenger: Doubles the number of arrows collected from dead Creeps and Heroes. Block and Parry: Using Fend grants one block charge per enemy hero hit, up to three block charges. Pierce: Gives all arrow themed skill a 20% chance to pierce their initial target and continue onwards. Each time an arrow penetrates an enemy, it loses 5% chance to pierce. Regeneration Master: (Wiki it) Seasoned Marksman: (Wiki it) Level 4: Puncture: Impale Deals an additional 150% of it's damage over the next 5 seconds. Battle Focus: hero kills give the amazon an additional 5% chance to deal 50% bonus damage with each attack. Stacks up to 6 times. Lose stacks upon death. Pressurized Poison Chamber: Poison Shot's toxin splashes 50% farther. Quill Rain: Increases the number of Arrows Shot in Barrage from 3 a second to 5 a second. Heavy Draw: Increases the range of all bow skills and attacks by 20% Level 7: Battle Momentum: wiki it Fire Storm: Causes the arrows shot by barrage to become fire arrows, which deal 50% more damage each. Barrage now consumes the twice the full number of arrows. Magic Arrow: 60 second cooldown. Upon activation, do not use arrows for 10 seconds. Lunge: If impale does not hit an enemy hero, it instead carries the amazon forward a short distance. Strike for the Eyes: Fend blinds all heroes struck, causing them to miss the next two basic attacks made in 5 seconds. Toxic Spearhead: Envenom your spear, causing your next strike against an enemy to deal heavy damage over time. Can occur once every 10 seconds. Level 10: R1: Summon Valkyrie R2: Immolation Arrow/Lightning Fury Level 13: Slice Your Throat: Fend silences all enemies hit for 2 seconds. Deals 15% more damage. Spell Break: once every thirty seconds, the next enemy spell directly targeted on you will fail. The spell's cooldown is halved. Sprint: wiki it. Deft Hands: Jab now strikes 6 times in an instant. Fend now strikes heroes twice. Increases cooldowns by 25% Level 16: Blood for Blood: wiki it Dodge: while standing still, gain a 30% chance to avoid melee and ranged basic attacks. Armour Break: Impale now applies vulnerable to all enemies struck. Chance of spear damage is now 100% if it hits an enemy. Plague Arrow: The toxin from poison shot now spreads to other nearby enemies upon the originals death. Duration of poison shot toxin increased by 200% Level 20 Superior Valkyrie. The spear wielding Valkyrie now reduces all damage taken by the Amazon by 20%. The Bow wielding Valkyrie now increases all damage dealt by the Amazon by 15%. Infernal Arrow/Lighting Frenzy: Infernal Arrow gains a 50% chance to pierce enemies it hits, creating a fire wall upon each enemy hit. Lighting Fury can be cast upon allies. Lightning arcs can now target allies, increasing their attack and movement speed by 20% for 2 seconds. Endless Quiver: Amazon now never runs out of arrows. Bolt of the Storm: wiki it Fury of the Storm: wiki it A bit of Justification for the Talents: Level one provides a great deal of general utility talents. Scavenger will help players maintain their arrow supply and is applicable in almost every situation. Block and Parry can provide some much needed defensive capabilities to the Amazon, given that she would be a very squishy hero without the benefit of life steal of any sort. Pierce is a utility that can add massive amounts of damage to a number of different abilities, especially barrage. Regeneration Master gives some staying power in lane and seasoned marksman has some good synergy with barrage and jab, as both are based off of basic attack damage. Puncture is a powerful damage boost to Impale, making it more effective as an ambush ability or a finisher. Battle Focus would work best with either Seasoned Marksman or Scavenger, as it is strongly focused around basic attacks, sort of a gathering power for a non spell-caster. Pressurized Poison Chamber is a straight forward AoE increase that will make Poison Shot more effective against spread out creeps and make it more possible to hit fleeing enemies over a gate or wall and such-like. Quill Rain is a bit of a trade off. While the potential DPS of barrage does go up, so does it's arrow consumption, meaning that one should be careful when using it. Would probably work best with scavenger. Heavy draw works kind of like nexus frenzy, but without the added damage and instead with added bow skill range. This would increase the distance barrage shot arrows and would increase the distance Freezing Arrows would travel before entering it's second stage. Battle momentum would reduce the downtime between all of the Amazon's powerful skills like barrage and impale and her more defensive skill fend. Firestorm is a massive damage increase to barrage's potential damage. Without quill rain, the damage dealt by Barrage in increased from about 22 attacks to about 34 attacks. With quill rain, firestorm increases barrage's damage to a whopping 56 basic attacks worth of damage in 5 seconds(this may take some balancing). On the downside, combining quill rain with firestorm results in an arrow cost of 75 arrows per cast, allowing a player to us it about 3 times before being completely out of arrows. Regardless, one should never try and take the full brunt of barrage to the face. Magic Arrow gives the Amazon a little more sustain, versatility and staying power in the game, giving her ten seconds of blissful free-arrow joy. It has to be on the same level as firestorm, otherwise it would be utterly broken.(it already kinda is). Lunge also makes the opportunity cost at this level quite high, causing Impale to grant a huge bonus to mobility. Strike for the eyes is another talent that makes getting firestorm a harder decision. It's ability to blind any target struck by Fend could mean the difference between life and death for an amazon caught out of position, or one that gets jumped by an Illidan. Toxic Spearhead is just a great big damage boost to using the spear. For discussion on the heroics, see above. Slice Your Throat is an Amazon's tool for dealing with enemies like Zeratul and Nova. Between this and Strike for the Eyes, an Amazon can effectively disable just about any attacker for a short period of time, giving her a chance to either retaliate or escape. An added bonus is that a Zeratul caught by Fend with this talent will not be able to blink away. Spell break works somewhat similar to Slice Your Throat, but does not require you to be so close to an enemy. It's useful if one particular hero targeted spell keeps disabling, like poly-morph, or killing you outright, like Nova's triple-tap. This does halve the cooldown of the ability it prevents, however, so keep that in mind. It also will not prevent non-targeted abilities like skill shots or AoE spells. Sprint provides an excellent burst of mobility to chase an enemy or escape from a sticky situation. Deft hands is the only damage Increase available at this level, for those who want to go full glass cannon. It essentially doubles the damage of both jab and fend, while making them less available, meaning you're more susceptible to being caught with your cool-downs up. Blood for Blood represents the only way the Amazon can steal health from an enemy, as well as adding an effective slow if the need arises. Dodge is an amazing survivability increase, providing you are willing to essentially root yourself. It has good synergy with barrage, as this requires you to stand still, but is less useful when using your spear. Armour Break can provide a powerful damage boost to both you and the rest of your team, by causing all enemies struck by impale to take 25% more damage. While hitting an enemy will guarantee a loss of 10% weapon damage, the 25% increase ensures a net positive. Plague Arrow turns Poison Shot into a terrifying pushing tool, as it can spread to other nearby enemies when the original poisoned arrow dies, and the skill lasts three times as long, essentially dealing three times the damage. The aura bonus' from the Valkyries at level 20 are fairly self explanatory. The melee Valkyrie provides additional defense to the Ranged Amazon, while the Ranged Valkyrie provides some additional damage to melee Amazon, helping to fill in some of the amazon's weaknesses and motivate some more melee combat late game. Infernal Arrow gives Immolation Arrow a +50% chance to pierce enemies. This chance STACKS WITH THE PIERCE TALENT, giving it a 70% chance overall to pierce enemies. Since every enemy struck by Immolation Arrow will create a firewall, this can be devastating in a team fight, with a little luck. Filling an enclosed space with multiple firewalls can severely reduce the enemy team's options. Lighting Frenzy can help your entire team in a team fight by increasing their attack and movement speeds. Casting it on an ally ensures that you will not prematurely end the effect by killing a the enemy carrying the effect. Endless quiver is like magic arrow, but forever. The idea was to make the opportunity cost at this level massive, to make choosing infinite ranged attacks harder. This obviously is the talent of choice for a Quill Rain-Firestorm Amazon, and would likely need to have some changes made to it to prevent it from being totally broken. Bolt of the Storm could allow for some impressive plays of blink into freezing arrow into barrage, or act as a general escape ability. Fury of the Storm simply adds in some Additional damage to round out the Amazon's talent set. Congratulation! You've read this entire horrifying mountain of text that was at least 60% my own musings. Sorry for that. Please comment on any thoughts, questions or ideas that might make this a more interesting character, or just your opinions of the hero idea in general. Thanks for Reading. "

245,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,How to Team Fight - A Basic Guide,10,38kj6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/38kj6y/how_to_team_fight_a_basic_guide/,2015-06-05 06:34:37,"Hey guys, A lot of people have been questioning how to team fight so I'm gonna try and explain how to team fight effectively and efficiently. **WHAT IS A TEAM FIGHT?** A team fight is a fight is a fight between 3 or more Heroes from each team. A team fight is usually for some form of strategic advantage, usually a mercenary camp, or an objective. **WHEN SHOULD YOU TEAM FIGHT** In a perfect world, you team fight whenever you have an advantage, this could be when the enemy team has one player waiting to respawn or one of their heroes is across the map. This is rarely the case and so you usually team fight when both teams are grouped up and they meet each other on the battleground. You should team fight when you have a chance in winning, this seems obvious but there are times when teams fight when there is little to no way they are going to win **WHEN SHOULD YOU *NOT* TEAM FIGHT** * When you have a player waiting to respawn * When all your team is low on HP and/or Mana * When you're (or the enemy team you have to kill is) ""under"" a functioning team structure (the core is sometimes the exception to this rule) * When someone on your team is not with you and you do not know where their team is. **WHAT ARE THE ROLES WITHIN A TEAM FIGHT** I would like to mention before this the main priority for you should be staying alive, do not kill yourself or put yourself in a position to be killed to fulfill the following roles Also depending on specific heroes they may have different roles than the following, but these are typically the roles which those types of heroes have. * Warrior: * Initiator: Creating an opening which your team can use to land abilities which can lead to you securing a kill or gaining enough of a lead within the team fight so the enemy team cannot win * Disruption: Interrupting the enemy Heroes so they cannot do their jobs at maximum efficiency, thus increasing your chances of winning the fight * Protection: Keeping the enemy from killing your more vulnerable allies * Support: * Healing: Simple, using your abilities to regenerate some of the heal which your enemies will take from your team's HP * Zoning: Using your abilities to ensure your enemies cannot get into a favorable or beneficial position * Crowd Control (CC): Locking the enemy down so that your team can secure kills, or can safely escape from enemies attempting to kill them * Assassin: * Damaging: Your job is to inflict the maximum amount of damage onto your enemy while ensuring you are in a safe location. * Specialist: Depending on the specific specialist, their role will usually be a combination of the other roles, you'll need to know your individual hero to see what your hero can do. **THE STEPS OF A TEAM FIGHT** 1. The Poke: This stage of the fight is when both team ""poke"" each other in an attempt to get a minor HP lead before the fight breaks out 2. The Initiate: A hero (or group of heroes) using an ability (or set of abilities) to create an opening (or vulnerability) which your team can exploit in order to kill enemy heroes or gain a major HP lead, so you will shortly after kill enemy heroes. 3. The Fight: Once the initiate has faded and both teams have relative freedom the majority of the fight will be decided, during this time it is essential you keep track of your team to know where to run, and keep track of your own HP to know when to retreat. This step ends when one team goes into full retreat. 4. The Chase: When a team goes into full retreat, the ""winning"" team will chase over the enemy team either to try and collect a few remaining kills or to grab the objective which was being battled for. At this point the team will press the lead which they gained from winning the team fight, and this pressure will end when the enemy team respawns. **WHO SHOULD I FOCUS** There is no real definitive answer, it depends entirely on the team fight but here are some tips for ranged and melee heroes: *MELEE HEROES* * Get in the face of the champions you know cannot deal with you easily * Deliver as much damage as possible as quickly as possible * Be wary of your HP and don't be afraid to use an ability just to escape * When retreating always retreat into your team *RANGED HEROES* * Only attack Heroes you can attack without getting damaged * Do not use your escape in an aggressive fashion, if you charge into the enemy team you can quickly find yourself on the wrong end of a whoopin' and can quickly lose your life *GENERAL TIPS* * Be aware of AoE abilites going off near or on your hero * Know your enemy, and try to predict what they're going to do and avoid it or adjust your offence because of it * Time your abilities, don't just fire them off because they're off cool-down * Do not waste your ultimate ability, use it only when you KNOW you're going to get a good effect from it. * Learn which abilities can combo together and try to combo and ability if you can. After all that it just comes down to knowing which Heroes your Hero does well against and how to do well against them, and that only comes with time and practice. TL;DR: Know what you can do, do it, don't die. Thanks for reading and I hoped this helped!

Jaina, Dodge her abilities, she wont make it far without sprint. Gazlowe, Catch him off guard, he wont go anywhere. Murky, Practically gets oneshotted by Shockwave, not a issue. Zagara, Catch her off guard, she wont have enough time to kill you or get away. Stealthies, Stealthies stepped into the wrong neighborhood, if you see Baine, you run. Equal Match Ups Sonya, almost the same amount of health, will kill you if you are on cooldown. Thrall, almost as bulky as you, although, he will kill you if you are on cooldown, and Sundering will interrupt Son's Vengeance. Tychus, almost the same amount of health, will kill you if you are on cooldown. Tyrande, will stop you from killing her if stunned. Brightwing, will get away from you if she has cooldowns. Unfavorable Match Ups Illidan, If he evades pulverize, just run. Sgt Hammer, She pushes you away with concussive blast, from there you are kinda screwed. Li Li, if she blinds you when you attempt to pulverize, meanwhile, she is running away faster each time you hit her, its pretty useless to try. Johanna, shes just way too bulky, and has blind, pretty useless to try. Raynor, the push-back is just devastating, if you engaged with Heroic Leap and got hit by Penetrating round, you cant catch up, he will probably kill you next. Kael'thas, most likely stun you when you leap in, he will get away. PROS AND CONS Pros High damage. High health. Misidentified as a warrior or such, because of large size. [Note: If you say he cant be a assassin due to size, go check The Butcher out for a second.] High Teamfight Compatibility (Heroic Abilities) An assassin that resurrects from the grave. (Talent) Moo. Cons Very High cooldowns. Very vulnerable to pushback. Very vulnerable to blind. Little mobility, and Heroic Leap is directional, causing even farther struggle. THE IDEA The idea of Baine mostly came off of the idea of the Tauren Chieftain in Warcraft III, although, I did not like the idea with him being a warrior, because E.T.C. is already a Tauren Warrior. So I decided to make him a assassin! He would use his mace to put out abilities. I believe he should be put into the game because E.T.C. is not really a tauren in the sense of the race. Because he is mostly kind of a comedic character. (I love E.T.C.) Besides, go look up a picture of Baine, tell me it would not be badass to see a tauren wearing feather headdresses n !@#$, That kind of stuff is only in concept art, which I would absolutely love to see in game. When I created this character, I set out not to make a clone of another character, although, Sonya kinda takes the same feel, (Seismic Slam = Shockwave, Leap = Heroic Leap) but they are different characters completely from that. I personally don't care if you take ideas from this concept, the more concepts the better! COOL HUH? MOO. Thanks for reading my Hero Concept, I hope you liked it! If you did like it, please like and comment what you liked and/or disliked about it, its much appreciated! I will continue to change my Hero's Talents and Abilities at your desire, Thanks!"

Than for 3,5 second all enemies in area receive auto-attack. All spilled napalm in area is ignited. **2. Twin linked flamethrowers** Passive that increase damage done by auto-attack. - Other Ideas: Horace Warfield With this guy I have problem does he will be better as Specialists-Commander or Warrior. In first option I was thinking make him something like cross between Abathur and Azmodan. You stay in back summon/Spawn soldiers, buff them. Real General. In Second I was thinking about his mechanical hand. Give him Flamethrower(Firebat) Grenades(Marauder) and Jump Jets(Reaper) and his Heroic abilities will indicate that he is a General. (Spawning on each lane a new wave of soldiers for example) Here after some suggestion I more incline to make Warfield a warrior, when putting Mengsk as the Commander. Sorceress from Diablo 2 She have 3 trees of abilities. Ice, Fire and Lighting. Make her similare to Invoker from Dota were she can have many different spells that she can create from using her basic abilities. The most difficult hero to master and the most versatile. I want thanks people from previous threat that give me suggestion. I also ask for more suggestion. "

I'm not too sure on the balance, and i'm bad at numbers so i largely left those out. But i thought it'd be fun to share! * Hero: Tomator, the Alien Collector * Series: The Lost Vikings * Role: Ranged Support Description: A Support geared towards hindering the enemy team and disrupting their positioning. Tomator would have expensive mana skills, but be able to greatly control areas of space with fields and energy walls, making it hard to chase or disengage. He can use his Heroics either to power up an ally for the duration of the team fight or to forcibly peel a selected unit, assuming they don't escape the fight or burst him down first. * Trait: Limited Edition Collection If Tomator kills an enemy minion, mercenary, or hero, increase the EXP of that kill by 8%. * Q Alien Deathray Skillshot Tomator fires a laser skillshot from his cannon that knock-backs the first minion or hero hit. If the unit hits a wall or structure, they are stunned for 1.5 seconds. Talents would improve the damage, or make it also stun a unit that the unit is knocked back into, letting Tomator build for team fight disruption. * W Electricity Trap AOE skillshot Tomator throws a grenade that creates an electrical circle on the ground. Units caught in the circle are rooted and damaged for 1 second. The circle then explodes for additional damage. * E: Stop, Stop, Stop! Place a wall anywhere in a circular radius of Tomator. Enemy units can pass through the wall, but receive vulnerability and a 40% slow for 4 seconds. Talents would increase the slow or vulnerability by 10-20%, or allow Tomator to hold multiple charges at a time. * R1: Abduction Beam Channel Places a tractor beam on an enemy Hero that does damage per pulse for 3 seconds, and slows the affected Hero in the opposite direction. Tomator gets a moderate shield for the duration of the channel and can move, but not use abilities. The beam can be broken by getting outside of its area of effect or killing Tomator. After 3 seconds, if still unbroken, teleport the Hero to Tomator's location. Upgraded talent would increase the damage of the pulses the closer they are to Tomator and add a 'pull' to the tractor beam making it harder to escape. * R2: Tech Upgrade Tomator enhances himself or 1 allied Hero with cybernetic upgrades, interrupting all nearby enemy Heroes. For 8 seconds, the enhanced Hero gets bonus health, and receives a significant Attack Damage and Ability Power increase. Talent would allow him to also upgrade any nearby allied Heroes caught in the activation, up to three Heroes."

Decoys are good but after most of us have played against Novas, you can easily discern which one is fake and where she actually is. With the introduction of Sylvanas, I noticed one of her talents is she can immediately cloak by casting her E ability, which is great for heavy dive champions such as Tyrael or Illidan. I purpose that Nova as her active passive, can activate it to immediately cloak, and either be on a 60 second or 120 second cd. This would probably fix her big vulnerability factor and obviously you would have to use it only in certain cases. Thoughts? "
252,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Abathur's Invulnerability,0,31m5lw,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/31m5lw/abathurs_invulnerability/,2015-04-06 20:40:52,"Abathur is, in the right hands, an absolute beast. I think he's in a fairly strong place as he is, but I would like to recommend the following change: He should not be allowed to use Symbiote from spawn. Now, here me out. Many of you will say that sure, he can invulnerably use Symbiote from spawn, but he will lose out on strategic Toxic Nest placements and efficient use of his Locusts. A good Abathur will play as close to lane as he safely can in order to make the full use out of these abilities. But let me run you through this scenario. One of my favorite things to do with Tyrande is snipe an Abathur with my Owl of Doom^TM . With the right build, you can reliably kill an Abathur with a double Owl using rewind or with an Owl + Global Starcall combo. Even if you do not kill him, Abathur will usually stop his symbiote to save himself, which can give your team a few precious seconds to wreak havoc. While it can be a bit of a waste, preventing an Abathur from helping his team by sniping after finding his position using ShadowStalk, for example, can be a beneficial move, and it is so rewarding. Last game I played, I sniped the Abathur a few times, and like all Abathurs eventually do, they run to the spawn and stay there. This Abathur was smart, however. He took the talents for unlimited mine range and took the monstrosity, which means he was able to both pressure lanes and keep a global map presence with his shields, AOE, and poke without having to rely on his locusts. He was also, unfortunately, completely invulnerable. There wasn't much our team could do about this god-like Abathur at this point. He was safe from assassinations and snipes and essentially carried his team to victory. I feel that as a champion whose primary weakness is supposedly his vulnerability to direct damage, allowing him to use most of his abilities with only a few small drawbacks is a bit strong. What are your guys' thoughts about this? Was there something I could have done in order to deal with this better, and even if there was, do you think his ability to have a global map presence from the comfort of spawn is too strong? Edit: If you guys are going to downvote every opinion you happen to disagree with, you're going to turn the sub into a circle-jerking echo chamber that fosters negativity and stomps out meaningful discussion. You should not downvote every opinion you think is wrong, and the fact that most of my posts in this thread are being downvoted is not a good indicator of the state of the community. Even if the points don't matter, they still mean something."

256,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,Hero League Guide: How to deal with Illidan Carry,33,2yp772,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/2yp772/hero_league_guide_how_to_deal_with_illidan_carry/,2015-03-12 04:44:06,"I've noticed in Hero League that many players don't know how to properly deal with an Illidan Carry, so here are some quick tips for shutting the popular team-comp down. **Know Illidan's Strength** First, it's important to understand Illidan's strengths. They are: * Illi's auto attacks heal him. * Illi's auto attacks reduce his cooldowns by 1 second per attack (and his default attack speed is 1.67/s &lt;-- very fast) * Illidan has no resource. Health and cooldowns are all he has to worry about * Illidan is highly mobile. Sweeping Strike and Dive both grant mobility and make him hard to pin down. * Illidan has strong map presence. With The Hunt you should assume that if he can see you, he can The Hunt you. Metamorphosis also has decent range (not really map presence, but strong teamfight presence). * Illi can evade auto attacks with Evasion, +50% of ability damage at lvl 13. Evasion makes all AAs miss Illi for 2 seconds, and has a short cooldown because of his trait. * Metamorphosis does AoE damage (don't stand in it), gives him HP per heroes hit (don't stand in it), and +20% attack speed. * He can chase *forever*. **Know Illidan's Weaknesses** * He has low HP * His trait/staying alive revolves around **attack speed** and **hitting auto attacks** * Evasion pre-13 (or without Sixth Sense) doesn't evade ability damage (and at 13 it's only 50%, not 100% like AAs) * He's frequently out of position. This isn't true of *all* Illidans, but considering his hyper-aggressive playstyle, he'll often wade quite deep into your team. SO! Based on all this shtuff, here are some more specific tactics. **Counters** * Attack speed slows * Hard CC (polymorph, stuns, or even roots so he can't get in AA range) * Vulnerability (anything that increases his damage taken) * Slows help your squishies kite. * Ability damage is usually better than AA damage (I find Falstad can do some substantial damage to Illi) * Blinds/blocks are always good against him. **Specific Counters (not at all exhaustive)** * **Shrink Ray**. If you're Li Li, Malf, Tass, Uther, or Tyr, you will choose **Shrink Ray**, or you will make everyone cry. * Muradin should choose Reverberation at lvl 1. * BW should choose Critterize at lvl 16, and Rewind at 20. * Li Li should choose Lingering Blind at lvl 4 (Lingering Blind+Shrink Ray makes Li Li laugh in the face of The Betrayer). **Tactical Tips** * Don't kite away from your team, but within it. * Don't stand in Metamorphosis AoE. * Don't spec towards auto-attack if you can help it (you usually can). * Don't waste attacks when his Evasion is up. * Try and separate him from his healers. **Parting Words** The problem with any ""carry""-style comp is that if the carry gets shutdown, the comp implodes. Use this to your advantage. I hope these tips leave you **A LITTLE MORE PREPARED!** P.S. Li Li with Lingering Blind is my favourite hero for dealing with Illi. Her blinds, Shrink Ray, and strong healing make dealing with Illidan pretty easy. **EDIT** Things I've forgotten that others reminded me of: * Malfurion can rek Illi with **Twilight Dream**. * Imposing Presence is useful against Illi (but only if you're actually going to be one of his targets). * Re-emphasizing that you should kite **within your team**. Running away from your heals, tank, and DPS is not the right thing to do. * Re-emphasizing the importance of hard CC (stuns). "

So that being said, I played quite a bit last night, and put together a build that feels like a good balance between damage, survivability and pushing. I am also providing my feedback on each talent selection and pointing out some back up or situational talents. Your feedback and discussion is truly valued! **TL;DR**: * Lost Souls * Envenom * Unstable Poison * Wailing Arrow * Splinter Shot * Cold Embrace * Deafening Blast **LEVEL 1** Talent | Description | Thoughts ---|---|---- With the Wind [Q] | Increases Withering Fire's range by 25%. | *Don't Take*: While the range is a nice addition, Sylvanas doesn't struggle for range. The upgrade utility doesn't provide any additional increase to DPS unless you are a solo chasing, with such specificity it doesn't provide the most improvement at this tier. **Lost Souls [W]** | Reduces the cooldown of Shadow Dagger by 2 seconds. |*Take*: The improvement to your ""W"" will increase your uptime on Black Arrows to the highest number of targets. It will work well in early game for taking potshots at towers, while still have utility in the late game for chasing and spreading Black Arrows to the enemy heroes. Barbed Shot [Q] | Withering Fire deals 200% bonus damage to Minions and Mercenaries. |*Don't Take*: Sylvanas doesn't need additional pushing support, and while this could add a slight increase to early game pushes the overall utility is low. It essentially becomes useless in the late game. Corruption [Trait]| Basic Attacks against Structures destroy 2 Ammunition.| *Situational*: If left alone, with this talent, Sylvanas can muster a huge push quickly. Quickly switching between towers will greatly improve the survivability of your creep causing some early game deep pushes to forts. The late game applicability is zero. **LEVEL 4** Talent | Description | Thoughts ---|---|---- Paralysis [Trait] | Increases duration of Black Arrow by 100%. | *Don't Take*: I don't feel this adds as much utility as the other options at this level. While I can see the increased ability to chase fleeing heroes, we still don't want to chase deep since positioning is so important. If being able to chase is important, I would recommend taking *Evasive Fire* at level 16. Overflowing Quiver [Q] | Whenever you would gain a Withering Fire charge from killing a Minion or Hero while at maximum charges, it is automatically fired. |*Situational*: I wouldn't outright call this a *Don't Take* since there is the potential when you are generating ""Q""s faster than you can use them...potentially. Otherwise this talent helps assist those who are worried they can't remember to stay on top of their ""Q""s. ***Note:*** Save your fingers, you can spam ""Q"" by just holding it down instead of slamming it as fast as possible. Ranger's Ambush [E] | Using Haunting Wave to teleport refills all charges of Withering Fire. |*Situational*: I personally don't like this choice, and while it will improve DPS, it removes your only escape for the majority (if you take *Bolt of the Storm*) or the entirety of the game. **Envenom**| Activate to poison an enemy Hero, dealing 180 (+30 per level) damage over 5 seconds. | *Take*: This is my talent of choice, and believe it adds the most to your hero's build. **LEVEL 7** ^I ^could ^see ^an ^argument ^for ^almost ^any ^talent ^choice ^in ^this ^group. Talent | Description | Thoughts ---|---|---- **Unstable Poison [Trait]** | Minions and Mercenaries that die under the effects of Black Arrows explode, dealing 75 (+9 per level) damage to nearby enemies. | *Take*: The improved creep clear with this is impressive. And there is the potential for burst damage if your lane opponent is standing in a wave when they die. This talent is good at improving lane bullying. Then again, you have to hope your opponent is dumb enough to stand in the dying wave more than once. **EDIT: Upon further play, I find that I have to clear enough late game waves that this talent has been very strong. Additionally, I have actually been able to burst down enemy heroes who are standing in large minion waves in the late game. Plus, it is fun to see everyone explode.** Life Drain [W] | Shadow Dagger heals you for 10 (+3.5 per level) each time it spreads to a new enemy.|*Situational*: I believe this talent tier, more than any other, is about personal choice. I like the improved sustain in the lane, but this loses effectiveness in late game. Follow Through | After using an ability, your next Basic Attack deals 25% additional damage. |*Situational*: The uptime on this ability is quite high, with the ability to spam your ""Q"" almost constantly. Mercenary Lord | Siege and Bruiser Mercenaries near your hero deal 50% more damage. | *Don't Take*: Since they've nerfed this talent so you have to escort the mercs I've found it to be a lot less impactful on your ability and utility. This could prove useful in the mid game pushes, but not much after. Shade Form [E] | Haunting Wave grants Stealth for 3 seconds. Activating the teleport does not break the Stealth. | *Situational*: If you are looking for even more survivability this proves to be a good choice, especially if you are planning to get the Ultimate upgrade at 20, and skipping *Bolt of the Storm*. **LEVEL 10** Talent | Description | Thoughts ---|---|---- **Wailing Arrow [R]** | Shoot an arrow that explodes for 200 (+20 per level) damage and silences enemies for 2.5 seconds. Can be reactivated to detonate the arrow early. | *Take*: For now, I believe this is the best choice of the two. It has nice AOE damage, which will inflict your Black Arrows. This will allow you to silence a bunched up enemy team for 2.5 seconds. One downside, you can be CC'ed between cast and then activation, so there is a chance you can miss this skill shot against heavy CC teams if you are out of position. Possession [R] | Force an enemy Minion to fight for you. It gains 20% Attack Damage and Health. Cooldown increased to 20 seconds when used on Catapults. |*Don't Take*: Without some beefing up, this isn't a strong ultimate. If you had this ability in the early game (pre level 5) it would be stronger in assisting in lane push, but as you transition to more team fighting it loses useful, and in late game the utility is nearly zero. **LEVEL 13** Talent | Description | Thoughts ---|---|---- Overwhelming Affliction [Trait] | Black Arrows now also applies to Heroes, slowing their Movement Speed by 5% for the duration. Stacks up to 5 times. | *Opt. 2 Take*: Do you want to slow the target, or speed yourself up? That's the question for these two talent choice options. I prefer to slow the target, since it helps the whole team besides myself. Evasive Fire [Q]| You gain 10% Movement Speed for 2 seconds whenever an enemy is hit with Withering Fire, stacking up to 30%.|*Situational*: The added bonus of taking this talent is the increased speed bonus of 10% stacks vice the decreased speed debuff of 5% stacks. This will also stack more (30% vice the 25% of *Overwhelming Affliction*). **Splinter Shot [Q]** | Withering Fire hits a second target for 19 (+2.25 per level) damage. | *Situational*: I like this talent to improve Splinter Shot and Black Arrows distribution during a team fight. Also, if you accidentally target the wrong target, your second shot might still get the right guy. Downside, this adds nothing on a 1v1. **EDIT: Upon further play, combining this with Unstable Poison makes a POTENT lane pushing build that is hard to deny. Entire minion waves will melt in just a few shots. And at the speed of the deaths, your Q is infinite, incase you are attacked during that clear. Very strong.** Spell Shield | Upon taking Ability Damage, reduce that damage and further Ability Damage by 50% for 2 seconds. Can only trigger once every 30 seconds. | *Situational*: If you are against a very bursty damage team (e.g., Jaina / Zeratul), this could be a good chance to improve survivability. Overall, I think there are stronger talents in this tier. **LEVEL 16** Talent | Description | Thoughts ---|---|---- Windrunner [E] | After you teleport from Haunting Wave, you can cast a second one for free within 2 seconds. | *Don't Take*: As I stated previously, they balanced the Windrunner talent fairly well, so you are still vulnerable to CCs during that casting time, I believe *Bolt of the Storm* at 20 provides more survivability. **Cold Embrace [W]**| Shadow Dagger makes enemies Vulnerable, taking 25% more damage, but the range of Shadow Dagger is reduced by 25% .|*Take*: This is a GREAT talent, I believe it adds a huge amount of utility to your team and provides universal support during team fights. With *Lost Souls* you'll be able to get this vulnerability out early and often, especially with grouped heros. Will of the Forsaken | Activate to become Unstoppable and gain 30% Movement Speed for 3 seconds. | *Situational*: Again, if you are really worried about being bursted down (DAMN YOU NOVA) then you can take this to improve your survivability. Also, you can use this to chase in combination with your ""E"". Blood for Blood | Activate to steal 15% of target enemy's Max Health and slow its Movement Speed by 30% for 3 seconds. | *Don't Take*: I know people are going to disagree on this one, but I feel like this is a selfish talent choice. You boost your damage at the expensive reducing overall team damage with *Cold Embrace*. I do not recommend. **LEVEL 20** Talent | Description | Thoughts ---|---|---- **Deafening Blast [R]** | Enemies at the center of Wailing Arrow's explosion take 50% more damage and are silenced for twice as long. | *Opt. 1 Take*: Assuming you made the effort to improve your ""E""'s escapability utility, then taking this is a good choice. The increased damage is nice, but that 5 SECOND SILENCE THOUGH. **EDIT: After further play I feel like this is the better overall pick at 20, the 5 seconds of silence is too strong and can swing an entire team fight.** Dark Lady's Call [R] |Increases the Attack Damage and Health bonus to 30% and allows Possession of enemy Mercenaries with a 20 second cooldown.|*Situational*: If you selected *Possession* at level 10, I believe this is a must pick talent. This is the only way that your ultimate stays relevant in the late game. Fury of the Storm | Every 5 seconds, your next basic attack will deal an additional 20 (+9 per level) damage to the target, and 20 (+24 per level) damage to all nearby Minions and | *Don't Take*: I believe this has been overshadowed by other choices in the tier. Although this would be activated regularly, by the time you hit level 20 we aren't really focused on burning down minions / mercs as a priority. Bolt of the Storm | Activate to teleport to a nearby location. | *Opt. 2 Take*: Coupled with your ""E"" you can ALMOST escape Illidan. Seriously though, this is my go to talent choice to stay alive longer in extended team fights, or to quickly retreat, I highly recommend."

Regardless of her power level (numbers can always be tweaked) I feel Blizzard's dev team has learned a lot about talent trees. Sylvanas has so many builds available to her and each have their own niche, and are fun to play! I'm not a Sylvanas expert but I've enjoyed playing the following builds: **PvP Sylvanas** (Pros - High Burst/Mobility) * Talents - With the Wind, Envenom, (Follow Through/Shade Form), Wailing Arrow, Evasive Fire, Blood for Blood, (Deafening Blast/Fury/Bolt). * Description - Probably the #1 build right now. This has the most PvP burst along with a good amount of mobility. Follow Through combined with rhythmic use of Q allows all of her AA's to be at 125% damage - but at higher tiers of play and vs. well coordinated enemies, the stealth granted from Shade Form is invaluable. Combining that with Envenom/Blood for Blood Sylvanas can burst a lot of heroes down easily. **The Dagger Build** (Pros - High CC/Teamfight Potential) * Talents - Lost Soul, Paralysis, Life Drain, Wailing Arrow, Overwhelming Affliction, Cold Embrace, Deafening Blast. * Description - This is a CC-heavy build that focuses on using Sylvanas' W. W has a great range that can be chained further from minions/structures to heroes. Early on this build is the only one with sustain but it's the late game that makes Dagger Build Sylvanas a team fighting terror. Her daggers will add Slow and Vulnerability on the entire enemy team. Combine it with her Silence and your foes will be in a heap of trouble. **Split-Pushing Sylvanas** (Pros - Base, what base?) * Talents - Barbed Shot, Paralysis, (Unstable Poison/Mercenary Lord), (Black Arrow/Possession), Splinter Shot, Will of the Forsaken, Fury of the Storm. * Description - This build is great for the larger/merc populated maps where you can get a good push going (the choices in this build depend on what map you're on). You can tear through minions and jungle fast, and can push ridiculously hard if left unchecked (esp. with Mercenary Lord). Will of the Forsaken's is necessary as you'll be a lot closer to the front line than other Sylvanas builds. **Queen of Arrows** (Pros - Highest DPS) * Talents - (With the Wind/Barbed Shot), Ranger's Ambush, (Unstable Poison/Follow Through), Wailing Arrow, Splinter Shot, Windrunner, (Deafening/Fury/Bolt). * Description - This build focuses on Sylvanas' Q. I used to think this was just a silly build but as others pointed out it has the highest DPS potential. Late game you can spam Q, fully recharge it with your E, spam Q, recast E, Spam Q, etc...Talent choices depend on whether you're focusing on jungling/pvp. The main problem is it requires perfect positioning to maximize damage and not get killed, making it unforgiving of mistakes. Give it a *shot*! **General Sylvanas Tips** * Q Management - You can hold down Q to burst fire with Sylvanas, but it's not really recommended unless you're going all in. Generally you want to manage your Q stacks - always keep one fired off (so it refills on CD) and one more any time a nearby minion will die. Remember you get 3 stacks when a hero dies so late game if the enemy team is low (and preferably Silenced!) you can E in and start chain killing heroes (the Dagger build is great for this, as you can apply Vulnerability/Slow to everyone before silencing them). * Taking Merc Camps/Towers - Paralysis makes taking mercs and towers easy, but you can take Giants/Towers without it if you place yourself close to one and keep Q'ing every second (W'ing when you run out of stacks) while AA'ing the one furthest away. When taking Knights, it's best to AA the caster while dancing around the Knights Q'ing them. * Save Your Mobility - Sylvanas is one of the squishiest heroes, along with Valla and Jaina. Make sure you keep your E up at all times and don't use it to push unless all other enemies are elsewhere. A good strategy is to E one way (preferably over a wall) and run the other, forcing enemies to split up if they want to chase you. Also, if you take Evasive Fire, make sure to keep 3 Q stacks up at all times. * Maps - Sylvanas *loves* Blackheart's Bay. It's a large map with a lot of mercenaries and all but the boss are affected by your arrows. You can fire a single Q and AA the chest until the first coin is about to drop, then spam your Q's to take it down quickly (as chests don't have hp but go down in # of hits like totems). A lot of other map NPC's are immune to her Black Arrows (like the big statues in Sky Temple) so be careful if you're low on hp. On maps like those, Barbed Shot can be really valuable if you don't mind losing the safe harass of With the Wind. **Thanks for reading! Feel free to share your builds/tips/tricks here!**"
259,vulnerability,heroesofthestorm,"Sylvanas: The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (xpost bliz forums)",46,30gsqt,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/30gsqt/sylvanas_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_xpost_bliz/,2015-03-27 17:21:59,"I'm currently level 10 with her, played plenty of competitive games in the past with good results blah blah blah. I'm not here to brag or say that I'm right, I'm also going to try and avoid suggesting specific changes but rather identify problems for feedback. **The Good** I'm really impressed with the selection and viability of her talents, there's a lot of variation and a lot of choices hinging on maps, match up. team strategy and desired build. I think this is ideally where we want everyone to be and a lot of champions have been having a hard time getting there. I'm left hopeful looking toward new releases and future talent changes. She's very fun, satisfying to play and try as I might I'm finding it impossible to set in on an optimal build. Stellar design overall, the HotS team have outdone themselves. **The Bad** **Mind Control** It's simply not good at all. I understand it's thematic and I'm presuming initial designs were to be able to MC players which is a balancing nightmare (5 or 6v4, no thanks). As it stands this is on par with a level 1-7 talent (think bribe, merc lord) and I'd love to see it reworked as such with a different heroic option. Currently it feels like an afterthought with no relevance. The catapults and mercenaries clauses seem to be reversed, catapults are relevant a lot later than mercenaries are. If catapults are an issue at level 10 your team is having other issues this can't solve. On the other hand if your team is having issues not being able to clear mercs in a second flat post 20, you're again having other issues this can't solve. I just can't find a reason for this not being global, or can't even be talented at 20 for global. Even with all of those changes, while it would make it stronger it would still never be picked as a heroic. **The Ugly** **Haunted Mines** Until something changes she should always be aggressively picked first on this map, I'm almost convinced picking her is a win condition all by itself and I don't say that lightly. The majority of DPS on the first 2 Golems comes from structures which she negates entirely, untalented. Currently there isn't a single hero that puts such a gigantic skew on a map that I'm aware of, It's incredibly easy to take a 5 man push with a 50 skull Golem straight through fort walls, fort, keep walls, keep and if it hasn't been dealt with well by the opponents, finish the game outright at 7 minutes. That's at equal skull levels when Golem is at it's weakest the problem only get more exasperated as the game continues. It's very reminiscent of alpha haunted mines with 100 skulls on first Golem and is simply not ok. **Her Trait** It's very deceptively strong. A large part of this is because it's from all sources of damage applying it (I'm not entirely sure Unstable Poison does, reasonably sure Envenom and BfB don't). Her W locks down everything it touches for 2 seconds on a 10 (or 3 and 8 talented) CD. This is without talenting the passive at all. I realize a change here would affect Unstable Poison which I think is a solid talent right now but tying it in with W instead of the trait wouldn't be changing much. Personally I'm OK with her being able to keep two targets locked down with autos because it isn't doable without putting yourself in a vulnerable position, this creates risk vs reward and counter play. The peripheral lockdown from W and E really doesn't. **Her Burst Potential** The combination of Envenom, Blood for Blood and her kit is very drastic, while it's true her standard kit can be underwhelming taking these talents, the burst feels very out of line. when trying to optimize builds for her yesterday, I compared her burst @16 to her hp, made the reasonable assumption of 7 Qs and 3 autos, ult, W and actives and she was pushing very close to 3k damage compared to her life which was ~2.6k. If people are curious or think I'm lying I can run the numbers again no problem, I just did it at the time for myself. Both my experience in game and knowledge of certain heroes I play frequently is that without intervention and near equal levels, those numbers alone kill most specialists and assassins in a very short period. This is ignoring E and her ability to get more Qs and autos in. This can easily turn most fights into a 5v4 instantly. BfB is competing with Ws vulnerability which is just an absolutely incredible team steroid (potentially the best in the game?), which should be telling that there's too much burst here when it's regularly being picked over the vuln. I believe design intent for BfB here is to help her deal with tanks, but that's not what's happening at all."

Hopefully gives Blizzard some ideas to change stuff. and vote up if you think its a good thread to keep it going. comment on other peoples ideas to better them or if you like them and add your own as well. **Tyrael:** trait locked and unlocks at low life allowing activation. Light radiates from Tyrael away from him in a circle, slowing all enemies caught in it and applying a burning light DoT for 3 secs. This should allow optional traits to boost effects on this such as vulnerability or applying a heal to team mates in the light. Should you wish to have a option of building into this vs the other skills. Most importantly it doesn't aim at getting yourself killed but still lets you get a risk / reward element out of it. this should work nicely with his kit as after he gets low enough to use it 10-15% maybe, he has the option of shielding or blinking away."
